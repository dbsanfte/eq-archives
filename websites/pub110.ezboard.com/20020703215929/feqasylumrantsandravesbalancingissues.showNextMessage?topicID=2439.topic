<br>
     I've always read in these boards the Druids saying things regarding they having full agro, and that if you had agro it's your own damn fault...  Well, I felll to the fate of some of you who died cause a druid is clueless as to how to play their class.  <br>
<br>
    I'm fighting in EW near Safe tree last night, My warrior is figthing an Uthork warrior with cleric behind him.  Well, this druid run through with his snare warrior...   He runs <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> too far</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> from his mob, and my warrior becomes a new target.  So my warrior has 2 mobs hitting on him... so I go, oh well I can handle this...  I get near finishing the main mob, druid comes and picks his up.  So I shrug it off, didn't cause any real damage.   A bit later, while my warrior is pulling (I play 2 accounts) I didn't realize that I had yet another snared mob dropped on me... but on my Cleric this time.  Well, I dump all the loots on him cause warrior needs to pull... so cleric can't run.   I root it, but by the time my warrior got to it... it broke root, and finished my cleric.<br>
<br>
     I found out later that another group had the same incident happening to them, and I ended rezzing someone in their group.<br>
<br>
    My biggest mistake, considering I never got the name of the Druid in question (Only saw this wolf running through me over and over, never Targetted him).  I went to ooc and asked that Druids please be carefull with their kitting...   And I got flamed to hell for it and was also called a whiner and told that I shouldn't be spamming the zone...   So I was spamming the zone, on my first &quot;ooc&quot;... *Boggle*<br>
<br>
    Eitherway.   It's clear that I understood one thing.   Druids might not realize this when they keep crossing other people/group with their mobs.   They have <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> sow</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, mob is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> snared</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  In so, if they don't pay attention they will get out of agro range and if mob has another possible target around it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> will</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->change to it if that target is KOS.  The none-sense Bull Shit I hear about Druids saying, I had full Agro on me... you must have done something...  Is full of crap.   If you go too far from your mob, your agro is Meaningless if there is a KOS target near mob.  Mob will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> always</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> got for nearest target in it's agro range when the Druid is out of range.  This doesn't cause a problem when mobs aren't KOS to others, like Rhinos, Mammoth's, bears and many other mobs.  But this really screws other people off when the mobs are very easy to agro to begin with.<br>
<br>
Lesson to be learned ?   Don't go through people when you Kite...   If you don't have a choice, take notice of your distance so that you don't screw other people in the process.   Being considerate is a good trait in EQ, so I hope some Druids that have been doing this would be a bit more of that in the future. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ukinoel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kinoel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.sluggy.net/beta_forums/images/smiles/lilkiki.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here...get out</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/28/02 8:56:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2494.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kitting, and things Druid need to realize...</span><hr size=1> Excellent post, but sadly useless. This argument has been going on for ever, but until the druid has it done to himself, well... He wont acknowledge it.<br>
<br>
And that is especially true when kiting.<br>
<br>
And for the record, this seems to be especially true in the 30s and 40s, when the druid just begins to kite or quad kite. They seem a little bit more considerate in their 50s. <p><center>

<br>
Druids will always do it, wizards too.. No matter how many times it happens to them on other chars, there will always be some &quot;me &gt; anyone else&quot; so screw everyone else and what they care.<br>
<br>
Mind you, there are a lot of druids that will die before letting aggro get on another group. <br>
<br>
The best is when the main tank is low on HP while a cleric &quot;aggressively&quot; complete heals him.  I've seen druid quad's go &quot;Oh by that guy over there is almost dead, let's go help Fred!&quot; and kill the MT then go back after the druid who is glad to have the extra click to med.<br>
<br>
One of the places that makes my eyes roll for quad kiting (Unless I'm a chanter in a duo just sitting and playing buffer of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) is the rockhoppers.  Sometimes you see 2 or 3 duos or lower level groups out in the field happy as can be until a quad'r comes by and makes it 1) harder to get a spawn 2) have to watch the quad's pathing because you can get beat up easily by their kites.  I hate to see quad kiters come to a place where people are grabbing a majority of the spawns and then start quad'n and getting in the way or taking the peeps spawns.<br>
<br>
I know some of you are like FFA! You can't camp whatever.. well then don't ask me for clarity (So they can regen mana from their quad killing and then sit next to me where I'm medding).. there are a few druids/wizards out there scowling at me for not buffing them for that reason.  If we're after the same mobs and I find what you're doing annoying.. don't even ask you won't get it.  I don't care if you do sow me, I'm not obligated to return anything to you other than a thanks if I see it.<br>
<br>
Things like this are part of EQ.. you embrace the ones you find that actually follow the golden rule, and scowl at the ones that abuse it. <p><IMG SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/llowe/qindyin.jpg" ALT="Qindyin's Signature"><BR>

Then I go Doh!<br>
<br>
Personally, it's a chase for the mob.  They got to it first, so I can't really bitch.  It does screw up my pulls, but I don't have to stay...  Instead of being told to leave, or hear something sarcastic/nasty I tend to keep my mouth shot.  Unless i get killed, which then... I'm a bit passed irritated.   hehe<br>
<br>
I don't hate Druids, and I played a wizard to 54 on Sullon Zek.  As a wizard... I Quad (well, only 3) rockhopper a lot in Danshroud.  Then again, I was alone almost all the time cause the server is so low on population...  and also a very dangerous zone for PVP, cause Evil/Newts loved to come and kill those at Rockhopper while we were busy.   Ah....  I don't miss the paranoia anymore  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Had a Druid Buff both my chars like 20 min after the incident that killed my Cleric.  I was so greatfull, and I know that there are as many Good Druids as there are Poor ones.  I finally understand now why people bitch at the Druids that say they didn't do anything wrong...  Mostly when the Druids say &quot;You must have done something&quot;... which is totally false, and lack of knowledge in their own class.  You're too far, mob will go for a better target if it crosses one.  Low hp/Complete Heal, or just plain KOS targets.   Accident happens.  It sucks, but it's part of life.   But to do it 4-5 times within an hour, killing 2+ people in an area... shows no respect for others.  All I know is that this Druid left after I said something in OOc... that stopped the kitting from him/her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udarkomen42.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DarkOmen42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I had the 15k post on R&R<br>and all I got was this<br>lousy title!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/28/02 10:45:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2494.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kitting, and things Druid need to realize...</span><hr size=1> Quadding and taking up spawns isn't really the real problem though, unless the druid or wizard has KEI or C2 they are going to take a while to med up. <p>[55 Blackguard] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96718" title="Magelo profile">Harabakc Taintedblade</a> (Dwarf)

Using a class to it's full potential is their right.   &quot;But&quot;, they need to know how to use that potention without causing harm to others.<br>
<br>
We're probably talking about 5% of the Druid population that's totally clueless and giving a bad name to the other 95%...   Sad thing, that 5% causes enough damage for a lot to hate all of them.  I have discussions in Guild where I've heard people bitching about them a lot.  Aye, I don't want to be a hypocrite... when I do play a Druid and I get to lvl 34+... I will be Quadding.  I'll try to do it in areas where I don't affect anyone, but that's not always sure.  One thing is for sure, even though I might goof.  I know that if I kite something, and there's people around... I have to be extra carefull not to get anyone hurt or killed.  And If I do have an oops, it's my responsability to first Apologize, and 2nd try to fix it if I can..  Running/logging/moving is a coward way of acting.<br>
<br>
Again...  The topic here isn't about Druid hogging the mobs.  It's about some Druids not knowing that if they aren't carefull, their pulls could end up killing someone else in their path.  And NO, it's not their fault most of those times. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udiako.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diako</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/28/02 10:54:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2494.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kitting, and things Druid need to realize...</span><hr size=1> Bah... 2nd post I make, where I see typo's all over the place... and I can't edit.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

All of Friday night and Saturday morning I set up camp at the tree.  Maybe two hours after I've been there on Friday, Sentry logs on (think that's his name).  He's a ranger that starts to kite to the left of us, we don't go in his area nor does he mess with ours (partner being a 37 sk and I being a 36 shammy).<br>
<br>
[insert Saturday's events here]<br>
<br>
Sunday when I log my friend I start looking for a new spot to level because the Northern shore is being over ran by kiters.  Sentry was back (no disrepect man), some druid that started with a B, and another that started with a Y.  With three kiters right next too each other it'd be suicide to stay there, so we headed to the bridge and checked out the orc camp.  No one was there, not even a soul setting up camp to hunt kod's and snow griffans by the ramp.  The SK pulls the two orcs and of course I root the other ..blah blah aboot other shammy battle stuff involving cancel magic, slow, debuff, buffing, etc...  During this time I see Sentry asking for help in ooc, i ooc back that he shouldn't have kited more then he could handle <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Sentry ooc'ed back that he was cross trained by another  druid, and that it wasn't his fault.  I replied that I wished him the best of luck and apologized.  My partner and I pulled the other two orcs and mystic, then took a med break.  Both of us were low on health and mana from the previous battle--during the battle there was ooc from a druid who's name starts with a B that was asking for help.  Even while we med'ed up he still persisted on someone helping him--the SK had around 80h and 20m while I had 60 health/mana.  Next thing I know he and some other druid that starts with y has trained two snow dervs and a cougar onto my tank.  Did the cc with root and we finished one cougar and derv, during the first derv my root broke so I turned around to run to get some distance.  When I turned I saw the two people that had trained us go invisi on the slope =/--they're glitter stayed there and did not go up hill like they were zoning.  The last derv broke root and I had aboot 20h left--after two resisted roots and one interrupted one I was dead.<br>
<br>
At this time I was livid--mainly at myself (have a strive to be better thang)  but also at the two that trained us.  When I zoned back into EW I made the ooc comment, &quot;thanks for helping with that train you dumped on my tank's head. /rude&quot;.  Druid B acted all innocent and claimed that he told druid Y to zone, he also stated that it wouldn't have mattered because they were both 00m.  /sigh I said to myself OFWSH, notch some more druids that are incompetent to their class and giving good druids on our server a bad rap.<br>
<br>
Couldn't the bad druid kiters just play a necro, hell even I six year old could fear kite without training anyone.  Another thing, wf'ing good does it due to kite during a busy time?

<br>
Lower level druids:  Before you start quad-kiting on your own, go find and watch a higher-level druid who knows what they are doing.  (As a grouping Druid, I am just really learning solo quad-kiting myself.) Quad kiting can be very different from regular kiting because you are not rooting the mob and using dot, you are snaring and grouping your mobs as close together as possible so you can use the aoe spells on them.  This involves LOTS of running around and it's easy to accidentally train others.  Also, start out on mobs that are indifferent - they don't automatically aggro unless you hit them (elephants, mammoth's, rhino's, etc...).  That way if you do accidentally run past others, no one gets hurt.<br>
<br>
Quad-kiting Druids:  Our SOW (and wolf-form) gets faster as we go up in level so if you don't take that into consideration, you can outrun your mobs.  Also, if there is a mistake and someone does get trained, APOLOGIZE, DAMMIT!   Be helpful and heal them or find them a rez if they died.<br>
<br>
Folks in quad-kiting areas:  Realize that you are in a zone which is popular with quad kiters.  There is usually an area within the zone where most Druids do the kiting - find it and make your camp somewhere else.  (For example:  most Druids in CS snare the wyverns from the peaks and kite them on the beach - safest area in the zone to do so)  Also, most of us who go to zones like CS to hunt do so because we have excellent faction there and the mobs won't attack us unless we attack first.  If you are KOS in CS and you decide to hang out on the beach, don't get all bent out of shape if you get hit with a train.  There is no way we are going to know who is KOS and who isn't.<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts. <p><br>

I don't believe &quot;all&quot; druids and Wizard are idiots.  I played a wizard to 54.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    And quadding is a bit more complex.  You got 2 minutes to snare, and nuke them.   And adds mean you have to zone cause your snare is going to break.  Had green wolfs agro on me in Dawnshroud while Quadding Rockhoppers on SZ....  Ugly, you have to zone or root and hope it sticks.<br>
<br>
Eitherway, back to EW.   You might have seen my pair Foolbok.  I am Soulsavor/Calistau, was a bit south of the tree.  It happened once in the past week where I pulled too close to tree, and it got suckered in to group at tree.. then again, a druid casted on my mob and got it's muzzle pummeled in.  Doh!  Calistau went right on the Mob, and Cleric had to nuke twice to try to diminished dmg.  I think the Ranger you might be refering to is Century (was red to me at 43), I'm certain his name started with a &quot;C&quot;.  Seen him a lot in the past week, and for most of the 15-20 hours I've played this past weekend.  I've seen a few Druids quadding, had a full group at tree... and also had an Iksar monk grouped with someon North of Tree...  I ended up having to pull light blues last night cause competition was so bad...   hehe<br>
<br>
I have a feeling there were some trouble makers this past weekend....   And hearing what you said Foolbok, just confirms it.  Maybe it wasn't an accident that so many died near Safe tree... Maybe it was setup on purpose.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   These are the days when I miss PVP.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ucelticdiva.showPublicProfile?language=EN>celticdiva</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.gifs.net/animate/tiger.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Póg ma thoin </span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/28/02 12:56:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2494.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> I'm sorry to hear about that stuff in EW - I hate it when a few other Druids out there screw it up for the other 95 percent of us. <p><br>

I'm not sure if it was us you pulled to or not, it might have been but this weekend is somewhat of a blur to me :P.  You are right aboot the name Century, he seemed like a good guy though and never crosstrained us.<br>
<br>
It would seem that the 8th coldain shawl quest has fux0red EW now.  Every1 is camping ulth's now and Saturday it was near impossible to find a snow griffin that wasn't engaged.  I talked to my friend via the phone after I made that post earlier.  That halfling warrior was being PL'ed by him or another druid.  I'm not sure if the druid pulled too much for him or if they were trained by a druid that was pissed with them PL'ing in his quad kiting country.  Not to come across as an asshole or anything, but druid's that quad kite in that area during busy server times are frickin' stupid.  Go to IC and quad kite the infinite cougar spawns on top of the hill by the soulbinder.  They don't hit as hard and have less HP's then wal's and ulth's.<br>
<br>
I've had nothing but bad luck in Velious since I bought the expansion two weeks ago.  First time in Velious I'm running along the shore of the snow gnolls island in IC to head to the soulbinder for my Rogue.  A giant turtle falls out of the sky on top of me and bites me three times for 300 hp and slashes for 100--yup an ultra rare 18 hour spawn named Lodi.  First time I zone into EW I die from some1 bringing the death squad to the zone.  :ack: what are the chances <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If it wasn't for the shawl quest and dragon armor I'd have left that place long long ago.<br>

I was in EW during this incident and noticed everyone calling him a whiner.  I, too, thought it was BS.  /ooc is for talking.  He didn't have the name of the person so he couldn't give a tell to him which is something he said before everyone chewed him out.  I would have said something but why have both of us being yelled at?  I'm tired of starting /ooc arguements.. LOL.  For the record, *I* was over by sleeper taking out mammoths :P<br>
<br>
On the question of quadding, I quaded for 5 levels in IC and this is where I first learned of the problem with agro.  I was working with anothe druid who was lower and if I got out of range the cougars would go towards him ruining my kite.  I'm observant of it now and that comes with practice.  After 2 years of play, this is my first druid who could quad, but I'm learning.<br>
<br>
The other side of the coin is the fact that druids do kite.  I dont' know how many times people would kill my kills and then apologize when I said something about it.  The apology is nice, but if you know a druid is around kiting - and I make it known - take a moment to look at the your potential kill.  I realize that the damage bar takes a second to update, but as you get closer, it does update.  Some of the kills I witnessed were blatant KSes pawned off as accidents.  I actually watched another druid kiting.  This guy runs PAST him and killed his kill.   We might be 50 ft from the kill, but it's not hard to check.  /rant<br>

<br>
I solo in the same areas as quad kiters, usually one or two of the same outdoor free-range mobs that people like quad kiting.  I will generally SoW wizards when asked, and trade focus for PotG with druids (they have to group buff PotG even if it is only for themselves anyway) and I have actually had very little trouble.  Druids and wizards will steer themselves away from my rooted/dotted mobs and we all get along in relative harmony.  <br>
<br>
However, it sounds like you have run into some asshole wizards/druids.  Post their names if they do it repeatedly.  If you don't want to shitlist them, then take it to the druid or wizard forum and maybe one of the older druids or wizards will take a minute and explain to the training idiots exactly how to control their kite.<br>

    Happened once on a pull where I shot an arrow, and realized like 5 secs later...  it wasn't behind me... turn around... and see it coming at slow speed... and I go Doh!   Then I finally found the Druid that was Quadding, I probably shot the mob with only a snare on it.  Asked him where I could bring it back to him and he said he was fine, he had 3 other ones.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
    The way I've been pulling after that is get close enough and do /assist on the Mob to see if it's targeting someone.  If not, I shoot it.   This way I didn't get to cross anyone else's mob. <br>
<br>
  And thanks for the supporting comments on my ooc.  I started to be defensive in ooc, and realized I was being taunted.
