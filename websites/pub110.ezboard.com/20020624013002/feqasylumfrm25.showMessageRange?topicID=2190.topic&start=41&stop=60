If someone is needed for this I will sign up, I have nothing else to do, hell I surf the boards while in eq.<br>

Again, I dont agree with the actions, and will NOT support them when I host open raid in the near future.

Harne has lead more open raids then I care to count. Look at his raids... Damn 5 to 6 pages over 100 people signin up for his raids, He's doing SOMETHING right. <br>
<br>
Arwin, you obviously dont raid very often, I have a freaking calender and write them down as soon as I sign up, to keep them all straight. If you raid more than once a week you almost have to. <br>
<br>
People who say... "stop your bitching and whining, it's just a game" Ya I know it's a game, Harne knows it's a game and that's why we have a calender. Because we all have real lives outside this game! If people dont adhere to the rules of the calender it makes MORE work for people like Harne, who lead open raids on a weekly basis. <br>
<br>
/cheer Harne<br>
Thank you Harne for being the wonderful raid leader than you are, thank you for standing up for our community. <br>

There are people in any community who will just not respect the intentions of others or the accepted way of doing thiings.  Using the raid calendar is not a rule nor is posting your raid here a rule for that matter, however courtesy and good will towards your fellow players demands some respect of these guidlines if you are a person of any decency.  However, there are rules as to how the calendar is used. If you are going to use the calendar, then use that calendar within the rules laid out by the moderators and the community as a whole.<br>
<br>
Harne leads tons of raids, many of them with no benefit to himself or to some of his guild mates come to mention it.  He does it because he wants to see people enjoy the game and loves to lead.<br>
<br>
Can you imagine the utter chaos that would ensue if people did not at least <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  try</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to work together and be fair to one another?  I don't think that many people over the level of 50 would even consider signing on it would be an utter nightmare.<br>
<br>
I am saying then, someone has the courage to do something about an issue in their own way which will hopefully at least make those who show no respect or concern for others think twice about it then they get a /cheer /salute and a ton of respect from me.<br>
<br>
Really those that appose someone for standing up for what they think is right, well, you don't have to agree with it or like it or follow it.  Harne is making the consequences abundantly clear to anyone who doesn't respect them with respect to joining his raids and he has every right to do that. <br>

BTW- those that say they don't check to see stuff about raids, dates and such or see if its over 2 weeks out, its really not hard to do... simple math..and if I sign up for a raid I just don't blindly sign up. I check to see who's in the raid, the place, the time, how far out is it, who's leading, etc...<br>
<br>
I would recommend others to do the same, don't walk in to a raid blind... <p><table align="left" border="0"><tr><td align="left" nowrap style="filter:glow(color=#ffffff" strength="1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt'">

<br>
I have asked and volunteered to help with the calendar before when moderators were needed.  But I was not accepted. I do not have the power to alter the calendar. <br>
<br>
I have asked on many occasions that people have the courtesy and decency to respect the calendar and follow the rules that govern it.  I asked  as nicely as possible and people still DID NOT hear me.<br>
<br>
I got TIRED of talking to a wall.<br>
<br>
So I did what I (me as raid leader) can do to try and STOP the flagrant disregard of the calendar.  I posted CONSEQUENCES that will happen if individuals violate the &quot;2-week&quot; rule. This is something that I (as a raid leader) will do. If I stood alone, I was ready for that. If others supported my actions, great. If other raid leaders followed my example, so much the better. The consequences are heavier. <br>
<br>
Almost all open, semi and closed raid leaders try to honor the calendar so that the posting of raids on days could be as FAIR as possible. I did not say &quot;EVERYONE&quot; followed it but the VAST majority did. <br>
<br>
You will ALWAYS have the uber guilds having their own agenda and I know some don't even BOTHER looking at the calendar. I cannot do anything as an individual to stop them. They have the manpower and forces to pretty much do what they want. However, in my dealings with them I have always found a way to compromise and still raid. Talking to their raid leaders, I have always found some form of communication possible and beneficial. <br>
<br>
What I want to do is find a solution to the flagrant disregard of calendar. True... the &quot;2-week&quot; rule is NOT something everyone has to follow. As we can see almost daily, it was frequently broken.  But it is the BEST and FAIREST rule we have to posting and raiding. <br>
<br>
Anyone can disregard the &quot;2-week&quot; rule. There was no stopping them. But now, IF they do... there are CONSEQUENCES. <br>
<br>
A rule is not a &quot;rule&quot; unless it is enforced.  IF there are no consequences to breaking that rule, it's not much of a rule. Why do you follow the rules in real life? It is because you were brought up to and there are consequences to breaking them. <br>
<br>
We as a community MUST enforce the following of the  &quot;2-week&quot; rule.  Who else will?<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that you don't agree with my actions but you don't have to... these are MY actions. <br>
<br>
I want to THANK everyone that DOES support this. The more raid leaders that support this, the heavier the consequences for violating what everyone has tried to uphold: respect and courtesy of others on the calendar.<br>

<br>
When I was using the calander I kept a page in my EQ notebook (I have a 3 subject spiral notebook filled with lists and locs and stuff) just for raids and events.  If you want to be an effective casual raider, and especially if you want to be a raid leader you need to keep track of time. (If I were to write down my current schedule it would look like Tuesday-Raid, Wednesday-Raid, Thursday-Raid, Friday-Raid, Saturday-Raid, etc. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .  Point being, if you want to raid, know when the raid is, don't just sign up at random...be there on time...and if you are posting one don't post more than 2 weeks in advance.<br>
<br>
I think that Harne should be the new calander mod.  There is obviously a need for one. <p><center><img src="http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/29/2468929.jpg" border="0">

<br>
But I dont think Blacklisting the ppl who sign up is the right way, maybe just the leader, as the ppl signing up may not know that the raid is breaking the rules.<br>
<br>
some ppl are still new to raids or new to this calander and may not know what is going on, and if you blacklist ppl for signing up to a raid that is not following the rules will make it difficult to get on future raids.<br>
making all new raiders blacklisted before they get a chance to raid or learn to raid.<br>
<br>
I for one have a limited time scedule for playing... and if the raid is in my time scedule regardless of the rules I may have signed up without knowing... AND GET BLACKLISTED??? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I dont want that to happen!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I dont get the chance to check this board all the time, so I have no idea if a leader is following the rules for the calander or not.<br>
<br>
when I have time or know i will be available for a raid I ussaully sign up 2 - 5 days before raid, not knowing what offence the raid leader has committed.<br>
Unless there is an edit or reply I can see stating the offence!<br>
<br>
I also dont ussaully read every post or reply on the raid ( just the raid and rules of it ) as it would take up all my time to read every post on every raid and wouldn't have time to play the game  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
won't it be kind of hard to check a date stamp this way as the thread will be created before the 2 week rule and the calendar post may not have been?<br>
<br>
I do not agree with this 100%, but I agree with the spirit of it.  I am not trying to play devil's advocate but honestly, some brand new character who just got lvl 46 and is itching to go on a plane raid isn't going to know anything about all this, and even if Harne does post a warning they'll probably think who the hell is Harne, and why is he trying to ruin this raid?  Sure, something needs to be done about how no one respects the calendar, and in my experience everytime a contested raid is posted (faydedar, CoM etc.) it is NEVER respected, I doubt this will change that.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of people who will not understand what is going on, I'm sure there are tons of pepole who browse the calendar every day and are not aware of this post.  Blakclist the raid leaders, but I would think that if you blacklist people who sign up you are hurting innocent people more than you are the guilty--if people aren't going to respect the calendar they won't need people like Harne to set up open raids for them, but 75% of the raid DOES, and they are most likely not aware that they are screwing themselves out of it.<br>
<br>
As for me, I don't really sign up for open raids anymore (Except Amori's /wink) but I have a lot of friends who are just getting to go on planars, halls of testing, a lot of fun raid areas, and I'd hate to think they get blacklisted because they are ignorant...anyway my point is if you are going to go through with this, do something to educate people besides this post, because not everyone is going to read this, and not everyone is going to understand it anyway.<br>

And perhaps, this will weed out the majority of the &quot;rogue&quot; raid leaders. So, thanks for having the balls, Harne. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The reason why I want to place individuals versus just the raids is because even though you blacklist the raid and the raid leaders, they WILL continue to lead raids IF they have support. The less support they have, the more they will be forced to follow the rules. I'm basically undercutting them by depriving them of their ability to gather people. IF they had the manpower already, they wouldn't be using open raids. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The idea behind posting the raid is that it lets people know which raids not to honor.  So if a raid leader posts more than two weeks out, notice is sent to Lanys that their raid shouldn't be respected and anyone is well within their rights to get there first/schedule a raid there for the same day same time.<br>
<br>
Also, listing the raid/guild/raid leader instead of the participants will make for a much smaller and more maintainable list.  Either way, I agree with the previous poster that it should be stickied at the top of the forum where everyone can see it.<br>

<br>
I too have raided with Harne and Kiras, and a number of others who lead the better raids, and I agree with the idea that something should be done to help &quot;promote&quot; a little more courtesy regarding raids.  I even agree with blacklisting raid leaders who can't follow simple rules.  <br>
However.., I do not agree with blacklisting people who may have signed up for of those raids, for whatever reason. That would be too much like flying a jet liner into a building full of defenseless people in order to attack the government, and way of life, of the country that building resides in...<br>
When you start something like this you have to be very careful what you do. It's a fine line between right and wrong...<br>
