<br>
Okay, so I wanted to see for myself. I ventured up to see our friend. I just watch for a round of spawns, see whats going on. He's got it down to a science, no aggro on any pulls.. no problems. No trains, nothing. So, the second round comes. The archer I've been sitting near spawns.. I wait a minute or two, and taunt it (wondering whether I can take it solo... it occurs to me quickly that I can.)<br>
