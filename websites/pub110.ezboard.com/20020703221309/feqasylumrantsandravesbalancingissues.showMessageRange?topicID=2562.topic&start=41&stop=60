Even though they all get sued by dumbass moms and dads, they're still a relatively happy bunch.  Surgery + Medicine is a happy medium for a lot of people.<br>

<br>
I never said they were apathetic.  I said they had God complexes, blamed the patient, railroaded him through (at a couple of clinics, Mayo Jacksonville being the primary one), didn't listen to him, and missed a very obvious diagnosis, but...none of them seemed completely apathetic, no. :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Perhaps your fiance was just a complete pain in the ass to every doctor he saw<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, he was generally too out of it to say much at all besides answer their questions.  He was always excited and enthusiastic about each new diagnosis and treatment, since he wanted so badly to find out what he had and get better, but he became disillusioned as more and more didn't work.  It was me who came in sorta late in the process, and after seeing what was happening to him and seeing him being bullied by his current doctor (the one with all the nasty drug combinations), that turned into something of a &quot;pain in the ass.&quot; :P  I did my homework though, and I didn't (and don't) argue with doctors unless it's something I have read extensively about.  And it turns out I *was* right, because we (yeah I have it too, but that's another story) are finally getting better.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Doctors do not just &quot;toss aside&quot; all previous records and information.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hmm some have, and even more than that the administrators of clinics have.  When nascens went through Mayo, most of the doctors he saw had not even seen his previous medical records, and they made him redo all of the expensive (and often painful, one sending him into a seizure -- after he warned them it would and they still didn't take the necessary precautions) tests he had had at least a few times before.  I really fail to see why it is necessary to redo very expensive tests even &quot;a few weeks&quot; after they have been done with negative results.  Why do them at all, if by the time you get the results back they are out of date?  His illness was the same during all the years he was sick.  So were almost all of his symptoms.  And yes, every single time the same tests were done, the results were the same.  <br>
<br>
Money is always an issue, especially if you are too sick to work, and we were treated at that clinic as just another source of money.  In fact, we refused to pay because of the horrible way we were treated, and after a few letters I wrote explaining our protests to the president of Mayo, they called the  collection agencies off and stopped threatening to sue us, realizing we had a pretty damn good case against them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And, sure, you have a few incompetent health care providers out there...somewhere.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Honestly...you are taking this as a personal insult to the medical profession, and it did sound like that from my post, but I'll point out the following.  Maybe I just have competence standards that are too high.<br>
<br>
Throughout grade school, I had 3-4 teachers that I really thought were good, a bunch that were ok, and several that were just horrible.  In college the ratio was better...more that were really good, less that were really horrible.  In EQ even...I know a handful of players that are really good, a bunch that are ok, and...ok well quite a few that really suck too. :P  That's just the way people are, and fields like medicine are the less forgiving ones.  <br>
<br>
Is it too much to ask to be open minded and compassionate to your patient?  That's really all we asked in a doctor, but it was the hardest to find.  We didn't expect them all to know exactly what fibromyalgia is (it is, after all, a pretty newly discovered illness) and recognize it instantly, but when we came to them saying hey this is not working and nascens feels even worse, we hoped they would listen and not yell at him and make him feel even worse.  Or would at least read the studies I brought them, consider that their original diagnosis *might* be wrong, and possibly try the treatment I had brought them research on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But to label every doctor (regardless if it is the south) as apathetic and incompetent is reckless and slanderous<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That was not done here; go re-read my earlier posts.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And then  trust their opinions. That doesn't mean not ever getting a second opinion, or not asking many questions...but it does mean that at the end of the day you have to believe in the doctor you've chosen.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
We did, which is why on nascens' medical record there are at least a dozen diagnoses and even more different treatments tried. :P  It was several years before we became disillusioned enough to try to find the answer ourselves, and stopped &quot;trusting&quot; most of our doctors.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> For every one bad case you hear about there are at least 10 good cases you never hear about<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok, my experiences:<br>
<br>
42ish doctors, several at clinics.  4 compassionate ones that listened to us and were open minded, 3 of which admitted that they could not help him but wished us luck finding out what was really wrong (and no, that wasn't what we &quot;wanted to hear&quot; :P).  5-10 who actually knew what fibromyalgia is (and no, it's not rare).  5-6 that actually yelled at nascens because he questioned their diagnosis and/or the treatment was not working and &quot;it must be his fault.&quot;  20 or so gave him diagnoses that they were &quot;absolutely positive&quot; of, all turned out to be wrong.  1 gave him a very dangerous combination of medicines, one that had a huge warning label saying NOT to prescribe that for the condition the doctor had just diagnosed him with -- thank god he didn't really have that condition (but he's head of his department -- can we really take that to the medical board?).  And almost all repeated expensive tests that he had had done sometimes several times before.<br>
<br>
So, either we're really really unlucky, or out of our rather large sampling maybe 1 in 10 doctors are &quot;good&quot; ones.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But when people say EVERY medical person out there is greedy and doesn't give a rat's ass about patients<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Sure it does.  You did your job (and hopefully did it well), good for you. The garbage man came to get my garbage and recycling today, and did a good job of it, and boy was I glad of that too!  I used to teach little girls dancing and fix computers, those were my jobs, and I thought I did a decent job of those.  Let's not get into the &quot;you should respect me because my job is more important than yours&quot; debate, please.  That's probably the main thing that gives doctors their &quot;God Complexes.&quot;<br>

/shrug -- I'm pleased as punch with my current doctor, love him to death.  He's a 70 year old man with so much energy it makes me tired watching him, and he's got my illness too (under control, though). :P  On his treatment I went from narcotic pain medicines to not even advil, from lying in bed delirious to...er...sitting in front of a computer. :P  Ok I'm not quite there yet, but I'm getting there!  Nascens is also loads better too, just takes forever. <p><center><a href="http://www.theroyalknights.org" alt="Adjani Tristesse, Saucy Kitty of TRK"><img src="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/adjsig14.jpg"></a>

<br>
I'm paraphrasing Nek's post, go back and read it for a full jist of what he said, it was a good post.<br>
<br>
However, I'm going to absolutely disagree with you here. Patients SHOULD have a sense of entitlement. Doctors work <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> for</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> their patients, not just with them. And while it seems semantical, it is exactly that appearance of arrogance that causes so many patients to distrust doctors.<br>
<br>
The distinction IMO is important, because far too many patients completely hand over everything to a physician. And that's dangerous. And yes, since my husband works medical board cases, I am biased. I've seen the direct results of that.<br>
<br>
I'm not talking about patients who continually refuse to follow medical advice, about changing habits and lifestyles, and then blaming the doctor when they have to have a triple bypass. Or patients who continually refuse to follow a correct course of treatment.<br>
<br>
However, all too many patients blindly and willingly follow a doctor to the point of sacrificing their health for it. <br>
<br>
Most people posting, are offering first hand experiences with shitty doctors. Does that mean all doctors are horrible? No. Do I think you're a horrible arrogant doctor? No. Actually Nek based on what little interaction I've had with you, and what I've read of your posts that I can recall, I think you're probably a damn fine person who cares.<br>
<br>
Let's run down briefly my shit experiences with doctors. Just mine, in my 30 years of life.<br>
<br>
When I was about 12, I broke my ankle. It was a hairline fracture. Rather than putting on a cast, a doctor who had been working an extremely long shift, who wanted to go home said &quot;fuck it&quot; and ace-bandaged it. The nurse argued with him, and was vetoed. I heard the entire conversation while extremely doped up on codeine. I related it later to my parents who were sure I must have misheard. I have had numerous injuries to that same ankle over the years and it is &quot;weak&quot;. Often when running, the ankle would give out and twist. I had so many sprains to that ankle that I don't bother to even seek medical treatment for it anymore.<br>
<br>
When I was in my 20s I stopped menstrating normally. I went to 3 or 4 ob/gyns who told me a variety of bullshit from &quot;Not every woman will menstrate&quot; to &quot;well as you get older...&quot; Finally I went to a specialist who my mother had seen, and who is a wonderful doctor, who correctly diagnosed PCOD. Which is also the cause of my infertility. However at least 3 previous ob/gyns <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> couldn't even be bothered to run the basic blood tests for this</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> because I was not overweight, and I did not have abnormal body hair, two symptoms of the syndrome.<br>
<br>
When I was 26, I lost half the vision in my left eye. We went to the ER because my husband, who has medical training, and was pre-med and works for the medical board, thought I might have an inter-cranial bleed. The doctor I saw at the ER ran no tests, he wiggled his fingers in front of my eyes, proclaimed he thought it was a detached retina, and said he did not have the equipment there to make a full diagnosis. (Which was untrue, the ER has the equipment as we found out later). That I was to see opthamology the next day, and to go home and not bounce around too much.<br>
<br>
When I went to opthamology, they were <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> horrified</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Had it been a detached or detaching retina, I would be blind in that eye due to his gross negligence. Fortunately it was not that, I was diagnosed with psuedotumor cerebri after several tests.<br>
<br>
When I was diagnosed with PTC, I was put on diamox, which is the first dieretic of choice for that. Unfortunately I had every single side-effect in the worst possible way. I was violently ill. I was told there was no other medication. <br>
<br>
We switched neurologists. I was vomiting constantly, could not engage in any activity for more than 15-20 minutes without being so fatigued I would sleep for hours. I was in constant pain between the head pain, and the pins and needles in my hands and feet. Even walking was agony. Food when I could eat tasted horrible. It was literally hell.<br>
<br>
There are numerous other medications. There was no reason for me to be on that one. Especially due to the side effects. When I demanded of the new neurologist why this other doctor would have told me there was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> no other medication</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it was justified as &quot;Well what you have is uncommon. He probably simply didn't know&quot;. That was seen as a reasonable excuse.<br>
<br>
This new neurologist, who I actually like, also was adamant on shunting me as a &quot;cure&quot;. However I took it upon myself to not only educate myself on this illness, but also seek outside expert opinions. Fortunately we have many friends who are doctors and experts in various fields. The neurologist was not fully disclosing the risks and disadvantages of such a procedure. When I asked him about this, he admitted there were problems, but wanted to proceed, because he saw it as a quick fix. (He literally said that). <br>
<br>
Not a month later this same neurologist, despite continuing symptomology wanted to remove me from the dieretics. After my husband (loudly) protested that I was still having visual disturbances, still having symptoms of edema, still having severe head pain, he consulted my chart. And then tried to press once more for surgery <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> when not 5 minutes before he was ready to remove me from all medication and pronounce it resolved!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I'm leaving out the numerous doctors who simply gave me medication for asthma, as I went to the ER approximately every 6 weeks for almost 2 years, because they all assumed I had asthma since a child <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> because they couldn't be bothered to read my chart</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and NO ONE thought to tell me how to manage it. It took two years of battling with doctors before one realized &quot;Oh my God, you developed asthma as an adult, do you do this, do you do that?&quot; and they were HORRIFIED at the fact that this had gone on for so long. I told them that one doctor said I had it, and the rest just dumped medication on me, rescue inhalors and tried to get me to take predisone. <br>
<br>
 I went for a full allergy screening (no allergies) and was given a pneumonia vaccination because I had chronic pneumonia at that point.<br>
<br>
After the vaccination, my asthma improved 99%. They assume now I probably had chronic pneumonia that was causing the asthma. I use a rescue inhalor now <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> maybe</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 10 times a year, if that. They also finally authorized a $200 machine to give me a mist of medication...which is basically what I was going to the ER for every damned month. And a session with a nurse to explain asthma; treatment and management.<br>
<br>
Realize also that the asthma and PTC occurred while I was with my husband. Even between us, who are obviously not ignorant of this field...look what occurred.<br>
<br>
Is this to say all doctors are shit? No. It is to say that people need to take control of their health. Whether that's by a willingness to manage their own health care, by following doctor's advice, or by educating themselves on what's wrong with them, and questioning the doctors until they understand.<br>
<br>
Even with the fertility issues, the first ob/gyn I went to, whom I liked and still like as a doctor, attempted to dismiss PCOD. Fortunately I had been through that before and knew why. And he was able to listen as I explained my history. I was forwarded to a department head, who ran all the tests. Not everything was conclusive, but he was smart enough also to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> listen</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to what we were telling him, and look at previous tests and histories. While I don't fit into the absolute pigeonhole of people with this, that's what's wrong. And additional tests confirmed what I knew, which was I was not ovulating due to hormonal deficency. <br>
<br>
Doctors are not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> gods</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and patients should also understand that as well. They are people who are attempting to help others, yes. However they can also make mistakes that have a serious impact on people's lives. Which is why I personally believe it is absolutely essential for people to take ownership of their own health, and recognize that a doctor works for them. And if they are not happy with those services they should find another physician. That is not a license to 'shop around until you hear what you want to hear', because that is purely stupid.<br>
<br>
However it important that they take care and consideration in choose a physician. And that they are personally involved in their own health care. And that they have a doctor that they are not only confident in, but who also is willing to take the time to make sure that they understand what is going on, who will answer their questions, listen to them, and explain whatever processes are occurring and viable alternatives.<br>
<br>
Yes, doctors should work with their patients, however patients should not lose sight of the fact that the doctors work for them. They are not doing you a favor by treating you. They are paid professionals providing a valuable service for a fee. That doesn't mean that they cannot care, or do not care. I know for a fact they do.<br>
<br>
I'm leaving out the good stories...the doctors who worked on me for 3 hours in surgery when I had what the department head of anthesia described as the worst asthma attack he had ever seen in his 25 year career, on the table. They worked 3 hours to bring me safely out of anthesia. He also looked in on me every hour after admittance long after he should have gone home, because he was so concerned for me. He didn't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> have</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to do that. But he did. And when I had to have a second surgery, he completely changed his schedule to make sure he was my attending anesthesiologist  <br>
again, because he was there before. And he went with an alternative to sedation, by using an epidural, and other drugs to make me comfortable, and blissfully have no memory of it as well hehe. And he has it noted and also told me *any* time I have to have surgery if possible to please notify him, and he will make every effort to be there, and if not he will talk with the doctors involved to make them completely aware of what to potentially expect. Even though my chances of that occurring again are only 20%. <br>
<br>
My current ob/gyn has designated on my chart that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> no one</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> but he is to treat me for the infertility, even though policy is that people going through the infertility treatments are supposed to see anyone available in the doctor pool for that. He will also be my ob/gyn for pregnancy because of the other health issues. He doesn't have to do that, his schedule is precious since he works as a department head, and primarily only on high risk cases. However he <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>cares</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> and since he is familiar with everything wants to be the only doctor handling it.<br>
<br>
Unfortuantly I'm a patient some doctors loathe. I have reactions to things I shouldn't, and no bad reactions to things I should. I don't fit into many typical archatypes. I shouldn't have had that severe problem in surgery, but my recovery was nothing short of astounding. I should have had perm. vision loss from the optic nerve damage due to the severely increased cerebral fluid levels...yet my vision returned 100%. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I've had more than one doctor introduced to me because PTC is so rare that they may never see a case in their career. And I've been asked if I mind them doing a full exam, and neurological exam for their benefit. I don't mind one iota. They care enough to want to educate themselves on what to look for. They ask many questions so if they come upon it during their career they can identify it. I'm more than willing to be poked and prodded for that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'm not bashing on doctors, I would venture to say even with my poor experiences <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> most</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> doctors care deeply about their patients and are there to help them. However they're not perfect. The one thing that is continious in patient care is the patient. They *must* be involved in their care. And they must have a physician with whom they can do that. And if not, then they need to recognize the fact that the doctor when all is said and done, works for them, and fire them and find another physician.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I never said they were apathetic. I said they had God complexes, blamed the patient, railroaded him through (at a couple of clinics, Mayo Jacksonville being the primary one), didn't listen to him, and missed a very obvious diagnosis<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I can't see how the diagnosis was obvious and the tests were done it was missed... you have what is called a diagnosis of exclusion.   There is much controversy whether or not the disease even truly exists.  This isn't an 'obvious diagnosis'.  I know in chronic pain and fatigue, you look for -every physical cause- possible before moving to &quot;chronic fatigue syndrome' or 'fibromyalgia'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> nascens went through Mayo, most of the doctors he saw had not even seen his previous medical records, and they made him redo all of the expensive (and often painful, one sending him into a seizure -- after he warned them it would and they still didn't take the necessary precautions) tests he had had at least a few times before. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Actually redoing tests is standard if the clinic doing so only trusts its own results.  I've ordered repeat CTs (very expensive if uninsured) simply because other centers have different protocols.  MRIs, same thing.  LPs, blood cultures, xrays even... often they are re-done.  Again, you mention a painful test that sent him into a seizure, yet they didn't take precautions?  It just doesn't make sense.  Having done nearly every test known to man, you spend a few minutes ensuring all your bases are covered, to -not- is malpractice.<br>
<br>
And I'm not sure what test for fibromyalgia will cause seizures, could you be more specific?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Or would at least read the studies I brought them, consider that their original diagnosis *might* be wrong, and possibly try the treatment I had brought them research on<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  I guarantee anyone dealing with chronic pain has read the studies.  We all have.  Promise on that one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 5-10 who actually knew what fibromyalgia is (and no, it's not rare)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->.  Um.  err.  U sure about that?  It's been a hot topic for over 20 years.  I'd be hardpressed to find 5-10 doctors in NA who don't know what it is.  Understanding it... that's another issue.  Becuase honestly, it's a patient-reported disease.  No test shows it, no treatment guarantees coverages, no test excludes it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1 gave him a very dangerous combination of medicines, one that had a huge warning label saying NOT to prescribe that for the condition the doctor had just diagnosed him with -- thank god he didn't really have that condition (but he's head of his department -- can we really take that to the medical board?). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Please name the medications, I'd like to know what they were doing that was so terrible... it sounds horrible if its a stark Contraindication, and yes, you could take him to the medical board.  Even the head of the department needs to be licensed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> probably the main thing that gives doctors their &quot;God Complexes.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  Some doctors have God Complexes, no doubt.  But a lot of patients have an inferiority complex (that is, they have an automatic assigning of traits to education and standing in society), so that any display of personality is -projected onto the doctor- as being superior and high-handed.  I'm not saying that's the case with you, but its often the case.  <br>
<br>
Fact is, doctors usually occupy the 'top social rung' of the ladder... due to salary and just society's assigning of doctors to that place... and anyone on that rung will be a little much sometimes.  But at the same time, everone 'below' will be assigning a lot of attributes to people above them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> On his treatment I went from narcotic pain medicines to not even advil, from lying in bed delirious to...er...sitting in front of a computer. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Which treatment worked for you?  I'm curious as fibromyalgia is such a tricky disease.<br>
<br>
Certain groups feel its purely psychiatric... a somitization disorder (which is why SSRIs, Gabapentin, etc, tend to work) where psychiatric illness manifests itself as an undiagnosible pain.  Other groups feel its neurologic, irritation or inflammation of nerves, which is why steroids can maybe work.<br>
<br>
Honestly, its a crapshoot.  When i read that you and nascens had fibromyalgia, i knew what type of ordeal both you and the medical staffs went through.  Everyone with fibromyalgia has gone through your path, so frustrated that the medical system 'misses' their diagnosis, but completely non-understanding of how diagnosis works, and how things that are -much more severe- have to be completely excluded before moving into the area of CFS/FM.<br>
<br>
At the same time, when you tell me doctors were yelling at you and nascens, it tells me there is more to the story.  I'm sure things got tense, but remember part of that is on your side.  I'm pretty confident you weren't just sitting there as a doctor berated you, i'm sure you were involved.<br>
<br>
I will also make a generalization, this does not apply to you, but is one of the frustrating things of medicine and being a doctor.  When you have people with chronic conditions, you see the worst in their personality.  Stress and pain and fatigue all contribute to a real change in personality, and as such, patients often arent on their 'best behavior'.  On top of this, there is the doctor-centered frustration of not knowing what's going on.  On top of that, there is a -demand- and -expectation- on the patient that they will be cured as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
Fibromyalgia, CFS, etc.  its' the suck.  i have sympathy for you and nascens, but i also have sympathy for your healthcare providers.<br>

<br>
****begin section on the gory details of fibromyalgia here.  Skip down to below this section if you don't care****<br>
<br>
Fallacy #1: It's an illness under debate, and nobody knows if it really exists.<br>
<br>
Wrong.  It's been recognized by the CDC, AMA, WHO etc. etc. for 10-20 years now.<br>
<br>
Fallacy #2: It might be purely psychological.<br>
<br>
Wrong again.  As it was recognized by the CDC, AMA, etc. etc. it is a physical disorder, not mental what-so-ever (although it affects the brain as well as every other bodily function).<br>
<br>
Fallacy #3: It's a disease of exclusion, which can only be diagnosed after everything else has been ruled out.<br>
<br>
There are definite physical criteria for diagnosis, as accepted by the above organizations and more, and have been for, again, 10-20 years.<br>
<br>
Fallacy #4: Nobody knows what causes it and there is no cure at all.<br>
<br>
Well, I think this one is wrong, as do a whole lot of other FMS sufferers and doctors, but of course not everyone is going to agree here.  After studying every theory and treatment I could find on the disease, I came across the research of a certain UCLA doctor who has FMS himself.  He thinks it is a genetic kidney disorder, that his research proves it (and it was more well supported and conclusive than any other research I could find), and that his treatment corrects it, much like gout treatment corrects gout (same treatment, actually).  It's all very fascinating if you are interested in that sort of stuff, and you can read it, if you are interested, on his website:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.fibromyalgiatreatment.com">www.fibromyalgiatreatment.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
We've tried many different treatments, but this is the one that seemed to make the difference for us, and so this is the one we have stuck with through the better part of 4 years.  And, as I mentioned earlier, the results are better than any doctor's prognosis for us originally.  They all said &quot;well there's no cause known and no cure, but if you exercise and take all this medicine for symptoms, maybe you can get a job and lead a somewhat normal life someday.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fallacy #5: Most doctors learned about this in Med school, or at least have read a lot of the research and/or debates about it.<br>
<br>
Of the young doctors I have talked to (old ones went through med school, of course, when nobody knew about FMS), the most anyone mentioned hearing about it in school was a day spent on it in some class covering many different &quot;rare&quot; illnesses.  More than one said they recalled hearing it mentioned one day in class, but not elaborated on.<br>
<br>
Many had heard of it in passing or through literature (although it was shocking how many doctors I went to that read no medical literature whatsoever besides what the pharmaceutical companies sent), but of those the vast majority had a totally wrong impression of what it was and couldn't begin to tell you how to diagnose it.<br>
<br>
Fallacy #7: Adjani can count.<br>
<br>
Fallacy #8: It's rare.<br>
<br>
It is not rare, but causes an enormous amount of mis-diagnoses, mostly because of the misconceptions about it in the medical field I guess.  Also the fact that its symptoms can emulate most every disorder known to man (although having them all together, of course, should set off alarms).  I've read a few studies trying to ascertain how common it really is, and the conclusions were that around 5% of the *total* population have the gene.  Now, to develop the actual illness one usually has to go through a trauma of some sort...car accident, illness, stress, etc.  So a lot of those are &quot;undeveloped,&quot; but then again a lot of them are developed and misdiagnosed, the person just doesn't seek treatment (thinks they are just getting old or whatever), etc.<br>
<br>
Fallacy #9: Guys don't get it.<br>
<br>
It's true that the majority of peeps diagnosed with FMS are women, but guys definitely do get it too.<br>
<br>
Fallacy #10: It's not serious and not fatal.<br>
<br>
There are all sorts of degrees of FMS, so if you know someone who &quot;has it and lives a normal healthy life,&quot; don't assume it's not very serious indeed for others.  My dad, for instance (from whose side of the family I got the gene), displays minor symptoms of it but they barely affect his life at all.  My cousin, however, has had health problems all her life, been diagnosed with all sorts of crap, has been in and out of school (never graduated from high school), and for the most part of her life has been too sick to pass or sometimes even attend her classes at any given time.<br>
<br>
For a great many people, it's completely debilitating.  Some have to use a wheelchair, some can't even get out of bed (I went through a period where I could barely get out of bed).  Most can't work or go to school, some can't leave their houses at all.  These are generally the ones who are too scared/socially anxious/broke/fed up/or just too debilitated to even go to a doctor for it, and just live as invalids.  It's not technically fatal, meaning you can't die from the actual fibromyalgia, but there are a *lot* of things it makes you more susceptible to that greatly increase the risk of death...much like AIDS.  <br>
<br>
Rampant among FMS sufferers is suicide...especially the ones who get told &quot;it's all in your head,&quot; &quot;if you really wanted to get better you could,&quot; &quot;you're just making this up to be lazy,&quot; &quot;your illness doesn't really exist,&quot; &quot;there is no cure and you will be like this for the rest of your life,&quot; etc. etc.  You're right Tarot, so many patients believe everything their doctors tell them...and if you were faced with a life of total dependance and debilitation, with no hope of getting well, how thrilled would you be with the prospect of the rest of your life?  Thank god I didn't take the first few doctors' words for it myself.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I can't see how the diagnosis was obvious and the tests were done it was missed<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The tests they did were not for fibromyalgia...out of the first 40 of those doctors nascens saw, only one even *mentioned* fibromyalgia, and that was to say that he knew little about it but was sure nascens didn't have it.  Fortunately, we picked up a brochure on it on the way out (we were following every potential lead at this point), saw that it *exactly* matched his symptoms and medical history, and from there everything went uphill.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Actually redoing tests is standard if the clinic doing so only trusts its own results.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, I found out that it's standard. :P  Whether it's necessary or not...I'm still not convinced.  Seems awfully greedy to me, perhaps it's a good measure to be &quot;extra special sure&quot; that the tests are done right, but clinics should at least ask the patients if they can afford to have them redone first.  We couldn't, and we didn't expect to be ordered to have them redone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And I'm not sure what test for fibromyalgia will cause seizures, could you be more specific?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Like I said, they were *not* testing him for FMS.  They were just running some standard tests, and this particular one required an inordinate amount of blood to be taken from him for analysis.  He warned them that he had gone into a minor seizure the last time he had this done, and that he needed to be lying down on a table and...er something else that I forget.  They said &quot;nah, you'll be fine,&quot; and proceeded to take the blood with him sitting up.  He went into a massive, scary seizure.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I guarantee anyone dealing with chronic pain has read the studies. We all have. Promise on that one<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What studies?  The ones that say chronic pain is all in the head and patients just make it up?  Because that's what I was told by several doctors. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Please name the medications, I'd like to know what they were doing that was so terrible<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nascens really doesn't want me to post all the meds he's been on here, but if you want I can email them to you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Which treatment worked for you? I'm curious as fibromyalgia is such a tricky disease.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
See link above in the &quot;gory details&quot; section. :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Certain groups feel its purely psychiatric<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If it is, it's interesting that I denied forcefully that I was sick until I was so sick I could not get out of bed.  Also interesting that the shrink I saw for a year and all the meds he put me on did nothing.  Also interesting that I exhibit so many visible physical symptoms.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> a somitization disorder (which is why SSRIs, Gabapentin, etc, tend to work) where psychiatric illness manifests itself as an undiagnosible pain.

<br>
Read all those studies...too inconclusive, theories scientifically unsound and not backed up, etc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> At the same time, when you tell me doctors were yelling at you and nascens, it tells me there is more to the story.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There's not more to the story with the doctor who also gave him the nasty combo of meds.  He yelled at nascens, who had been meek and compliant for so many months, after he had a really bad reaction to multiple meds.<br>
<br>
A doctor at mayo clinic really chewed nascens out because he had a hard time remembering things to answer the guy's questions, and he accused nascens of making things up as he went.  He also yelled at me for helping nascens out with some answers, as my memory was better than his at the time...said I was &quot;obviously controlling him and his problem was that he let me and his mother run his life.&quot;  At that point I stood up for myself and he made me leave the room, lol.  Nascens came out really feeling like sheet after that mental abuse.<br>
<br>
Another doctor we saw, a fibromyalgia doctor, yelled at me mostly.  I was *so* very enthusiastic about him at first, but he just wasn't as much an expert on the treatment we were on as he would like to think (we are seeing the discoverer of the treatment himself now :P).  We stopped getting well for a year and he couldn't figure out why, so he literally told me I was preventing myself from getting well for some reason, and needed to change my outlook or I'd never get better.  Fortunately, our current doctor quickly found out why treatment was not working and got us back on the right track.<br>
<br>
Think this is this long enough yet?  /sigh there's really only 2 topics I can talk about in my current state, EQ and FMS...so I do, and do, and do. :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udarkomen42.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DarkOmen42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I had the 15k post on R&R<br>and all I got was this<br>lousy title!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/6/02 5:17:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2562.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Medical Profession today..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Seems awfully greedy to me, perhaps it's a good measure to be &quot;extra special sure&quot; that the tests are done right, but clinics should at least ask the patients if they can afford to have them redone first.

I go in saying i'm sore all over, point out a few points where its worse, and i can get stuck with the diagnosis.<br>
<br>
it's a diagnosis of exclusion.  let me repeat.  it's a diagnosis of exclusion.  according to the own document provided by you:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Muscle biopsy has revealed important morphological changes but no characteristic ones, and other tests (eg serum levels of muscle enzymes, electromyography, exercise testing and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ) have not been helpful. Laboratory tests can be important to rule out conditions that mimic fibromyalgia, such as hypothyroidism, polymyalgia rheumatica, or generalized osteoarthritis<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
if you come in with pain, i'm gonna make sure you don't have cancer.  you don't have hypothyroidism.  you don't have RA, you don't have lupus, you don't have a great # of things that are far more likely to kill you.<br>
<br>
from the website you provided (the first one), <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The American Academy of Rheumatology recommends searching for tender points at eighteen predetermined sites on the body. However, individual pain perception varies greatly.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  in other words, you don't even need those 'criteria points' that are mentioned in the Copenhagen Definition to be considered for FMS.  There is no specificity to those points, only mild sensitivity.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Fallacy #1: It's an illness under debate, and nobody knows if it really exists.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Let me clarify.  It's an illness under debate.  Noone can -prove- that it exists in an individual.  You come to me with pain, you could have it, or you could be completely malingering.  There is no way for me to say.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Fallacy #2: It might be purely psychological.  <br>
Wrong again. As it was recognized by the CDC, AMA, etc. etc. it is a physical disorder, not mental what-so-ever (although it affects the brain as well as every other bodily function).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Absoutely not.  There are many psychosomatic disorders that can completely mimic FMS, and more importantly, it is associated highly with psycological disease such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.  I don't know where you got this from, but you're absolutely wrong.<br>
<br>
I stand by my statement, it might be purely psychological.  The mind controls a lot, and we don't know what controls FMS or CFS.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There are definite physical criteria for diagnosis, as accepted by the above organizations and more, and have been for, again, 10-20 years<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> No there aren't.  There are clues, but i'm sorry, &gt;80% of the patients i've ever seen with it don't even come close to the Copenhagen definition.  not even close.<br>
<br>
Here's your critera, by your widely cited governing medical bodies : <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There may be local tightness or muscle spasm, although active contractions typically cannot be demonstrated by electromyography. Inflammation only occurs with an underlying systemic condition.<br>
<br>
PFS is recognized by the typical pattern of diffuse fibromyalgia and nonrheumatic symptoms (eg, poor sleep, anxiety, fatigue, irritable bowel symptoms), by exclusion of significant contributory or underlying diseases (eg, generalized osteoarthritis, RA, polymyositis, polymyalgia rheumatica, other connective tissue disease), and by exclusion of psychogenic muscle pain and spasm. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I took that right from the Merck Manual, which is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> the </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> textbook of diagnosis.<br>
<br>
It's purely a diagnosis of exclusion.  I don't have to have a single 'tender point' to qualify for FM, it just helps.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Many had heard of it in passing or through literature (although it was shocking how many doctors I went to that read no medical literature whatsoever besides what the pharmaceutical companies sent), but of those the vast majority had a totally wrong impression of what it was and couldn't begin to tell you how to diagnose it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  That's because, there is no way to diagnose it.  You put the label on when nothing else fits, and the clinical picture of FM sounds appropriate.  There are no inclusion or exclusion criteria for FM.  Please, if you find some that say 'this is required for the disease' aside from generalized pain, show me.  Cuz i can't find it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Fallacy #7: Adjani can count.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Nothing wrong with unorthodox counting <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> and the conclusions were that around 5% of the *total* population have the gene.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> ERrr gene?  Which gene is that?  There have been no genes found as of yet.  Suggestive of a genetic disorder, but i haven't heard of an isolated FM gene.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Fallacy #9: Guys don't get it.<br>
<br>
It's true that the majority of peeps diagnosed with FMS are women, but guys definitely do get it too.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> To be specific, 85% of FM affected people are female.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Yes, I found out that it's standard. :P Whether it's necessary or not...I'm still not convinced. Seems awfully greedy to me<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> In canada, we dont' charge for tests, and we still do it.  It's not greed that motivates retesting.  As to the financial problems of the American patient, I'm not touching that one today <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> They were just running some standard tests, and this particular one required an inordinate amount of blood to be taken from him for analysis.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> How much is inordinate? And what tests? blood tests?  you'd have to take 20 or so vials to do anything remotely damaging.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What studies? The ones that say chronic pain is all in the head and patients just make it up? Because that's what I was told by several doctors.  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> No, the studies that talk about a condition with so many vague symptoms, 0 diagnostic signs, and a strong tendency to occur in females.  No study i've read has convinced me of anything remotely diagnostic for FM.  We had a week of lectures where patients with CFS, FM, etc woudl come in and talk to us.  And we still had no clue about the disease.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If it is, it's interesting that I denied forcefully that I was sick until I was so sick I could not get out of bed. Also interesting that the shrink I saw for a year and all the meds he put me on did nothing. Also interesting that I exhibit so many visible physical symptoms.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> There are many cases of visibly and physically displayable disease that are completely psychological.  There are many people who despite having psychological illness continue to deny they have it.  And there are many people who are completely resistant to psychiatric medications.  Nothing you said would refute a psychiatric diagnosis for pain syndromes.  <br>
<br>
Just because something is psychiatric doesn't mean you're making it up or it's not real.  Schizophrenia is real, and it's purely in the head.  Depression is real, and there is no physical sign for it.  Etc etc.  Only a few old stodgy doctors would say FM isn't real... and just don't go to those ones.<br>
<br>
Any rheumatologist would be more than versed in FM.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> He also yelled at me for helping nascens out with some answers, as my memory was better than his at the time...said I was &quot;obviously controlling him and his problem was that he let me and his mother run his life.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  Well were you? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   heehee as a medical interviewer i will say that when you take a history, you want it from the patient.  Often times patients SO's, moms, dads, daughters will pipe in, but i don't want to know them.  I want to know the patient.  Often I'll ask the person to leave, then after talk to them.  I'm certainly not accusing you of anything, but i know that some doctors find it frustrating, already being frustrated with chronic pain issues.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If that's the case, we have a ton of potential lawsuits on our hands. All the tests that were repeated had shown nothing before, and showed nothing again. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> If they missed something like a cancer or a brain/MS type picture, they would be highly negligent.  I'd retest anyone presenting to me with a complicated case like you're describing.  To not is malpractice.  Labs are wrong.  CTs are wrong.  MRIs are wrong.  IT happens all the time.  I treated a patient whos potassium was 7.1 (kinda high), but before i administered the kayexelate (Really nasty stuff) i rechecked, turns out lab error it was 3.5.  Coulda made him actually low.  Lucky there.<br>
<br>
I'll make one more point, one that i don't think the patients with chronic disease understand.<br>
<br>
We get a -lot- of patients who use us to treat their drug addiction, get them off work, send them home from jail, etc etc.  So much so we develop a natural skepticism.  I hope you appreciate this the next time a doctor is hesitant to give pain meds, etc etc.  It's frustrating, especially with something like FMS/CFS that can be completely faked by a patient.  As a doctor you don't want to assume everyone is faking, but you want to start off treating them that way.  Again, malpractice if you didn't.<br>

<br>
There are actually &quot;lumps&quot; that can be felt there too...deposits of phosphates, as theorized by Dr. St. Amand.  Everyone has a different pain threshold so not all will find them as painful, but the lumps will always be there.  At times the swelling is worse than others, and they are quite large.  I have at least two that are visible with the eye as well as being able to feel them.  But you're right, sometimes poking the points doesn't &quot;hurt,&quot; and so cases can slip through the cracks that way.  But if you do have the lumps and pain at the specific points...chances are very high you have FMS.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Noone can -prove- that it exists in an individual. You come to me with pain, you could have it, or you could be completely malingering. There is no way for me to say.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Go read St. Amand's research...he has done physical tests that have shown results in line with his theories.  Also, as I said, I have several visible symptoms.  Some are quite gross, so I'd rather not go into them here :P, but one is rash like bumps all over my arms, legs, and shoulders.  There are others, if you want to know them I can email you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I stand by my statement, it might be purely psychological.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Do you have evidence of that?  Because I have evidence that it is not, and a heck of a lot of it.  Little infuriates me more than to be told this is &quot;all in my head,&quot; as I'm sure you can imagine.  The only doctors that told me it was psychological were also the ones who could not tell me the first thing about its symptoms and how to diagnose it.<br>
<br>
I have never, in all my reading, seen the ties between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and fibromyalgia.  I have, however, seen the statistics on how often fibromyalgia is misdiagnosed as something else *first* and then later diagnosed as fibromyalgia.  Lots of correlations have been drawn between it and other illnesses simply because of this high incidence of misdiagnoses.  Depression...duh.  Every chronic illness has depression associated with it.  I had my entire life taken away from me and I went from being an overachiever to an invalid.  I'm supposed to be cheerful about it?  Especially when I'm being told that I'm really just making all of it up?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There are clues, but i'm sorry, &gt;80% of the patients i've ever seen with it don't even come close to the Copenhagen definition. not even close.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
How do you know?  Did you watch an experienced FMS doctor poke them?  If this definition weren't used to diagnose them, how were they diagnosed anyhow?  Did the doctor just say...well they don't have anything else, must be fibromyalgia?  If that's the case, perhaps something else *was* overlooked and they don't really have it anyhow.  There are a lot of illnesses that emulate FMS (or a lot of illnesses FMS emulates, however you want to look at it), but none that I have heard of that emulate the exact trigger points of the copenhagen definition.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I took that right from the Merck Manual, which is  the  textbook of diagnosis.<br>

<br>
If you go by what's written in your textbook, perhaps.  I'd rather go by the latest research personally, and so would every fibromyalgia specialist I have seen or talked to (admittedly a limited number, but significant that they *all* use this definition for diagnosis).  This isn't something I found and decided to put here to validate myself...this is what is *used* in the field every day.<br>
<br>
I'm sure it's a good thing that you have faith in what is written in your textbooks, but honestly I have found that the &quot;textbook doctors&quot; have been the least help to me.  If it doesn't fit the textbook exactly, they won't do it, or you must be making it up.  It's fine for diagnosing strep throat, or the flu, or whatever...but relatively new and &quot;debated&quot; illnesses, I'd take an open minded well-researched doctor over a valedictorian textbook doctor any day.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  ERrr gene? Which gene is that? There have been no genes found as of yet. Suggestive of a genetic disorder, but i haven't heard of an isolated FM gene.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Read the research and studies on the link above...no gene has been isolated, but almost all research shows strong inheritance in the disorder.  My dad has symptoms, my cousin on his side has it, I have it.  Nascens' mother has it (bad), his uncle has symptoms, his brother had it.  Dr. St. Amand's theory, a very interesting one, is that it is a genetic kidney disfunction, and he does have some tests and studies that support the theory.  Not the least of which is that the disease parallels gout very closely, and responds to gout treatment.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  To be specific, 85% of FM affected people are female.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well...85% of FM affected people *as diagnosed by whatever criteria the specific doctor is using,* and according to that particular study are female.  I have no idea what the real percentage is, but I do know that there's a higher suspected percentage of male victims than that -- but doctors are hesitant to diagnose males with it, and males are hesitant to seek diagnosis because of the stigma as purely a female disorder.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  In canada, we dont' charge for tests, and we still do it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In america, many hospitals have been warned or cited for recommending and conducting expensive tests that were not really necessary. :P  LIke the &quot;machine that goes bling&quot; in the miracle of life. :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  How much is inordinate? And what tests? blood tests? you'd have to take 20 or so vials to do anything remotely damaging.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
We can't remember exactly how much, but I know that they did warn him that it was going to be an awful lot, for a lot of tests.  He warned them that he had to lie down or he would pass out, and they did it with him sitting up anyways.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We had a week of lectures where patients with CFS, FM, etc woudl come in and talk to us.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A week?  Wow that's a lot more than most doctors I talked to said they got on it in med school...oh yeah, you're in Canada.  Anyhow...there are very many varying symptoms to the disorder, but there's a pretty comprehensive list of about 50 of them.  The many, many other FMS patients I have talked to never had exactly the same case, but they generally had at least 25 or more of the symptoms.  I have about 35 of them, and yes some of them are visible and observable by doctors.  I have found that if you are familiar with the list of symptoms, and the &quot;patterns&quot; they tend to go in (i.e. I had terrible back pain, and that also went along with my nasty calf cramps...I had really bad frontal headaches, and that went along with reactive hypoglycemia...etc.), you have a pretty good idea what the disorder is.  But then of course there's the whole other areas of diagnosing and treating it...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  There are many cases of visibly and physically displayable disease that are completely psychological<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm not a doctor, but I wasn't aware you can *make* rash like bumps appear all over your body?  Or make painful lumpy deposits form in particular places (the same places as other FMS patients) on your body?  Or make your face become puffy, break out, and your hair fall out?  Or make your joints swell?  Or make your urine stink (much more so than usual), become cloudy, and often have very high levels of phosphoric acid (yeah I know you can probably do that by eating certain things, but assuming your diet is constant)?<br>
<br>
Well, perhaps not *make* all that happen, but I was not aware a psychological illness could make any of that happen either.  It can do a lot of things that have (visibly) happened to me...like raise stomach acid levels, cause the shaking and anxiety attacks I often get, perhaps even cause the twitching and muscle spasms.  But all the above stuff?  Just seems incredible to me that they could be attributed by *anyone* to psychological causes.  And those are not even remotely rare symptoms of FMS.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Schizophrenia is real, and it's purely in the head.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Schizophrenia doesn't cause those kinds of physical symptoms.  Heck, nothing mental short of what happened in &quot;the exorcist&quot; could, that I have heard of. :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Any rheumatologist would be more than versed in FM.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Making that assumption almost caused us to rule out FMS for nascens (and me) altogether.  We saw a rheumatologist at mayo clinic specifically for the purpose of seeing if he had fibromyalgia.  He said &quot;well I don't know why they sent you to me, since I don't know much about it, but I know it's mainly joint pain and since you don't have joint pain I'm positive we can rule that out.&quot;  His report actually never even made it into our final report or his medical records, though we were charged for the session.  Fortunately we didn't believe him totally, and picked up a brochure on fibromyalgia anyhow.  The brochure -- outside his office -- had a ton more info on fibromyalgia than he seemed to know.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm certainly not accusing you of anything, but i know that some doctors find it frustrating, already being frustrated with chronic pain issues.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well...what's more frustrating?  Getting an &quot;I don't know, I don't really remember&quot; to every question you ask, or getting the answer from those who have been around the patient constantly?  That was my reasoning, and there were times when nascens couldn't answer any of his questions due to memory problems.  We wanted to know what he had, we didn't want the doctor's opinion of our personal lives based on a 15 minute interview.<br>
<br>
Also, Nascens' issues were not actually chronic pain, he had many other symptoms but his pain threshold is very high, so pain was a very minor concern for him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> To not is malpractice. Labs are wrong. CTs are wrong. MRIs are wrong. IT happens all the time.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The place where he had the tests done originally was UAB, one of the most respected test centers/medical schools in the south (whether I actually respect them...well, that's another story).  If they are wrong so often, why not schedule 10 tests in a row, just to be sure nothing is missed?  How can you trust just one test no matter where it is?  Could I sue them for malpractice if they only tested me once and it turned out negative, but I really had cancer or something?  /shrug I just don't see where you draw the line at what you trust and what you don't, and maybe the patient should sign a waiver saying that just the previous tests are fine, or just one test is fine, or that he/she requires 100 tests to be absolutely certain.<br>

Sure, if you turn up *positive* for something you should retest before administering potentially dangerous medications or surgery, nobody would dispute that.<br>

<br>
Yes, that's very true, and I have faced just such skepticism during the time I had to be on narcotic pain meds just to sleep.  THANK GOD this treatment has &quot;cured&quot; my back pain, so that I am off all pain medications whatsoever, and don't have to put up with the &quot;well why should I give you pain medicine for your back when the x-rays show nothing.  I think you're an addict, and you'll just have to use ibuprofen instead&quot; anymore.  I know doctors have to be very careful, but damn...I have met so many where you come in guilty until proven innocent, unless you have an x-ray or blood test showing something.  They really could at least treat people better until they prove they are a drug addict or are &quot;faking it.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> especially with something like FMS/CFS that can be completely faked by a patient.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, I think there are enough physical symptoms in the average case to observe that it is not being faked.  I'm not saying there are not those out there who fake it and manage to convince doctors, but if you know enough and are observant I think it's easy enough to tell the difference. <p><center><a href="http://www.theroyalknights.org" alt="Adjani Tristesse, Saucy Kitty of TRK"><img src="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/adjsig14.jpg"></a>

Dr. St. Amand has provided no evidence to back up his claims, and while his evidence is very anecdotal and compelling, he has not one iota of data supporting his claims.  <br>
<br>
I know it worked for you, and you're gonna tell me that's enough for you, and truly, it is.  However, if you think everyone with FMS has the extremely broad definition Dr. St. Amand gives FMS, well duh.  He throws every symptom out there.<br>
<br>
#2 - we know depression is related to FM.  you, emotionally, associate this as 'well duh FM causes depression'.  But we just know a relationship exists, it could work in the reverse.<br>
<br>
#3 - Dr. St. Amand is a moneymaker, and hasn't provided any data to back up his claims.  In fact, studies have shown his treatment to be less effective than sugar pill (placebo).  He of course released an entire book to refute this, making him more money.  I always doubt people who do their research, and then refute every other bit of research that is contradictory to theirs.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How do you know? Did you watch an experienced FMS doctor poke them? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I poked them.  Everyone has lumps and bumps.  I can find them on everyone.  We were told about 'deposits' but the FM doctor that presented FM to us said 'certain groups claim there are deposits to be felt, but as you can see there are not'.  and he's a FM doc.  only one in my city.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you go by what's written in your textbook, perhaps. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I go by evidence.   Of all the evidence I've ever seen, none except Dr. Amand (who doesn't make his data available for review, and doesn't do anything double-blind placebo controlled) have presented anything positive like this.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Everyone has a different pain threshold so not all will find them as painful, but the lumps will always be there<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> No always in medicine.  period.<br>

Yet noone else finds high phosphate levels?  Noone else finds these lumps?  Noone else except him... hrmmm...<br>
do you think there is a conspiracy against phoshpate?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> He warned them that he had to lie down or he would pass out, and they did it with him sitting up anyways.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I have an alternate theory to that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm not a doctor, but I wasn't aware you can *make* rash like bumps appear all over your body? Or make painful lumpy deposits form in particular places (the same places as other FMS patients) on your body? Or make your face become puffy, break out, and your hair fall out? Or make your joints swell? Or make your urine stink (much more so than usual), become cloudy, and often have very high levels of phosphoric acid (yeah I know you can probably do that by eating certain things, but assuming your diet is constant)?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> You can't make it often, but your mind can.  They're called somatization disorders, or somatiform disorders, or conversion disorders.  And sweetie, I hate to burst your bubble, but if you think everyone with FM even has -one- of those symptoms, you're way off.   I would guess that population (Based off of the FM patients i have treated and seen) to be around 5-10%. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Schizophrenia doesn't cause those kinds of physical symptoms.

If it did, everyone with FM would have them, and they don't.  Some people with schizophrenia exhibit very odd physical findings, ranging from true blindness to odd rashes.  Again, you're not speaking out of knowledge, but assumption.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But all the above stuff? Just seems incredible to me that they could be attributed by *anyone* to psychological causes. And those are not even remotely rare symptoms of FMS.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> They are very rare symptoms.  Of every medical journal I have read, where symptomatic data was compiled of anyone with generalized pain, those symptoms were either at the bottom or not even on the list.  Except Dr. St. Amand.  hrm.  did you know he has a book tour?  complete with a speaking circuit and book signings!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sure, if you turn up *positive* for something you should retest before administering potentially dangerous medications or surgery, nobody would dispute that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> again you're not speaking from experience or knowledge.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I know doctors have to be very careful, but damn...I have met so many where you come in guilty until proven innocent, unless you have an x-ray or blood test showing something.

I have not seen anyone not receive the full gamut of investigation + treatment.  It's only when other factors are brought to light that more... non-medicinal treatments are approached.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Again, I think there are enough physical symptoms in the average case to observe that it is not being faked.

You take this St. Amand guy as a god, i see no data backing him up.  I see book deals and speaking tours.  I see no evidence from any source but him and his cronies, and I see no correlation in the real-life experience i have.<br>

<br>
Anyway, what I was going to say is, I'll talk about PTC instead of fibromyalgia, because that's the one I've been forced to become an expert on.<br>
<br>
PTC is also an illness of exclusion, let's face facts though <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> many</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> illnesses are. The definitive test is when the potential for a brain tumor has been eliminated (by CAT) then if the patient's cerebral spinal fluid pressure is 100-400% of normal, and there is no indiction of brain infection, then it's PTC by exclusion.<br>
<br>
Now, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> most</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> adults with PTC are women. Reason? Unknown. Men do get it, but it's extremely rare. Most people who do not present with perfect symptomology and characteristics go undiagnosed. Many who do, still go undiagnosed for years.<br>
<br>
Most adults with PTC have been in the system for 1-5 years for chronic, severe head pain. Most have been sent for psych. evals. Why? They're told it's all in their head. <br>
<br>
Most are not finally diagnosed until they have perm. vision loss, but have a history of seeing doctors for the head pain for years prior. I'm an exception to that, I never went to the doctors for the head pain. I always had severe headaches, and frankly thought all women did.<br>
<br>
PTC causes headpain more severe than migraines. Some PTC people also have migraines, they say the PTC headpain hands down is more severe. I've had it so bad I've been vomiting, dizzy and can't see straight. Fun shit.<br>
<br>
The <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> treatment for PTC headpain is narcotics. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NO</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> other medication works. I wish to fuck some other medications did. Migraine medication does not work. Aspirin, does not work. Caffeine does not work. Tylenol, motrin, etc. does not work. Opiates do.<br>
<br>
Now, most doctors apparently do not want to prescribe narcotics for the pain. Most other people I've connected with online who have this, have been refused pain management by their doctors. I haven't had to go through this. I didn't seek treatment for head pain. I had vision loss and so was immediately diagnosed. And from the get-go I've had vicodin for pain management and still have damn near an open 'scipt for it.<br>
<br>
However a majority of people with this are not taken seriously. Their pain is untreated. They're told it's all in their head when an immediate diagnosis cannot be made. They've gone through <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>hell</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->. And eventually end up with perm. vision damage, because they're not properly diagnosed.<br>
<br>
I can understand it. Most doctors have never seen a PTC case. Most doctors I see have never seen it. <br>
<br>
PTC can also be caused by antibiotic reaction, and abuse of vitamins. It can also occur during pregnancy (though if so it almost always resolves immediately after birth) They're more likely to see one of the transition cases. Or a pedatric case. In fact one of the experts we consulted has never seen an adult case, only pedatric cases...which are radically different, and undoubtably have different causation.<br>
<br>
Why does PTC happen? Unknown. Treatments? Only symptomatic treatment. There is no cure. PTC often resolves as mysteriously as it started. I was told it would resolve in 2 years...well it's been over 3 now.<br>
<br>
Do I get pissed about it? Sometimes, but not too often. It's a rare disease, extremely rare. Which is why it can slip through the cracks. And since there are symptomatic treatments, and it doesn't kill people (generally, though I suppose you could die from a burst dura), there's not a ton of research in this area. I can't even argue too much with that. Money for fatal diseases...or just ones that really suck for a few people. Hmmm. <br>
<br>
I am very very fortunate. I have an unbelievably high natural tolerance for pain. I didn't get stuck in the system for headpain. (They still can't believe I never reported the head pain haha prior to severe vision loss). I've never had to fight with a doctor for pain medication. And fortunately I can tolerate most of the pain long enough not to be addicted to the narcotics. Or develop a tolerance. <br>
<br>
However so many people with this haven't had that luxury. Some are legally blind now as a result of going undiagnosed. Many had severe financial or emotional problems as a result of being crippled by the pain and being dumped into psych. because they were told they were malingering...or making it up, or addicts, or it was all in their head, they were nuts.<br>
<br>
Most PTC people I've come into contact with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> hate</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> doctors as a result of this. Some were in the medical profession themselves as nurses or doctors or the spouse of nurses and doctors. One of the worst cases (she's now blind) was a nurse who went through that shit for 3 years until she went blind. Vision loss can occur rapidly if the warning signs aren't caught. That's the biggest risk of PTC. That and suicide due to chronic severe pain.<br>
<br>
Are there people who are junkies who will lie for a fix? Yah. Are there malingering people, hypochrondrics, and Munchausen Syndrome people out there? Yeap.<br>
<br>
Most people though do not fall into those catagories. However it sure as hell seems most doctors want a 'label' they can slap on someone. I'm personally convinced that most cases of PTC are caused by hormonal problems. I'm absolutely convinced mine is related to a hormonal imbalance. And surprisingly some PTC cases are resolved by carrying a pregnancy to term. (This is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the reason we are trying to have children though.) Most have hormonal problems and a history of menstruate cessasion or difficulties. The longest standing case of PTC...40 years. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Anyway, most people won't go through this type of shit, but you can understand why I can completely sympathize with Adjani. Hell, it wasn't 50 years ago when the parents of schizophrenics were told it was due to shitty parenting. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  When Alzheimer's disease was simply either senility or undiagnosed or misdiagnosed dementia. <br>
<br>
There's quite a bit that's still undetermined by medical science. Even some shit that is, such as PTC, they have no idea of the causes, and therefore haven't a clue on a 'cure'.<br>
<br>
And because so many doctors seem to want to quickly label their 'mystery' cases, if they can't find the cause, then they'll label it psych. or malingering, or whatever else they can pretty much blame on the patient for not being so good as to present their symptoms a little better.  <br>
<br>
Am I damning the medical system? No, I'm actually not. I'm saying it's imperfect. Unfortunately the casualities of that are people. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I'm sorry you had so many bad experiences with doctors, but it seems to me, most of them chose NOT to work with you, instead probably trying to get you out of their office in an expedient manner.  The onus of responsibility lies with the patient - choose your doctors carefully.  That I can agree with you 100%, since I personally see bad doctors around me every day.  Word of caution - some of the most &quot;charming&quot; doctors are the biggest idiots, while some doctors who are crude and vulgar are clinical geniuses.  I'll give you one guess which doctor is more popular with patients and has a busier practice.<br>
<br>
Also realize in this day and age, most doctors are fed up with the system.  You mentioned that you pay doctors for their services.  I defy anyone to tell me the last time they wrote out a check for a doctor.  In truth, you pay an insurance company, or a hospital, for health care.  Most doctors today work for a flat fee, a gauranteed salary.  If they see 10 patients a day or 100 patients, they get paid the same.  Unfortunately, for some doctors this means they have less commitment to a patient, since even if you left, another patient would be right around the corner to fill your spot.<br>
<br>
This is the same reason I laugh when people say surgeons try and operate needlessly for money.  Most surgeons get paid the same whether they operate once a week or 20 times a week - see above.  Every time you operate on someone, there is a chance something will go amok and then you just rewarded yourself with a lifetime of headaches, and open yourself up to liability - who needs that?  So nowadays you will see more surgeons seeking ways NOT to operate rather than operate - isn't socialism a great thing?<br>
<br>
One of my old professors told me that &quot;whenever you want to operate on someone, find out all you can about them, and then decide if this is someone you would want to marry...because once you operate them, they are yours for life.&quot;  I think patients need to apply this same adage when they choose a doctor.  <br>
<br>
Also remember a doctor can only see so many patients in one day, can only operate on &quot;x&quot; number of patients a week.....so why would a doctor ever want to fill their office with difficult, noncooperative, unappreciative, or demanding patients?  In reality, doctors tend to cherry-pick patients as much as patients select doctors, as much as their specialty allows.<br>

And yeah, I completely agree with you on the bedside manner thing. It's amazing the number of complaints the medical board gets each year on bedside manner issues. (No, it's not actionable. Because you felt a doctor was rude doesn't make it actionable against their license to practice medicine.

I have. I've paid directly for medical services. Not everyone has fantastic insurance, though I have for most of my life. During the period I didn't, I paid my money for visits directly to the doctor. Most insurance companies do not pay for psychatric care, especially basic therapy. Many people pay completely out of pocket for that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Currently our insurance is with an HMO. Which means that we have co-payments, and no, they're not directly to the doctors. However we pay to be in the HMO, and the doctors choose to work there. Yes, they're working for me, I pay a fee for their services, both to be in the insurance groups and co-payments. Regardless of whether someone's insurance is covering it, or they are, they're still paying the doctors for the services. Yes, the insurance system sucks. I won't even attempt to argue that, there are massive problems. But in many ways that's another issue. None of my problems I outlined were insurance related.<br>

Yeap. HMO's lose money for treating patients. Most hospitals that accept reg. insurance make more money for more treatment.

As to all the rest, yes it is just as much on the patients to be an active part of their health care. And all too many are not.<br>
