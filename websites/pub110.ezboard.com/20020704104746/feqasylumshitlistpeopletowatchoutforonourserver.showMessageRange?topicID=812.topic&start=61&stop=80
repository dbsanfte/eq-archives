       Why be so mean about people's English ?  What Bite you today ?  Some of US are not from either the United states or England.  Some of us have learned English as a 2nd or 3rd language... and also some of us write better english than the people from the areas that should know better.  English is my 3rd language by the way, and I know I make mistakes...  but Who the fuck died and named you a Judge of other's grammar.  Good job in sounding like a jack ass.   Is that how you were raised ?  to Harp on people that don't have your lvl of knowledge ?  Think of the crap you wrote, and think BEFORE you write shit.<br>
<br>
[Edit]  My 2nd sentence came out all wrong.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I wrote &quot;White&quot; instead of &quot;What&quot;, and that was not my intention.  My 3 kids are half black, and dealing with Racism on continual bases I wouldn't go out of my way to do such a thing... even though that looked I did.  I'm sorry for whom-ever got insulted. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udiako.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diako</A> at: 5/6/02 10:44:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ulennybruce.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenny Bruce</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/6/02 5:33:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=812.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lugorr Level 52 Warrior</span><hr size=1> korrso=felix unger<br>

Quote "White Bite you today?"<br>
<br>
Nice racial slam..<br>
<br>
BTW, based on your post, how are you being any different?<br>
<br>
I wonder how you would have reacted if I posted so inanely in your native language, on native language boards of your own.<br>
<br>
Before pointing out the mote in another's eye, make sure there is no beam in thine own.<br>
<br>
I for one am frustrated with the complete degredation of communication skills which are present in the extreme, not only on these boards, but throughout the internet. Personally, I would endeavour to hold true the nuances of another language before I tried to communicate in one, as to show the respect to the other language that is due. The linguistic communications of one culture are historical, as held in high regard by many. Culture dictates such respect.<br>
<br>
I see your use of the vulgate vernacular of English is quite impressive. While I mentioned that it was near impossible for me to make out what the context of his message was, you decided to make, and take, a personal slam, based upon some conditional assumption that this was a racial bias upon which I was making my comments. Way to use the assumptive to show your narrowmindedness! <br>
<br>
Your racially derogative comments far outshine anything in my post. My comment was on grammer. Your's was a slam on race. <br>

<br>
There's no reason to be completely anal about this whole thing.  The poor guy's just trying his best to communicate, when he doesn't have to in the first place.  Why post at all if he'd gonna get kicked in the ass by Korrso the English Nazi who flaunts his insane talents at the foreigners?<br>
<br>
There are places and times for different styles of writing.  A community gaming forum on the internet should be the last place people should care about whether they've followed the grammar handbook verbatem.<br>

<br>
Well let's see here.  These are all quotes of Korrso. Made in that earlier post.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice racial slam..&quot;<br>
<br>
Um, you ass!  You're supposed to use three periods.<br>
<br>
&quot;Before pointing out the mote in another's eye, make sure there is no beam in thine own.&quot;<br>
<br>
'thine' is a relic of Old English.  Welcome to the 20th century, you ass.  Use 'your' like the rest of us, ass.<br>
<br>
&quot;I for one am frustrated witht he complete degredation...&quot;<br>
<br>
'Degredation' is spelled D - E - G - R - A - D - A - T - I - O - N<br>
Learn to spell, you ass.<br>
<br>
&quot;... complete degredation (sp) of communication skills which are present'<br>
<br>
The correct word in this instance is 'that' not 'which' you ass.<br>
<br>
&quot;The linguistic communications of one culture are....&quot;<br>
<br>
I believe you meant 'one's' not 'one' you ass.<br>
<br>
&quot;... communications of one culture are historical, as held in high regard by many.&quot;<br>
<br>
Please correct the word 'as'.  It should be 'and' you ass.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see your use of the vulgate vernacular...&quot;<br>
<br>
Vulgate and vernacular are both nouns, you ass.  In fact, they are nearly synonyms.  Vulgate is NOT an adjective as you tried to use it, you ass.<br>
<br>
&quot;While I mentioned that it was near impossible for me to make out what the context of his message was, you decided to make, and take, a personal slam, based upon some conditional assumption that this was a racial bias upon which I was making my comments.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not even going to touch this one, you ass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Way to use the assumptive to show your narrowmindedness! &quot;<br>
<br>
This is not a sentence.  Please respect the English language, you ass.  Also, the 'assumptive' - not a noun... at least a noun in the normal English language, you ass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your's was a slam on race. &quot;<br>
<br>
The proper word here is 'Yours' not 'Your's' you ass.<br>
<br>
Practice what you preach.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now you see what an ass I sound like saying stuff like this?  Honestly, I don't give a crap about language and how people use it.  I completely agree that all caps, or very poor grammar should be avoided, but we certainly don't have to pretend we're all that when we're not.  Geez... give him a break.<br>
<br>
You mentioned that culture dictates respect.  Well, there are different cultures in the United States too.  If I had written this post using language like 'what up G' or 'homiez', that also would dictate respect, since it is culture as you stated.  But I doubt that you were thinking about that when you posted these lame posts.<br>
<br>
Geez, don't be an ass.  Sure, ask politely if they could be more careful about how they post, maybe come to some kind of solution. <br>
<br>
But these posts you made.... they're just plain stupid.  <br>
<br>

Yes, people from all over the world... I know. Agreed, there is no need to be condescending and still get your point across.<br>
<br>
Point is: We need to be able to understand what you are trying to say. When someone post something totally incoherent it is extremely frustrating regardless of the reason. <br>

Periods are not just a girls best friend. Paragraphs are a wonderful thing as well. I don't think those two things are too much to ask.  <p><center><img src="http://saltyslug.com/nonipw.jpg"></center>

The point of the post by Skidney should not be the poor grammar or spelling.  The point is that Lugorr attempted to cheat the player/character.<br>
<br>
Granted that spelling and grammar issues make some of the posts on this board difficult to read but I have yet to encounter one that was so bad that i could not at least understand the story being told.  That story of good or bad experience with another player/character is the paramount issue in these postings.<br>
<br>
Maybe if we ignore the fact that a person is not a native speaker, or roleplaying a troll/ogre, or sadly less educated than you, then the quality of the post would not be the issue. Hopefully, this would make these listings shorter.  Also, people would be more willing to contribute because they would not fear being targeted for their poor communications skills.<br>

Had a meeting with my Boss yesterday, and the last thing he left with with was this.   When I send an e-mail, to first use Spell Checker, then make sure it's never in the 1st person and Never ever be negative.  And last of alll... make sure my point is made and that I don't write so much that the main point is lost in my e-mail.<br>
<br>
Well, I read SKidney's post...  and even though It wasn't perfect writting, I knew all along what the point was cause I know what this thread is about.  Maybe the fact that I have the same issues with getting to point helped me here.  hehe  Dunno if Skidney is English speaking, but either way.  EQ is a GAME.   And these boards are NOT only for the people that can write perfect english.   It is Anal to put someone down for their English.  Skidney's post belonged here,  The Dukes response was out of plane and plain nasty.   No matter the fact of agreing that lazy english is irritating...   The point is, we're not here to get judge on our writing.<br>

It's not an issue when the author is not a native speaker of the forum's language, and is earnestly trying to communicate an idea.<br>
<br>
It's pathetic when the author simply spews whatever garbage comes to mind.<br>
<br>
It's disgusting when said author has had the benefit of several years of English-based education and is a native speaker. It shows a lack of respect for those who have to sort through the garbage in order to determine the point being made, if there is a point at all. <p><table align="center" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=157617" target="_blank"><img src="http://personal.bellsouth.net/jax/f/j/fjferry/img/ezb-euphemism3.jpg" ALT="Syuni's Personal Signature" border="0"></td></tr></table><CENTER>ShadowKnight of the 33rd Circle, Officer of <A HREF="http://www.nyaaeq.com">NYAA!</A></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/usmeeha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>smeeha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/15/02 12:03:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=812.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &gt; Re: Lugorr Level 52 Warrior</span><hr size=1> Everyone calm down!
