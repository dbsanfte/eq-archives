It's not that I'm new to raids, I've got most of the basics and I am improving on my techniques and abilities every time I join up with some merry band 40+ strong, but I wanted to get a line on some other sources of information on techniques people use to raid.<br>
<br>
The afformentioned thread is here:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showMessage?topicID=2901.topic">pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showMessage?topicID=2901.topic</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Even though it wasn't specificlly about raiding per se, but it had information in it that I just never knew before.  It seems that was an excellent strategy for druid members of a raid force.  Perhaps not the only strategy but seemed like a good one.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I just wanted to know if anyone had links or wanted to share their thoughts on other classes or aspects of raiding.<br>
<br>
For example, I've been thinking about the chat channels available as well as the /hitsmode windows.  Something I've noticed is that raids seem to work much much better when people have a clear and easy way to transmit and recieve information (i.e. the assist call, loot that has dropped, when we're moving, etc . . .).<br>
<br>
I was wondering if it would be efficient to use seperate chat channels for different aspects of the raid.  One in particular is a general chat channel due to the fact that I've seen raidleaders get frustrated when they give an order to the raid force and half don't recieve it cus it's lost in general chat.<br>
<br>
So something like a channel for general, raidorders, loot, assist, and group leaders.<br>
<br>
Also the color settings of said channels could reflect their importance.  Like raidorders could be light purple(the easiest to see in my opinion), assist could be red, group leaders yellow, loot light blue and general green.<br>
<br>
I know it would take a lot of doing to get 30 or more people working like this but has anyone tried this?  Does it work?<br>
<br>
Also hitsmode.  I love those windows personally.  It takes the battle spam out of my regular chat window and I don't have to do anything special to see it.  Just another thing I find helpful.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, if anyone has links to pages describing raid techniques or has info themself to contribute, I'd be very appreciative.  *smiles*<br>
<br>
Thank you all very much.<br>

This post is pretty much common sense, but hopefully you can learn a thing or two.  <br>
<br>
You've got the general idea that cutting down on spam is good, as is clear communication.  When you go on a raid just listen to the raid leader, hopefully he knows what he is doing.  Listen to his instructions and perform them to a T.  If you have a question, ask him or someone knowledgable!  Asking questions is NOT noob, it's how you learn, and it prevents you from killing everyone and really turning up like a dipshit.<br>
<br>
Don't wander around, just stick with the raid and resist the urge to peak around the corner, even though you have FD it can get you guys in trouble.  Don't get aggro either. =)<br>
<br>
Even in a pinch, try to keep your cool, if shit happens it's going to be your job to aid the corpse recovery.  Try to stick the fight out, but if you see that the end is near feign and wait for the dust to settle.  After a raid wipeout there are a couple different ways corpse recovery is going to happen:<br>
<br>
1) Everyone died in a safe spot.<br>
 a) If a cleric has camped out or you have someone there feigned with the ability to res, simply /q out, come back then ask in /gu or the raid channel something like &quot;=== Consent me now for a res, asshats===&quot;.  Then start dragging corpses to a convenient pile for the clerics to start clickin'.<br>
 b) If all the clerics are dead, the necros are dead, and no one has a Staff of Forbidden Rites (Vox res stick), notify people they need to get to the zone and prepare for a summon corpse<br>
<br>
2) Everyone died on top of mobs that aren't going to leave.<br>
 a) If the mobs aren't at their actual spawn spot and they're just being sticky, cordinate yourself with a cleric who is on another character (or a necro, person with res stick), plan to train the mob(s) far away so that he may log in and begin ressing.  Check your aggro for sure before coming back into camp so you don't train everyone.<br>
 b) If you guys died on top of a mobs spawn point you'll have to relocate camp for CR.  Hopefully you have a necro or res stick, if you have a cleric the only way for this to work is if you can train the mobs away and he can move to a safe spot without getting aggro, but this isn't likely.  So get consent, then begin dragging corpses to the safe spot where the necro or whoever is going to res a cleric so he can start clicking.<br>
<br>
3) Simplest scenario, you feigned, some clerics camped (or have necro, res stick) and the mobs eventually path away.  /q out then come back and get consent to drag the corpses to a pile.  Oh one last thing, inform people over /gu or the raidchannel before ressing that once they're ressed not to wander around.  It sounds like common sense, as does the rest of this post, but people sometimes do and gain aggro from nearby baddies.<br>
<br>
4) There are tons of other different variations on the previous situations, but just use that noggin' of yours and adapt, you'll do fine.<br>
<br>
If you plan on going on a raid where there is a good chance you may end up pulling, try to do some research in advance.  You can find maps at eqmaps.com or eqatlas.com.  Ask around or go to the zone ahead of time and see how the mobs path, how they aggro, the best route to get to the named mobs with less hassle.  You'll impress everyone with your well refined pulling technique as well.  Even if you don't get any compliments it's okay, too, people usually take good pulling for granted.<br>
<br>
Be courteous, kind, attentative and just use your head before acting and you'll do great on your raid!  You'll also impress others and surely gain a great reputation that shall allow you to get invited on more prestigious raids in the future.<br>
<br>
And most of all, HAVE FUN, it's not all about loot. <p><TABLE WIDTH=600 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>

<br>
If you plan on making a raid yourself attend it under other people first, you'll want to know all you can before you are putting other people's enjoyment in your own hands.  If you feel like being a studious raider I'd even take notes, make a list of things the raid leaders did right, things they did wrong and what you would like to do different.  I'd do a raid at least 3 or 4 times before leading your own, simply because if something goes wrong it is now ALL on your shoulders.<br>
<br>
Be fair with the loot, don't favor friends or anything because others will remember this and it's not going to reflect upon you well.<br>
<br>
Even though by now you have hopefully done the raid yourself several times, don't assume everyone else on your raid has.  Instruct them precisely as possible, like you would a little child.  Tell them when to follow, when to stay, who to assist, who to ask for buffs etc.  It's really important to let people know where they need to be, otherwise people will be confused and you'll sometimes have small groups (or sometimes the whole raid) wander off and aggro unwanted stuff.<br>
<br>
When you have a nasty pull it's up to you to judge the call if clerics should camp or not, if you do decide to call camp, SPAM it so they all get the message and hopefully one or two can get out.<br>
<br>
Delegate authority if possible, if you have someone else knowledgable there, put them in charge of tasks like debuffing and healing orders as well as cordinating pulls.<br>
<br>
By cordinating pulls I mean that you want to make sure stuff isn't coming when clerics don't have the mana or people aren't buffed.  Don't be afraid to have a &quot;=== mana check ===&quot; after a big fight to see if you should continue pulling or take a break.<br>
<br>
You're going to be really busy, people will be asking you directions often, who to do this, who to that, people will ask you about loot, if their friend can join etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.  The people already on your raid come first, only take the time to make replies if things are calm at the moment.  Put a /afk up once the raid starts, something along the lines of &quot;really busy, I'll answer you when I can&quot; will help people be more understanding.<br>
<br>
I think planning is going to be the biggest thing though, make sure you're going to have the right people, and they and you know what to do ahead of time.<br>
<br>
Well that's all I have off the top of my head Soek, good luck leading your own raids matey! <p><TABLE WIDTH=600 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>

<br>
By giving yourself default rights to an item to justify your time for leading the raid is your decision.  But if this is something you plan on doing, make sure everyone understands fully the loot rules for the items that may be dropping after the kill.   By defaulting some items you may lose some people, but maybe some will stay for other reasons and you can win the fight.  Whatever decision you make, do it knowing you'll have no regrets later on.<br>
<br>
I really don't know what the epic situation is nowadays with Vox/Nagafen and if basically the only way to attain the needed items is by defaulting them to yourself, else you get 20 paladins or something showing up for the book and really slimming your chances.  Because of this I'm going to say it'll have to be your own judgement call, what you feel best about doing.  I know great raid leaders (Gabrielle for example) who lead a vast number of raids before attaining their needed epic piece, but from what I can tell that's always made winning all that much sweeter and fulfilling.<br>

Setting Rampage: <br>
<br>
Every mob in EQ has an Aggro list, pretty much like a ranger or druid track list. On top of it is the one with highest aggro, the one the mob will pick and attack. <br>
<br>
A mob that rampages has another List, which we can call 'Rampage List'. It is basically a Copy of the Aggro list, when the mob does his first Rampage. <br>
<br>
AGGRO LIST: <br>
<br>
- Tank1 <br>
- Tank2 <br>
<br>
RAMPAGE LIST: <br>
<br>
- <br>
- <br>
(no one is on it because the mob didn't rampage a single time yet) <br>
<br>
Then we will send Tank1 and Tank2 in melee, and right at the moment the mob will rampage for the first time, the rampage list will be created. <br>
It should look like this if everyone pays attention and doesn't enter the aggro list (Bard AE song, random group buffs on Tank1 / Tank2, etc) <br>
<br>
AGGRO LIST: <br>
<br>
- Tank1 <br>
- Tank2 <br>
<br>
Rampage List: <br>
<br>
- Storaz <br>
- Teradok <br>
<br>
Once this is done, whatever you will do after, the two persons on top of rampage list will be Storaz and Teradok, untill the mob is blured again, or wipe the raid completely. <br>
<br>
Of course, as soon as we start fithing, more people will enter the mob aggro list (cleric first mostly when the first CH land), chanter Tashing, paladin curing or using lay hands. <br>
<br>
A common aggro list will look like this after 10 seconds of fight: <br>
<br>
AGGRO LIST: <br>
<br>
- Warrior <br>
- Cleric <br>
- Cleric <br>
- Cleric <br>
- Paladin / druid / shaman (backup heals at the start) <br>
- Other melees <br>
<br>
Each time the mob rampages again, he will add these new persons entering the aggro list, to his rampage list. <br>
<br>
In our exemple, versus Arch Lich, it would typically look like this: <br>
<br>
AGGRO LIST after <br>
10 seconds of fight <br>
with arch lich: <br>
<br>
- *Tank1* <br>
- Cleric1 <br>
- Cleric2 <br>
- Curse Remover1 <br>
- Curse Remover2 <br>
- Curse Remover3 <br>
- *Tank2* <br>
- Other melees <br>
who joined the <br>
fight and pressed <br>
auto-attack <br>
<br>
Rampage list: <br>
<br>
- *Tank1* <br>
- *Tank2* <br>
- Cleric1 <br>
- Cleric2 <br>
- Curse Remover1 <br>
- Curse Remover2 <br>
- Curse Remover3 <br>
- Other melees <br>
<br>
Contrary to the Aggro list, the order in rampage list is NOT modifiable, even if you zone, camp out, die, when you will come back in melee range and attack, you will be back at your spot in the rampage list, and be rampaged again if it's your turn. <br>
<br>
Rampage list is 2 Targets at the same time, getting a round of Attack each time the mob rampages. This means only the MT + 1 Warrior will be rampaged whole fight if we do well. And this is much better than before, cause we were thinking rampage was MT + 2 warriors , and it was monopolizing all clerics. Now it will only take 2 clerics to heal rampage actually. <br>
<br>
<br>
- FAQ: <br>
Q: What happens if Tank2 dies, or gets out of melee range? <br>
A: The mob will pick the next person on his rampage list (Cleric1 in this exemple) <br>
<br>
Q: I am on rampage but not supposed to be, what do I do? <br>
A: Run out of the mob's melee range <br>
<br>
Q: But I am a cleric and I will be out of range for CH if I do that. <br>
A: Run out of range anyway and ask someone to replace you asap. You will die if you don't run out of range. You will still be able to do long range heals, heal other people running to camp for a heal, etc <br>
<br>
Q: Would it be possible to send in 3 or 4 warriors for the first rampage proc so a cleric isnt rampaged if one warr dies ? <br>
A: Yes certainly, let's say you want Tank1, Tank2, Tank3, Tank4, Tank5 on rampage list, in this order. All you have to do is have them all shoot arrows before the first rampage. Make Tank1 shoot 100 arrows, Tank2 50, Tank3 25 , Tank4 10, Tank5 1 arrow. And you will have an aggro list in this order once the first rampage happens, and the rampage list will be the same order. <br>
<br>
Q: Or would that make the mob rampage more than just 2 ppl ? <br>
A: No, it would still be Two targets max. <br>
<br>
Will add more to the FAQ if anyone has more questions. <br>
Hope it helps, that way we will be quicker at setting rampage if everyone is careful with aggro. <br>

CH-lines <br>
CH Line basics: <br>
Type 1: <br>
a bunch of 6 or 8 Clerics, 3(4)main, 3(4)backup <br>
all 6 or 8 Clerics heal down the MT line: MT1, MT2, MT3 etc. <br>
(i.e. Cleric1(Cleric4), Cleric2(Cleric5), Cleric3(Cleric6)) <br>
<br>
Type 2: <br>
a bunch of 6 or 8 Clerics, 3(4)main, 3(4)main <br>
each 3(4) Clerics heal 1 MT. <br>
(i.e. Cleric1, Cleric2, Cleric3 - grouped with MT1 and MT2 <br>
Cleric4, Cleric5, Cleric6 - grouped with MT2 and MT4) <br>
<br>
Type 3: <br>
all Clerics involved except 1/ 2 backups <br>
~7 Clerics form one big CH line and heal down the MT list. <br>
<br>
Make hotkeys like this for pause. <br>
<br>
Hotkey Name - CH-Line <br>
Line1- ## CH INC to - %t ## <br>
Line2- /cast 1 (or whatever your CH spell is) <br>
Line3- /pause ## (use pause for MOB and status below) <br>
Line4- ## NEXT CLERIC - Cleric2 ## <br>
<br>
Cast your hotkey when NEXT CLERIC has your name. This way you retain a rotation of heals on a set pause. <br>

Snare Glands Aggro Trick- <br>
<br>
Snare Glands are available form the Caller Quest in FG. All you need is 2 minimum. <br>
<br>
This is the fastest way to gain quick aggro on an MT switch or such w/o AE Taunt. Burn as many charges as you want untill you get solid aggro. <br>
<br>
once its empty you can RECHARGE it. Goto a vendor with 1 empty gland and 1 full one. Sell the Empty one to vendor (make sure he has space). Then sell him the full one. You can then buy both back with full charges. You should farm 10-20 of them and use for big fights if aggro control on MT switch is a problem. <br>
<br>
___________________________________________ <br>
<br>
Shammy Torpor + Mages chain summoning rods/using them = endless mana for Clerics + Wizards. Sure its known, but just a fact. <br>
<br>
<br>
Few Strategies: <br>
<br>
Arch Lich – <br>
<br>
Get everyone in right side of room behind the pillar. Set CH line for MT, and group the RP (Rampage) tank with 2-3 clerics. Fully buff the tanks, and mem blur AL till he has no target. Set RP with the tactic above; have MT shoot 30-40 arrows, have RP tank shoot 10. Have both run in at once, until AL does a Rampage. Then back up out of range again. If a tank dies doing this, you have to mem blur and set RP again. Let MT shoot more arrows so that he is on top of AL agro list (just “/assist Arch” to check). <br>
<br>
Now where you position your clerics depends on who your better players are. You can keep clerics much safer BEHIND the pillar, out of RP range, and they can CH from there. However, AL knockbacks and CH will be OOR, and the tank will die. Which leads to a bit of chaos. This is best situation if you have good tanks. <br>
<br>
Tanks (MT and RP) should have DMF to help stop the knockbacks effect some. They should line up looking exactly straight at the other wall so their back is facing the alter. Then back into the alter and look almost directly up. This will prevent them from being knockbacked out of range of CH’s from the pillar. If your tanks suck and you can’t get this to work, just move the clerics to the wall next to the ramp. The downside to this is if RP tank dies, Cleric will be in RP range and be killed instantaneously. <br>
<br>
If RP tank dies have EVERYONE back out of range (down the ramp). Drag the RP tank, ress and rebuff him. Send him in and keep him alive a few seconds then send everyone else back in. If you don’t do this, you’ll lose half your melee’s to RP before you wipe. This can be done with 35-40. You shouldn’t have a single death if you follow this exactly. <br>
<br>
High Priest – <br>
<br>
Start at jail room. Pull the next room clear of Golems and Chapel Guards. The HP’s room consists of 4 Bloodpirests, 4 Zels, Bunch of Disciples (number slips my mind, 8 I think). You want to pull the Bloodpriests and Zels INTO the Jail room. The HP fight becomes a 2 part raid now. 2 groups of agro controllers, and everyone else for the HP. <br>
<br>
Aggro Control Groups (2): <br>
<br>
-2 Chanters will keep the 4 Zels MESSED in the Jail room. <br>
-4 Tanks (hybrids work fine) will TANK the Priests in Jail room entire fight <br>
-Keep 2 clerics in Jail room to heal add tankers. <br>
-Keep 1 magi in Jail room to chain summon rods <br>
-Keep 1 Shammy in Jail room to slow snakes, and Torp Magi so they can chain summon rods. <br>
<br>
HP Force: <br>
<br>
-2-3 Necros/Clerics with NO other tasks will Banish Undead the Disciples the moment they pop, during the HP fight. <br>
-You can run your CH line 2 ways. First way involves getting an SK to build major agro on HP from range so he won’t attack anyone who comes in range. Move a magi on TOP of HP house and CoH the CH line clerics up here. AE will not hit them here. Can’t let RP tank die though, or Cleric will die immediately. Your other option is to find the 20 ft range between CH and HP’s AE. You can also run CH line from in the blood pools. AE won’t hit there. <br>
<br>
Shouldn’t be too difficult. Again, should be no deaths. <br>
<br>
<br>
Cursed – <br>
<br>
You’ll want to pull cursed inside the bottom, right level of the Temple. All the way on the right is a space. To the left of it is an Alter, and another space, then another Alter. Park your clerics/casters in the far right corner. Pull Cursed between the 1st and 2nd Alter. Hold him against wall, with MT’s back facing the first alter and beyond that, your Clerics and Casters. Use your normal N ToV positioning here and stick him to wall between the 2 alters. If he gets pushed back to far, his AE will hit your Casters. If pushed to far forward, MT will be OOR or heals and be stuck up on an alter. This whole fight is positioning. Your MT must have a hotkey set up to CALL the AE charm. Its 24 seconds, so have a hotkey saying “AE IN 10 SECONDS” and one saying “AE DOWN.” When the first hotkey is called, have your melee’s (except MT and RP) run behind the 2nd alter (opposite one that casters are behind), and dodge the AE. Once 2nd hotkey down they can come back out. This next part is crucial to your fight. If AE Charm connects on the MT (DR resist) he will lose ALL agro. You can use AE Taunt, or Snare Gland trick (scroll up) to regain agro. Make sure the other melee’s know to back off if this happens to give ample time for MT to regain agro. Cursed is gimp if done right. <br>
<br>
AoW – <br>
<br>
I’m not sure a strat is even needed anymore for this gimp encounter. Set up on either side of arena, pull whatever is needed (Vindi, Statue, Idol eventually; whatever). Make sure your Tanks are shrinked to minimum size b/c you’ll prolly lose at least a few if this is your 1st attempt. There is a crack in the wall on either side of the arena, that is where your MT will back into to fight him. Once AoW is Inc, have MT shoot an arrow or whatever, then puller FD. AoW is inc to your camp now. Once hes there, give 10-15 seconds for the MT to build agro, while slowly backing the AoW up into the corner. Disc should be used immediately obviously. CH line should begin before its even inc. MT should use AE taunt or Snare gland trick (see above) to make sure he doesn’t agro on the clerics. Once 10-15 seconds have past, have ALL melee’s hitting from back and push him into the corner. Make sure your aware when MT’s disc is down so you can adjust your healing pauses (see CH pause list above). If the MT dies, have the next tank get spammed with DL’s, Chloroblasts, Celest Blast, LoH, whatever. Let him use Def disc and get into corner and have ALL other melee’s stop attacking, until next tank has solid agro. Rinse and repeat until hes dead. This encounter is a joke. <br>
<br>
Emp Info – <br>
<br>
Tormentors and Slayers ARE messable. Malignants are pretty much solo’able by a hybrid when slowed. There is a 10 minute timer between when Blood dies and when Emp spawns. Everything is for all intensive purposes insta-respawn. Just keep the 4 messed and the last 4 tanked IN one of the front halls (so not in Emperor LoS when he pops). Emperor is slowable with the SoL Shammy Disease-based slow (25%). Won’t give full spoiler. Just some basic infoz for 1st time. <br>
<br>
Lucid Shards – <br>
<br>
Maidens Eye: Named Gorangas <br>
Dawnshroud Peaks: Random Rockhoppers in cave <br>
Ssrae: Named skeletons in mines (same place ore for bane weaps drop) <br>
