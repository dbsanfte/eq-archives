<br>
and it goes on,,She cant seem to get her story right ,,she was only there a short time and didnt know mob was up but made a rude gesture to him right before hand in,,, was only there to sell and camp out but then says ~'that means I went there to wait for the respawn'~. She did this with intent and cannot even keep her own lies straight. Beware her,,,her little stunt cost me 5k pp and alot of my heart,,,i don't even know if i have it in me to try again, i know financially i can't ~and no i dont want your money, twas my responsability I'm just stating fact.~<br>
<br>
I do want to thank you for coming out to help me rescue my raid,,,i had /gu off i don't even know how it happened. I appreciate it all very much because of you i was able to see all rezzed ~unless im mistaken~. I want to thank all my friends who showed at a moments notice,,, many of you know i had to start this epic over once before. Seeing you all there made me smile.<br>
<br>
To Many Names to Name ~hugs them all ~ I Thank You. I think i'll take a break tomarrow, saturday as well except Laeils attempt. I'm just heartbroken right now. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.auction.2y.net/user/lanearas/Rhyannon55.jpg" ALIGN=MIDDLE>

Rhy I understand how upset you are over this issue at hand, believe me when I say I feel for you I did the enchanter epic twice (not just one step either). However we do not allow others to come onto the boards and post such things about Avvi members, nor will I stand by and watch Avvi members do it. You have a great guild behind you who can take down Fay any time, walk away the better person, and refrain from such comments.<br>
<br>
Thank you <br>

After the initial wipeout, two Avvi groups dropped what they were doing and came out to try to whack Fay before he despawned, Laeil, in an effort to keep the despawn from happening, kited the dragon around, dying twice more to give the team the time needed to make the attempt.  Unfortunately, agro was lost and the dragon killed those trying to rez folks back in to continue the fight.  In the end, we ended up summoning to Chess island.  Regardless, Rhy and I are deeply moved by the unexpected response last night, something we certainly never would have imagined.  Seeing such actions make me proud to wear the Avvisione tag over my head, even if I am still a recruit.<br>
<br>

         I can certainly understand you being very upset, it is hard to fathom  the actions of the individual in question. You will have your epic soon, the chances of someone being there to muck it up again I would like to believe are slim.  Hopefully on the next attempt I will be able to come help. Don't let this person ruin your fun here.   {{{{{{hugs Rhy}}}}} <p><img border="0"

<br>
I offer my sincerest apologies about what happened the previous night and would like to clear up some confusions.<br>
<br>
I realized that the *trigger* mob was up, but had no idea Fay was up.  I'm not exactly sure if you had already triggered the mob, or if that happened when I went to the merchant.<br>
<br>
When I did a /w to see who was in the zone, I saw many small groups from several guilds, including yours.    When I got to the fay area, I saw many different guilds there and assumed a dispute about the spawn, not a joint raid.  This is my fault, but I hope you can understand the assumption.  <br>
<br>
I did make a rude gesture at the mob -- because he is never up for me.  Then I left to go sell stuff at the merchant and camp.  Fay aggroed me while I was in the inn and my first thought was I had aggroed the merchant.  I ran down the ramp and then was hit by fay's aoe lava and realized what had happened.  <br>
<br>
I am *extremely* upset about what has happened, and upset at myself for handling it so poorly.  I did tell your guild mate bartimista (spelling, sorry) that I would use my turn in piece so that you would not have to get the frog piece again.  That offer is still there.  In addition, if there is ANY other way that I can make up this mistake (doing pickups for the raid, anything) please let me know. <br>
<br>
I really want to stress, this was an honest mistake, where no one was at fault.  I didn't realize the raid was taking place, or I wouldn't have gone in, and you didn't know I was at the merchant.  All I wanted to do was camp there so that when the weekend hit I could check the trigger mob more easily.<br>
<br>
Rhyannon -- I am truly sorry to have wasted your time with the unfortunate corpse run, lost trigger item.  I am also sorry that I was not more respectful and polite.  <br>
<br>
I did not lie at any point in time.<br>
<br>
I would NEVER deliberatly sabatoge a raid.  I read your story earlier today about your troubles getting fay.  I am truly sorry, and again anything I can do to help rectify the situation, please tell me.<br>
<br>
I don't know what else to say, except that I am sorry, sorry that this mix up happened, sorry that I reacted in an innapropriate manner, and sorry that I dragged my guild into this.  If you can think of anything for me to do to rectify the situation, or something I can do that you feel is a fair exchange, tell me, and I will do it.  Again, if Rhyannon will take it, I will donate my trigger mob piece so she does not have to camp the frog at all.  I will also be happy to bring any people needed for the fay raid, zone out while it takes place, and zone back in for helping people leave, as well as refunding the money spent on coffins.  I know thats probably not enough for you, considering the corpse run that you went through, but like I said, I want to make up for what happened, so if you think of something, let me know.  <br>
<br>
<br>
My Humblest apologies<br>
for being rude,<br>
for messing up your raid,<br>
<br>
Llilli<br>
<br>

<br>
Thank you all for the words of encouragement and hugs, and hiya Bremmy you big teddy bear!<br>
<br>
No i don't have to start the epic all over,,,my gosh if druids ran that risk i think we have minimum 10 groups there JIC!! When she Llilli said all i needed to do was recamp Ululmp and get the froglock essance i felt paniced . I had heard that you get the essance returned and indeed i after i got my gear back i do have the essance back. So no i do not have to recamp the Frog ~thanks the good spirits, ill post how my frog camp went sometime so you can all laugh~<br>
<br>
Cam,,,my responability thus lies here. Many ppl offered thier time and services to help me, this in and of itself it quite alot. I know that there is no loot mobs to help compensate clerics and mages for componet use and i would never expect them to defray costs. Also you all come to my aid at a moments notice and died, some on my raid ~Cringes Laeil~ died 3 times to help, you all deserve to be rezzed and taken care of. It may sound odd, foolish to some even but i do try to conduct myself within a certain code of honor inside this game as well as RL. I owed everyone here no less then what i gave and far more then i am capable of. Of course my husband would call and remind me just now of how many times we've dropped everything ran to anothers aide. I do see where you are coming from Cam as i sit here and reflect. I hope i didn't seem to come off ungrateful for the help and i welcome you offers of support.<br>
<br>
~smiles somewhat~ and the comment that they arent real pp. ~Giggles~ IRL now i have taken to calling money ~coin~. And hun if they were real i would take a loan from my ingame bank, ~i have more pp in a game then irl~ fly to tahatti, sit topless on a beach of white sands sipping a cold drink while Lan proceeded to...Well,, erm,, coughs,, brightens...Fan me with a palm frond...yes that it.<br>
<br>
Thank you all again, I'll see you in the other world.<br>
<br>
O and i thought i'd copy and paste my froggie episode so you all could laugh...Copied and pasted from post from ToD boards.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
~bounces joyously~ ok the froggie went down,,,err not quite like i envisioned ~gather 2 groups, kill frog, loot essance~ not ~grab frog, kite him round zone with the potential kser hot on my heals as well as frog, ping ponging him between myself and Feniin to lose Kser and buy time, see guild is in zone, stand, take loc, die, scream at Lan he typed it wrong, get a hot rez and loot item~ but the end result was i did get the item and Thank You All.<br>
<br>
~rubs her temples~ Lets hope Fay goes a little less chaotic. <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
~chuckles at the last part~ Time for more coffee and a bath!!!<br>

<br>
Llilli it takes allot for you to come to our message board and tell Rhy your sorry. I am sure this was not an attempt to ruin the epic, as it was all a mistake. I have read the log posted by Rhy, serval times, I read your comments on your post. I truly believe you are sorry for what had happen last night. As I will not speak for the rest of my guild on this, but as far as I can see this came out of confusion and anger on both sides.<br>
<br>
1.) I think a tell or a /ooc from you asking if Fay was being spawned atm would have stopped you from going in to sell and camp in the inn.<br>
<br>
2.) I think a /ooc or /shout from the group doing Fay would have stopped you from going in. In BW you shout or ooc for Ixiblat Fer, but see normally in TD you don't have anyone but your raiding party at the hide away to worry about. So there for the call was made in raid channel. <br>
<br>
<br>
Epic spawns are fought allot, The many guild tags could miss lead to it being a contested spawn. but still a tell from either you or the group leader could have prevent this hole mess.<br>
<br>
Good Luck to you Llilli I hope my observation (base on only what was stated in the thread I was not there last night) was right and you did not mean any of this. For it is very sad when players will cause anothers death just to get a time on a spawn.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sindal and Xorraak<br>
<br>
Thank you for coming and expressing your concerns. I know IB does not allow this behavior, as Avvi does not either. I am very happy to see this matter be respond to so quickly. If you need anything just send me a tell in game. I would also like to extend my apologies for some of the comments made towards Llilli in this thread. Remarks such as lier, etc should of been excluded in post's. <br>
<br>
Hope to see you around and maybe next time our meeting on the boards will be better reasons.<br>

<br>
 I have had so many KS my mobs, kill me training mobs to get to camp or spawn and so forth and so on this was just the icing on the cake. It just seemed yet another of these situations.  <br>
<br>
You offer to use the essence is appreciated but not needed as mine was returned to me so i have everything i need to pop Fay again ~i hate that dragon~.<br>
<br>
The offer of helping with compensation for the cost is appreciated and i accept it. Also if you wish to come out to help with Fay you and Iskarian Broods are welcome. I had a multi raid group because i am new in Avvisione and was doing my raid outside of the guild. My husband has rescheduled Fay for Sunday ~yup Tomorrow~ morning at 11 am Eastern ~yup real early, even Mystipul was complaining to me the PR doesn't make her get up that early to raid~. His logic everyone will be sleeping, with hangovers, or of to church so we have a better shot of the dwarf to be up. <br>
<br>
On a note someone asked if i planned to edit my posts, i never do for content, only for spelling or clarification. What i wrote was a reflection of a time and a place and is like a snapshot in a moment in time. I wear my emotions and deeds, ~whether they be good or ill~ for all to see.
