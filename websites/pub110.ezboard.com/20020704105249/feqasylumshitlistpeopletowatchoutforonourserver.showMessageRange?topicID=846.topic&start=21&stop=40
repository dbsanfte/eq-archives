<br>
I am sorry, but I think i will be backed by many people in what I say, but being rude is one thing, yeah, maybe Shoot was out of line, and maybe Hartland should hate him for it, but seriously training a group, that wasn't at fault, with the possibility of them losing exp, over one person saying some crap in shout, that wasn't even offensive, is beyond rude.  Hartland was upset at Shoot saying that Aashna wasn't a Power Ranger, a ficticious childrens hero, or group of heros..  Come on how can you be insulted by that?<br>
<br>
And I have sent an unedited copy of my log to Aashna, and I intend to send one to their guild leader if he will respond to me, so there isn't anything hidden, or something that we are trying to keep secret.  Yes this does not include anything in tells between Shoot and anyone else, but still, opinions are based on perspective, and all i saw was in that log file.<br>
<br>
I mean when Shoot was choking someone in shout, and they were making choking noises in shout, and complaining that he turned their head into a dolphin instead of something else, and sending LOL in ooc over and over, how is that how you paint the picture.<br>
<br>
You, Longfellow, want everyone to believe that the whole zone was shouting at Shoot to STFU, and in reality, all except for Aashna, and Hartland, and one other person who said one thing and didn't say anything else for a long time, people were playing with him, talking back and forth, having a good time.  He spoke of making a Bulldog a chihuahua...  How is that offensive?  he spoke of being a Jedi knight, and someone shouted Patience young Jedi, and they sent about 5 or so shouts back and forth about Jedi and Sith, and having gone to the darkside.  And these are people i don't even know, not in our guild, never heard of them before.  And Aashna said one thing about taking away his shout key, with a Smiley at the end, so Shoot turned her into a ranger...  And said she wasn't a power ranger, and all of a sudden Hartland is coming over, cussing at us, and training us.  yes while Hartland was enroute, Shoot was being a smartass, but who wouldn't be when a higher level char is coming over to claimedly &quot;kick your ass&quot;?  I mean this is ridiculous to say that Hartland and Aashna, and Derekthom for that matter didn't play with and try to piss off Shoot, as they did, and as a final straw, since it didn't seem to bother Shoot, they started training on us.<br>
<br>
Yes, make this about shoot being an ass all you want, but you know what, being an ass in shout isnt something you see on this list.  It doesn't qualify.  It isn't something that you have to &quot;watch out for&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Training groups, and killing people, now that is something you see here, and that's why Hartland is on here.  read the rules, and look at the other posts, training is shitlistable, because it is something that poses a danger to people in the same zone as hartland.<br>

<br>
   Qini, I also wish it hadnt gone this far but here are the facts, Shoot SL without ANY attempt to solve this outside of Lanys. So this is where it is. Besides I guess this is our only place, concidering Shoot is leader of your guild so who do we take his actions up with. So it gets played out here. <br>
   As for Binnans comments: <br>
   &quot;Aashna seemed to be having fun with it&quot; <br>
why would I /ooc &quot;takes away his hotkey (smiley face)&quot; if I was part of this shout banter ? I found it bothersome not &quot;funny&quot;.<br>
   &quot;she (Aashna) said some rude things&quot; I do not find anything rude about what i said and dont feel others would either. <br>
I will admit in /tell to Shoot I did say that i thought he should grow up and that it was possiably past his bedtime, and do not feel that was &quot;rude&quot;. Just like his comments about me not having a sense of humor and other negative comments were not rude they were comments in tell between him and I. Therefore not forcing the zone to be a part of this.<br>
   And Binnar I understand your wanting to talk to our guild leader and all that, the problem I have with it is your lack of patience. It is the Mothers Day weekend and you expect things to be instant .. is it possiable that our guild leader is outta town or something and that is why there is (in your words) &quot;a seeming lack of interest to resolve this&quot;. Some people have lives outside of EQ and Lanys and may not check there email and boards constantly. And im sure you will hear from the leader, but please, give them time to get your email and such.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udwunkin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwunkin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/12/02 10:07:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland</span><hr size=1> Just goes to show....women are noth'n but trouble.<br>

I dont even see why she should have been mentioned by name. You could have said &quot;some ranger&quot; but you felt you had to personally stick it to her, and spice up your post with attempts at humorous comments and what not. I agree, what Hartland did was wrong, but there was absolutely no reason to drag a person who had a very minimal impact on the situation into this.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Artemecium, stfu and go play Anarchy Online, it seems all you're good for now a days is trolling. Doesnt matter how many guilds she was in. Some of the nicest people I know were in numerous guilds. Doesnt make thier actions anymore questionable than your attitude. <p><img src=http://fcguild.virtualave.net/eq_sigs/eq_sig_amw.jpg><BR>

Personally...   Shit listing someone that trained me, cause me and my buddies were being dicks and spamming in ooc and Shout...  I'd think twice and shut my mouth.  Then again, tha'ts me.  There some things that I wouldn't be proud about, and I wouldn't go and tell others.   &quot;Aye, ya...

So why is all of a sudden shoot a big dick and an asshole jsut because he started something in shout that people were enjoying?<br>
<br>
You can't please all of the people all of the time, I mean you say he is being a dick, Talking about being a Jedi and transforming dogs?  That's being a dick?  Yeah he was loud, but come on, how is that being a dick?<br>
<br>
I have said in my post that Aashna was not at fault here, same as Derekthom.  Maybe I should have not mentioned them, but alas, a little late now, I would have rather it not have come here.<br>
<br>
Aashna, I say these things from talking to your other claimed officers (I say claimed because your website lists them as members, not officers).  Guilds that I have been in have an appointed officer to take the leaders place when ever he is gone to prevent something like this from getting out of hand.  And why would you put a smiley face on something if you weren't having fun with it?<br>
<br>
All I am getting from this message board is that Training is OK by the community of Lanys.  So next time I get pissed at someone then I will train them, and if they get pissed, well, I have my community to back me up right?  NO way, Fuck that, if this is what lanys is turning into then I don't want part of this.  I started on this server because it was a friendly server.  Now if you say anything in Shout you are being a dick and it's ok if you get trained?<br>
<br>
Come on people, Shoot was being loud, he wasn't being a dick, and some people were amused by it.  Hartland trained, plain and simple, and you all are saying it was OK that he did that, because Hartland and Aashna found him to be &quot;bothersome not &quot;funny&quot;.&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now to move forward, I am pushing my guild to have a PR person, someone that hopefully isn't involved and can be used to resolve things before coming here.  Something that should have been done before this, but once again, learning and moving forward.<br>

It's ok to get drunk, and act like a total moron as long as a few people in the zone agree.  What the hell is wrong with the rest of 'em... they can't enjoy some fun ?   I guess all the other people should have a life Right ?  Cause they couldn't enjoy all the Moronic behavior in the zone, cause you felt it was fun ?  Right ?<br>
<br>
Training is wrong, no question about it.  No one on this freaken board is going to deny that (exception of those saying you deserved it for being a dick).  <br>
<br>
How long has your friend(s) been loud and Obnoxious before the training ?  how many have asked all of you to stop, nicely or not.  What was the response ?  Did it change, or were your friend(s) still being loud and Obnoxious ?  There is such a thing as respecting others, and I feel there might have been a lack of that.   Don't mean to sound harsh, but too many take the Shout/Ooc channel and abuse it.  Make you're own &quot;We're Drunk&quot; Chat channel, and invite the people in the zone mind you.  But if you don't leave people alone cause you just feel like fooling around.  Sorry, You're also wrong.<br>

Nothing wrong with a little humor.  It's not humor anymore when people are cussing back at you to stop.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uaashna66.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aashna66</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/13/02 11:19:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hartland</span><hr size=1>   In this post I am going to use some lines, form there log to shed light on the situation from our side. Im sure I will get flamed for the use of them (told I could have alter them and such) but im sure Binnar will forward them to anyone willing to read them. <br>
   We admit our actions were wrong and it should have never progressed this far, we do not as you will read in this SL deny anything.<br>
   However I feel that they are not representing this fairly this is the point I am trying to have understood. <br>
They all claim they wish this hadnt come to this point and they hadnt had to SL. Yet in thier logs never once do they ask about contacting the guild or our leader or anything of that nature. They were quite &quot;happy&quot; to get to shitlist, and never made any attempts to contact anyone before SL Hartland. Yes, Binnar is trying but, Shoot logged immediatly from the game and shitlisted &quot;then&quot; claims he wished he didnt have to come here. He has never posted on our boards or to my knowledge tried to contact anyone about resloving it outside this forum.<br>
   The facts are yes his banter in shout although annoying was harmless. What was harmful was the fact that both Derek and myself tried to resolve this as it was happening and were both brushed off as he was &quot;having fun&quot;. No where in his logs do you see anything but encouragement by his group to continue to encourage him to provoke Hartland. They enjoyed the fun til they got got a result they didnt like. <br>
    Admittedly things got outta hand, but these lines from there logs will show the attitude of these people. And how they looked at the issue. Please ask Binnar for the full log, and make your desision. I just took the lines I personally felt shed more light on our position.<br>

   Shoot I feel you should maybe step up to the plate and admit more responsibility then your willing to accept. And admit while his actions were wrong so were yours and that you yourself could have prevented it but in trying to resolve this you told me you were enjoying yourself. And that you made no attempt to resolve anything not while it was happening not before you SL and possiably to this moment you have made no attempt to resolve it. Binnar I feel was being the responsiable and is taking steps to contact our guild leader and such but you chose to come directly here you had made that desission before you even logged, and logged and came directly here to this forum.<br>

<br>
Yes, I am sorry you felt you had to take the exact logs to the board, because when I get home I can start to post the things that Hartland said, including &quot;you all survived, guess I will have to pull more&quot; and shit like that.<br>
<br>
I mean come on, shoot isn't even posting anymore at this point, Hartland fucking trained, and he needs to know that isn't fucking acceptable in any means. What we said in group was just that, shit talk in group. And that is all that you can pull? Aashna, I was trying to defend your role in this, but all you do is defend the fucking asshole that Hartland is, and try to say that training is ok in this situation. That makes you just as bad as he is. Training is not acceptable, Verant will ban people for training, at least they claim they do, so get it, not acceptable.<br>
<br>
Now why don't you post the other people in zone who were in shouts also at this time. Talking about their Dolphin head, choking to Shoots Jedi choke, all sorts of shit? Why only bring out the bad, why not show what really happened? Or are you chicken that people might actually see what Shoot did was not so bad and what Hartland did was really fucking bad? <br>
<br>
Why do the Crimson Renegades continue to lie over and over while I sit here and take shit for sharing the unedited log, that obviously doesn;t make us look any better? All I hear are lies from them, and frankly I am sick of this shit.<br>
<br>
Aashna, get the facts straight and stop trying to contort the truth to make make people look at shoot. This post IS NOT ABOUT SOMEONE BEING AN ASSHOLE IN SHOUT. THIS POST IS ABOUT HARTLAND TRAINING REPEATEDLY AND ENJOYING IT.<br>
<br>
What is so fucking hard about recognizing this post for what it is? HARTLAND IS A TRAINER AND HE LAUGHS ABOUT IT IN THE PEOPLE HE TRAINED FACES.<br>
<br>
Those are the facts. No one is denying that HARTLAND TRAINED. And no one is saying that Shoot was 100% in the right, in fact shoot himself says that he wasn't perfect. But still HARTLAND TRAINED. Ok once more, HEARTLAND TRAINED AND HE ADMITTED IT.<br>
<br>
If you have such a problem with Shoot, Shitlist him, Stop trying to make this post a shitlst of shoot, because it isn't, it is about A TRAINER NAMED HARTLAND.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uthanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/13/02 2:28:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland</span><hr size=1> I have known most of the people in Crimson Renegades for quite a while.  Frankly, I never really knew Hartland that well, but Aashna is honestly one of the nicest people that I have met on this server.  I can't defend what Hartland did, but it should not have progressed this far to begin with.  <br>
<br>
Looking at the log which Aashna provided, it appears that Shoot and the people in his group were acting extremely childish and rude.  Nothing pisses me off more than people who act like complete idiots, but if I do feel myself started to get irritated at one or two people acting like asses in shout/ooc, I generally just turn them off.  It's one of the reasons why it always seems like I have shouts and OOCs off in EC, oasis, LOIO, etc...  :P<br>
<br>
Not really taking sides here, as I think both parties are somewhat at fault, but it seems that something like this could have been prevented if everyone had acted a bit more mature and civilized than this.<br>

<br>
Never asked for him to pull for us...but he is obviously giving it to us...<br>
[Sun May 12 02:22:11 2002] Hartland says, 'there ya go that ones snared'<br>
<br>

Kiting and then rooting on top of us...<br>
[Sun May 12 02:53:25 2002] Hartland shouts, 'I never trained anyone, I was kitting :P'<br>

<br>
Ok, now who was really being an asshole?  These all were pulled directly from thg log file without changing them at all.  Oh and Aashna, here is what I was quoting you on<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  [Sun May 12 01:38:44 2002] Aashna says out of character, 'uumm your a ranger and dont realize i am already a ranger =0) '<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  Notice the smiley?<br>
<br>
In this he admits to training, lies, uses profanity in shout, and is generally an asshole.  So, who looks worse?  Oh and notice that I was confident enough to share my unedited log with them, but I don't see them offering to let me see any of their logs.  Could they possibly have been worse in their group chat than we were in ours?  Possibly yes, we will never know. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ubinnar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Binnar</A> at: 5/13/02 3:49:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uqinipure.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QiniPure</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/13/02 4:01:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland</span><hr size=1> /sigh this is getting lovely<br>

things get taken out of context when you 1)dont know the people having the conversation 2)dont get all of the text and 3) get it in writing instead of hearing and seeing a person say something.<br>
<br>
That being said, I dont think we were that bad.<br>
<br>
As for my quotes, I feel that my &quot;ive always wanted to shitlist&quot; comment should be explained.  I am a shy person and I wouldnt start a shitlist. Also,  wanting to be brave enough to shitlist someone is what I meant. There have been times where people are so mean and so...well shitty on this server that I've wanted to  but never did. Notice, that I wasnt the one who brought this incident to the boards.<br>

EQ is an equal opportunity game. There are a LOT of idiots playing (fortunately they usually can't get up the ambition to put together a coherent MB post), and you will never, ever like all of what's going on in ooc and shout. Personally, I tend to ignore shouts as a rule. Anything about me in there is stupid BS from someone who knows nothing and is just trolling.<br>
<br>
Words are one thing. As a writer I realize words have a great deal of power. Experience is worth more than more or less any amount of money at some points in EQ. Trying to maliciously cause XP loss is not condonable by any amount of assholery. I understand the whole protective nature thing... but then again by his diction in the log I don't trust that so much. Granted, logs posted here aren't exactly the most reliable thing, easy to fabricate, but still. Training is bad. Don't do it, kids, and you won't get SL'ed. <p>Dagna, 25 dorf heal machine<br><br>

I used to be an officer in Crimson renegades, and i can tell you this. That guild does not support training, but they do support their friends.
