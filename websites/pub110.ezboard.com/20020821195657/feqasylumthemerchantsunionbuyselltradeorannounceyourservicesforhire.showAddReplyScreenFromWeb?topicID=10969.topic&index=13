With Ezboard, all I have to work on is your profile, so we will have to ignore or deny requests from new accounts with no post history, and are likely to deny most Sullon Zek posters also, sorry. (Well, given the circumstances, not that sorry actually)

If your post history is not visible...then you may be denied as well.

If you have any questions, or were denied and feel you shouldn't be, contact Xian or Tarot. If you can't figure out how to contact us...then you're not bright enough to post on Lanys! ;)
