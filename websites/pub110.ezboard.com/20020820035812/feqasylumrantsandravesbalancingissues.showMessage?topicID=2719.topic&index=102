Few things actually get me mad, Vassa. It is just so fun to sound outrageous on these boards because it *really* doesn't matter for crap what I say here. It isn't gonna change the minds of the airlines, now is it? I could say someone like...ohh...I am gonna piss on Tom Cruises' face. As much as he might like that, am I gonna? Nope. What if I scream about it? Nope. What if I jump up and down and get everyone else on thebaods to jump up and down screaming out Tom's name is furious anger? Nope. What I am is someone who is rather adamant in their views. If that makes me angry, then so be it - I am an angry dude with an unwavering view of the world. OK, you pegged me.<br>
<br>
And as you should know, in most cases, the majority rules. Yeah, bummer for the little guy. Until that mentality becomes a losing proposition, you should probably get used to it...or join the majority. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/utorachanjones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TorachanJones</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Nagafen</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/24/02 1:49:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2719.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Southwest Airlines To Charge Extra For...</span><hr size=1> If I have to pay for 2 seats, then I should get 2 meals on the flight.

<br>
Now being former Navy myself and living on ships for 3 years I know what you are saying but there is no law, no guideline, no documentation anywhere that says you are intitled to XX space and this will be called personal space.<br>
<br>
I was in the docks in philly had to fly to California for my new duty station, I sat next to this lady who literally took up 2 whole seats they even gave her the seat belt adapter to hook the 2 seats together and she was STILL in my damn seat.<br>
<br>
Why wont this fly because there is enough clinical proof that points out that obesity is a disease, thus if it is then they would be discriminating against passangers based on their medical condition and you can take it to the bank ole J.Cochran is just waiting to get him about 4 pissed off big people to walk in and say the seat dont fit you must acquit!<br>
<br>
I am 6'1&quot; 255 pounds I eat to much I drink to much soda, when I fly I ask for a isle seat so I can often get up and move around also so I can lean out over the isle in order to try to not infringe on the people next to me, do I have to do that no but as you are considerate in your way of keeping to your self I know that if it was me as I once was thin and in shape I wouldnt want someone leaning over on to me but not everyone is the same and airlines that go to this format of charging by size will eventually fire the brainchild who tried this. <p><image src= http://www.darkwhispers.us/Sigs/Villinsig.jpg>

There is no law, no guideline, no documentation anywhere that says you are intitled to XX space. Personal space is completely individual. I made reference to Italians earlier. The majority of people in their culture are *very* comfortable being inches away from each other, if not having to touch each other. You will frequently see 9 people stuffed into a 5 passenger vehicle and not have a problem with being that close to each other. I am talking about a culture of people where the men walk down the street with their arms around each other's waste, sometimes 3-4 men linked together in said fashion. They are comfortable with it. That doesn't mean I have to be. <br>
<br>
In the same sense, a lot of people probably have no problem sharing half of their airline seat with someone who is too big for their own seat. I am not one of those people. It doesn't make me a mean of bad person that I want my personal space to myself...it is a personal belief. Is it right for me to think like this? For me, yeah, it is right to think like this because I do not want strangers touching me. That is just me. Is it wrong for me to think like this? I don't think anyone has the right to tell me what I have to believe in, so I think it is inherently wrong for people to expect me to surrender wht I call &quot;my personal space&quot; in order to accomodate someone else's body mass. I have a big problem with that.<br>
<br>
What happens when you have three people who all just happen to all be over 6'5&quot; and 350lbs sitting next to each other? You can't tell me those people wouldn't be comfortable sitting next to each other for any amount of time on that plane. Which of them is gonna give up a little of their personal sapce for the guy/gal next to them? Is it expected that people give up their seat space to accomodate bigger people next to them? I don't think should be expected, because most of the time that extra space is nowhere to be found. So what if these three large people are sitting next to each other... what should they do? Ah ha, get another seat for their own comfort! Good idea! Ah ha, get a seat in first class! Good idea! <br>
<br>
I see many of the arguments on this thread pointing the finger at 1) the small seats as the reason of being uncomfortable for bigger people and 2) people who are not too big for their seat being 'assholes' for not being more sympathetic to the big person next to them by not wanting to make them comfortable. I can not control your body size. I can not control the space in the seat that I am sitting in. I have almost no control to make things better for you without putting my own comfort aside. What if the entire passenger list is comprised of people that are 1.5 times too big for the seat, what are you supposed to do?? Regardless of the situation, I think the bigger person should take it upon themself to make *themself* more comfortable by buying more space -to accomodate *themself*. Small people pay for first class because they want to be more comfortable, and they don't even use all of that seat space. Why don't bigger people do the same thing - for *themself* to make *themself* more comfortable? I dunno why this makes sense to me, but it does.<br>
<br>
Now, if you are talking about the military...man, that really is a whole different ball of wax. There have been numerous times where I have been &quot;nut-to-butt&quot; with a grou of guys as a result of training necessity. Did it bother me? Hell yeah it did...but in those situations I didn't have a choice and I sucked it up. Then again, I am not a consumer of the Navy's product. I do not pay the Navy to get into a &quot;nut-to-butt&quot; situation nor is there any expectation to be comfortable during training. On the flip side of that coin, I do not pay the airlines to have someone sit on my lap. The Navy has me do things I would not otherwise do in such proximity to others that I do not know. <br>
<br>
When I ride as a passenger on an airline, I expect what little space I am allotted to be there for me without others sitting on me. Perhaps I expect too much. Perhaps I really don't have the right to have my seat to myself. In that case, I guess I should just stand in the isle for the duration of all my future flights just for the sake of everyone else's comfort. Maybe I am just being *way* too selfish about what I consider personal space. I don't think that I am though. I stay within my own parameters of the seat space without violating others' personal space, and I expect the same in return from others. If I wasn't courteous, I'd prop my feet up across their lap for my own comfort. After all, the airlines do not guarantee me a comfortable ride...they just guarantee me passage from point A to point B. It is just common decency not to disturb others. I give the courtesy, I expect it in return. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ublodughadda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blodughadda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orcs</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/25/02 2:11:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2719.topic&index=107>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Southwest Airlines To Charge Extra For...</span><hr size=1> I don't see the peoblem realy, my druid has always charged twice from Ogres, Barbarians and Trolls... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uthoarnswiftarrow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thoarn Swiftarrow</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dozekar the Cursed </span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/25/02 3:06:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2719.topic&index=108>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Southwest Airlines To Charge Extra For...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How much will one have to pay for the additional seat?<br>

I know Bello and I have gone around on this issue and the mainly the cost of it.  After seeing what they propose and the &quot;actual&quot; cost of what its going to be to the &quot;larger&quot; passanger, I cant say its as bad I was fearing.  <br>
<br>
Still does not make 110% right of them to do it.  They all listed reasons to why they can not add bigger seats on the planes.  Of course it always boils down to profits.
