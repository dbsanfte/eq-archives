Ok, better now.  Xantheus, this is the most rational thing that has come from you in a while, thank you for finally &quot;coming to,&quot; and I don't blame you one bit for retreating from the boards.  I just hope you will still keep in touch in the GL's forum and send someone WITH TACT to communicate policies in the other forums. :P  Might I suggest that this NOT include any of the officers that have been posting on the trak forum, lol?<br>
<br>
Every one who has flamed in this thread, you are the lousiest bunch of hypocrites...and YES I mean that for those on &quot;my side&quot; of this issue too.  WTF do you think you are accomplishing??  You are FLAMING people for FLAMING others or otherwise being tactless and inconsiderate.  IF YOU WANT IT TO STOP, QUIT BEING PART OF THE PROBLEM!!!!<br>

I'm the first person to point out when I think something wrong has been done. I'm also the quickest to try to defend. Unfortunately I was one in this case and not the other...(damn these moving threads)<br>
<br>
Xanth - I respect the heck out of ya for this post. And I lost a heap of respect for others, who simply went out of their way to prove you right. &quot;Damned if you do, Damned if you don't.&quot;. I've spoken to a few 7D peeps lately, in the wake of this, and even just briefly, yourself...and I've decided that the lanys board has pretty much turned into the spot of blood that turns into the feeding frenzy. For what it's worth, I don't think I was wrong in the Trak thread for trying to call attention to the difference between working with people and dictating to them, but I sure as shit don't think you deserved what's come down the line since then, and apologize for being associated with it now. I get tells in the game &quot;Right on man, those guys are ASSHOLES! You take em to task&quot;. No. They aren't assholes. They are people. People who play a game, have an agenda, and while that agenda doesn't really affect many of us that much, we all got nerves touched by the method of delivery of a message. It doesn't devalue the good these people have done, it doesn't suddenly turn decent and good people into raving ego maniacs (Ok, well Eckert may make that seem the case...what IS with the monkey sigs, man? It's like they have magic power <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). I watched/helped a trak raid today that got wiped out...and despite making it clear that they would consider it an option to go in and kill trak themselves and rez the fallen group, they stayed clear. (It was really the only reason I spent all that time on the raid :P I had other stuff I needed to do today, but I doubted I would get a better example of if they were going to march in on a raid or not.) They respected the raid.<br>
<br>
You're right, Xanth, it's entirely too easy to get caught up in egos, pride, and other crap on here. Just one more post to prove how right you are and how wrong everyone else is. For your last post to have been an apology rather than another &quot;I'm more right than you&quot; like everyone has been posting all along, took balls and I salute you for it.<br>
<br>
That being said, a while back I also quit reading the forums and found the game suddenly became a lot saner. I think I'm probably going to do that again myself. I have no desire to be part of a lynch mob looking for their next victim.<br>
<br>
Qwade: look me up in game bro, when you have a minute to spare. I want to talk to you about something. I tried once when I thought you were on, but was mistaken.<br>
<br>
To the others that spit in Xanth's face when he did what you wanted him to? He showed some balls. You need to grow a pair.<br>
<br>
I'm out.<br>

I, myself, have taken many breaks from these boards due to the massive personality conflicts that occur here. It gets old pretty fast and a little recoop time is needed to deal with imbeciles that make an otherwise fun board into a dagger throwing contest. These boards (and many others) are merely a breeding ground for hatred and discontent by those who feel the need to take things in the wrong context or that like to twist things around to make things mean what they want them to mean. There will always be those who never have a positive thing to say and go out of their way to twist things around only to make life more difficult for everyone. You don't need the stress of their crap. Who does? It is good to acknowledge that your maturity is above the nonsense that some of the kiddies dole out. While there are many who can look at issues objectively and make an educated retort, there are an equal amount that lack the cerebral clout to comprehend even the most elementary of statements. A message board is a reflection of the community it supports. It is a shame there are so many that choose to make Lanys look like a ghetto playground. The negativity weighs on everyone's shoulders, not just those acting like children. <p><a href="http://pub75.ezboard.com/banarchyonline13012">The Anarchy Online Message Boards</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraistilyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>raistilyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/10/01 2:23:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Goodbye Lanys Forums</span><hr size=1> well khan may have not put it as delicatly as it coulda been said i think he has a good point.....Flaming Xan isnt really doing much here huh?

Most of this flame stuff is just the hype or a frenzy folks get into while typing something.  I think for anyone who read through xan's post and still posted some hateful flame either represents their age or a lack of maturity.  <br>
