I have a habit, developed out of experience, to be cautious towards doctors that surround themselves with either false claims or half-truths.<br>
<br>
The fact that YOU brought up his credentials shows the danger, because not only did you take stock in it, for right or wrong, you also promoted the fact he is a &quot;member&quot; of  UCLA's faculty (in your previous posts), and therefore it legitimizes Dr. St. Amand's position.<br>
<br>
Does he spend &quot;pro-bono&quot; time with Harbor/UCLA residents?  Yes, BECAUSE HE HAS TO.  That is the deal I mentioned previously....to use the title, you have to give a lecture or take on residents a few times a year, for which you do not get paid.  I find it funny he also mentions that it takes away from his &quot;economically profitable clinic time&quot;....funny, I never view my clinic in terms of profit or money.<br>
<br>
Also, at the bottom of the link you gave, I find this little &quot;fact&quot;:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Dr. St. Amand's rebuttal to Dr. Bennett's claims was due for publication in the October 1997 issue of the Journal of Myofascial Pain. Reprints of the article will be available from Dr. St. Amand's office. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The words &quot;was due&quot; struck me kinda funny....does this mean he submitted it and it wasn't accepted?  Shouldn't it read &quot;is due&quot; if it was to be published?  So I search the national medical journal database (&quot;Pub Med&quot; as it is nicknamed):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/journals/noprov/loftext_noprov_J.html">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/journals/noprov/loftext_noprov_J.html</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
I can't find it.  Does the journal even exist?  Has it gone out of print?  Is is too obscure to be included in the national registry?  I dunno.  I do know though, that if it was never published, yet he is willing to provide reprints of his rejected article....that is unethical.  Pharmacy companies are guilty of this frequently, giving doctors articles &quot;proving&quot; the efficacy of the drug they are trying to pitch, even though that same article was rejected by whatever journal it was submitted to.<br>

Medline doesn't cover that journal, I found it in another journal search (i believe 'embase').  The citation is at the bottom of his website.<br>
<br>
The problem is, he argues evidence with theory.  Which of course completely useless.  What I feel he does unethically is give a drug that doesn't do an effect.  He has provided no evidence to the contrary.<br>

As to the rest...only thing I can add at this point is; being close-minded is a bad thing. Something we all do. I do it too. Dangerous thing is when you're close-minded about something it cuts off the opportunity for learning. Doesn't mean not to be skeptical, but it does mean not to close off your mind to other things. <br>
<br>
I think both sides on the discussion that evolved have elements of that. (Not discluding myself from that either!)<br>
<br>
I learned a couple of things from everyone. I may never need it or use it, but learning is always good, especially when not done at the knee of experience. It's less painful that way really. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

on the other hand, calling him a quack was a bit much, heat of the argument type of thing.  Actually i'm sure his patients will do OK, because they believe in his treatment.

He supports his theories much more eloquently and technically than I do. :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  holy shit. goddamned ezboard ate my post. fuck. fucking hour of my time. Fucking fucking shit. FUCK! i'm deleting the board in anger :P<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In the entire course of this thread, I have obsessively cut and paste my responses as I typed them into a text editor.  I have had toooo many posts eaten, and put too much damn work and length into these. :P  In fact, why I'm not just typing them in a text editor in the first place is beyond me (think I'll do that now).<br>
<br>
Ok, I'm going back through the archives of the support group I used to be active in (just too much email for me to keep up with now).  There are so many reasons I slowly became more convinced this stuff really works.  A lot of the parts of the archive I'm reading are in response to initial doubts posted by myself, others new to the treatment, or even other doctors on the list.<br>
<br>
There are many many people who have fibromyalgia that claimed cold or cough medicine made them feel worse and they never knew why (guaifenesin is the main ingredient in most of them).  Then they read about the guai treatment and it clicked, so they started it.<br>
<br>
Also, the placebo effect.  I'm not too keen on it.  Doesn't it only work for a limited amount of time for the vast majority of patients?  Not, like me and most of those on guai, for 4+ years?  And how common is it that lots of people report being *cured or almost cured* by a placebo?  My common sense is telling me not very often, so perhaps the burden of proof should be on you to show me cases where placebo can really have such an amazing effect on patients. :P<br>
<br>
The deposits of tartar-like junk on patients' teeth.  This was one of the first clues St. Amand claimed he got from a patient, that he could chip these deposit-like things off his teeth (and biopsied to reveal mainly calcium phosphate).  Several other patients also reported having those (in the support group), and guai cleared them up.<br>
<br>
Most of the patients in the group came to try the guai treatment after &quot;everything else failed,&quot; often for a decade or more.  Certainly that makes sense, because guai is not the most commonly prescribed treatment around, and most people will try the &quot;traditional&quot; treatments or whatever their doctor tells them to do first.  What doesn't make sense to me is how all of these people did not get well on any of the other placebos, but they got well on this one.<br>
<br>
*edit -- cut some junk out.  As if this post weren't long enough already*<br>
<br>
Here's an excerpt from an email by St. Amand about vulvodynia and crystals in urine (he answers questions on the list occasionally as he has time):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Dr,. Clive Solomons has done pioneering work on the fact that oxalates in urine have intensified or caused the vulvitis and vulvodynia. He and I are part of the dog and pony show that, along with Doctor John Willems (chief of Ob-GYN at Scripps Clinic) have been getting around the Country speaking to various Vulvar Pain Foundation support groups.<br>
<br>
When we did our studies on the increased excretion of certain factors before and after guaifenesin, we found an increase in phosphates of about 60%, oxalates 30% and calcium of 30%. We have reasons to suspect that oxalates are produced excessivley in response to demands for the creation of more energy. They along with phosphates readily combine with calcium to form the crystals I alluded to in an earlier posting a few minutes ago<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm trying to find out if those studies are available.  Maybe you can help me search.  <br>
<br>
Ah, here's an excerpt from another email of his and why he feels those results are &quot;of no value for our purposes,&quot; so I doubt we'll find the results online:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As phosphates are used and metabolized, a certain amount is 'wasted' into the urine. Any excesses uneeded in the body are exreted in the urine. This renal release is the only means we have for unloading undesired amounts.<br>
<br>
However, so great and variable is our intake that daily phosphate excretions in the urine would not provide a good test. It would require a fully controlled intake with a proper diet and measurements made daily. You are always putting out phosphates in the urine and any dipstick, urine test would always show phosphates.<br>
<br>
When we did our &quot;experiment&quot; we put patients on a diet restricted for dairy products to somewhat control the calicum and phosphate intake. We measured two 24-hour urines for phosphate, calicum, oxalate and uric acid. We then put the patients on guaifenesin (or our older drugs) and witnessed a 60% increase in the excretion of phosphate with the medication as well as 30% calcium and oxalate. Uric acid increased only 20%.<br>
<br>
This kind of study was only good to help us confirm the initial burst. Later on, as you would guess, the excretion rate would vary too greatly depending on your intake, where the guaifenesin is working, the effect of minor cycles, bad cycles and good days or hours. In other words, too many variables would exist to make any of this of any value.<br>
<br>
This is a long way about to say: no, urine testing has no value for our purposes. The action appears to be in cells and mainly in the power stations within those cells, viz., mitochondria. Paul St. Amand<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
More quotes from emails of his to the list:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In short however, the phosphates we eat are inorgnic. They have to be 'organified' within the body. There is a well-known formula in all textbooks of physiology that reveal, raise inorganic phosphates in the mitochondria and you depress the formation of ATP. Excess ADP does the same thing. ADP becomes ATP when an inorganic phosphate (Pi) is attached (organified) to the ADP (Adenosine diphosphate becomes adenosine triphosphate thereby).<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Phosphates do not lump in that manner. If our theory is correct, they are still in<br>
solution albeit in excess amounts in the mitochondria and that is were<br>
they create their mischief. Probably 90% or more of the lumps we feel<br>
are merely fluid, trapped under high pressure.  The important thing is<br>
why is it there?  There are good chemical reaons but, very deep<br>
chemistry.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Gout was the prototype that led us willingly into the fibroyalgia problem. If you recall, it was a man with gout who, while taking his gout medication (&quot;probenecid&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  began pulling tartar off his teeth with his fingernail. When I analyzed tartar it was mainly made up of the minerals, calcium and phosphate (already well known in dental circles).<br>
<br>
We were seeing some patients with elevated serum uric acid, the test for gout, who had no joint symptoms but whom I thought displayed a variety of other symptoms. Many of those were similar to fibromyalgia. I thus thought there was a &quot;gouty syndomre without joint symptoms&quot; as yet. These patients responded well to the same medication.<br>
<br>
I soon saw a larger group who had similar symptoms but always normal tests for gout. I remembered my tartar man and began to wonder were there another retention disease, viz., phosphate instead of uric acid (urates)? This began our protocol.<br>
<br>
There are a few other retention illnesses such as &quot;primary oxaluria&quot;, &quot;cystinuria&quot; &quot;lipid retention diseases&quot; (several of those) and all of them have a strong genetic basis. It was not a quantum leap of faith that FMS, that so much mimicked gout, was another one of them.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, each of the five medications we have had (three we still have besides guaifenesin) all work at the proximal renal tubule to cause the excretion of uric acid and thus are successful in the treatment of gout. We tested the first one (probenecid) and then guaifenesin and found the accelerated excretion of phosphates after instituting treatment for FMS. This was the beginning of our theory. Data continues to suggest we are not too far off.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Perhaps it is different there, but in the U.S. diagnoses seem to be handed out rather callously, often without adequate proof.  Just look at all the things Nascens was (wrongly) diagnosed with.  This is probably because most every insurance agency requires a diagnosis to provide any sort of coverage at all besides routine checkup visits, and it makes patients happy with the doctor to think he/she has &quot;done the job&quot; and figured it out.<br>
<br>
Also, having one diagnosis does not preclude it possibly being wrong or there being other conditions coexisting.  Any good doctor would realize that.<br>
<br>
I think it still comes down to the fact that I think there are rather objective criteria to diagnosing fibromyalgia (once you have ruled out certain other conditions) and you do not. :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> That's really sad for 43 years of practice, research, etc.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Er...why is that?  How many doctors do you know that were published at all in their lifetimes?  I know a good many who were not.  He has never been primarily a researcher, although he has involved himself in research to find the cause and &quot;cure&quot; of fibromyalgia.  I daresay any doctor would for a condition he had himself that (at the time) was not even labeled.<br>
<br>
Perhaps to get &quot;peer review&quot; on his ideas and theories you should search for reviews of his books.  Unfortunately, he's always been of the opinion that he will help more people if he continues treating patients instead of going on a vendetta to prove himself and his theories valid.  I think he will help more people by proving his theories correct and convincing the whole medical profession to adopt his treatment.  He does do some things to try to prove his theories to the world, like write his papers and his book, but he wouldn't, for example, involve himself in a debate like this. :P<br>
<br>
Here's some &quot;publications&quot; of his I found.  Does Womens' health digest count? :P<br>
<br>
Here's one he's the co-author of:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.vulvarpainfoundation.org/effective_treatment.htm">www.vulvarpainfoundation....atment.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Publication that he is the sole author of in the same magazine:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.vulvarpainfoundation.org/guaifenesin_treatment.htm">www.vulvarpainfoundation....atment.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
In it he claims to have successfully treated 3500 patients -- and the date of the publication was 1997.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Why do you automatically assume that just because I'm saying it has to do with your attitude and belief in the system, that I'm saying a bad thing?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Because I think you're very wrong that FMS is a psychological disorder that can be &quot;cured&quot; by just believing strongly enough, and that there is far more than sufficient evidence out there that it is a physical disorder.  I also consider myself smart enough to not be duped into believing that a placebo really works, and that I have presented a lot of evidence showing that it's *not* a placebo, whereas you have presented little except saying &quot;there's no hard evidence that it's not a placebo.&quot;  Well, show me a placebo that can work like guai has for fibromyalgia.  If guai is not what made all these things happen to all these people, an explanation of what did would be pretty interesting.  And if it was &quot;St. Amand's charm&quot; that did it, as Bennett claims, maybe we should patent him and sell him in a bottle. :P<br>
<br>
From what I have gathered from various papers, emails, and conversations, St. Amand has experienced a 95% &quot;success rate&quot; in those that followed the treatment exactly and did not give up.  Including those that did not follow it exactly and/or gave up, I think the rate was 85%.  But I will ask him for sure next time I talk to him, and ask him how he defines &quot;success&quot; in a patient.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> www.myalgia.com ... go to it. Dr. Bennett's website. He's not selling anything, he's publishing data and help for patients.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, I've been to it.  It's the Oregon Fibromyalgia Association site.  This is the one I was talking about:<br>
<br>
www.fmnetnews.com<br>
<br>
Ah, they have a &quot;store&quot; on the site but it's just selling their newsletter.  He's on the board and is published very often in it.<br>
<br>
It's easy to make a doctor look better or worse, like a quack or a scholar, greedy or benevolent based on small tidbits of information, links, or quotes. :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Specifically read this work.  Dr. St. Amand dismisses it as do you sarcastically by mentioning how weak a 'personality' argument is. But read the whole thing<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I've read the whole thing.  It basically says the same thing you've been saying -- that it's &quot;all in the head&quot; and that positive thinking and reinforcement or whatever made all those people better.  The interesting thing is, it contradicts Bennett's own theories that FMS is a physical illness and takes physical treatments to cure.  He thinks that the &quot;psyche&quot; is a very small part of it, and that psychological techniques help only some patients:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Unless the patient has an obvious psychiatric illness, referral to psychiatrists is usually non-productive. Psychological counseling, particularly the use of techniques such as cognitive restructuring and biofeedback, may benefit some patients who are having difficulties coping with the realities of living with their pain and associated problems.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.myalgia.com/treatment%20overview.htm">www.myalgia.com/treatment%20overview.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
So he says that he attributes all of St. Amand's success to &quot;psyche,&quot; but for his own patients (and advice to other FMS patients), he says that's just a small part of it and likely to only benefit some.  That's just hypocritical.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Dr. St. Amand proposes Guai works through a phosphate measure, though no evidence has been found of this. So it could be phosphatidic.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok, he is sure that fibromyalgia is a genetic physical disorder.  He is sure that guai treats it.  He's pretty sure the area of dysfunction is the kidneys.  He only thinks it has to do with phosphates (and/or possibly oxalates).  So that's the part of his theory he's the least sure of.  Most of the evidence that leads him to believe it has to do with phosphates is in the above quotes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  He could easily publish patient success rate, but that would require data, which he doesn't have.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Thus, 90 percent of our patients were shown to have attained a sufficient dosage at 1800 mg a day or less. Obviously, 10 percent required 2400 mg or more.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm actually in the 10% that requires greater than 1800mg/day (which also puzzles me about it being a placebo.  Why would it not have worked with just one pill, or even with an &quot;average&quot; dosage?  My dose is 3600, and has been as high as 4800.)  I'm assuming that in that 10% is included those for whom it just didn't work at all, which from what I have read other places is 5% (according to St. Amand).<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> For several reasons we suspect a partial role for inorganic phosphate (Pi). This is supported by some observations. Patients note cyclic chipping or peeling fingernails (calcium phosphate). Dental calculus (calcium phosphate) often breaks off, and sometimes no longer forms, during treatment. Calcium added to meals allows lower dosages of medication, probably because calcium binds to phosphate as calcium phosphate and increases fecal elimination. Examination of 24-hour urine samples of patients who had begun guaifenesin show large increases in the excretion of phosphate and, in lesser amounts, calcium and oxalate. Though other anions might be involved, the preceding suggest a primary defect in phosphate (and possibly pyrophosphate) metabolism. If so, the following formula would account for depressed mitochondrial ATP generation:<br>
<br>
Delta G =<br>
ATP (Delta G = energy change)<br>
ADP + Pi (Pi = inorganic phosphate)<br>
<br>
Bengtsson and Hendriksson biopsied fibromyalgic, trapezial lesions and reported roughly a 20-percent decrease in ATP despite specimen dilution with normal tissue. [2] They also noted a similar decrease in phosphocreatine, the high energy reservoir. No such changes were present in unaffected muscle. A decrease in red blood cell ATP has also been documented. An energy deficit in affected cells would explain the entire syndrome: all symptoms and the multiple chemical abnormalities of fibromyalgia.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
