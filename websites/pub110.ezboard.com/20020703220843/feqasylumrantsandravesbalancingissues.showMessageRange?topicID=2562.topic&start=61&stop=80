<br>
the placebo effect, people think, proves that something is 'in someone's head'.  the truth is, that healing comes from within as well as from external sources.  just because placebo is effective, doesn't mean the disease didn't exist.  Placebo effect is amazing, and shows what spirit and healing is all about.<br>
<br>
so when i say that, say, guanifiescn (god i suck at spelling) as a treatment for FM might work, but if it does it hasn't shown to be any more effective than sugar pill.  In fact, patients often did worse.  Of course, Dr. St. moneybags explains this by salicilic acid (Aspirin, plants, etc) countering this effect, yet there is absolutely no rationale behind this, and he hasn't done a study comparing people on guan + ASA vs people without.<br>
<br>
fact is, placebo is real.  alundra i'm very happy if your treatment worked for you and nascen, really i am.  i just don't think that treatment should be applied to all patients because of shady anecdotal evidence by a money-driven resource.  there is no such thing as 'no side effects', 'always works', etc in medicine, and the same applies for Dr. St. Armans' therapies as well.<br>

There are many illnesses that are of exclusion. That's my point. Yes, there's a final test that they can point to and say ah-ha! But realistically it's exclusion. Was the same for my asthma, I never had a test performed where they said, ah-ha! see this test shows blah blah blah. Yet, it's undoubtable that I have it, as much as I like to pretend I don't. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You have your opinions on it, but they're merely that. I'm not bashing you for it. I personally think MPD is a made-up disorder. It's not to say that the people presenting with it aren't sick, or mentally ill. It's simply to say I think it's a manifestation of another psychological disorder, not a unique disorder in and of itself. And I also think it's largely created by incompetent psychologists. Yet as in any field where the answers aren't all known, it comes down to opinion based on emprical evidence. And there's going to be a variety of opinions.<br>

<br>
New placebo studies have shown that the touted 'remarkable' effects of the old sugar pill aren't nearly as remarkable as previously thought. In fact, it has very little medicinal value.<br>
<br>
Also, almost every single epileptic has 'pseudo-seizures' as well as actual seizures. It's well documented in studies. Does this mean they're 'faking' it? Of course not. It means that there is also additional components to seizure disorders, usually psychological that can cause someone out of anxiety to have a seizure. It's not caused solely by the electrical imbalances, but can be triggered in these same people by psychological components. <br>
<br>
I personally use bio-feedback tricks to help with asthma. However it doesn't make a tinker's damn of difference if you're going to have a severe attack. Yes, anxiety can play a role in asthma, as can other psychological components, but it's all physical. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  My worst attack ever was triggered while unconscious during surgery. Did anxiety pre-surgery play a role? Did my feeling that something bad was going to happen play a part? Wouldn't shock me. But the reality is that while I could have 'psychologically' primed myself for a severe attack, while unconscious, I could hardly play any role in it. <br>
<br>
And while it works for me, it won't work for everyone. Yes, I believe people can make an attack worse by going into a panic. However it's also hard for most people NOT to panic when you can't breathe. Then you start getting into chicken and egg arguments. <br>
<br>
Yes, the mind is a powerful thing, but don't over-rate it. Yes, people under high stress find that they are sick more often, because high stress levels depress the immune system. They may be more susceptable to illnesses, but the illnesses are real and not caused simply by the mind.<br>
<br>
Numerous things labeled psychosomatic at one time or another have been found to have very organic causes. They're only now doing very interesting research into OCD and it's coorelation with strep throat infections. (Neat stuff).<br>
<br>
There's quite a few unknows out there, or things that are not immediately apparent, even to the best of doctors. Instead of attempting to label it and dismiss it when the answers are not readily apparent, they do a better job by continuing to investigate it, and trying to find the best solutions for the patient. No, the enviroment they work in isn't always conducive to that form of care, everything...including often the patient...pushes for answers quickly. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:<br>
<br>
I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.<br>
<br>
I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures which are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.<br>
<br>
I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.<br>

I will not be ashamed to say &quot;I know not,&quot; nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery.<br>

I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.<br>

Unfortunately I think that sometimes gets lost in the shuffle of beaurocracy. (Also with the 'modern' Hippocratic Oath, there are several forms of it floating around, and not all schools even use it. /shrug but the general principles are roughly the same.) While there are numerous versions of the Oath out there (none approved or applied by the AMA despite the misinformation online btw) I just liked that version the best. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://marian333.livejournal.com" target="_blank">

<br>
In short, you (Xian) seem to believe as strongly in the medical profession as I do in my &quot;quack doctor and placebo treatment.&quot;  You are self righteous in the authority of the medical profession that you are so dedicated to and think so highly of, and I think that the vast majority of self righteousness in the profession is closed-minded, egotistical, and destructive.  I am self righteous because I came into the whole situation being very trusting of doctors and the medical profession, becoming less and less so over time, and finally being thoroughly disgusted through massive experience.  I researched and tried many, many &quot;theories.&quot;  I have looked at &quot;all sides&quot; and drawn a conclusion based on my research and considering all sides.  So, we're both pretty convinced that we're right, for whatever reasons, and it's a completely pointless debate.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  However so many people with this haven't had that luxury. Some are legally blind now as a result of going undiagnosed.

Yeah, heh.  Ohhhh yeah.  I have been lucky to not have needed narcotics for very long at all, and had a doc willing to believe me and prescribe them.  But I've heard from sooo many patients who were refused pain medicine of any sort (St. Amand actually won't prescribe pain meds for patients except extreme circumstances, wants to keep them as clean and pure on the treatment as possible, and prove that it really is the treatment making the difference. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and told that they were bad people, drug addicts, and mental cases.  The few suicide cases I knew of personally were after treatment like this from doctors...blamed, of course, on their drug addiction, or their psychological problems that caused the &quot;disorder&quot; in the first place, etc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And because so many doctors seem to want to quickly label their 'mystery' cases, if they can't find the cause, then they'll label it psych. or malingering, or whatever else they can pretty much blame on the patient for not being so good as to present their symptoms a little better.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes.  Psychological causes seem the easy answer for a whole lot of doctors.  I got that as the &quot;easy answer&quot;  to all of my problems and went through a hell of a lot of abuse at home and in the doctors office for this all being in my head and if I really wanted to I could get better etc. etc.  So I went to 2 different shrinks over a year, and they did absolutely nothing for me, and honestly both told me they were convinced I had no psychological problems whatsoever.  They were less than helpful, but at least they were honest...although they were friends of the family and had known me for a long time, so gave me a whole lot more credit than the doctors I had not known before did. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uuhgreebugga.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Uhgree Bugga</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/6/02 10:02:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2562.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Medical Profession today..</span><hr size=1> E-G-A-D-!<br>

I'd like to get out of it myself, but for the potential friends of those reading this thread that might have fibromyalgia, I'm not going to let Xian take bits and pieces to make this doctor look like a quack and convince peeps to miss out on probably the only treatment that actually treats the disease, and not the symptoms.<br>

<br>
Dr. St. Amand didn't diagnose me actually, the diagnostic I originally followed (that was confirmed by a FMS specialist) was published by a Dr. Devin Starlanyl based on the copenhagen definition, who has published the most widely read and recommended books on fibromyalgia (according to various doctors who have recommended books to us, whether they have a clue who St. Amand is or not) and can be found here:<br>

She is a doctor who has fibromyalgia and became at one point too debilitated to work.  She investigated many treatments and advocates a combination of them, the most important of which she believes is the guaifenesin treatment -- one of her books is where I first heard of it.<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, while perusing her site I came across a new study that indicates there might be a new way to test for fibromyalgia, &quot;algotensiometry.&quot;  A &quot;blood test&quot; like that would go a long way  to improving the recognition and diagnosis of fibromyalgia!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.sover.net/~devstar/algo.htm">www.sover.net/~devstar/algo.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Dr. Bennett (opponent of St. Amand's guai theory) also uses the copenhagen definition of trigger points for fibromyalgia diagnosis.<br>
So does the american college of rheumatology.<br>
So does every doctor/institution on every website I've come across so far with the exception of a very old article I found on the NiH website.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Dr. St. Amand has provided no evidence to back up his claims, and while his evidence is very anecdotal and compelling, he has not one iota of data supporting his claims.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So does he have *no* evidence or just &quot;anecdotal and compelling&quot; evidence?<br>
<br>
I encourage you to read all of the link below if you have not, for it gives theories, a summary of the data and test results (referenced) that have supported those theories, and actual detailed biochemical formulas and processes for what he thinks is happening in the body.  He has so many biochemical terms and formulas in there that it is beyond what I learned in my few biology and chemistry classes, but I have read the &quot;toned down&quot; patients' version and found it very logical and well worked out with quite a bit of test results to support it.  I'm sure a doctor could understand these formulas and processes better than I could.<br>
<br>
Basically, I have read the detailed theories for every major proposed cause of fibromyalgia.  None explain everything or even most things about the disorder, and put all the puzzle pieces together in a detailed and *scientifically sound* manner.  I think that if he has not hit on the cause of fibromyalgia, he has come very close, because disruption of the ATP cycle in cells would explain everything that occurs in FMS patients.  Now what exactly causes the disruption and how to fix it is what is more sketchy, and has less evidence supporting it...that's where the &quot;anecdotal&quot; evidence comes in.  But you're right, if you meant it so, that the evidence is compelling that he's hit the nail on the head there too, and the results are even more compelling.<br>
<br>
But seriously, as to the cause for fibromyalgia, I think his biochemical explanation is dead on, not just from my research but from my personal experience.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I know it worked for you, and you're gonna tell me that's enough for you, and truly, it is.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not really. I've never been satisfied with just &quot;it works for me, so whatever.&quot;  I want to know exactly why it works and what it's doing.  I read about a heck of a lot of treatments for fibromyalgia and some just made me crack up, as ridiculous as were their foundations.  If they work for those patients, well great (usually they don't, or only work for a few), but I wouldn't try anything that didn't make scientific sense, or that at least could be partially logically proven to me.<br>
<br>
I'm not an expert, obviously, in the field of biochemistry, although I have always excelled in science and before I got sick won many science competitions.  So it's not like I read St. Amand's theories and said &quot;eureka, I've found it!&quot;  I treated them with a great deal of skepticism, but since they seemed scientifically sound I decided to try the treatment, and I approached it with the same attitude as I did any treatment I've tried.  The fact that it seemed to be working exactly as the guidelines said (I felt like a truck had hit me after taking this &quot;harmless&quot; medicine for a few days, as the protocol says will happen if you have fibromyalgia) caused me to delve deeper.  <br>
<br>
I have read the report of the guy who is adamantly against the guai treatment (Dr. Bennett), and I do not agree with his conclusions at all, although I think he is a smart guy and is definitely a fibromyalgia expert.  He agrees with St. Amand that his theories make good biochemical sense, he agrees that guaifenesin is indeed a uricosuric agent that would fit into the whole theory, and he agrees that salicylates like aspirin would &quot;block&quot; the effects of the medicine.  What he did not agree with was that topical salicylates as well as ingested pills would block the treatment.  So basically, all they disagree on is what exact dosage and method of absorption is enough to block patients and, therefore, skew the results.  Bennett denied that any absorption of salicylates other than taking pure aspirin would affect the workings of the guai, and therefore accepts the study results as conclusive.  St. Amand and his supporters believe that there are other ways for the body to absorb salicylates that &quot;block&quot; in the same way (like smothering salicylates on the skin), and that since they did not take that into account until the study was over, the results are inconclusive.  Really a very minor point they disagree on, and I think it's quite irrational for Dr. Bennett to not even consider running a new study taking the new findings into account, and he rather vehemently ridicules St. Amand's treatment and all patients who are &quot;duped&quot; by it at any chance he gets.<br>
<br>
That's the only &quot;evidence&quot; disproving St. Amand's theories that I have ever heard of.  Interestingly enough, Dr. Bennett is on the board of a for-profit organization that offers a newsletter for a paid subscription, and a whole host of products from an online store.  He benefits from a lot of traffic from patients on the guaifenesin treatment going to read his vehement refutation.<br>

Ok, find me a case study or two of depression causing the following symptoms:  severe back pain causing inability to sleep or eat, calf cramps, stomach acid requiring prescription medicine (prilosec) to control, dry eyes/eye irritation, irritable bowel syndrome, reactive hypoglycemia, bumps on arms/legs/shoulders, vulvodynia, chest pains mimicking MVP, multiple chemical sensitivities (I once had a severe system shock reaction to a cotton tampon, of all things), and of course the mental symptoms...brain fog, anxiety, extreme sensitivity to light/sound, depression itself (yes I have depression.  I think I have a damn good reason too. :P).  Find me some case studies of those, and I will find you doctors who were looking for an easy psychological answer to physical symptoms.  Find me some that were &quot;cured&quot; by a shrink to the point of no more symptoms and totally going off medication, and maybe I'll be a bit more swayed.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Although reams of anecdotal evidence exist on the success of guaifenesin in treating fibromyalgia, there has never been a tightly controlled, double-blind study performed by a credible research institution that provides the solid proof the medical community requires. This study could easily be done by a drug company, but since the drug is no longer under patent, and no one company stands to profit from such a study, it has been difficult to interest any corporation in undertaking the project. It became apparent to the members of Guai-Support, an online support group of more than two thousand fibromyalgia patients who use the guaifenesin protocol, that if a proper study were to be accomplished it would be necessary to launch an independent effort. Thus, the Fibromyalgia Treatment Center, Inc., a tax-exempt charitable foundation, was established to fund a double-blind study of guaifenesin as a treatment for fibromyalgia. It is the goal of this study to definitivly prove, or disprove, the efficacy of the guaifenesin protocol. The information resulting from the study will be essential to the education of the medical community, now largely uninformed or misinformed about the nature of Fibromyalgia and the benefits of the guaifenesin protocol.<br>
<br>
Our most important contributors to this multi-year project have been fibromyalgia patients, their friends and families. The study is now being developed by Scripps Institute in La Jolla, California and will be conducted with the participation of Dr. Bruce Solitar with the New York University School of Medicine, and other research institutions.<br>

Profits from book sales go to that fund, 100%.  I wasn't aware that he took any fees whatsoever for his &quot;tours&quot; and physicians' conferences, but I can't comment for sure on that.  I think you can request a financial accounting report from them at the address on the page.  The only money he makes is like any doctor, from his practice, and also I think he is still on the payroll of UCLA.  He certainly doesn't live a rich lifestyle...the man works from 8am to 6 or 7pm every weekday, and lives in quite a small house (all he can afford in Marina del Rey, lol) near his office.  He is over 70 years old, and refuses to retire.  *Not* the symptoms of a doctor inspired by greed, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
In ANY case, he sees patients all day every day pretty much.  He is not the main proponent of his own treatment and theories, as he believes the biggest difference he can make is by continuing to see patients, even though many of his supporters disagree and wish he would dedicate his time to fundraising for a study.  There are many other doctors and nurses who run or are on the board of the nonprofit organization that is selling the books and keeping the money to fund a double-blind study.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In fact, studies have shown his treatment to be less effective than sugar pill (placebo).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In fact, on his treatment in the one (flawed) study, even then some patients reported feeling worse on his treatment than on a sugar pill.  How can that happen?  Aren't you supposed to feel the same or better on a placebo?  If you read about the treatment, you *are* supposed to feel worse before you feel better, a lot worse, and I in fact *did* feel a lot worse before feeling better myself.  I think the fact that patients felt worse on the treatment is a pretty interesting fact about that study, and warrants raising an eyebrow in itself.<br>

No, and no.  *opens St. Amand's book and flips through it* -- I don't even see a refutation of the study in there at all.  Read the book before you decide what it's about -- there's a lot of good information in there.  And again, book proceeds go to the nonprofit fund for a double-blind study.<br>

<br>
So he disagrees with all the international scientists that came up with the Copenhagen definition in the first place?  They were the ones that originally observed the very interesting coincidence of the same &quot;trigger/tender points&quot; on almost all fibromyalgia patients.  Not St. Amand, not Devin Starlanyl, not the many doctors that use it every day.  They just applied it.<br>

Not sure about the phosphate levels, don't think most doctors are doing frequent urine tests on their patients.  Patients, however, very often report acidic, burning urine -- I get that if I don't drink at least 4-5 glasses of water a day.<br>
<br>
But as far as who finds the lumps, here's a list of doctors who support and use St. Amand's treatment and &quot;lumps and bumps&quot; method of mapping progress (these are just the ones he knows about and has on his website, and he tends to &quot;screen out&quot; doctors that get bad reports from their patients, like the one I saw in Atlanta)...there's even one listed in Canada:<br>

Hmm, I'm picking all sorts of gems out of the website of Dr. Bennett's newsletter (yeah, he's just on the board, but nearly all research and commentary is his):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> While many chronic pain syndromes display symptoms that overlap with fibromyalgia, the 1990 ACR multi-center criteria study (published in the February 1990 issue of Arthritis and Rheumatism) evaluated a total of 558 patients, of which 265 were classified as controls. These control individuals weren't your typical healthy &quot;normals.&quot; They were age and sex matched patients with neck pain syndrome, low back pain, local tendinitis, trauma-related pain syndromes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, osteoarthritis of the knee or hand, and other painful disorders. These patients all had some symptoms that mimic FMS, but the trained examiners were not foiled--they hand-picked the FMS patients out of the &quot;chronically ill&quot; melting pot with an accuracy of 88%. FMS is not a wastebasket diagnosis!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  That's according to St. Amand<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Er...no?  St. Amand has done no studies on the incidence of FMS in males and females that I am aware of.  There are many out there, however, and the ones I read were probably many of the same ones you read.  I just don't personally think they're totally accurate, as I think there's going to naturally be more misdiagnosed or undiagnosed males than females.<br>
<br>
I didn't even really disagree with you on that point, heh, yet you want to make it look like another point on which I blindly follow St. Amand.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And sweetie, I hate to burst your bubble, but if you think everyone with FM even has -one- of those symptoms, you're way off. I would guess that population (Based off of the FM patients i have treated and seen) to be around 5-10%<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I've had, for instance, the bumps on my forearms since I was 11 years old, and I thought that was a quirk about me.  I also have this weird itching in my inner ear that is relieved when I press on my earlobe.  I also have eyes that turn bloodshot very easily, again, I thought it was another quirk about me.  I *never* would've thought to mention these symptoms to a doctor, as I didn't see them as symptoms at all...until I was in a huge online support group of fibromyalgia sufferers, and every now and then something would come up and someone would say &quot;so do you guys get such and such,&quot; and a dozen or so people would say &quot;yeah, that's pretty common in fibromyalgia&quot;<br>
<br>
To present a counter story, I also have some skin and eye problems caused by rosacea (as I later found out).  I thought they, too, could be explained by fibromyalgia, so I asked the group if they got those problems...nope, nobody had them.  So I looked elsewhere and found out I also have rosacea, not severe though (yet).<br>
<br>
So I can guarantee you that the people you have treated don't tell you about every minor little symptom they have, because some are just annoying, written off as &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;just a quirk about me,&quot; etc.  And again, not every fibromyalgia patient gets the same set of symptoms.  However, I found it very interesting that I could ask the support group and get a large round of &quot;yeah, I get that&quot; for symptoms on the &quot;list&quot; of FMS symptoms, and a &quot;no, that must be something else,&quot; for symptoms that aren't.  Just my personal little study. /shrug  Wouldn't have found out that I have rosacea if not for their honesty.<br>

Data compiled of anyone with generalized pain?  Generalized pain does not equal fibromyalgia.  Here's some of the places (besides St. Amand's site) where you can find detailed listings of all the fun fun symptoms (however minor) of fibromyalgia...one is an article of Dr. Bennett's:<br>

...ok I got tired of going through links after those few, I have so many of them.  That gives you a good idea of not only how many doctors and institutions do recognize all of the symptoms that you say are &quot;only on St. Amand's list,&quot; but of how many also use the copenhagen definition (I wasn't even looking for that, but every website cited that as the &quot;definition&quot; of fibromyalgia).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  They do. I have not seen anyone not receive the full gamut of investigation + treatment. It's only when other factors are brought to light that more... non-medicinal treatments are approached.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

No, I don't.  I disagree with him in some areas.  I treat his theories with as much skepticism as any others.  And I have given you links to the theories, described in inticrate detail, part of which are very well backed up with data, and the other parts will hopefully be backed up (with &quot;hard&quot; evidence as opposed to anecdotal) as soon as they raise enough to fund the study.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  (i feel bad for doing this... i know your treatment works for you but you'll never accept the fact that it could be placebo, or that your symptoms could be psychogenic, because those have negative connotations thanks to society.

<br>
Hmm.  First I'll agree with Tarot, that you WAY overestimate the potential effects of a placebo.  I've read studies, lots of them, and the placebo patients always displayed very minor improvements, if any.  In no study, nowhere, did 85% or more of the placebo patients claim to be cured or significantly better.  And that has been St. Amand's success rate with his treatment, and also it seemed to be what I observed in the support group I was a member of.<br>
<br>
If the placebo effect works, there are other treatments that should have gotten me well long before guai started making a difference.  But I guess there are &quot;conditions&quot; on what kind of placebos work and when, too.<br>
<br>
I also have dealt with quack doctors and quack theories, and yes I was even &quot;duped&quot; into trying one, since the science backing it up seemed...ok, admittedly way too good to be true, but well explained at least.  I tried it, with at least a little excitement that a possible &quot;cure&quot; could be so easy, especially considering that the guai treatment is so long and hard.  This quack treatment did nothing for me, and investigating further, I joined their email group and did some research on them.  In their email group, as I observed, anyone expressing doubts in the treatment was quickly banned.  Many websites had sprung up from these banned individuals and much evidence disproving her theory.  In fact, I finally came across a website of an expert who had been bugged by many to say if her theories were scientifically sound.  They were so off, it was pathetic, lol.<br>
<br>
But anyhow, the signs of &quot;quackhood&quot; were really, really obvious.  None of these such signs appear about St. Amand.  They don't boot anyone from the email list unless they spam with advertisements or are abusive to people on the list, and many MANY times have people expressed doubt about the effectiveness of the treatment, including myself.  They are usually the ones who...like me...after a year or two on it are its biggest proponents.  If you are really that interested, you can join the list yourself, although it's a lot of mail to read (I no longer have time/patience to read it all).  Once you join, you can search the entire archives of the whole lifetime of the list, which is a very valuable resource!<br>
<br>
About it being somatized or psychogenic or whatever (I thought &quot;soma&quot; meant sleep related heh, guess not)...you're basically calling me crazy, saying I don't really have a physical illness at all and that all these physical symptoms are in my head, and that I'm only getting better because I've managed to convince myself that this should work, and therefore my body is exhibiting exactly the patterns the treatment guidelines said it should.  You expect me not to be offended?  Heh, there is nothing more infuriating to me than to be told this is all in my head.  I'm sure the same was true of MS patients before you could do definite tests for it...and allzheimer's...and aids...and *insert disorder here that was once ridiculed or said to be all in the patient's head*.  I had to move out from my father's house because I couldn't take him telling me that every day.  Nearly killed myself several times.  I mean, like I *chose* to have my life taken away from me and live as a dependent invalid.

Is that really necessary?  Calling him Dr. St. Moneybags?  I feel like you've done nothing but insult me and my beliefs in the last few posts.<br>
<br>
Also, as I have said already in this post, even the opposing doctor to St. Amand agrees that salicylates block guai, if they get in the bloodstream in sufficient amounts.  So apparently, there is some pretty good evidence of that.<br>

BTW.  Some peeps that have been reading this, or other places where I have mentioned I would do suchandsuch but may be too sick etc...I don't want your pity.  Really.

<br>
i just spent a better deal of this morning talking with residents and staff in rheumatology, who deal with FM people all day.  These are doctors who want to help people.  Do you think there is a guai conspiracy?  A undercover agency designed to block the use of phoshpatidic agents in FM?  Every rheumatologist i spoke to was aware of Dr. St. Amand's 'research', which is funded by 15% of his profits.  certainly not 100%.<br>
<br>
FM is highly researched.  FM is amazingly investigated and a topic of high debate and research.  Yet you feel that the entire medical community except for Dr. St. Amand are off?  The doctors i talked to didn't mention these lumps, what is that?  A conspiracy?<br>
<br>
It's not like these other researchers don't know that it's a misdiagnosed and terrible label disease.  I've included some reading i've scanned in for you, that is very current reserach from a textbook i just purchased... Kelley's Textbook of Rheumatology.  I'm including it because, honestly, it just doesn't add up.  Specifically read the last talk on 'alternative therapies'.  It's important you do.<br>
<br>
How can every major rheumatologic textbook exclude such an obvious physical sign as lumps?  Phosphate?  I mean, i order phosphate levels every day.  You don't htink it's been investigated?  Quite simply, Dr. St. Amand would have the data if it existed now.  He doesn't.  He is regarded as a snake-oil merchant who uses pseudoscience and anecdotal testimony to sell a product.  <br>
<br>
By the way, the 'salicylate hypothesis' is a -common- argument in herbal medication.  Because it allows for the 'exclusion' of any contrary claim with the blanket statement: &quot;EVERYTHING HAS SALICYLATE IN IT!&quot;.  Where's the data showing patients on ASA and Guaifenesin vs patients not on ASA and Guaifenesin?  Simple, it doesn't exist.  It hasn't been shown.  His data is completely non-existent.  Do you think the FM textbooks are biased?  Why?  They don't want to cure the disease?  They don't want Dr. St. Amand to be right?  They don't want to help their patients?<br>
<br>
fact is, rheumatologists deal with FM patients every day.  Who come and have failed on his miracle therapy at great expense, as well as other miracle therapies at great expense.  They care, but they deal in real world medicine.  They use what works.  They use what has been shown to work.  Dr. St. Amand does not.<br>

There is nothing unique about fibromyalgia in this regard, because labeling has been shown to be harmful in many medical conditions, such as hypertension. In contrast to hypertension, though, for which labeling can be justified because of an increased risk of mortality in the absence of intervention, there is no evidence that treating fibromyalgia changes mortality. This places a burden on the treater of any condition that causes symptoms, but not damage, to ensure that a label is accompanied by a treatment plan that improves function.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Alternative Therapies</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Several different types of alternative therapies are used by physicians and patients to treat fibromyalgia. Some of these are physical modalities, such as trigger point injections, myofascial release therapy (or other &quot;hands on&quot; techniques), acupuncture, and chiropractic manipulation. Others fall under the general category of cure du jour: nutritional supplements, diets, and devices that are frequently advertised over the Internet <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Xianedit... do you feel Dr. St. Amand falls in this catego</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> [/i], usually accompanied by testimonials to their efficacy.<br>
<br>
There are few controlled trials that can guide the practitioner in how to grapple with these treatment modalities, but there is a body of science that has accrued from examining the essence of the &quot;placebo response&quot; as well as in studying the reasons for the efficacy of CBT. Key constructs that reverberate through all of these fields of research are that patients with nearly any medical disorder will fare better if they have an &quot;internal locus of control&quot; (i.e., they believe they can control their illness), and a corollary is that a patient's belief system is important to prognosis.<br>
<br>
With this in mind, a three-stage approach to any unproven treatment regimen is suggested, which does not require that the physician advocate or endorse any unproven treatments. The practitioner first evaluates the safety of the proposed treatment and points out to the patient any potential harmful effects. The physician then considers whether this treatment is reinforcing a maladaptive belief that in the long run will be harmful to the patient (e.g., a treatment program of prolonged bed rest or of isolation). If the treatment is neither harmful nor maladaptive, the practitioner should suggest that the patient conduct the equivalent of a clinical trial (as is done in &quot;n of 1&quot; trials). In this setting, the patient begins a single treatment (keeping all other variables constant) and determines whether the treatment is beneficial. If the patient judges the treatment to be helpful, the treatment should be discontinued to determine whether the symptoms worsen. If the treatment withstands this test of efficacy, a &quot;placebo effect&quot; cannot be excluded; but in clinical practice, especially in an enigmatic condition such as fibromyalgia, it is difficult to argue with success. Even for the purist, in this setting the physician has subtly reinforced the need for the patient to take an active role in treatment, which is indisputably an important step in any chronic illness.<br>

What I do think is positive is that you feel better, and thats great, but i don't attribute it to the medicine.... rather the belief in the medicine,  the attitude of you, and also, the course of the disease, which is waxing and waning in nature.<br>

i'm very happy you are feeling better. just... sigh.  i dunno. the entire world (5% of the population has FM, estimated) vs. Dr. St. Amand... it doesn't make sense.<br>

Yes.  Finally you begin to understand.  The evil Queen of the planet Zantar is bent on turning earth into a planet full of drugged-up, bump-covered sex slaves to satisfy her secret human fetish.  She is using her army of communist ninja space mice to confiscate guai supplies worldwide and her super secret brain wave altering mechanism to brainwash young medical students everywhere that St. Amand is a quack and guai is a drug of the devil!  But the Queen was not counting on the sharp witted endeavors of the three saucy heroines Adjani, Tarot, and Xian.  Little did she know that as her evil plot was unfolding, Adjani was secretly recruiting the others to help her hijack the queen's flying fantasy saucer, force her to take guai and free the world from this diabolical menace.  You must join me in defeating the evil Queen and saving our planet from its desperate plight!<br>

That is another of the evil queen's devices, but it is even more highly advanced because, you see, as doctors age the hard matter in their skulls becomes thicker and harder to penetrate.  Nothing but the Conjobobilizer can penetrate and conform the doctors' brain waves to the evil queen's will.

Obviously not everyone missed the lumps/tender points, because it was decided upon as diagnostic criteria at Copenhagen, and is used as such today by every specialist I have seen or read about on the internet, from almost every major FMS center in the U.S.<br>
<br>
Also, if you have reads St. Amand's theories and tests, everyday urine samples from FMS patients do NOT have abnormal levels of phosphates or oxalates (or yes, it would have been recognized long ago).  It's when they are on the guai and filtering out the junk that occasionally there are high levels.  I don't even remember where I read that, somewhere in his research (I'm sure you can find it on there somewhere), so you best get the details there and not from my fuzzy memory.<br>

By whom?  Dr. Bennett?  We already went over his quarrels with St. Amand.  Who else thinks St. Amand is a quack?  I've searched and I don't find the sites that I have found on other &quot;quack&quot; doctors...the one I spoke of earlier had a slew of sites against her, was listed in &quot;quackwatch,&quot; etc. etc.  A search on just her name brought up more &quot;she's a quack&quot; sites than positive sites for her.  A search on St. Amand, even when putting &quot;quack&quot; in the search engine too, brought up...Dr. Bennett's refutation on a few sites, that also linked to St. Amand's site and suggested patients should make up their own minds.  It is a very popular treatment and almost every FMS site at least mentions it.  None of them that I have found have called it a &quot;quack treatment,&quot; not even Dr. Bennett's site...he just calls it a placebo.<br>
<br>
Dr. St. Amand has been on the teaching staff at UCLA school of medicine in the endocrinology department for 43 years -- which is not a bad med school, from what I have heard.  If you had gone there, he might have been one of your professors.<br>
<br>
Fact is a ton of doctors around the country use his treatment, even a family doctor back in Auburn AL (and no he didn't find out through us, we were shocked to hear that he knew of and used the treatment).<br>
<br>
Here's something interesting.  Even Dr. Bennett agrees that St. Amand has had not just good, but AMAZING results with the guai treatment.  So amazing, in fact, that he's been hard pressed to explain exactly why the results have been so good if guai really is just a placebo.<br>
<br>
His explanation is along much the same lines as yours, except even more...difficult to believe.  He thinks that patients are infected by St. Amand's enthusiastic and charming personality (even the thousands that have never met him), are lulled into thinking St. Amand is an expert and has found the cure, and through &quot;self fulfilling prophecies&quot; go through cycles and eventually make themselves better or almost better on their own.  He thinks that they need to be assured that they have a real illness that is not in their heads and that they can get their lives back.<br>
<br>
What he doesn't mention is that he also tells his patients that FMS is a real, physical illness and they can get their lives back with his treatments.  But his success hasn't been anywhere near as amazing as St. Amand's, from anything I can find on his website.<br>
<br>

Where's the data showing salicylates don't block guai?  I assumed it was a well known biochemical fact, since I have not seen it disputed anywhere.  Dr. Bennett has brought up *every* possible argument he can come up with against St. Amand, don't you think he would've used that one rather than resorting to saying &quot;patients are charmed by St. Amand's infectiously enthusiastic personality?&quot;<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Because it allows for the 'exclusion' of any contrary claim with the blanket statement: &quot;EVERYTHING HAS SALICYLATE IN IT!&quot;.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No...now that IS a well known biochemical fact.  We know what salicylates are, and what they come from.  Plants manufacture them to protect their roots from bacteria.  Aspirin comes from tree bark (artificially made these days though).  Salicylates are the stuff in astringents and aloe and mint that give your skin that &quot;tingly, cool&quot; feeling.  It's pretty easy to avoid them if you know what to look for and the ingredients are listed on the products you're using.<br>
<br>
I stopped getting well for a year back in Alabama, after making an extraordinary recovery on the guai for about a year and a half -- we're talking going from narcotic pain meds to no pain meds, delirious in bed to being up and walking around all day.  Then I just stalled for a year in the midst of my excitement over such progress, and I lost almost all faith in the guai treatment, my current doctor, and just about everything.  No change for a whole year, and my doctor started blaming me, telling me I didn't really want to get better etc. etc.  I even stopped taking the guai for a while, thinking it was useless if I were just blocking or not doing it right or it didn't work.<br>
<br>
Then I moved to California and saw St. Amand and told him what happened.  He asked me what products I was using, and I listed them all, all approved from his lists.  Well, one company had started putting mint in their toothpaste, and they are not required to list ingredients on the tube so nobody knew until much later.  He said many peeps had been blocking with the same toothpaste (some disgusting tweety bird kid's toothpaste, was glad to get rid of it :P), so we swapped and started cycling again and I'm better now than when I moved out here, as slow as the progress is (hence why I'm not playing as much, getting stuff done and getting out more).  If that's all mental, how do you explain the lapse of a year?  I was *much* more excited and hopeful about the treatment at the beginning of the lapse than when we started.<br>

<br>
Because the only double-blind study done on guaifenesin treatment gave no indication that guai was effective.  Which makes sense, since textbooks and medical associations require very hard proof in order to call something a &quot;cure.&quot;  However, this isn't the first time a study's results have been skewed by an outside factor that the doctors were unaware of at the time, and it won't be the last.  And I just *can't wait* until they have enough for Scripps to run the next study and I don't have to have *this* debate anymore. :P.<br>
<br>
It doesn't require a successful double-blind study to make a treatment work, it just requires it to prove it to the majority of the medical community.  I'm sure there was just as much skepticism about treatments for hundreds of other disorders before they were finally &quot;proven&quot; in a study.<br>

<br>
Actually his therapy is far from being touted as a miracle, and it's far from expensive.  It is a VERY LONG very difficult treatment, and it doesn't &quot;cure&quot; you.  You have to stay on it the rest of your life or you will revert back, like insulin for some diabetes patients.  And guai is a very cheap generic drug.  It's very easy (as you have yourself said) to get instructions from a doctor, go home and only half follow them, then come back and complain that it's not working.  We've heard from people like that in our support group, and we told them to follow the treatment exactly or don't come whining to us.  Some of them give up and leave the group, some of them stick with it and almost all of those eventually get that &quot;whammo&quot; moment when cycling first starts and they feel like a truck hit them.  For a few of them, it doesn't work.  Maybe they don't have fibromyalgia really, maybe they are blocking and don't realize it, or maybe it really doesn't work for everyone.  St. Amand thinks that it just doesn't work for 5-10% of FMS patients (that figure is from memory, can't find it atm, but it's very small).<br>
<br>
But if the patient doesn't follow the doctor's instructions (or worse, the doctor doesn't understand the treatment himself), then complains it doesn't work, whose fault is that?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> They use what works. They use what has been shown to work. Dr. St. Amand does not.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Why don't you talk to his patients, hundreds of them (that fly from as far as Australia to see him), and the patients of the other hundreds of doctors that use this treatment before coming to that conclusion?  It's true that in fibromyalgia you can't x-ray someone to see if they're better or improving, or give them a blood test.<br>
<br>
There's only one way to find out if a FMS treatment is working, and that is to ask the patient.  So if you go by that criteria, St. Amand's treatment works better than any other in existence.<br>

*takes a few deep breaths*  There was a lady in our support group who had terrible, debilitating problems for years that wrecked her life.

The doctor said &quot;yeah I know, I've known for years that's what you had.  But there's no cure and no treatment so I didn't think there was any point in telling you.&quot;  She left that doctor, did her own research, found a specialist who treated with guaifenesin, and got well.  But she lost years of her life to that doctor's malicious arrogance.<br>
<br>
You should never, ever, ever refuse to tell a patient what they have because &quot;there's no cure and no treatment and so no point in telling them.&quot;  Just because YOU don't know about a treatment doesn't mean there isn't one.  Just because YOU don't think a diagnosis will help the patient doesn't mean it won't.  That is playing God in the very worst sense, and disgusts me.<br>

I don't know this guy at all, but I will point out one of the traps that people fall for, unfortunately you did also Adjani.  Some doctors will often attach a title to there name, associate a university with themselves, to give them an air of legitimacy.<br>
<br>
I believe St. Amand is one of these people.  Firstly, I went to UCLA, and I've never heard of this guy before...but I will give him the benefit of the doubt, since I wasn't that interested in internal medicine.<br>
<br>
The more telling fact, the smoking gun if you will, is his title - Assistant Clinical Professor.  This is the lowest rung on the ladder....kind of funny for someone who has been in practice what, 40+ years?  You think they would have promoted him by now.  The truth is, most (not all) clinical professors are by TITLE ONLY.  It's something nice to put on your business card.  You know what it takes to be an assistant clinical professor?  You just have to give a certain number of hours to the university, which usually involves giving 1 or 2 lectures a year, and perhaps round on patients once a year.  Different schools have different criteria.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I don't know who this guy is, but I do know this whole thing smells funny.  My spidey sense went off, like they always do when I see a doctor advertise himself as a &quot;Clinical Professor&quot;.  I doubt you can find this Dr. St. Amand's name in UCLA's physician registry anywhere.<br>

WHERE DO YOU KEEP GETTING LUMPS from?  The cophenhagen criteria correspond to tender areas only.  No single mention of a 'lump'.   I push, it hurts = tender point.  THERE ARE NO PHYSICAL FINDINGS THAT ARE STRONGLY CORRELATED TO FIBROMYALGIA.  They're all weak, 15-20% incidences.<br>
<br>
you didn't read the textbook clipping... you just read what you wanted to read.<br>
<br>
the textbook didn't say 'lie to the patient'  it said 'why give someone a label when it won't alter their course'?  Why don't i just tell the patient 'you have chronic pain, nothing else is coming back positive, these are our treatment options.'  sure, ill try every treatment in the book, but if i give a patient a label that's it.  did you even read what it said?  Or did you get so blinded by emotion that you skimmed the part about helping the patient symptomatically and not trying to pigeonhole them into a diagnosis.<br>
<br>
if i tell a patient they have fibromyalgia, sure they'll have a name, but they'll also have a whole host of things to worry about.  FM patients are extremely responsive to stress, and cope with depression and anxiety.  up to 70% of people with FM will develop depression.  YAY YOU HAVE A CHRONIC, UNCURABLE DISEASE!  CHEER! I'm gonna try and treat their pain.  If i can't, i will find someone who can.  Giving someone the diagnosis of fibromyalgia will also lead to things like:<br>
   * decreased suspicion of cancer<br>
   * decreased suspicion of other fatal diseases<br>
   * increased prescription of depression medication<br>
   * etc etc<br>
do you understand why labels are bad?  basic medicine here.<br>
<br>
every day doctors make this distinction.  If i label -you- with depression, you will go through the rest of your medical life with that diagnosis on your file.  it will taint how people see you both in and out of the medical community.  I think long and hard whether or not i want to apply a label or just care for my patient.  I apply the label if i think the patient will help them understand why my treatment will work.<br>
<br>
if i 'diagnose' fibromyalgia, then what?  What can I do?  Dr. St. Amand's therapy? Shit.  85% of patients get better?!? jesus fucking christ if there was a treatment then got 85% of FM patients well it would be standard therapy.  use your head.  just think for yourself.   fucking 85% of people get better with this treatment?  fucking tylenol doesn't cure 85% of people of headaches.  If i give antacids to people with ulcers -barely- 85% of people will get better.<br>
<br>
i admit, i'm tired.  i'm cranky stupid babies keep popping out of stupid cooches.  but this is absolute bullshit.  you sarcastically spout joke conspiracy theories yet you offer no plausible reason why the medical community would choose to ignore Dr. St. Amand's therapy.  they wouldn't.  I wouldn't.  <br>
<br>
C'mon adj, lets hear it.  Why is the god-damned medical world ignoring Dr. St. Amand despite the fact that over 30 million people in the world have the disease, and are a huge drain on health resources?    You think doctors like having chronically disabled patients?<br>
<br>
I'm glad you got cured, but i'm not glad that this 'pseudoscience' gets perpetuated by it.  I'm glad Dr. St. Amand makes money off of a chronic disease.  You buy his hoopla, you get better (it's a disease that waxes and wanes, and has a SEVERE response to state of mind and stress), u think he's a miracleworker.   Yay for him.<br>
<br>
You have FM.  You know its tied into the mind.  In periods of stress and anxiety, FM gets much worse.  Wow it's hard to imagine a psychological link isn't it?<br>
<br>
FM is a relapsing/recurring disease.  Waxes and wanes with stress. Highly tied to mood and anxiety.<br>
<br>
Dr. St. amand comes up with a theory, and just by nature of the disease some people will get better.  He claims its due to his treatments, and patients of course offer testimony.  Then, if patients don't get better, he blames salicylates (God damn it, i'm not denying they block the drug, biochemically this is apparently fact.   i'm saying where's the proof they stop people from getting better?  Simple enough to test, yet 0 data.).  HE HAS THE PERFECT THEORY.  Treat it with -whatever-, some people will get better, 'hey its my treatment'.  Patient doesn't get better, 'hey its the salicylates'.  <br>
<br>
You really have to read what i write, and respond to my questions.  I'm not being sarcastic when i ask about conspiracies.  I have no idea why the medical community would ignore potentially zillions of dollars of cost-saving therapy.  why do you think the medical community ignores him?<br>
<br>
You are one person.  If you get better, yay for you, but you have nothing to do with the rest of the FM population.  They are not you.  If there was a treatment that cured or helped 85% of FM patients, it would be handed out like fucking vitamins to every patient who came to the office.  There simply isn't.  Dr. St. Amand has offered 0 proof, only theory, and a poor one that doesn't have any physical correlation.<br>
<br>
You asked me who thinks Dr. St. Amand is a quack?  I do.  My teachers do (After asking them <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> specifically</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->), the rheumatologists at my university hospital do.  Dr. St. Amand hasn't published a single article in any medical journal.  Dr. Bennett has.  He's analysed the use of exercise, group therapy, guaifenesin vs placebo, etc etc etc.  he's trying to help his patients.  Dr. St. Amand is trying to prove his therapy works, and as of yet, hasn't produced anything compelling enough to publish.<br>
<br>
except a book.  no peer review on a book.<br>

<br>
Here's an exact, straightforward explanation of what exactly St. Amand does and has done in his career, and his tie with UCLA (basically he teaches some classes at Harbor-UCLA &quot;pro bono&quot;):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.fludan.com/guaifaq/gen7.html">www.fludan.com/guaifaq/gen7.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
And here you can find him listed on the page of volunteer clinical endocrinologists with Harbor-UCLA:<br>

<br>
The medical center we walk into every time we see him has &quot;UCLA Medical Group, Marina professional&quot; plastered on the front.  You can see it and a few of the doctors that work there at this link:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.healthcare.ucla.edu/MedGrp/MARINA105.HTM">www.healthcare.ucla.edu/M...INA105.HTM</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I think they only list primary care doctors on the site, because none of the specialists in that building are listed (there's 10 or so doctors working in the building, but only 2 listed there).  But if you don't believe me, you can call them and ask...I promise that's where we go for every appointment with him. :P<br>
<br>
Another significant point is that there are a *lot* of doctors working for or tied in with UCLA that also use his treatment -- you can find them listed on his site.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> when I see a doctor advertise himself as a &quot;Clinical Professor&quot;.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
He doesn't advertise it...I brought it up because I thought it was relevant.  UCLA wouldn't associate themselves with a quack, would they?  If they really thought his treatment was bunk and he was duping people out of their money, wouldn't they strip him of his title?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> WHERE DO YOU KEEP GETTING LUMPS from?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
St. Amand and all the doctors that use his methods...they all seem to find the same lumps, at the tender points mainly.  I found lumps before I even knew they were supposed to be there, back when I was reading Devin Starlanyl's book.  I just thought it was swelling because it was sore. /shrug<br>
<br>
Next time you poke a fibromyalgia patient, if it's not too painful for them, poke around and see if you can find the lumps.  Prominent places are the front of the armpits and the top of the shoulders.  I can frequently feel lumps there on myself (not always though, but then again I'm not a doctor and don't really know what I'm looking for).<br>
<br>
I thought you were trying to deny the whole trigger points definition altogether.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Or did you get so blinded by emotion that you skimmed the part about helping the patient symptomatically and not trying to pigeonhole them into a diagnosis.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
&quot;pigeonhole?&quot;  How is it pigeonholing if it's what they really have?  You, obviously, have never been chronically ill without knowing what you had.  I haven't either, really -- well just for a few weeks.  Nascens was for years and years of his life.  He never knew if he was going to die in a day or two, if he were just crazy, or if he had something easily curable if only they knew what it was.  That SUCKS.  To even imply that you should withhold a diagnosis from a patient because YOU think it may not help them is playing God, I'm sorry but that's what I see there.  At the VERY least they can say &quot;yes sir I know what I have, I'm not going to die from it, I'm not crazy, it's fibromyalgia.&quot;  Then they can start a treatment, get into a study, or whatever. <br>
<br>
To me, what he said was &quot;ok, you think (or know) they have fibromyalgia.  Now you have to decide whether to tell them or not.&quot;  The patient is seeing you to find out what he/she has.  To know (or have a pretty good idea) and not tell him is inexcusable, IMO, and just perpetuates mistrust of doctors.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  FM patients are extremely responsive to stress, and cope with depression and anxiety.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Now see that's arrogance again. :P  You think it's uncurable, others may not.  The correct response would be &quot;The good news is I know what you have.  The bad news is, most of the medical community (including me) considers it incurable.&quot;<br>

<br>
No, I don't.  Decreased suspicion of fatal diseases is an ENORMOUS burden off one's anxious. stressed out shoulders, especially since by the time one gets a FMS diagnosis those have generally been ruled out.<br>
<br>
Depression medication...if somebody needs it, why is it bad to prescribe it?  I know people whom it has helped out *enormously*.  I only wish I could find one that helped me, but I have tried nearly all of them and they did nothing.  I do have, interestingly enough, one pain medicine (ultram) that has an antidepressant effect on me -- while none of the actual antidepressants did.  When I take it, I have energy, most of my social anxiety disappears, and I can go places and do things (normally I cannot leave the house without it, anxiety/exhaustion is too bad).  However my body &quot;adjusts&quot; to it very quickly, so I can only use it once or twice a week.  But OMG if I had something like that that worked every day, I could get a job.  I could get my own place.  Maybe I could even start back to school.  Oh the possibilities...<br>
<br>
So what's wrong with antidepressants if they help people *live*?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I apply the label if i think the patient will help them understand why my treatment will work.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think a doctor should make a diagnosis for one reason and one reason alone -- because it is what the doctor truly thinks the patient has.  If you truly think someone has something, there is *no* reason to withold that information from them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> if i 'diagnose' fibromyalgia, then what? What can I do?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You?  I don't know, what can you do?  Nothing?  Ok then, tell them so maybe they can do something themselves.  I sure did, and let me tell you that the BS the normal doctors gave me about exercise and take a muscle relaxer and pain meds to sleep did jack sheet for me.<br>

<br>
And maybe it's not commonly used in Canada, but when we came out to California we were very surprised to hear that almost every doctor we've talked to treats fibromyalgia with guai.  Even the ones who haven't read an iota of St. Amand's theories or research say &quot;can't complain about the results, and it's a harmless drug, may as well use it.&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
And they don't.  Just do a search for sites on fibromyalgia, for fibromyalgia doctors, for fibromyalgia clinics.  Almost every single one talks about the guai treatment in some way, shape, or form, and none (that I have come across), say it's a &quot;quack treatment that patients should under no circumstances try.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm glad you got cured<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I didn't, and I'm getting better a lot more slowly than I should be.  I do have my own doubts, but honestly...this whole discussion has caused me to probe deeper than I have in a long while, and for the most part I'm reassured.<br>
<br>
But then, it's easy to be reassured when you've tried most everything, and then this one (very sketchy sounding at first, I admit) treatment took you off narcotics and out of bed.  And helped and/or &quot;cured&quot; everyone else you know who ever seriously tried it.<br>
<br>
BTW I put &quot;cured&quot; in quotation marks because St. Amand doesn't consider this a cure.  A real cure, according to him, would be genetic alteration...which of course is, at this point, impossible.  He just considers this a &quot;fix&quot; like plugging a leak, but as long as you take it you should stay clear.<br>

<br>
No.  First off, I bought no &quot;hoopla&quot; ever until I saw results.  I saw no results from the other treatments I got, other than temporary relief of symptoms.  I saw results from this treatment.<br>
<br>
Second off, I have had back pain, *constant* back pain, since I was 13 years old.  It got worse through the years, but at NO point was I ever free of it.  I thought it was just the &quot;family back pain&quot; I got from daddy, and like daddy, I had to take ibuprofen before I went to dancing, before show choir, after a long day, etc.  Ok daddy wasn't in show choir or dancing, but he took ibuprofen before physical activity or after stress. :P<br>
<br>
On this treatment, after a year and a half, I was completely free of back pain for the first time in 7 years.  That was nearly half of my lifetime.  During &quot;cycles&quot; a bit of it has come back (not even requiring ibuprofen), mainly in my neck and shoulders, but I haven't had any lower back pain in probably 6 months to a year now...not even the tiniest hint of back pain, no matter how long I sit at a computer and how bad my posture is.<br>

Fibromyalgia is definitely precipitated by stress, trauma, illness, an accident, etc.  Mine was triggered by stress.  However, my very worst fibromyalgia was during a time in which I had no stress whatsoever.  It is certainly true that it gets worse with stress, like most any illness, but it also &quot;cycles&quot; on its own or...dare I say it...with guai. :P  However, what it does not do on its own (very often, at least) is cycle more and more lightly until finally there are no cycles and just good days.<br>

How many people will really get better on their own though?  I seem to remember that it's a very small percentage of total fibromyalgia cases.  Also, I consider being &quot;better&quot; as having hardly any restrictions on one's life.  None of this &quot;you must not have a stressful job, you must rest 14 hours per day, you must not have kids and a job at the same time, you must not...&quot; blah blah.  I want a cal-tech degree in nanotechnology, I want a stressful, prestigious, difficult job, I want to be a political activist, I want to be a dancer, I want to be a writer, and I want to run for congress someday.  Is that too much to ask? :P /duck<br>

<br>
Then what about the other 200 &quot;cures&quot; for fibromyalgia that are out there?  The quacks I've read up on all have a cop out, they are all generally very convincing, etc.  But they don't get nearly the following of St. Amand, nor the attention from the whole medical profession, nor the results.<br>
<br>
There's a simple fact about the guai treatment that is the real kicker, and gets people &quot;hooked&quot; more than anything else.  If you take guai and you're a healthy person, it should have no effect whatsoever...it's cough medicine, of all things.  If you take guai, and you have fibromyalgia, you feel NASTY.  It really, really hits you like a truck at first, as long as you're not blocking.  So somebody starts the treatment half-heartedly and still uses his aloe skin lotion...ok, nothing happens.  He asks his doctor why nothing is happening, doctor says quit using the damn lotion.  He stops using the lotion and the next day he's in bed feeling like sheet.<br>
<br>
Just the simple fact that any common, harmless drug could cause a reaction like that shows you that *something* is working.  And that's what convinces so many people to stick it out and really try not to use the products with salicylates.  And of those who stick it out, well, most get better.  That's what keeps me going.<br>

<br>
THEY DON'T.  Most think that there is not enough evidence to prove his theories 100%, since patient success rate is not considered evidence in this day and age.  I can accept that.  A whole hell of a lot of doctors still use the treatment anyway, saying success rate is enough for them.  Honestly, most doctors who use the treatment were talked into it by their patients.  First they humored them, saying what the hell it can't hurt anything.  Then they saw the improvement.  Then they read up and tried other patients on it, and saw their improvement.  That's how most all the doctors I've talked to that use the treatment came to do so.  DOCTORS TELL ME IT WORKS.  Most of them say I don't know why, but it works, so I use it.  I'm guessing it has not &quot;caught on&quot; as much in Canada as it has in the U.S., but if you have contacts with U.S. doctors I encourage you to try to find some who use the treatment and ask them why they do.  There's a long list of ones who use the treatment in the link I gave you above.<br>

<br>
If you can prove that it really does help 85% of patients.  But you can't, or at least you can't until you can fund a study to do so.  A lot of doctors have had it &quot;proven&quot; to them just by watching their own patients.  But St. Amand says it helps 85% of his patients, so the medical community is just supposed to believe that?  Of course not, so they set up a study.  The study was flawed, but Bennett thinks it wasn't (Bennett's the one who ran the study and ignored St. Amand's warnings, so of course he doesn't want to think his study was flawed), so they think the discussion is over.  St. Amand, a bunch of doctors, and a whole bunch of patients think another study is warranted so they are working on funding it.<br>

Are you sure about that?  I can't say that I've ever asked him (and I don't read medical journals), but I do know he's spoken at most every major fibromyalgia center in the country, and is published all over the internet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Dr. Bennett has.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah.  Dr. Bennett is the one who asked St. Amand to speak to the Oregon fibromyalgia association (or whatever it's called), thought his theory made GOOD SCIENTIFIC SENSE and was fascinating, and suggested running the study.  Like I have said earlier, the point they disagree on is very minor and technical.  Other than that, Dr. Bennett thinks very highly of St. Amand's theories and practices.<br>

Jeez guys, you are just digging and TRYING to do whatever you can to make this guy and me look like idiots and frauds.  If you had done an iota more searching, like I did, you would have come across the information I linked to above.  You can call the numbers if you don't believe me.<br>
<br>
He never, ever misrepresented himself.  He put exactly what he is on his website, he never advertised it or forced it on anyone, and I'm looking at his business card and he doesn't even have UCLA on there (even though it's written on the building he works in).  If you think I misrepresented what he is, fine shoot me, but I'm not him and I don't speak for him, and all these opinions are MINE and don't necessarily represent his accurately.  In fact I know several of mine disagree with his.  But I'm doing my best to defend a treatment that I am pretty darn sure works, and that I researched pretty thoroughly before becoming convinced.  You'd probably do better to just read his website anyhow.<br>
<br>
BTW I had forgotten this (more evidence that you should be getting info from the site and not from me :P).  They have decided, instead of saving up to fund a double-blind study (which is quite expensive so they say, and under scrutiny as of late for the potential flaws inherent), that they are giving their money to a Scripps genetic study.  He explained to me exactly what they're doing, but I forgot, possibly trying to isolate the gene?  They hope that if that study proves successful, it will instigate more funding for a double-blind study and put the doubts to rest once and for all.<br>
<br>
In conclusion (ok one conclusion), people, I think there are intelligent folks out there that are not doctors.  I think those people are capable of seeking out and finding theories and evidence, testing hypotheses, and forming conclusions of their own.  I think it can be easily ascertained through intelligent discussion whether that person has their wits about them or not, and whether his or her opinion and intellect are worth a hill of beans.  And if it is, it seems worthy to at least take into account his or her experiences and opinions.  So!  If I have been ascertained to be not one of the intelligent people, whose personal experiences, research, conclusions, and opinions count for nothing, just tell me so I can go play instead of wasting time typing these long responses. :P  And no, I don't consider &quot;being smart but duped into thinking a placebo is a real cure and that a quack is really a genius who discovered the cause and treatment for fibromyalgia&quot; as plausible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uhsianlichen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hsian Li Chen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Lanys.com Moderator</B></FONT></span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/8/02 9:44:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2562.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Medical Profession today..</span><hr size=1> holy shit.  goddamned ezboard ate my post.  fuck.  fucking hour of my time.

ok i give. thanks ezboard.<br>
<br>
Adj.  You are too emotionally wrapped up in the subject to read what i'm writing carefully, and it seems every point i make you seem to either take offense to or completely misread.  <br>
<br>
#1 - Dr. St. Amand has the responsibility to his patients and FM patients around the world to publish his results.  Double-blind placebo controlled would be nice, but how bout starting it off with a fucking retrospective chart review.  Get a fucking national grant.  FM costs $2,400/year/patient, and with &gt;6 million patients in US alone, we're talking billions of dollars.  You don't think the government would sponsor a study?  <br>
<br>
#2 - he has the patients, in his own 'rebuttal' to the oregon study he states that another study should be done.  WELL HE FUCKING HAS THE PERFECT SETUP.  He has patients off of all salicylates (which by the way, do -not- interfere with Guaifenesin at high enough doses, ie) an aspirin a day)<br>
<br>
#3 - I've poked and prodded many patients with FM.  I've poked and prodded many patients without FM.  There is no difference between the two groups, exclusionary of pain on poking and prodding.  No physical lump to find.  If there was, it would be biopsied and we'd have the answer.<br>
<br>
#4 - when i wrote pigeonholed into a diagnosis, i mean add a label that will carry with them for life.  You're right, it's good to know you don't have cancer.  And for sure I'd tell the patient that.  However, the next time you come to the office with a headache and weight gain, and i read you are a FM patient, i'm much less likely to consider cancer in my diagnosis.  I'm much less likely to investigate it, and if you had it, it would be detected much later.  that is -not- good.<br>
<br>
This is what I would tell a patient:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Well, Ms. Adjani.  I understand you're having chronic pain, and you'd obviously like to know the source.  We find no evidence of cancer, or any other disease that would really worry us.  We could be dealing with arthritis, either rheumatoid or osteo, but we have found no evidence for it.  It could be an early osteoporosis, but again, we have no evidence for this.  It could be a neurological disorder, but every test we've done shows us your nerves are just fine.  It could be a disease called fibromyalgia, but again, we have no way of showing this through tests.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the treatment for these conditions will be mostly the same.  This is going to be a long process, and I promise we have a number of treatments and medications to try.  The most important thing is that you tell me what works for you and what doesn't.  This is going to be a long process, but I will be working with you to try and find the solution I know you want.  Does that sound reasonable to you?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That would be how i approach a patient with chronic pain.  I don't feel i'm playing god by not labelling them.<br>
<br>
#5 - &quot;Are you sure about that? I can't say that I've ever asked him (and I don't read medical journals), but I do know he's spoken at most every major fibromyalgia center in the country, and is published all over the internet.&quot;  Yes I am sure.  The only article i ever found he published was in the same journal Bennett published his placebo study.  It was a rebuttal argument with 0 data to back it up.  I searched on every major medical database that exists, and his name didn't pop up but that once.  That's really sad for 43 years of practice, research, etc.<br>
<br>
#6 - if you are feeling you are being helped, I am very happy for you.  Why do you automatically assume that just because I'm saying it has to do with your attitude and belief in the system, that I'm saying a bad thing?  The point is whether or not you're getting better.  You have this desire to have a 'proven physical disease', yet you don't have one.  You have a cluster of symptoms that have no correlation with other patients with different clusters.  <br>
<br>
#7 - www.myalgia.com  ... go to it.  Dr. Bennett's website.  He's not selling anything, he's publishing data and help for patients.  You can read quite clearly how Dr. St. Amand's salicylate theory is refuted, how FM is really treated, and how he feels on the subject.  I see no mention of 'sound theory'.  He says 'they seem to be helped, but i tested guai and it isn't the thing that works'.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.myalgia.com/guaifspe.htm">Specifically read this work.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  Dr. St. Amand dismisses it as do you sarcastically by mentioning how weak a 'personality' argument is.  But read the whole thing.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What kind of treatments are phosphatidic? I mean, are there treatments out there that affect phosphate levels or anything?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Sure... any diuretic that act on proximal renal tubules will affect phoshpate (eg Diamox).  Oral calcium (calcium gluconate) will bind phosphate in the GI tract and excrete it as Calcium Phosphate.  Drugs like Sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel) -- Lowers serum phosphate to near normal.  <br>
<br>
Dr. St. Amand proposes Guai works through a phosphate measure, though no evidence has been found of this.  So it could be phosphatidic.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> THEY DON'T. Most think that there is not enough evidence to prove his theories 100%, since patient success rate is not considered evidence in this day and age. I can accept that. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> He could easily publish patient success rate, but that would require data, which he doesn't have.  Simple publication: No. of patients seen with FM.  No. of patients treated with guaifenesin.  No. of patients symptomatically better.  It would get the ball rolling at least...<br>
regardless, the only study done on guai wasn't done by the guy that works with guai.  Wow... that's pretty amazing.<br>
<br>
i had a much longer post, but sorry, it got wiped.  pretty pissed about that.  gonna go work off my frustrations by playing with people's titles.<br>
