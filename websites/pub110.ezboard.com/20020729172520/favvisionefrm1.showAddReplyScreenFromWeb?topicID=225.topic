Story</span><hr size=1> Venturing through the lands of Kunark, when I had received word from many friends that the mighty dragon Trakanon had arisen, and needed to be destroyed before he could harm the people of the island. I decided to help in this venture, and headed towards the ruins of the ancient city Sebilis.<br>
<br>
With new items in hand to aid me in my journeys, and my upcoming adventure, I prepared myself to aid in the defeat of this mighty foe. As I approached the entrance to this city, I saw the souls of many who had fallen to the wrath of Trakanon. As I tried to enter the city, I found a locked door. And having remembered hearing from friends that the key was easily attainable from the undead emperor. <br>
<br>
I searched the lands around the entrance to find the 2 monsters that I needed to slay for the right to earn a key for the ancient city. After finding them, I quickly dispatched of them and turned in my proof of my victory, and in turn, got the key to enter the city.<br>
<br>
When I entered the city, the stench of decay and must was quite overwhelming. But I was not alone when I entered the city. Not only were my friends there waiting for me, but several foes stood in our way in an attempt to keep us from their lord. Little did they know the power that was about to devastate the city they called home.<br>
<br>
We formed up 8 groups of our mightiest companions and began the descent into the ancient city, destroying everything in our path. As we ventured further and further, we began to hear a low rumble echoing through the halls. Thinking we were getting close, we began to ready ourselves for the upcoming battle. As we got closer to the dragon, we encountered mighty guardians, that came to be known as Juggernauts. Their ferocity in combat was un-matched by anything we had ever seen before, and they punished our raiding party severely. But like all the monsters before them, they fell to our might.<br>
<br>
We then entered a great catacomb, where the rumbling voice filled the air with an evil bellow that made everyone cringe. Not sure of just what we were up against, we decided to rest up in safety before adventuring further. When we had finished mending our wounds and resting for the battle, we ventured into the catacomb. Trakanon was there, seemingly waiting for us. &quot;Wait,&quot; he said in a voice that shook the very ground we stood upon, &quot;are you mortals sure about what you are considering?&quot; Everyone froze dead in their tracks. &quot;You do not comprehend the power of what you are about to attack. All I will do is give you one warning, turn back now, or join the hundreds of souls that surround the entrance to this city.&quot;<br>
<br>
As we sat and thought, one of the men yelled out at the top of his lungs, &quot;YOU WILL DIE YOU FOUL CREATURE!!!!&quot;. And with that, we all charged at Trakanon. For the first second of the combat he did almost nothing, apparently stunned that we actually went after him. But that was only the first second of the battle. <br>
<br>
Trakanon's eyes filled with rage as he began his attack on the intruders of his domain. The battle would last for 13 hours. Neither side was able to obtain the upper hand in the battle for the first 8 hours of the battle. But with one surge of adrenaline, the battle quickly moved into our favor. The dragon was surrounded. And as the attacks came in from all directions, another yell was heard by a warrior &quot;NOW!!!&quot;. With that command, the wizards and mages began a magical assault on Trakanon like none he had ever seen. As the magical blasts of fire and ice began to rain down on the dragon, he began to weaken. Seeing this only made us fight harder. All of the guys on the front lines, gave everything they could possibly pull from the depths of their souls to slay this mighty beast. Even after seeing their friends fall in combat, they continued the assault.<br>
<br>
The dragon was staggering by now, but still attacking us with everything he had (which even though the dragon was weakened, was still a very powerful force). As the last few blows were landed on Trakanon that would end his life, he said to us, &quot;Remove my heart, and scatter my ashes on the wind, so I may finally fly again.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that the Dragon Known as Trakanon lay at our feet, motionless. Feeling compassion for the dragon, one of the Paladins complied with Trakanon's wishes, burning his heart, and placing the ashes into a container, so that he may let them out in the air in the mountains of Skyfire, home of the dragons. <br>
<br>
Once the Paladin finished cremating Trakanon's heart, a chest appeared in place of the dragon's body. Inside the chest were 4 breastplates. One was the dark blue color of Cobalt, one was the dark green breastplate of the mysterious Singing Steel, and to the bards that came with us to aid in slaying Trakanon, it seemed to have a melodic hum emmitting from it. The third one in the chest was recognized by the paladin immediately as the breastplate forged from the ancient Deepwater metals. The fourth breastplate however was a mystery to us as to what it was. It was blood red in color, and had an evil glow to it. Trying to equip it by many of the people that helped slay Trakanon caused them immense pain and anguish. When from the shadow's approached an Ogre. All of his armor, except for his breastplate matched the breastplate inside the chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;The breastplate is mine.&quot; said the mysterious Ogre. Which shocked us all, because every Ogre we had encountered before had an extremely limited vocabulary, and carried themselves a bit more clumsily. &quot;The reason I know this breastplate is mine is because it was made especially for me. The breastplate was made by a friend of mine and as he was on his way to deliver me the breastplate, he was abducted by Trakanon's minions. As you can see from the other breastplates in that chest, my friend had the capability to make very powerful armor. And because of the threat this would pose, Trakanon had him abducted and killed. Now, all that I ask is that you let me have my breastplate. So that I may have something to remember him with. You may keep the other 3, but I would like mine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not sure about this Ogre, one of our rogues decided to question the Ogre about whether or not he was lying. As he approached the Ogre, the Ogre raised his hand, and from the ground, sprang up 2 hands, that grasped the rogue's feet tightly, and couldn't be removed. <br>
<br>
&quot;I will take it if I have to.&quot; The Ogre said, &quot;But I do not see what is so unreasonable about asking to have one thing to remember my dearest friend by.&quot;<br>
<br>
Picking up the blood red breastplate, I approached the Ogre and held it out to him. Tears began to build up in his eyes, as he clasped the breastplate and began to cry. After about 5 minutes, he gathered himself and put the breastplate on. A bright light flashed out from the seems of his armor, as if the breastplate completed something. An unholy aura began to fill the air around him as he began to walk around. &quot;Thank you my friends, you have made me very happy.&quot; and having said that the Ogre handed a scroll to one of the clerics and vanished into thin air. The hands holding the rogue to the ground dispersed quickly after the Ogre vanished.<br>
<br>
After reading the scroll for an hour, the cleric gasped and said, &quot;My lord, we can bring our friends back with us if they wish to return to this realm of consciousness.&quot; Tears of joy flowed from all of our eyes, knowing that we did not have to lose our dear friends. Several hours passed, and one by one, our friends returned to life to be greeted by the people they loved.<br>
<br>
Everyone was filled with pride and joy as we ventured out of the city. We knew that we could return to our families, and grow old with them, knowing we would not have to fear an attack from this evil dragon. Once we got outside, the souls that once surrounded the city's entrance were no longer there, and the land seemed to be at peace once again. <br>
