<br>
so ok, after reading through the first 4 pages and seeing mostly the same posts from the same people over and over again i finally just decided to jump to the end..<br>
Now,this is a very good idea, BUT here is the major flaw..nothing to do with timestamps and what not..now,you have people who do not powergame in eq,then you have those that do..you also have to take in effect the time zones..U.S. is 6 to 10 hours difference than overseas..now giving this cercumstance what is fair? the guy  on U.S. standard time that power games and waits up to that time point and makes sure he is first to post or that other person trying to get his sleep because he lives farther away or has to be at work on the weekends or what have you that doesnt have a chance because when he gets up its already too late..that overnight power gamer gets his in first? this to me seems more like first come first served sorry you live somewhere else and have to sleep so you lose out..works both ways in states and overseas..is there a possible fix for this..hmm i think so..STOP trying to be exact on the minute of someones post..put some leeway in it..im sure people would be more appreciative of it..say perhaps a 6 hour grace period for posting.. EXAMPLE..someone wants to post on saturday for raid but has to go to sleep and cant wait for that midnight pacific time..what do we do? we give everyone a 6 HOUR grace..in other words the other time zone or non power gaming people could post on friday night but only 6 hours in advance..this makes it possible for everyone to have a chance at posting so the powergamers dont sneak one in and cheat everyone else out of a raid..YES YES this idea is not flawless and the same powergamer people would just go in and post earlier BUT at least it gives those other people a chance to get thier post in also....<br>
<br>
or heres another situation i see way too much..you get that common raid leader who decides he wants to post the whole week for a mob..he posts sunday through saturday..hmm everyday? wheres the equal time for all the other raid leaders? they cant post now because this guys has already posted for everyday of the week..does this  guy get penalized? no he doesnt because he posted in the time frame..doesnt sound like that fairness everyone is talking about to me..so whats the alternative? raid leaders have to post further ahead..not good because now they just got B-listed because of someone else who posted on time but did not show the courtesy to leave any opens days for someone else..<br>
<br>
also wanted to note..you mentioned to one of the newer server members that the calendar is not a planned my time only but just an info page to let other raid leaders know not to bring someone else in out of respect..in all actuallity this is planned time or else everyone would be in the same place all the time..its planned time that is hopefully repsected by all..<br>
<br>
well anyways not saying my ideas are the best or are better than anyone elses but i hope to see maybe they get taken into consideration..not everyone is in an uberguild or has all the extra spare time to live on the boards..basically though if anyone wants any real fairness then the only true action would be to get multiple moderators that are impartial to all..perhaps if enough people send leolan an email maybe we can get him to come back temporarily to help the possible new moderator out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ..who knows..<br>

<br>
Harne's only one fellow.  :) He's not leading so many raids that people have no chance to raid when and where they want to.  He tries to lead a variety of raids (in my opinion), so he's not monopolizing any zone, either.<br>
<br>
Even if he did decide he would only raid PoH, for instance, and would raid it every chance he got... Because of the two week rule on the calendar, and because he follows it, he has no more chance of getting his raid scheduled when he wants than other raid leaders.  He's on equal footing with everyone else when it comes to scheduling raids.  If he gets nice times, its because nobody else has taken them.<br>
<br>
The very fact that Harne is able to schedule quite a few raids at decent times is a testament to the fact that the two week rule works fairly and well.  He got those raids scheduled by following the two week rule, and every other raid leader has an equal opportunity to do the exact same thing. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://personal.sdf.bellsouth.net/sdf/t/j/tjwork/dreams.jpg"></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ujittanlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JittanLanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/27/02 1:25:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2190.topic&index=124>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid Blacklist</span><hr size=1> /wave Copp, long time no see. get sukkwin killed a few times please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

I see a distinct possibility (more like probability knowing human nature as I do) of some people using their blacklist as a method for getting back at someone they don't like.  Or some leaders' follower to remark that &quot;so and so&quot; is blacklisted even though they aren't, and start a snowball effect.<br>
<br>
I've hunted with Harne and Kiras several times, and trust them both impeccably,  However, I do not fully trust all of their followers, nor any leader I do not know personally. So the only way this will ever work is if the open raid leaders agreeing to this post their complete blacklist daily. Yuck!<br>
<br>
All this puts me in a situation I do not care for.  The first innocent person directly or indirectly hurt by anyone's blacklist, will place that person's leader, and only their leader, on my blacklist. After all, they obviously would never ask me for help, so no biggie, right...<br>

<br>
Guys, if there is an early post, post again on top of it, and in your post on the raid page simply state that the previous post by 'whoever&quot; was pre-2 week.  Then wait for the &quot;but it was midnight my time&quot; dance, but most peeps will understand which way to go.<br>
<br>
To be honest, if I find out that a raid was posted early or that there is even a rumor of an early post, I will not go, period.  So if someone wants to police the boards, so be it.<br>

<br>
The point of the list is to provide a discouragement to people who do not follow the calandar rules.  The calandar rules are posted in such a way as to make the calandar a better tool for communication between the smaller guilds.<br>
<br>
Having your name on Harne's blacklist simply means that Harne will not invite you to go on one of his excellent open raids.  The majority of the high-end players do not need to go on open raids, do not know there is a blacklist, wouldn't care if you told them, and would not lose any sleep if they were on it.<br>
<br>
As for &quot;running over a posted raid&quot; FL tries very hard not to, and generally succeeds.  I cannot think of a single case where we &quot;ran over&quot; a raid, though we have asked people to stand aside for a couple minutes in the arena while we killed Tormax.  We do talk to raid leaders and in the rare cases of conflict, we make arrangements for sharing, and we will generally do everything we can do to make sure both sides get as much out of the agreement as possible.<br>
<br>
The blacklist is a good idea.  It will help stop people from abusing the calandar and make it more usable for the other calandar guilds. <p><center><img src="http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/29/2468929.jpg" border="0">

<br>
I ALWAYS make the listing first on the boards than place it on the calendar. This gives me the chance to make a link to the board post so when people click on the Event on the calendar, they can jump to the boards. It also gives me a timestamp. <br>
<br>
I'm in the CST time zone so add  2 more hours to the post on these time stamps. <br>
<br>
These are my time stamps (PST) when I first posted on the Boards. Add a few more minutes because I made the Board post first then made the calendar post second. <br>
<br>
PoH 4/27/02  (4/15/02 6:47:04 am) - Note: 12 days <br>
HoT 5/2/02 (4/18/02 1:10:18 pm)<br>
PoF 5/3/02 (4/19/02 9:05:03 am)<br>
HoT 5/10/02 (4/26/02 12:35:10 pm) - this is past noon PST<br>
<br>
I don't camp the calendar. I don't try to beat people to posting on the calendar. From the time stamps on these, there was plenty of time for people to post ahead of me. If they did, it's ok with me because I can just raid somewhere else or do it a different day/time.  I don't try and monopolize zones. As Copper said .. I'm only one guy.<br>
<br>
If someone REALLY wanted to post for an area, they can post at 12.01 am PST (past midnight)... 14 days prior to the event. This gives a &quot;start&quot; time when that day becomes available for posting on the calendar. <br>
<br>
I disagree with having a 6 hour window as it just makes posting on the calendar more complicated than it really is. I know that there are some places that people &quot;really&quot; want. But personally, no zone is worth really losing sleep over. <br>
<br>
As I have said before, making MY list will be the result of BLATANTLY disregarding the calendar rules and thereby, disrespecting all the other raid leaders that try and adhere to the calendar rules.  I try to be fair and even take time from playing ingame just to talk to people before they decide that a raid is worth ruining your reputation with other raid leaders.  <br>
<br>
Many raid leaders support me in this because they want it to be as fair as possible too. <br>
<br>
As I have ALSO said about higher-end guilds before... wait... just go back to page 6 and read my post there... I keep saying the same thing over and over anyway...<br>

By the way, from what I understand the calendar and whats considered a calendar raid is discussed by the guild leaders in the guild leader forum. All the guild leaders in the forum participating atleast agree in principle with whats discussed there. I cann't see all liking it, but they tend to atleast agree or understand whats the deal.<br>
<br>
So all this argu ...... um discussion really is moot. Talk to you guild leader. Make sure they are voicing your concerns in the guild leader forum. If you are the leader of your guild, then get into the guild leader forum and find out whats going on and the reasons behind it. Then if you want to discuss it, they are the ones you need to discuss it with.<br>

The 2 week rule is set and it should be followed.  The popular slogan of &quot;rules are meant to be broken&quot; is not fair and does not make you out to be a respected RL.  As stated earlier here or on another post, everyone including myself flocks to Harne's raids.  Reason being a range from his ability to raid well to respecting the rules and &quot;practicing what he preaches&quot;.  I have more respect for people who abide by the rules instead of breaking them.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Harne&gt;  It was brought to my attention that there may be a rule about hosting the same raid 2 days in a row with exceptions like PoA.  Can you or anyone else justify this?  As a apprentice raid leader, I do not want to start off breaking rules, nor end up experienced and still breaking them.  Thanks.<br>

Seriously though.. That's not a bad idea all together.  I woulden't be very much differant than when Ist (God rest his soul) was admin of the calender.. <br>
<br>
As I recollect, in the end.. Ist no longer respected the calendar in the sence that he took DW to be a FFA guild.<br>

Tali might just make a good admin, due to the fact that he has absolutly no vested interest whatsoever..

<br>
Anyways i do have one simple question..<br>
<br>
If i am just bumming around, killing bunnys in EW and recieve a tell asking me to help out on a raid and i agree, would i get blacklisted if it was an &quot;illegal raid&quot;??<br>
<br>
Basicly i guess what i am saying is i am in the game to have fun, and will generally help out if asked and am not buisy. But now with this policy i could be blacklisted for helping some one because i dont say.. Wait a min, i need to log off and check the calender to make sure its ok for me to assist you in your raid, brb should take no more than 10 min???<br>
<br>
Well i hope i dont end up on the list, but either way,i will play as i choose and if that meens more dead bunnys and less quest armor then i guess Gratz to the people that win the pieces i was not there for.. <p>Stoneknife.. 55 Shaman<BR>

<br>
I've stayed silent on this thread, tho watched it carefully. Regarding Taliesn's post the summary is three words:<br>
<br>
Conflict of Interest.<br>
<br>
He is the last person who should moderate it. It should be done by someone who actually believes in it. Who follows it, and uses it as a communication tool. Who respects that for the 95% of the server who are NOT in the biggest 3-4 guilds, who are populated by SOME who think they are above it now, it is respected by almost all. Not by someone who openly says 'I don't look at it, and I don't give a shit what it says'. And most of all, not by someone who himself plans and runs many raids but of course secretly, and for whom in the future would be in his interest to 'delete' raids that might conflict with his wishes. To be above all suspicion, the calendar moderator cannot be the leader of on the the large FFA guilds.<br>
<br>
Frankly, all it needs is someone who will look at it dayly and remove posts that are more than 2 weeks ahead, but not worry too much about 1 or 2 hours (I mean, does it really have to be that* precise?).<br>
<br>
There is no way I'd want this task, but even I would take it on rather than see someone like Taliesn use it for his own political ends.<br>
<br>
I would suggest someone like Harne himself take on Calendar mod role, if he wants it. I know him not, but he seems to command the respect of many open raiders and smaller guilds, those who actually USE, NEED and RESPECT the calendar.<br>

<br>
As for the calendar, I NEVER said I don't give a shit about it, I just don't think it works when ppl are posting shit like lower guk, something I said OVER a year ago would happen eventually once people become overpussified by it.  <br>
<br>
I don't post there, because my communication tool consists of this:<br>
<br>
If I it drops loot my guild needs, it's not engaged, I will kill it.<br>
<br>
There ya go, there's your communication.  I have all these agendas and personal schemes of secrecy, yet you really have zero examples to prove this.  Harne would be an EXCELLENT choice, as he works hard, he's a GREAT guy, and I trust him implicitly, however, if no one were willing to do it, I offered to help.  I gain nothing from moderating the calendar, like I said before, there's nothing in the game I can't go kill if I want it.  Period.  I'd say that makes me about as unbiased as it gets /shrug. <p><img src="http://www.gloryroad.net/~arathorn/talisig.jpg"><BR>

If it is the raid I am thinking of, the raid leader invited us in after we had waited for them to have their raid for several hours and they were winding down, almost ready to leave.  The raid leader simply didn't bother telling everyone we had been invited, until a couple loudmouths started screaming that we were running over their raid.  <br>
<br>
We were asked to go in, and from their raid chat (which we were asked to join) it was evident they were down to their last cleric and that cleric had to leave soon.  All epic and armor drops went to them, regardless, but a few people didn't get the info from the raid leader that we were invited and that their raid was basically finished. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uharne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Harne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/29/02 1:32:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2190.topic&index=140>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid Blacklist</span><hr size=1> Zostrik - There is no rule about posting for consecutive days.

<br>
Tal and Feli, thanks for the vote of confidence. I have tossed my name in the hat for calendar mod but we'll see where that goes.<br>
<br>
For the higher-end FFA guilds there really is only one rule: If it is up and no one has it, I can go for it. <br>
<br>
As for higher-end raiding guilds and interfering with calendared raids, you would be surprised at what a little communication can do. Communicate in a civil and fair manner. Starting out with a hostile attitude just begs for more trouble.  <br>
<br>
For example, whenever Taliesn and I are raiding the same area, we always have a little chat about things. Sometimes my raid has to be patient and other times Tal's raid has to wait for us (and this has happened - they did wait).  It's a matter of respect. In all the instances when Taliesn and I have had our raids in the same zone, we have always tried to find a compromise.  There was no &quot;bull-dozing&quot;.  I have alot of respect for Fallen Legacy because of how Taliesn runs his guild. Taliesn may be a bit opinionated and vocal about alot of things. He can be down-right irritating at times but he does try to be as fair as possible.  If one of his own does something stupid/wrong, you can bet that Taliesn will do his damndest to try and make it right.  <br>
<br>
There are a those that still believe that might makes right. Some guilds don't bother communicating and just take it. That, in my humble opinion, makes it even more wrong. You'll have asses and you'll have good guys in higher-end guilds just like you would in smaller guilds. <br>
<br>
How you deal with people reflects on you as much as it reflects on them.  <p><img src="http://members.aol.com/grayeman/Harne.jpg"><BR>
