Is it a &quot;cheat&quot; or &quot;exploit&quot; to swim into a corner with numlock pressed?<br>

Also, are there programs out there that allow you to explore zones without being connected to the server?

<br>
From what I understand, such things as current mob hps, level, loots, PC level/location, current mobs up in a zone (and probably some more that can't think of right now) can be displayed for you.<br>
<br>
You need a linux box to run it (There used to be a winshoweq, but Brad sniffed people's Windows task lists when EQ started up, and banned anyone running it. It caused quite a fuss, but I agree with what he did.), and you have to route your network traffic across a LAN for showeq to be able to sniff it. Thankfully, not too many people have that particular setup, or want to bother, so its use is limited. It does make the game unfair though, which I thoroughly dislike. It is cheating, and cheating is lame. <p><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=81496">Dolalin</a> Bonewielder<br>

  They may mean &quot;item dopeing (or duping?) Where a player/cheater just works some cheat and boof, you have a +5 Sword of Uber-Uberness. The back up copies of the char may be able to show if an item was doped. ie, if Macoy shows up with his epic and full Plane Armor tomorrow, it should be easy to show a cheat was used. (seeing how today I have no Plane Armor or any parts of my epic done)<br>
<br>
  But as far as trade scams, as long as they allow people to play, you will have trade scams. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Correct. Code hacks (ala diablo where you could walk around inside walls, have a arrow that dealt 3000 damage per hit, etc) do not exist in EQ.<br>
<br>
SEQ is a data reader, while being a third party program, it is not a bot. It can and does give you an advantage over players not using it. <p>[55 Blackguard] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96718" title="Magelo profile">Harabakc Taintedblade</a> (Dwarf)

<br>
a) use is very hard to track and therefore often people, including GM staff, know someone is using it because people who use it can disrupt a server by always being first at a camp when something spawns, always knowing (on a PvP server) where opposing team members are - and therefore attacking constantly, etc. .. in short, messing the game up for all the good intention people. Rarely are people using it ever actually caught to my knowledge.<br>
<br>
b) Allows a user to 'listen' in to the GM channel! This capability constantly thwarts efforts to catch these idiots who use it since guides and GMs often discuss petitions (and believe me .. there are lots of those about suspected Show EQ use) on that channel. When they hear their names being discussed, Show EQ users immediately make themselves scarce - either logging or moving to another zone quickly (VERY quickly - as in instantly on occasion .. hmmm how DID they do that? LOL) and getting friends to back them up with alibis. <br>
<br>
c) Even if caught and banned, there is nothing to prevent a Show EQ user from just starting all over again - and they do .. constantly. Some people will proudly tell even guides their ban history. The only advantage of making them start over is that .. for a short while while they are being P'L'd back up to their previous level, they are harassing another set of people and one set gets a short rest. <br>
<br>
It is a sick crowd that gets their jollies out of using EQ to prevent others from having a good time. I consider it definitely a CHEAT for the above reasons. <br>

It's not all powerfull but can be convenient for several things.<br>
<br>
The first that comes to mind is 100% reliable zone wide track, you can't know what is up in a zone you are not though.<br>
<br>
You can also have some idea of the loot some mobs have, since you know if a mob is weilding a weapon and what type of weapon model (info used to display the mob). You could also know if Vulak will be dropping a Brother Xave's headband since it's a lightsource.<br>
<br>
At the time the hp of mobs were reported you could also know the exact hp of mobs, before and during fights. But this got changed since the server now only sends the percentage of hp remaining to allow mobs to have more than 32k hp.<br>
<br>
I am very sceptical on the ability of ShowEQ to intercept tells, since I can't see a reason why they would be sent to your client if you are not suposed to receive them.<br>
<br>
I am sure you can't insta zone around with ShowEQ. You can ask Sepnir how long it takes to get baned if you use a hack that allows you to do this. I believe it's about 15min...<br>
<br>
It is clear that ShowEQ is not a cheat of the magnitude of creating your own items, boosting your char artificialy or being invulerable, things that are not possible in EQ. It is also not has bad in my eyes as duplicating items or using way of killing mobs that does not allow them to fight back. But it is still a cheat that effects the balance of the game since it boosts the ability to gather informations. A guild that suports ShowEQ can know very fast what is up or what is not and act accordingly, their puller also have an easier job since they know at every moment where all the mobs are and the guild can elaborate better strategies since they have very detailed info on what happens during the fights.<br>
<br>
It's not a &quot;press U to become Uber&quot; cheat, but it's still unfair. <p>Szlia<BR>

<br>
I am not Macoy (or whoever you were directing your remark to) .. but I assure you that ShowEQ, in the wrong hands, does have the potential to wreck the play experience of others! <br>
<br>
Topofil .. <br>
<br>
I have never 'seen' or used ShowEQ myself .. and I didn't say it could intercept '/tells', just see 'channels' - which are different .. but I assure you I do have some experiential insight into what it apparently is capable of. <br>
I agree that 'zipping around zones' may not be a ShowEQ 'feature', however, I have seen people who were not legitimately endowed by the Gods do exactly that. What program they were using to make that possible I do not know though - just that it was deemed 'not appropriate player behaviour' so to speak.<br>
<br>
How these things disrupt are perhaps more evident on other servers than Lanys. I spent some time on a PvP server - and someone (or a guild of 'someones') using ShowEQ has a distinct advantage in PvP environments - where they can lay in wait for other players, and either show up to harrass them when they are camping items where the mob pops very rarely (if not KS or just claim the camp at the last minute due to their uncanny ability to know 'just when' the mob would pop - 10 times out of 10). <br>
<br>
ShowEQ use is NOT easy to prove, though it can be done ..with time and resources. Mostly people get away with it because of the latter. <br>
<br>
When a few people can take 99.9 percent of the GM/guide resources out there .. and cause about 100percent of the problems on a server .. it is disruptive in other ways too. Has your innocent and valid petition ever been delayed or apparently lost?? Perhaps it was because the GM/guides were off chasing ShowEQers. One never knows .. but it is possible.<br>
