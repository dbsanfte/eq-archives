Nasty guy in general.</span><hr size=1> I was hoping my first post under this name wouldn't be on the SL... but, I think this needs to be said.<br><br>Me and some of my guildmates were hunting Seafuries in Ocean of Tears, and we were all extremely tired, and some of us just a little tipsy, I believe. /eye Fisti...<br>So anyway, for a bit of fun, we began chatting in shout and ooc, of course this is a sin to begin with, but we were tired and didn't care. Eventually, I ended up ranting on about nonsensical things, as Pirates such as myself are wont to do, and a ranger, Aashna, who shall remain blameless, (I don't think she needs blame here) told me quite frankly to shut the ol' cake-hole. I remarked something silly about her not being a Power Ranger like me, and just a regular ranger... sooo what should happen, but a few minutes later aforementioned hoodlum Hartland is swearing in Shout (something I find very offensive... what if young eyes are watching, hm?) So I am attempting to calm him down... But he shows up next to me and my guildiegroup of Fisti, Qinamwen, and Qini, and begins to rant and rave about how I was (quote) &quot;talking smack on his girl like a punk bitch!&quot;<br>This I found quite funny... until he started &quot;kiting.&quot;<br><br>Now, it seems to me a funny way to kite is by pulling a giant, not casting any damage spells on him, and rooting him in the middle of my  group, then rinse-repeating with 3 others... but that's the way he did it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Fascinating.<br>Apparantly, this is TRAINING! gads! Attempted murder in its lowest form, no less! So my group (being the Mighty, Well-Organized Mob of Pirates we are) dispatched his feeble attempt at murder easily.<br><br>Qoth yon druid: &quot;Oh, you all lived! I'll have to pull better next time!&quot;<br><br>Continuing to train us for 15 minutes or so, we got bored and naturally started to lose tempers. We didn't have the sense to report him, because it was about 2:30 AM =X<br>Anyway, I get a tell from Derekthom the dwarf saying that he was drunk and needed to cool off... This was no excuse! exlaimed I! I was then smacked by a bit of insults, most of which described me as a bundle of unused, bound firewood. Ha-rumph.<br><br>aaaanyway, the Three Musketeers, Hartland, Aashna, and Derekthom (all of whom are in Crimson Renegades) are no friends to the Agitated Mob of Pirates... and I just hope the rest of their guild isn't like that, hm? =)<br>bleh.

Nasty guy in general.</span><hr size=1> Yeah, unfortunately my alt was in that group, and you know what, Hartland even said to zone, just put them on /ignore.<br><br>If he had heeded his won advice this would have been fine.  But he didn't.  This is the problem I have, I don't care how much someone shouts to zone, if they offend me, I put them on ignore.  Training over and over, since this wasn't the only incident of him training on us, isn't acceptable.<br><br>Come on people, use /ignore for what it is made for, it doesn't turn off all shouts, it just turns off this one person.  You don't get tells, you don't get shouts, ooc, auc, nothing.<br><br>So to come over and threaten to train, then get upset when his single mob doesn't kill us, and to say, I quote Hartland says, 'wow you guys all lived.. I guess I'll have to pull better next time'.  Now there are people in this group that weren't spamming shouts, weren't offending anyone in Crimson Renegades, they had nothing to do with it, until you train them and try to kill them.<br><br>I logged my main and tried to talk to Hartland about it, all he said was contact a GM.  I tried to talk to Derekthom a little, he seemed like I should just contact your leader.<br><br>Fine, you hate someone shouting, try to SL them for it, don't train their group.  I don't care how much this person pisses you off, DON'T TRAIN HIS GROUP.  Why should his group pay for him pissing you off?  All that is going to lead to is pissing more people off, I'll log my main and pull the whold damn zone on top of him for killing my friends on purpose, and then where are we?  Then he logs in someone else and trains my Main, and this is FUCKING ridiculous.  Training is training, it is shitlistable, and even after an hour when I tried to talk to him he blew me off.<br><br>The only thing I can say is he gave me enough information to try and get ahold of his leader.  Lotta good that did.<br><br>Also, Hartland, when you tell your &quot;story&quot; about this on your message boards, you forgot to mention the training on us part, I filled it in for you.<br><br>Abysmul, hate to tell you bud, but training is never justifiable, and trust me next time, I will /report him and get a GM there to watch him train, and with what every GM has told me, if they see it they will handle the matter accordingly.<br><br>Crimson Renegades seem to condone this behavior, and until I receive word from their leader, I have to assume that this is the case.<br><br>If we as a community allow this type of &quot;justifiable&quot; training happen, then next thing you know it is justifiable to train someone who has a camp you want.  Training is training.

I do not usually enjoy annoying people and pissing them off, but when somebody insists on insulting me and swearing at me, naturally I like to have a bit of fun with them...

I was there in OOT and I was in Shoot's group.<br><br>If there was anyone in my group that was drunk, I was not aware of it. As for Fisti and myself, we were sober. That being said, there was no /shout or /ooc harrassment going on that could make Hartlands actions acceptable. Shoot was talking in /shout about 2 things mainly:<br>1) being a jedi and <br>2) using his jedi powers to turn dogs into other types of dogs<br><br>there were people in zone that were taking part with shoot in the conversation.<br><br>It came down to 1 problem. Hartland went loony because Shoot told his girlfriend that she wasnt a Power Ranger. He trained our group and that was wrong.  And it wasnt 1 Seafury it was 4. I was amazed that we made it being that we werent prepared for 4. Also, I myself am a 34 cleric and the monk was 33.  He did try to kill us. He didnt succeed and because Shoot was trying to get attention in /shout by turning irish setters into yorkshire terriers doesnt make us the troublemakers.<br><br>I'm not happy this ended up on the shitlist.  It cant even help the situation at all being that people are lying about the events and Hartland really believes he was justified to ruin our game because some red text was ruining his. <br><br>~Qini Pure<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ubinnar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Binnar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/12/02 12:58:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland</span><hr size=1> Well, Longfellow, I only say that I have to assume that the guild condones his behavior because I chatted with 2 claimed officers, and both of them told me to basically take it to a GM, that they were in the right.  Also, I do not drink and play, nor does anyone else that I know of that I was playing with, the group was stone sober to my knowledge, albiet tired.<br><br>Now onward, many people in the zone were having fun with the shouts.  Some were even egging him on.  So the truth is that some people had a problem, others enjoyed, now since the people that were not pleased by this can just type /ignore, why should we strip the fun out of the people who are enjoying it?  Heck even Aashna seemed to be having fun with it for a while.  <br><br>Now I do not blame Aashna at all, she said some rude things, well so did shoot, no big deal, I do not blame Hartland for coming over and cussing shoot out.  I do blame Hartland for pulling and rooting several mobs right in the middle of our group.  That is training, that is bannable, shouting non-profane words is not bannable by any means, you can get at most a warning for it.<br><br>Now like I said before, this isn't about Shoot trying to be amusing in shout, and some people find it annoying, this is about some level 50 druid who trains on people less than 35!  Yeah shoot was 47, but fisti and Qini are both under 35.<br><br>Now I did try to take this up with their guild leader before it came here, and the gun was jumped a little, but even when I had come back an hour later and tried to get some reason out of Hartland, I got no where.  I mean his worst comment was &quot;[Sun May 12 01:49:26 2002] Hartland says, 'you like talkin shit about my woman'&quot; and the worst Shoot had said to my knowledge was she wasn't a power ranger.  I mean come on, how is that insulting?  When DerekThom turns around and says &quot;[Sun May 12 01:42:48 2002] Derekthom says out of character, 'why would she be jealous of a fairi in pink tights?'&quot;.  And also that Hartland is drunk, he just needs a few hours to cool off?<br><br>I still want to know how Shoot was being so offending?  And how training is acceptable as long as the other person has said something you don't like?<br><br>I mean you zone into Seb, and the Kitchen is taken, is it ok to send a monk in there to wipe them out and take it over?  What if you ask how long they will be there and you get a response of 'I hate you, now leave', then is it ok to train them?<br><br>I see that everyone is taking a hands off approach to this one, and that's fine, but instead of just having Hartlands friends talk crap about what they don't know, and our friends talk about it, why not have some opinion from everyone else<br><br>Is training ok as long as the other person has pissed you off first?  This is all about is training ever ok?  if it is, then we are in the wrong and this post should be removed, but if training is NOT ACCEPTABLE, then Hartland is wrong, and I hope that when his guild leader finds out, an appology is made.  And Derekthom saying that it is ok for him to train us because he is drunk, that's no excuse, the only drunk one in this situation happens to have been claimed by Derekthom to be Hartland.<br><br>Like I said before, I could have just typed /ignore and been able to ignore Shoot, when Hartland started training, nothing I could do except log out to get away from that.<br><br>Aashna, I am sure you wouldn't have taken it this far, as I know Derekthom wouldn't have either.  And I am sure that when your leader emails me, this will be settled as to the guild.  This isn't to trash anyone except the person who trained, and admitted it several times.  I have had no other problems with Crimson Renegades before, but there is a seeming lack of interest to resolve this, I have spoken to 2 officers, and I have left an email address on their message board.
