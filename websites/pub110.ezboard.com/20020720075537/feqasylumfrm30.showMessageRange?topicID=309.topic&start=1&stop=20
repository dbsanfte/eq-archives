Charse was actually born a few months earlier.. but I restarted her at 14 when I learned that having a base wisdom of 80 is a *BAD* idea ...<br><br>Throughout Charse's time in Norrath, she's met some amazing and incredible people.  Most of those people she was lucky enough to call a friend.  While her list is long.. it's not nearly as long as some others.  She had the oppertunity to do a whole lot of things while she was roaming the lands.. <br><br>She had her own guild at one time.  Most of you probably don't remember it.. Magnanimous Order.. it was a newbie guild.. ran around Qeynos.. about the same time as the &quot;Saber wolves&quot; and &quot;Mercenary Tigers&quot;..  I remember, they had a guild war.. and Merc's got owned big time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Charse had some very dear friends during that time...  <br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Grimslow:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Dark Elf warrior.. who walked with pride around the walls of Qeynos after killing &quot;A LOT&quot; of gnolls..  I remember the first time I saw you with your new armor.. a full set of bronze.. you looked so handsom.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Janguran:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Barbarian warrior of Halas..  Your pride and honor was always second to none.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Greyland:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Wood elf ranger.. Greyland, we never really got to know each other.. my two memories of you is before you guilded with us.. you left &quot;the boys&quot; deep in the pits of the warrens when it was first released.. and that time I helped you recover your corpse from the lava in SolA <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Corrvin &amp; Levella:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Wood elf ranger / Druid..  You guys.. you guys had more honor and passion than I could ever have dreamed of.  You took a task and devoted yourself to it.  I was so proud to call you guys my friend.. and so devistated when it became apparent that it was no longer the case.  I look back to how things were then.. then look to how things are now.. and it hurts.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Xorn / Halyk:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Leezard Monk / whitty enchanter.. You always had the head about you to make sure that all of us were keeping ours.  For your constant grounding.. I thank you.  Again.. this is a case where a once very dear friend.. drifted apart.. and it hurts.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Bobolink:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Human Druid.. You were the first one of our group to brave Antonica and venture past the lands of North Karana.. you brought us back tails of the Bazzar in the East Commons.. you told us of the wonders of a city named Freeport...  you filled me with wonder and excitement.. But then you went your own way.. and it still hurts.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Haargeld:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Half Elf Pally.. Always side by side with Grimslow.. where one was, the other was close behind.  You were part of our first perma group.. Grimslow, Haargeld, Charse, Janguran, Blaztzen, Bobolink.  Together we were unstopable.  We haven't been together in a long time.. and it hurts.<br><br>Magnanimous Order was founded on the beliefe that friendship prevails over everything.  That there was no dictatorship.. that everyone has an equal say in the issues facing the guild.  That was it's primary downfall.. and it's what ripped the guild apart...<br><br>Several of the members went off to form their own guild.. and I wished them well then.. and still do now.<br><br>Some were left to wander.. and found new homes.. and are doing *VERY* well.. which makes me happy.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Gthina / Kindfaith:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Human Wizard / Whitty Cleric.. I first met Gthina when Charse was lvl 8 for the second time.  She was with some lil rogue named Hikadaf lost in Blackburrow.  Seems Hikadaf was looking for some cask for some burning rapier quest or another.  I led you from the depths of the burrow to the safty of the surface.. in return, you gave me a plat armband.. which I still have to this day... we remained friends.. we discovered that we had an awfull lot in common.. and that helped our friendship grow.<br><br>After MO disbanded, you invited me into NS.  You had just restarted it..  I was a sheriff for a very long time.  I was proud.  But then.. things happened.. times changed.. as suddenly as our friendship flourished, it dissolved.  You were my closest and dearest friend for almost the entire time I played this game... loosing you hurts in a way that I can not describe.  I try to think about what went wrong.. where did I fail.. I have no idea.. but I know that I can't continue this way.<br><br>Charse and Cortney no longer hold any joy for me..<br><br>Therefore, As of today, Charse is stripped down to only her no drop stuff.. and is put into the old folks home.  She's being retired to designated port bitch for Blaztzen.. and that will be the only time you see her online.  She was a lvl 52 Wanderer<br><br>Cortney is deleted. She was a lvl 48 monk.<br><br>To all my friends who I haven't mentioned.. You know who you are.. I will miss you deeply.. <p><br><center><img src="http://stormguard.dhs.org/images/sigs/charse_sig1.jpg" border="0"><br><font size="-2"><em>"I say to our enemies, we are coming.
