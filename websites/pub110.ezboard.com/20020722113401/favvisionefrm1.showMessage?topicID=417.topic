And actually I'm more inclined to believe it after reading that.  It says they are from test and it gives more details and a nicer break up than kan posted.  It should also be noted that these skills should be attainable (the ones that make it live) to people 51+ not just lvl 60.   Although you basically have to stop leveling to get these, hence a level 60 will always be working towards more of these.<br>
<br>
I am very interested into exactly how this is implemented.  Special trainers is my guess but...   Also the new interface should be nice.  Getting rid of the last vestiges of the old UI and making it all mroe customizeable. mmmmmm<br>
