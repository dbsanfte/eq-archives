Today in ec i talked to this guy named (crap i forgot) ill post it later lol.  But he talked to me wanting to buy my fungi sayin he had a lvl 60 monk in sigil named gingail and he would pay me back.  Then out of nowhere he said his monk isnt gingail, thats its gatz a lvl 60 in second covenant and that gingail is his lvl 60 druid in sigil.  I asked gatz if this was true and he had no clue who this guy was.  Well then he said he in fact didnt have a lvl 60 monk, he said he just had a druid and that his little brother made the monk part up.  So i really got fed up with this guy after 4 hours of him begging me to hand over the fungi.  I just started ignoring him from that point on, then he completely changed his story sayin that his druid is not in sigil that he is lvl 54, and that the monk was not made up by his brother but it was a mistell that he was tellin his friend about a lvl 60 monk ( i was sooo confused). So i just told jannaka and ignored the guy. Well 5min later comes Rhiino sayin that (whatever his name is) is his good friend and that he is trust worthy and really has a lvl 54druid.  Well they both met my ignore list.  I will post the name of the other guy to stay away from later. Gatz has nothing to do with this his &quot;identity&quot; was being stolen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ualadinsaneuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>aladinsaneuk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tunare </span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/7/02 6:47:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=863.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.petedean.btinternet.co.uk/aladstyle.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rhiino...attempted identity theft and EC scam</span><hr size=1> seems to me as if this guy is not only making a name for himself here, but should be making a name for himself with the GM's  =  perhaps if he tries the same stunt again -
