I remeber the days of fun I had in your groups. We go way back, all the way from Mistmoore, to HighHold, to Sol B. Hahaha, your a kid, and we all understand that. I remeber once how mad I was when in MM we were in a hill group and you bug me for ever to get in my group. Then when we had a wipe, you up and left us. Then in HighHold, I remeber two people leaving our group because you joined, then you let us all die, when you ran to the zone because we pulled 3 raiders. I don't mind dieing, it is just a part of EQ Life, but I will never group with you again, and I will never alow you on my planes raids.<br>

Soon as someones name is posted here 500 people show up, and in Mirie's case, 500 people she never had contact with (at least according to her), to de-fame her, her guild, small puppies, and anything else thats in the way at the time.<br>
Im not saying this against anyone who has any REAL ligitmate problems, its just funny how withen 1day of someones post, alot of people add in comments, and mostly about stuff that has nothing to do with the threads basis....<br>
 i got an idea, i also have to disagree with something here, i have been reading the shit lists for months now, and i found my self avoiding ANYONE whos name i saw here, cause i figured they were bad news...<br>
Well then one of my alts, Azid ( not Izid ) grouped with Binidin or whatever he is, the Claimed Begger Guy, and he is one of the nicest people you could meet, although it is under my impression he is around 12-14 in age, but thats expected...<br>
What im trying to say is that once someone is Off the shitlist, you should have a post or Thread or even a who Forum where people who have their reps shiny again, to let people know they changed... a locked thread that sits there with someones name there shouldnt be there, there should be a new thread in the &quot;recovery List&quot; as proof that their name had no basis of even being in the Shit List... just some ideas..<br>
ohh yeah, i think Orc should be aquitted of all charges and be given some cash for this joke of a Shitlist post, Shitlisting for 1 training is a BIG misuse of The Shit List... <br>
also im posting my name, since im defending Orcy, i want to see how many people Shitlist me for not sowing them or not porting or causing a gnoll pup to train and kill a large rat they were fighting or sumthing else REALLY important that is Life or Death and makes me a real villian.. cause i know someone is gonna say sumthing, just look at my buddy Orcy....<br>

Krish, I may be mistaken, but didn't you and I have issues with Orc in Cazic when we were young....him wanting to pull shit off of 4c cause you or I wasn't pulling fast enough?<br>
<br>
As to any recent actions, I can neither confirm or deny.  However, in recent camping named/window in SolB, I have been in goups that repeatedly threated to disband if Orc was allowed in.  You don't build up a reputation like that without doing something wrong...and more than once with so many pissed off people.<br>

I don't know what was going thru Orc's head at this time whter it was because we had another cleric or what but the group never saw a twitch out of him for about 3 hours.... Due to the hectic nature of the camp no one noticed much about it till we got trained and our Chanter died.... Cryso was tring like hell to keep us alive and Ghetto mez as much as possible. We managed to derail the train (rude courtyard groups =P) and i ask Orcalan about 4 times what he was doing while this all happened. Finally he responses telling us he was in tell hell the whole time..... I caught a few glimpes of him during the fight and he never once got up and turned towards the fight and he was facing the wall. Not sure what he was doing but he basically was just sitting there sucking exp and doing nuthing else.......<br>
<br>
I asked him to leave the group since he was basically dead weight and we were going to replace him. Took me 5 minutes to get a response from him and it was basically him telling us he was sorry but he was in tell hell and couldn't do anything about it. He left the group and we found out later someone else was supposedly playing his character. This kinda stuff is something to definatly watch out for when you have a cleric in your group you rely extremly upon his healing abilities and he gave us nothing but excuses when it was said and done........<br>

Had a bad experience with this cleric three weeks ago in Karnors.  He's still on my &quot;friends&quot; list and I check everytime i log on so that i can avoid him.  Main problem was his constant whining about loot and inattentiveness or afk alot ( which resulted in three deaths for me in 1 hour).  He has made me study most members of RoA alot closer lately to see if others are of similair play style, but haven't found that to be so. All I have met from ROA so far have been very skilled and noble players, with the exception of this bad apple. /shrug<br>

2-trains happen, intentional or not, you can't shitlist him for attitude. people have bad days, get pissed because they even had to train in the first place, a group bugging him may piss him off more.  do you have the right to be angry? yes. does he have that right, and the right to give you attitude cause he's angry? yes.  should you be adding  shit cause of his attitude? no.  <br>
3-you're gonna avoid "laww" cause you got bad xp grouping with him? <br>

Did you even read the post on Laaw? Did you read ALL 108 responses? I don't think so. Not saying I have; but I have noticed people puting him up here for KSing, Ninja-looting, EXTREME training, and most recently, the raid thing. (You know, the one where he logged on for 5 min, did nothing, won a roll for monk item, and left) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=466.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=466.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=466.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=466.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=466.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=466.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=466.topic&start=141&stop=150>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showPrevMessage?topicID=466.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showNextMessage?topicID=466.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=466.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.unbeliever.net/images/lanys/postreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.emailToFriend?topicID=466.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.threadControl?topicID=466.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=466.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=466.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub110.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumfrm33">Luclin Info<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumfrm31">Crafts Guild<option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumfrm32">The Bored Room<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylumfrm34">Beastlord<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard<option value="eqasylumfrm37">All Other Games<option value="eqasylumfrm35">Morrowind<option value="eqasylumfrm42">Neverwinter Nights<option value="eqasylumfrm43">WarCraft III<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> -
