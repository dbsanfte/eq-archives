Sorry Orc.. but i will have no respect for your abilities as a cleric as long as u wanna play with ur new nuke undead spells before u buff me as the puller.. <br>
rangers DON't have much hp. and get pissed off when the cleric jerks off and nukes out his mana instead of buff and heal.. <br>

ah yeah forgot to say.. we had a bard in the group.. and when i stated i started pulling. i still only had my own buffs up.. those aint realy bad. but.. when u promised that you would buff me with symbol after the fight it ticked off.. sorry.. those are needed during the fight. not when ur lying flat dead on the ground cuzz ur cleric was oom after nuking 1 of the 2 mobs.. and had no healing powers for the second  fight.. <br>

end note.. u should realy take it too u to learn more of the profession as cleric.. .. ur not the nuker in the group.<br>

One thing a chanter does NOT want to do is be in group with a bad cleric (unless lookin for corpse run) And to ultimik, I understand you telling your friend go ahead and enjoy the game, but please remember it is not good to do so while ruining it for others. It says alot when on more than one occasion people left a group cause he joined (he is a CLERIC!) for people to rather have no healer than to group with him speaks volumes in my book. Also a friend spoke in his defense saying that orc would lay his life down for others. Well if that were true, why train? Why not just lay and die? Another said he would not do this with malice, yet when someone shouted in the zone that their cleric needed a clarity cause he was refusing to heal, orc asked the group to help train the guy!That is both intentional and malicious. The only experience I had with him is on my main, he bugged me to death to sell him a weapon I had equiped that I made clear was not for sale.

<br>
<br>
Orcalan was in SRo wanting to come to hate with us, he put on LFG, and sent me tell after tell after tell after tell after tell after tell etc. etc. etc. to get on the raid. I figured one cleric per group is good, and I have good ties with RoA having been a former member and raiding with them a lot, sure, why not. I didn't really know him, I think I may have been in one group or raid with him once, somewhere.... *shrug* name sounded vaguely familiar, whatever. <br>
<br>
So, he comes along, is very vocal in /ooc (which i discourage on my raids), continually gives me tells throughout the night about mundane stuff.... Again, I don't really think this is &quot;shit-list&quot;able really... Well, he wins a piece of EM armor, congrats to him. He wins another about 30 minutes later because no one else needs. He gave me a tell asking if he can still win a third piece. I replied something to the effect &quot;it's possible, but not probable&quot; since I wasn't sure what every other cleric needed. *shrug* Low and behold, 5 minutes later, with no warning, he says in ooc &quot;bye all, gotta go, thanks for the raid&quot; and gates about a minute later.<br>
<br>
Again, not shit-listable, but really poor attitude and he won't be attending any of my raids in the future. <p><center><img src="http://www.unbeliever.net/images/everquest/sigs/dres-sig.jpg">

That is a crappy thing to do to screw a raid over after getting not one but TWO drops in one raid then leaving.  If you cannot commit to a raid for its entirety, do not go.  This incident will only hurt him in the long  run as he has showed himself to be untrustworthy.  If you can only stay for a certain amount of time then state that, at least set expectations up front.<br>

Of course there is always the possibilty of RL problem and tat is perfectly understandable, but seems unlikely in this case if he asked if he could win a third piece and when told that it was unlikely left.<br>

I would issue a general warning to all Lanys players and especially raid-leaders to expect this kind of immature behavior if you allow him along.  Sure, your group needs a cleric:  but choose one that is not encumbered with loot, choose one that is not more concerned about what items players have for sale than buffing and healing, choose one that you know who will behave in a mature, dependable fashion.<br>

After grouping with you a few times in SolB, and as high as you've gotten considering (how i don't know),you've made quite a bad reputation with alot of people on lanys and it might be better to pick a new class to play.Start over, new rep, new class, i'd recommend somthing more melee based.Maybe a warrior, or a paladin if u still feel u want to heal people,but not a cleric.<br>
I'm not saying people are born able to play the class they choose, but some people aren't cut out to be some classes.Personally i utterly suck at being a wizard, not one i've tried (and i've tried quite a few) have made it to the 3rd round of spells.<br>
Just somthing u might want to consider, i'm sure with what you have as orcalan you could twink out a new character and just retire orcalan all together.<br>

Bergurgles crown for his part of the Epic. He knew nothing about the spawn whatsoever. I<br>
informed him its under water and he needed water breathe ability, gave em the levels of mobs I<br>
also informed him there is no way he could do this alone (which he was). He offered me coin to help<br>
him and he kept a series of tells going asking me letting him in on the camp. I let him know I first<br>
wanted to get my part of this done and that he should recruit some help as I did and come back<br>
since bergurgle was a rare spawn and I already had the camp. The next thing I know iam face to<br>
face with a guide!. Orcalan had petitioned about his boat being stuck and when the guide showed<br>
up he started going off about me not answering camp checks (which he never ask for) and that he<br>
thought I was not even at the spawn and he wanted it, so he ask the guide to check on me to see<br>
if I was lieing to him. Naturally Orcalan could not look for himself since he did not know where the<br>
camp was or even had the water breathe to get to it if he did!. While I was in tell with the Guide<br>
Orcalan kept a continuous stream of tells coming at me still asking for the loc and for help getting<br>
Bergurgle. I finally told Orc to quit messing with me I read the Lanys.com SL and I knew he was on<br>
it. Orc freaked about how its all lies and that I must believe them so he wanted nothing further to<br>
do with me. The reason I never told him the loc is because of the stories here about Orc training and taking camps. Thank you Lanys for posting here you saved me a lot of trouble. btw I did get Bergurgle and I should mention that the guide was amused when I told him why I wouldn't cooperate fully with Orcalan. <p><center><Img src="http://members.home.net/d3south/cin.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwinsomecannon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winsome Cannon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/4/01 11:36:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=466.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Orcalan</span><hr size=1>  BAH anyone that messes with my Cinan deserves to die!!!!!!!!<br>

<br>
<br>
IN NO WAY DOES ROA AGREE WITH THE ACTIONS OF ORCALAN....however we have to catch him on line to talk/boot him...and he's smart he doesn't say much in guild when he is on..so if we are raiding we sometimes miss him =)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As of Sunday June 10th Orcalan is no longer a member of ROA <p><img src="http://user.netomia.com/Brewhaus/simc.jpg">
