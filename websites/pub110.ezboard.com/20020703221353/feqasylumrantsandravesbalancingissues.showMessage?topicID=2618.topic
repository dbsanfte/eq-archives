FREAKS.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>I have one never Ebayed ,   I have always been and always will be the same person. The only person that ever played my character was my brother and he only did that a few times and for little time.  and no longer touches eq !<br><br>It amazes me that over the years how many people, no matter what there reasons where .  They found it funny to post something about me.<br><br>I personnally have helped Thousands of people with Quests, Raids, Events, Epics, you name it.  And as MOST people know on layns server.  Im a good guy and will go out of the way to help you. ( unless of course im busy )<br><br>But non the less I find it halarious that people  still post on the SL about me almost everyday.  ( its like bringing them to a ok situation that if they post somthing aobut me, then there ok and well liked ).  <br><br>I have never once posted to the SL under any of my SL's<br>and never will.  Today is a somewhat different day however, in the fact that I want to say something for the first time.<br><br>Not sure how to put all this but I'll try as i go, take it for what its worth.  a Rant, a Rave or whatever.<br><br>I have over the years sense ive palyed EQ  been a person that wanted and still wants to be one of the best players in EQ ,  ( I will never give that goal up ).<br><br>With that said, over the years on Lanys server only, ( i have other characters on 4 other servers ). funny how im not SL on any of those  and yes there levle 60 characters.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>This server has only a few bad egss i guess you could say as far as you can almost always see there names here constantly day in an day out posting on the SL , ( right there alone thats freaky , i say GO PLAY the GAME or get a life )<br><br>Do i think the SL is a good tool to use NO.  Anyone can come to the SL and post JON DOE did this or JON doe did that and have 20 of his or her freinds stating they did it ! ( when in fact  may have never done it in the first place ). Thus in the long run of standings take it for a grain of sand AS most people do anyhow.<br><br>Thre reason i have always been , so strong as to the people on lanys server is , I know i only did  one thing that wouldhave placed me on the SL in the first place , and that was 2 months into the server being up , i was on  a raid to kill  nagafen, it was officially my first Raid on any server , and i was very very excited and happy to be in the main group of the raid .  As i have played eq for over a year then on bertox server, and wanted to learn how to form a raid etc...<br><br> ............. As the raid went on we killed named firegiant and it droped pmm,  i had looted it ( not knowing at the time it was no drop )  and YES in those days the no drop feature was not available , had it been id probably never even been on the SL.<br><br>me and the raid leader discussed the situation and we both even  talked to the lead gm on the lanys that day. And there was no way to give the loot up.  <br><br><br>As time went on i had a drinking problem and would snap at people from time to time , becouse they probably did somthing that warented action.  And i being an older person in life saught justice by speaking out.  Thus more SLing on my part..<br><br>I found it ironic alot of times too as to where people come up with alot of the SL material they come up with , ( yes ive read all the SL threads).  One time i was away from eq for three months and people where posting things i was doing, those werethe types of things i was laffing at most.<br><br>There was an incadent one wher i was in a zone , with 2 or 3 people at the time and i was killing the pin keeper for a robe i was levle 60 at the time. Then a group of peopel came in all of the same guild, and came down and with out thoughtjust started killing everything.  I had in response stated how would you like it if i brought 6 levle 60s down here and did that to you sort of thing.  ( LAFF little did i know by them taking over my camp.  That yet again i was SLed.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  Freaks.<br><br>Over the years i have been in MANY guilds  and contributed VERY hardely to all of them. the best way i could i guess only to find my self SLed by them  after..<br><br>The one guild that mostly ranted and raved about me was a peson in dark whispers   , This guys name is all over the SL about me, i helped him get so many things and helped his guild out , but one day we went to FEAR and was a complete whip i mean took other guilds to come help at those times , i told him a way to have done the CR that would of made things so much better , but he didnt want anypart of it and we started to exhange words.  and i left the guild. <br><br>.............  This guy went off for  over a year  doing anything he could to SL me and tell anyone and everyone what a bad guy i am.   Thus to no end  he finnaly stop playing eq  /cheer <br><br>I later went on to a guild called monarchy of the dead , a good freind of mine was leader and i figured screw the SL once again and start fresh .   I once again contributed to EVery member in the guild , even showed them how to raid places and we as a team tried to become a  BIG guild. <br><br>well as time went on in this guild too people still SLed me for no reason and always got tells in game or when i group with people  why are you on the SL your a nice guy etc..  always with a SIGH  i eiather try to explain or just let them judge me for what they see and what i do in game.   as yes it gets very tiring after 2 years plus hearing wow dude your on the SL how come .  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Well me and a few others in the MOD  guild decided it was time to move on as  things where not growing as we were hoping they would and a few of us decided to leave.<br><br>instantly  the leader and the members of MOD  posted on the SL about me saying this and that  and OH NO im in another guild .  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Freaks.<br><br>Still to this day crux and others still post almsot dailey !  boggles the mind.<br><br>I then went on to ROA  after that, and was very happy again to see that it was a place where i can better my self and use more of my skills  and to learn more skills as this guild was bigger in level and raided alot more.  <br><br>heh once again after people going to the SL they tried insulting the guild and me all again the same story well uzziell is this and uzziell is that.   after about 2 months  i found myself out of ROA  and then yet again now that guild posting SL on me over and over.  this time i left becouse i was hosting a kael raid and one of the members ( long standing i guess not 100% sure on that) , started to get ina fight with me  saying he can do what ever he wanted and didnt want to listen to me as a raid leader becouse i was on the SL : /boggle  even in the same guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Well i bowd out gracefully as i could but it didnt matter. <br><br>as time went on i said the heck with guilds and  just grouped with all my freinds on lanys  and made open raids .   Which  were 90% successfull.  AS anyone on lanys will tell you my raids are always fun.   ( not stroking my self when i say that, its just the truth - im a pretty dam good raid leader . )<br><br>I hve played uzziell the most out of all my charcters  , mainly becouse i found the wizard to be the funnest character out of all the characters that cna be played.  and yes ive played all of them was a goal of mine to want to bethe best player in EQ  so i  played every character to at least level 45 !<br><br>AS time went on guilds would ask me to join them only to find my self out of the guild within  2 or three days becouse higher powerfull guilds would tell them  they will not alow anyone to rraid with them if uzziell was part of that guild.    <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    freaks.<br><br><br>Then one day  a pretty good freind was on and he had formed his own guild ,  iris it was named .  He asked me if i wanted to join and without hesitation i said sure  ( thinking what the heck  ill give it one mroe try,  i had three chracters on lanys at this point   cleric  monk and my wizard.   all joined this guild and me and him even said in tells that we would just keep it secret and notsay anything to anyone that i am  the cleric and monk at the time  , just to let people see me for who i am  and not be judged by some SL  !  of course this went off with a bang we raided almsot dailey  killing VS ever pop doing raids all over lanys and even to hot  with a new guild was pretty impressive.<br><br>HEH  then out of the blue on an hot raid my  so be freind  suddently  decides to kick me out of the guild , ( to much pressure form peopel on lanys saying bad things about me  Who knows  all i do know is i just laffed.  /boggles the mind)<br><br>20 min later he had asked me for an item he gave me during one of the raids weeks before ,  i toldhim i sold em and that you gave em to me anyhow. )    lol  here comesthe SL again.<br><br>thus to say his guild fell apart days later and  he even got a GM to change is first and last name.<br><br><br>One of the biggest guilds on lanys conquerer  at the time and other names before and other names now !     me and the Guild leader use to fight all the time in tells , as to raids or  events or just in general as to why his guild and others talk so much junk about me in game and on websites .<br><br>i finnaly just gave up on those arguemnts and decided to just place people on the ingore and play eq . and also /repot and petition  as to Frizz the lead gm at the time asked me too.  sense i was gettign so many tells a day ! <br><br>EVEN now today after all the  junk people say about me , 80% dont even know who i am  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   freaks.<br><br>i PREVAILed  and still play EQ  becouse i love the game ,  i have fun raiding with people almost  everyday  despite this SL   EVEN with peopel trying to defend me on the SL  ( those people in return get SL or whatever )  :amazing <br><br>I know have my own guild  and Will still be playing EQ until the day it dies down,  I will not be subjected to the SL EVER.<br><br>PS i no longer drink !

I thought you were an ok guy.  So I invited you on some raids and after a few you joined Riders.  I don't think any of us knew of the posts.  I didn't even know of the shitlistings until after you blew up that day in kael.  My opinion no matter how much you like to think it is, was and has never been influenced by the shit list.  My opinion of you is based  on your actions alone.  <br><br>So that being said lets set the record straight here.  <br><br>You were in the guild for maybe a week. <br><br>I didn't shitlist you for what you did.  I posted a link to your explanation of what happen in kael that day.  So basically you shitlisted yourself.  I know you realized this later because you  deleted the post a day or so later.<br><br>As for our fight.  It was because you threw a tissy fit when I pulled a crap arena mob and you did not specifically tell me to.  I checked with clerics mana before I pulled and all was good with them.  <br><br>But since you were on some power trip thinking you were the raid leader.  Which you were not.  Why would you be the raid leader.  When I was there?  I am now and was then officer of the guild and even back then well over a year ago was very experienced raid leader and puller of that raid.  <br><br>In your power trip you disbanded the group, you were the group leader, in the middle of the fight.  We were all lucky that the clerics were on the ball and kept everyone alive during the fight.  After that we exchanged words you told me that you were trying to teach me a lesson by endangering the raid the way I did,  ROFL.  I don't think you listen to your self.

I PREVAILED and WILL continue too </span><hr size=1> See the amusing thing about this post is this.<br><br>I won't answer to what Gus and Aste have said. Gus covered pretty much everything with what happened with Riders, and in an extremely accurate way. She left out some things though. Namely that Riders took some guff over adding a known piece of shit like you. However, of course they decided to judge for themselves. Which is admirable...if sometimes naive when someone proves time and time again what a scuzzbag they are. However, some may not have been aware of your history, it's certain others were. I tend to attempt to judge people on their own merits as well, so can hardly damn anyone else who does the same. It's admirable when guilds do that. Sometimes it works out, sometimes in cases like yours it bites them in the ass. Fortunately they found out quickly what a true asshole you are.<br><br>Time and time and time again though that's happened with you Uzz. You talk a good game, until you lose it. Time and time and time and time again people on the server have attempted to give you numerous chances. From you ninjalooting and gating on that long ago raid on fire giants until now you've <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> repeatedly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> shown your character to people. <br><br>Your rewriting of history is funny. You claim you didn't know the item was nodrop when you ninjalooted so long ago. Your first (but certainly not last!) shitlisting. There's a glimmer of truth in that, but only a glimmer. You did know, because you had been told. Repeatedly. As <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> everyone</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on that raid had been. First you denied looting it. Then you claimed you didn't know. And you didn't sit down and discuss it. That was also part of the problem. You ended up gating out with it. Unfortunately EQ also didn't have the strict rules against ninjalooting that they do now, or you'd be banned. Nice attempt though, really.<br><br>And other here, and on other posts have said the thing most telling about your character. The people you seem to turn on most viciously are the people who have given you additional chances. And you've burned 'em all sooner or later. Generally sooner. /shrug<br><br>Most of your alts, when it wasn't even *known* they were your alts...made a poor name for themselves by their actions. I find it laughable that you would attempt to tout being on numerous servers with level 60 characters. Even if it's true, and frankly given the way *I* have seen you act, I'd look out my window before believing you if you said the sky was blue...I sincerely doubt you have a stellar reputation there. <br><br>This isn't a case of someone who made a mistake long ago and is still damned for it. Oh no, that would be far too simple. This is a case of where someone has pulled the bullshit of telling people :<br><br>a) I didn't do it.<br>b) It happened, but not quite like that.<br>c) Yes, that happened, but I was wrong. I've changed.<br>d) Yes, I acted that way but the reason was (insert an excuse here). I've changed, and I've learned from my mistakes.<br><br>And my personal favorite, which I experienced after hearing all of the above after refusing to group you long ago. (Yes, I remember it well scUzziell)<br><br>e) (insert insults here, neither poetic, nor lyrical, in fact sad attempts that a 3rd grader could improve upon, generally designed poorly in an attempt to attack the person very personally and make them feel bad...which ends up being laughably pathetic)<br><br>Generally you seem to try combinations of a, b, c and d before progressing to e.  <br><br>It seems like every wave of people who've leveled up has seen this from you. And gives you chances 'til you burn them too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>The shitlist is chock full of people who gave you additional chances which you blew. Chock full of many people who amazingly enough <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> never</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have anything bad to say about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> anyone</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. I can't remember ever seeing Istrahd be critical of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anyone</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->....except you.<br><br>The general consensus has been that you're nuts. Whether or not that's true, I have no idea. But more than a couple people have come to believe you're totally psychotic. I'm sure it's not difficult to see why.<br><br>You came to the boards screaming at 7 Dreams, and talking about the calendar. Yet...not only do you seem to lack an understanding of the purpose of the calendar, which is laughable given the amount of time you've been around. But you had <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> also canceled your raid </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. What was it you were bitching about again? Or were you merely attempting to drum up sympathy and support for you and your guild. I know it hasn't *quite* been working out well for you. Too many people know about you.<br><br>I'm sure though that some people will never have that cusp event that causes you to completely come unhinged in front of them. And since you started your own guild now (which is frankly funny in soooo many ways) officers of guilds won't see the bullshit you have caused in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> every single guild</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you've been in. Won't get the reports of your actions against others. Frankly, running your own guild is about the *only* way you'll have a guild tag for any length of time. Maybe.<br><br>Even then I'd be surprised if you can maintain 10 people for any length of time. Perhaps you might, maybe you have other accounts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>If you only had a problem with Riders...people could say, ah well it was just that guild. Or even just with Gus, someone could say, ah well it was just a personality conflict it happens. But when you see the amounts of people who have posted, and that's only a small fraction of people who've had problems with you...the only constant in the pattern is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br><br>You won't change. You're absolutely incapable of it. You've repeatedly demonstrated that. Some people will be able to take the warnings of others, see what you've done and steer clear of ya. Others will learn by experience. <br><br>You can think whatever you like, that you've somehow prevailed. /shrug I certainly don't care what you think, and most others don't either. The only thing you've ever prevailed at doing in EQ Uzziell is repeatedly demonstrating to numerous players what an absolute piece of crap you are, how dishonorable you are in action (ninjalooting, stealing), word (verbally attacking numerous people, attempting to cause trouble in every guild you've been in) and deed (repeatedly fucking over anyone who worked to give you another chance.)<br><br>Congrats on your numerous &quot;successes&quot;. /roll eyes You're the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> player I've ever seen that has managed to piss off sooooo many people.
