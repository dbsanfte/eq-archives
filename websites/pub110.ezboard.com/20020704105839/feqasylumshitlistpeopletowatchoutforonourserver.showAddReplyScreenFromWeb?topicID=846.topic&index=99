Binnar is NOT saying this : People can do whatever they want and if you don't like it, put them on /ignore<br>

Binnar IS saying : If someone is annoying you so much that you want to train their group, put them on ignore, do NOT train the group to solve the problem.<br>

As Qini states, it is a possible action, not me saying that you have to use ignore, just something else that can be done.  I may have been heated when I said that quote.<br>
<br>
We are not on Sullon Zek, and therefore it isn't acceptable, and since I am not the one making an ass of myself in zones, please do petition people that need it.  Long story short, if you are so immature that you have to train, then you shouldn't be playing this game.

Training is an immature to handle any situation.  Well, any harm to others is an immature to handle a situation.<br>
<br>
eitherway, this has happen weeks ago...  Issue being dragged for ever on a Mute point by now.<br>
<br>
Hartland handled it wrong, but is not a person that I would consider Shit listable.  Why ?   Cause he did an Eye for an eye...  Well, he did way worse to you guys of course which makes him look bad.  But One in your group was out to piss the hell out of him.   People in this forum being SL are ass holes, they don't need a reason to be just that... an Ass hole.   You can't push someone, and then bitch cause they retaliated too hard.<br>
<br>
If Shoot really did apologize to Hartland, and vice versa... I think you all should just handle this out of forum (Should have been done that way from the beginning).<br>

<br>
That's why I have no problem with this being here and staying here right at the top of the list.  I would agree that Hartland training shoot is not Shitlistable, but Hartland training me, now that is, I refuse to agree that I should be punished for being grouped with someone 1 time and they make an ass of themselves...point in case, I have not grouped with him since. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udiako.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diako</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/30/02 11:47:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

<br>
Going through the whole thread, you got more heat than Hartland.  IT's probably cause you were so defensive, and lenghtly at that.<br>
<br>
Some people thought Shoot deserved it...   Shoot ain't back here... Who else was there when it happened, you...  And more you got defensive, and more you got the heat that was intended to Shoot...  It's like pouring more oil on the fire thinking you'll drown it...  doesn't work too well.<br>
<br>
I probably did take what you said the wrong way, but it doesn't change that I don't appreciate that some people think that /ignore is a Have to if someone decides to annoy a whole zone.  Eitherway,  this has been long enough.  You can keep this topic in here for a few months, won't hurt Hartland a bit.  You might want him to get hurt, but it won't.  Mostly cause of all the inner battles in this topic.  If I see Hartland out there and we both were looking for a group..  I wouldn't fear him being an Asshole.  He's Human, and made a bad call.  We all do.  Again... His bad judgement was a response...  Again why many called the Group hypocrits.  Don't make it a vendetta...  You've probably caused more attention to you then to Hartland in this whole thread.<br>
<br>
Oh.. .and sorry for jumping all over you as for the /ignore.  I mis-read it, and never went back until I posted the quote here.  Just hope you're buddy Shoot knows better now.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ulongfeller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>longfeller</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t dood!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/4/02 7:56:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

SHOOT DID NOT, jeka that is why this post is invalid, thx <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . binnar if you want to post your own post, then by all means, go for it. you got trained, and for no reason. you said nothing in /say /ooc or /shout. but maybe that was the problem to begin with. maybe because of the fact that you DIDNT say anything, is the reason why this post was here. when shoot said in group that he enjoys pissing people off when he is tired, people laughed. what did you do? did you laugh? did you sit there like a lump of shit not doing or saying anything? or did you tell shoot to shut up, and stop being an ass in /ooc /shout and /say? what did you tell your group? just because you did nothing to PROVOKE hartland,  you sure as hell didnt do anything to stop your group ( or try and prevent your group) from provoking him. that is my problem with this binnar, that is why i say that you are also to blame. because you were &quot;just going with the flow&quot; if you want to use that term. if you want to sit here and defend yourself ( which is why this forum is here, to defend yourself) then please explain to me why you didnt tell your group to shut the hell up. that is why i still post. because to me, being to chicken shit to tell someone to shut there mouthis just as bad as spouting off at the mouth in a zone. <br>
<br>
<br>
and by the way, you refrencing to me trolling, you can kiss my ass. because i stop at my regular forums once a day, so if you call that trolling, then yeah i guess i am a 400 pound big green machine. <p><p align = "center"><img

   That reminded me of a few topic I've had to get over with my kids...  My oldest one keeps doing things she shouldn't do, and one of those things is Stealing.  I tried to explain to my 2 youngest that if Their sister is doing something that is &quot;Wrong&quot; and they are going along with it...  They are as much to blame as She is.  It's still not sticking...   But I have hopes.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
   As I said before,  Guilt by association sucks...  And it's the main reason Binnar got the heat.  If he would have written this complaints instead of Shoot, it might have had a different flavor.  Oh well.  Still think this post is bogus.  Hartland was wrong...  But he's not an Ass Hole that causes other people to suffer across the board.  He had a bad judgement call once, and apologized to the main instigator.  Binnar, if you weren't so strongly accusing him... he probably would have appologized to you.  There are 2 sides to everthing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver>The Shit List </a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font> <BR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
