Feel free to send me a tell.<br>
<br>
Fact of the matter is this.  Althena did an outstanding job pulling on a pick up raid that was never formally scheduled by us.  Our officers should have discussed and made clear all loot rules before we entered the arena and we failed to do so.  This has been discussed on our private forums and should never happen again.<br>
<br>
It is to the negative that Avvisione let this happen and I will take all the blame.  Because I was negligent in confirming that all raid rules had been discussed, confirming who needed armor, and flat out talking with Althena, we have come to this unfortunate event.<br>
<br>
Does it matter that I was not running the raid? Not really.  <br>
<br>
Does it matter that I didn't realize that Althena needed the BP.  Not really.<br>
<br>
Does it matter that according to the rules I am bound by that all BP's, epics, etc etc are merit only to guild members? Not really.<br>
<br>
Fact is we were all burned by poor discussions up front in which I had no part.  We as a guild were negligent in allowing this to happen.<br>
<br>
I have the guild leader tag and will take the responsibility.  Does this help Althena? No.  For whatever value you hold my word, she has my appologies.<br>
<br>
---------<br>
On a side note...the Avvisione of today is made up of new members, new faces, new personalities.  Whatever issues you had with any members here are long dead.  If you wish to renew/continue old grudges or hold ill will due to this event, then it is your right to do so.  But it won't help the situation. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
&quot;Merit,&quot; as defined in EQ, is confiscation and redistribution of goods according to the whim of the bureaucracy.  It is socialism.  It is favoritism.  It is corruption. <br>
<br>
Had you told Althena in advance that you would deny her a fair chance at the BP she needed, and &quot;Merit&quot; the item to someone in your guild, I would have applauded you for openly owning up to institutionalized dishonor, instead of springing it on her after using her skills.<br>
<br>
Althena has more merit in her little finger...<br>
<br>
But it is not possible for one person to fairly judge the merit of another.<br>
<br>
I hold no personal grudges.  There is nothing that can be done to remedy the situation now--thus no tells.  My rant is purely ideological, and against the structure of your guild as a whole--thus I write it here.  <br>

While I agree on a lot of the issues posted, it was qualified by keeping the guild down to say 12 people or 2 groups.<br>
<br>
If was focused around CaWU, a idea I really like.....limited to small groups.  Ask anyone that I have grouped (single group) with and you will find that I typically insist on those rules.  This works and works well ... for single or small groups.<br>
<br>
If at any time, anyone groups with me in a single group then the guild rules that I am bound by do not apply.  We have not chosen to limit our membership to small numbers and while appluadable, those ideas will not work with more than 2 groups of people involved (as you guys have noted yourselves).  We have 3+ groups at that event last night and it was intended that the guild rules apply.<br>
<br>
As for the quality of person Althena is..that was never in question.  I have personally spent a lot of time with her (its been a while tho) in the hole in the lvl 45-55 range.  I don't disagree that she is a good person and a highly valued/skilled member of your guild.<br>
<br>
What I can note is that she is level 60, wearing armor and wielding equipment (gained through her own efforts, thats not the point) that most in this guild dream about.  The person that this breastplate was awarded to does not even come close to haveing 1/10th of the armor that Althena does but is at least equally dedicated to his friends and guild as Althena is.  Is this the point? Again, not really.<br>
<br>
Nor is an arguement over the systems we use to distribute loot.  The true failure here is a lack of communication and is unacceptable for future events of this type.  You can be assured that my officers have been informed and will ensure that this does not happen again.<br>

<br>
A Merit system is simply a structure for rewarding members who act in a selfless fashion to benefit other members of their team, its done on a need before greed basis, and is something that helps with normalizing how Major loot is distributed.<br>
<br>
Leaving decisions up to a random number generator does not work that well, especially when sometimes the differences between two members who need a major item that is being merited are subtle and require some discussion between a group of officers. Officers are elected to serve the members.<br>
<br>
So, do I want to trust a random number generator or would I want to trust a group of people who spend countless hours raiding zones that benefit a variety of classes to make the fairest decision possible? The answer is I trust people over machines.<br>
<br>
We could get into a long discussion about politics but I don't think either of us would convince us of anything so it would be pointless.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
I do however have some issues to clarify....<br>
<br>
1) What was at issue here is &quot;mis/communication&quot; not honor or anything else- yes Althena is a great puller, but our merit system on major items has to stand, our members voted on this and we try to be happy when someone who was deserving wins a nice item. This should have been communicated immediately to Althena... Brax did apologize for this.<br>
<br>
2) &quot;Institutionalized Dishonor&quot; is your opinion, which you are entitled to, but one I do not agree with and will simply expand what institutionalized means...<br>
<br>
 ... &quot;Institutionalized&quot; is the process when the select few in a political or economic system force their will and ideas on the many to make something part of a system.  <br>
<br>
The avvisione merit system was created entirely from member feedback, so in fact it is democratized not institutionalized.   <br>
<br>
Merit is a system that we in our guild as a democratic guild agree with, whether your yardstick of &quot;honor&quot; or &quot;dishonor&quot; is the right term for our system based on democratic principles is really a point of conjecture. I should also comment that the vast majority of guilds follow similar systems, and also in real life people generally get promotions and salary raises due to merit, they do not roll dice against their peers to see who gets a raise. Obvious parallels rise from this.<br>
<br>
3) Brax did a very nice job of apologizing over the miscommunication, you should accept his apology, its the right thing to do, and would be the honorable thing to do.<br>
<br>
4) We play this game to have fun, let's keep it that way. Let the past stay as history I say. I admire all of the Nexus Nex people and wish you all the best.<br>

It isn't the reason we stay small.  We stay small so I can have absolute power to enforce our charter without resorting to an unwieldy bureaucracy.  It is my fantasy that we can spin off a new sister-guild at some point with the same charter, and use the new raid channel that Verant has promised to re-unite for larger raids.  Probably a pipe-dream, I know.<br>
<br>
I feel impressed with your responses to my provocations, Brax.  Thanks for the enjoyable debate. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      <br>

--Editted to reply to Camrael:  the random number generator has tended to distribute gear very evenly over time...in proportion to time-played.  Guilds like *Guild X* like to concentrate the best stuff in the hands of the favored few in order to tackle the biggest mobs in the quickest time.  The price they pay: weasely, squabbling, whiney dogs among the masses of their guild, to whom they throw scraps from the table now and then in appeasement.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as you uged: I hereby accept your apology, and thank you for the honorable responses to my anger.     <br>

Well said, and yes I also very much agree that Elitism is not good either... We are trying to avoid that here, we want everyone in the guild to get the proper resist gear, items and equipment as needed, it may take us another 6 months but we will get there together. It takes patience to make it.<br>
