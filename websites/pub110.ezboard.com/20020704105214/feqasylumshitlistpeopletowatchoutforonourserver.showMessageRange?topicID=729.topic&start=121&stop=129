Instead he stated he was already in LUCLIN AND DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE. Do not make people repeat what was already said in this thread.

I said that people prejudged him BEFORE ANY OF THAT.  Does that make ANY sense to you?  Before the log was posted, before any evidence was brought out, he was attacked.  All the attacks were based upon was the word of a SINGLE PERSON.  The single person accused another single person, NO LOGS, NO PROOF, and 30+ people jumped him.<br>
<br>
After logs are posted, and evidence is given, fine, rip into a person.  I was stating how blatantly stupid it was that half the entire board community was ready to tear him to shreds when nothing more than &quot;he did this&quot; was said.<br>
<br>
It wasn't even one guy's word against one other guy's.  It was just one guy's word.  It'd be like if I accused you, and before any logs were posted, you had replied, before ANY evidence at ALL... 30+ people bashed you beyond belief.  THAT was my complaint.<br>
<br>
If evidence is given, go for it.  Evidence came up later, and if you believe it's true evidence, tear him apart, fine.  But prejudging a person based entirely off hearsay is pathetic. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125458"><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~briangeerlings/beredorsignature.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/umirramai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MIrramai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here...get out</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/28/02 8:27:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=729.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sallof : Ec Tunnel Thief</span><hr size=1> It was one respected person's word against another.

If people know you to be trust worthy, and you explain as clearly as possible what happened and what you did about it, people will side with you.  <br>
<br>
When the Lanys Community does make a mistake they own up to it.  In this case, I honestly think, they didn't make a mistake.  There were right; Sallof hasn't done a thing to make up for this.<br>

Understandable.<br>
<br>
I had a friend in UO who was in GoL, a happy, nice, friendly RP guild.  He used to, in the guild, goto all the RPing events, be very curteous, and act very nice and moral.<br>
<br>
When he got bored, he went around stealing camps, killing people for loot, etc.  He could change in the blink of an eye.<br>
<br>
I'm not accusing the poster of that.  I think the so called respected person was most likely right.<br>
<br>
The only problem I had was the early formation of opinions.  Respected or not, you can't just say &quot;he did this&quot; and have everyone and their mother support you.  It isn't right.  For 40 levels, I did almost nothing but pair with my girlfriend.  The only people I knew was her father, and his two friends, really.  If someone had said &quot;he did this&quot; about ME, I'd be screwed.  I would have no deep rooted support, no people to back me.  Now, I know more people.  People who know I wouldn't do wrong.<br>
<br>
The point is that it was a mob of people, who knew nothing about him, all ganging up on him.  All off of one &quot;respected&quot; person's post.  He had no chance to reply before he was torn apart.  After his reply, I can see people reacting how they did.  But beforehand, you're going totally off someone's word, and flying off the handle as a result.<br>
<br>
As another aside, Hitler used to be a respected member of the community.  He was a leader, and people liked him.  They followed him like sheep when he lead the Holocaust.  How many people here would do the exact same thing as those people did?  It's a less extreme situation than that.. we aren't talking a holocaust.  But it's the same idea.<br>
<br>
It's a real person behind the computers.  Both people can screw up, and both people have FEELINGS.  I know I sure as hell would be upset if the entire lanys community had just jumped down MY throat, before I'd even had a chance to say my piece.  Even if I was at fault, I'd be hurt.<br>
<br>
A friend of mine was SLed once.  He was a GREAT guy.  He had a lot of friends, and they stood up for him.  They cleared his name.  But he quit the game anyway afterwards.  It hurt him to be SLed, and bashed on, by people.  Just like it would hurt anyone else.  To me, it's a miracle sallof still plays.  And guilty or not, I think he's got a helluva lot more to him than anyone here, because he can actually still try and enjoy EQ, with people shouting and oocing about him everywhere he goes.  It's more than I could do.  If I was SLed, and everywhere I went, some guy who never met me was telling everyone what a prick I was... well, I'd quit.  It'd hurt.<br>
<br>
People are quick to judge.  What's worse is they are obstinant.  No one can see the OTHER SIDE of the issue, or even just let things go.  What gives a person the right, or even the perrogative to ruin someone else's EQ life?  I never felt that I had the right to destroy the gameplay of another in EQ, no matter what he did.  Apparently, there are people on this board who think that.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think that people who shout/ooc JUST to ruin somebody's gameplay should be SLed.  I mean honestly, what's worse... having someone steal a 1k item from you, or having someone ruin your chance of entering a guild you like, a group you want to hunt with, and soiling your name all at once?<br>
<br>
Lastly, if someone is really &quot;that bad&quot;, more evidence will arise.  If he really does deserve to be SLed, his true colors would show later on.  People are impatient, they don't want to wait.  They just want a target and a gun.<br>

Ummm. no you wouldn't.  You'd respond to the claim by giving your side of the story, and the community, being the self-governing body that it is, would ponder the evidence and be swayed one way or another.  <br>

I don't think Gaealis was given the &quot;respected&quot; status by being the accuser in this situation.  He earned that from the people on this server, by leading a guild that people respect, by leading by example.  Gaealis has been the guild leader of the Knights of Flame, which has been around a LONG time on this server.  People that don't know him personally know the organization he represents.  Of course, there are some people that get SL'd that are highly respected on Lanys.  And when someone takes umbrage with their actions, they CHOOSE how they are going to resolve it.  Gaealis STARTS HIS POST by saying that he had given Sallof an opportunity to make this right, and he had not.  So, if you were a &quot;disinterested third party&quot; in this case, like most are, wouldn't this color your opinion of the accused?  You bet.  If you were Sallof and Gaealis contacted you in game BEFORE coming here, would you have done something to resolve this besides saying &quot;tough shit, a gift is a gift&quot; to Gaealis?  I'll bet you would.<br>

Call me crazy, but it sounds like you are equating Gaealis, who was the victim in this situation, with Adolf Hitler, and the Lanys community with his minions, simply because they responded in a negative way to Sallof's actions.

<br>
Of course you would.  Most of us would be.  How would you address this unfortunate situation if you CARED how people viewed you?  Sallof did not do what you or I would do.  Don't make him out to be the poor, hapless victim here....gimme a break!<br>

<br>
So, even if Sallof's guilty, he deserves to enjoy his EQ playing time?  Doesn't Gaealis, and others that get ripped off by &quot;invis trade&quot; scams by Sallof and his ilk?  Sallof's got a helluva lot more to him, alright!  If he quits, BFD.  Lanys will be a better place with one less lying thief.  If he musters some honor and gives the item or cash equivalent back, then his actions send another message to the community.  This server is a microcosm for real life, as far as this goes.  One reaps what he sows, so let the community treat him the way his actions dictate.<br>

<br>
People heard the other side.  They were not impressed.  Sallof tried to lie about it right on this thread!  What gives SALLOF the right to ruin Gaealis and others' EQ life by stealing items from them?  If Sallof was truly the kind and gentle martyr that you think he is, he would have been upset by making Gaealis feel bad about the situation, (or least would have thought twice about how people were interpreting his actions) and... he-would-have-made-it-right!<br>

<br>
I don't think that we who shout or ooc in a zone are intending to ruin somebody's gameplay, it's an attempt to warn others about this individual, lest THEIR gameplay be ruined by another scam.  Sallof ruined his own chance for joining the guild he wants simply by his actions SINCE this happened.  He came to the boards, full of shit, and people saw through it.  He soiled his own name, friend.<br>
<br>
Beredor said:<br>
<br>

<br>
Have you read the previous SEVEN pages, including the accounts of previous guildmates and leaders?  What should we wait for?  What is this, 87 strikes, you're out?? Sallof's disdain for making this right speaks volumes of his character (or lack thereof)...it is THOSE true colors that the community is seeing, Beredor.<br>
<br>
I know your rant is about how people jumped on him BEFORE he had a chance to rebutt the claims against him, right?  If so, you have a point, and this thread should probably be moved to RANTS - your words (well taken, mind you) do not belong here if that's the case, but honestly it's starting to sound like you are defending Sallof rather than taking issue with the rant.  You go on and on about poor Sallof the victim.  Gag me!<br>
<br>
I think these are two separate issues:  people on a witch hunt before hearing from the &quot;defendant&quot;, and YOU defending someone who's obviously a thief on our server!<br>
<br>
As Mirramai said, the people on these boards were right about him.  So, your point is moot, IMHO.<br>
<br>
Beredor, please tell me your issue has NOTHING to do with Sallof, specifically, and his actions.  When he responded on this forum, he reinforced this board's despise for his actions.  He tried to LIE about what happened to the people that read this list, and was CAUGHT.  All of this happened AFTER he first addressed this issue on this thread.<br>
<br>
Sure, it all coulda been a misunderstanding.  I don't believe his story for a second, personally, but let's suspend my disbelief: let's say someone sticks something in your trade window and you hit &quot;accept&quot;, thinking its some anonymous gift from a complete stranger.  Afterwords, you realize the item was not intended for you and was given to you by mistake.  If you were an honest person and CARED about how your actions made people feel and how they view you (your entire arguement in defending Sallof, as it sounds), what would you do?  What would ALL of us on this board do?  <br>
<br>
Okay, let's say in the meantime you gave the item away to someone else and they, for some reason, are not available to return the item.  What would you do?  What would ALL of us do?  <br>
<br>
I don't even have to say what he SHOULD have done because we all know how he could have made this right MONTHS ago.  And, to this day, he still has not!<br>
<br>
So, the boards may have been rash in prejudging him, but that belies the fact that Sallof is STILL a scumbag that took an item that does not belong to him and REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  That speaks volumes.  If Sallof had responded on this thread by apologizing, &quot;I was a mistake, I don't have the item or the cash equivalent, but I can pay you small installment over time&quot;, blah blah blah...I'll bet the masses would have viewed him quite differently.  I'm sure Gaealis would have been completely satisfied with that response.  But he posted, and made himself out to be MORE of an asshole that people thought he was.  He EARNED his terrible rep.  Don't hijack this thread and make it about something other than Sallof's poor judgement and lack of willingness to resolve the problem.<br>
<br>
I have personally spoken to Sallof in-game several times, imploring him to make this right.  He refuses.  He belongs here.  He's a dick.  <br>

<br>
The comparison to Hitler was just an adage, not meant to be literal.  It was just to prove a point, and was not meant to be offensive.  Just that ordinary people are prone to joining in horrific things.<br>
<br>
And no, this in no one REALLY involves Sallof.  I met him once in game, he seemed nice.  I don't have the illusion that my single meeting was proof of his personality though.  I am not trying to defend him per se, so much as my point.<br>

And yes, it's somewhat of a rant/rave.  I've brought the issue over there once before, and recieved an attitude of &quot;if you don't like it, don't read it&quot;.  That's crap, in my opinion.  Fact is, this board can determine the fate of people in game.  It determines if they sink, or swim, usually.  It should be controlled, mature, and thoughtful.  It should NOT jump to conclusions.<br>
<br>
After his post and the logs, I can see why people reacted how they did.  And yes, it was in line with their early reactions.  And YES, it was posted by a respected member.  But everyone can get hotheaded.  Everyone can get mad, and want to take the anger out on the source of it.  I'm not saying he lied, or that he did anything wrong.  But on a forum dictated by getting mad at someone, and posting your anger, there's a lot of room for exaggeration.<br>
<br>
I don't think a person who is on this form is usually innocent.  Rarely.  What I think is that people need to take a sit down, wait around, and judge based off of EVIDENCE, not the word of a person.  I don't care if that person is Tarot herself, I would not believe it until I saw proof.  Maybe it's just me. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125458"><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~briangeerlings/beredorsignature.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uwaalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Waalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/13/02 5:36:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=729.topic&index=127>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uzeffansilvershield.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeffan Silvershield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t dood!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/13/02 6:35:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=729.topic&index=128>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> So, lemme guess, Waalker...trying to increase post count on your ezboard account?<br>
