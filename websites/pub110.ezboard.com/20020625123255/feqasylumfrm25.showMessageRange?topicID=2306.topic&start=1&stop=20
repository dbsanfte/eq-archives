(( 9PM EST, 8PM CST, 7PM MST, 6PM PST )). We will assemble for port ups at the SRO spires, so if you would like be considered for inclusions be there before the appointed time with LFG on. If you sign up, please be committed to 5 hours of raiding.<br><br>I'll go over loot and what not when I can make a long post freely (( darn work )), but I just saw the time available and wanted to get it in right away. Suffice to say the loot rules and such will not be substantially different from previous raids, so you can check those postings.<br><br>Please sign up here with name, level, class, and previous hate experience. Signing up doesn't give you a place on the raid, but it doesn't make it certain.<br><br>EDIT: 5/11<br><br>Here is a cut'n'paste from the previous raid's posting:<br><br>Objectives of the raid are: Kill any demis up, kill maestro if up, clear rev houses, and make a stab at the 2nd floor if there is enough time. Because this is a weeknight, and people often have lives and responsibilities the next day (( including your humble raidleader )) I'd like to move fast to get as much clearing in as possible. <br><br>Depending on the force we have and what kind of signups, we will either be doing a PORTAL or North wall run to SOUTHWEST break. If I have two very butch groups with two wizards to port them, it will be a portal break, if I don't, it will be a standard southwest break.<br><br>If it is a PORTAL break: Two groups will port up and attempt to clear as much as possible around the port-in area. If we win, the rest of the raid will be ported up as quickly as possible, then we will clear to SW camp, and then on to C and maestro. Portal is riskier and requires a lot of meat in those groups that do go up, but I am of the opinion that it is a better choice for speed reasons. Even if there is a wipe, it is easier to recover at portal.<br><br>If it is a SOUTHWEST break: Groups will be ported up one by one, where they will leave the port in building, hit the zone wall and make a NORTH wall run. This means you turn LEFT at the zone wall. Run about half way up the wall, making the zone wall corners until you come to the pile of bodies/FDer that marks the camp. If you aquire aggro, hit the floor and die. There are only two things that matter on a southwest break: Getting a rezzer camped out -and- not training the camp. Once you have camped out, log on to an alt and join the raid chat channel.<br><br>Gem reagents, coffins, port stones, other costs will be covered by me. Any help that you provide in this area would be appreciated but not required. I had a devil of a time tracking down an extra shrink potion last raid, so if you are large it would be appreciated if you could bring along a shrink potion of your own and/or to share.<br><br>What I need:<br><br>*four or five clerics<br>*two pullers<br>*two 55+ warriors or 57+ PAL/SK to act as MA and SA<br>*another enchanter, preferably 54 plus to back me up.<br>*at least one 51+ shaman, but I would prefer two, to do slows and buffs.<br>*wizard(s). At least one, two would be great.<br>*enought druids to get everyone who can't gate down at the end and to act as support healers and nukers.<br><br>What I would like:<br><br>*an epic cleric would be supa-sweet<br>*a 56+ cleric would be nice<br>*a necromancer in case everything goes to Hell.<br>*I'd like to take ikky versions of shaman and warrior along because I hate seeing those drops rot.<br><br>LOOT:<br><br>*There is one default: If the enchanter epic piece: &quot;essence of a vampire&quot; drops, it will be defaulted to me.<br><br>*There are no other defaults.... with the exception of if you are on the LAST PIECE for an epic. If you are on LAST PIECE, it will be defaulted, or you will roll with all other people of your class that are also on LAST PIECE.<br><br>*Epic drops otherwise will be rolled to anyone of the class that puts in for it.<br><br>*Rogue book will be open rolled to all rogues that need it, assuming that it is popped.<br><br>*There is NO last piece of armor rule. There is no special rule for robes or BPs. I don't like last piece rules, because I've seen it be abused, and not having one bypasses that opportunity for abuse handily.<br><br>*Armor drops will be handled as such: Anyone who is interested in a particular drop may roll if they are of the appropriate class. Once you have won a piece, you are out of rolling until either everyone in your class has won a piece -or- the piece is going to rot because no one who is able to roll wants it. <br><br>*Planar weapons, shields, wands, other shwag doesn't count towards armor rolls, it is rolled to anyone who can use it that wants it.<br><br>*Mundane money items will be held until the end of the raid, where they will be distributed fairly to those that didn't win anything all night. Diamonds and Blue Diamonds will be rolled openly to the raid. You must be there to the end of the raid to win.<br><br>*I will take one share of money items (( as if I didn't win anything )) and one blue diamond, and any spare change that drops (( usually 500pp or so )) to help cover my costs for the evening. Any extra costs I'll eat.<br><br>Please sign up in this thread, include your character name, level, class and hate experience. Priority will go to people that I've raided with before, and whose skills I'm familiar with.<br><br>EDIT 5/13:<br><br>Need support healers, and clerics. Shaman/druid/clerics please sign up. ;)<br><br>=============<br><br>FINAL:<br><br>I decides to do a Portal Break, because it worked once and was fun fun. We port up, clear the immediate area (( grats Durdy on rog booties, Grats Jtue on shammie booties )). No problem! Very easy. Pull the next couple buildings, very exiting, clear the patrol, and then the church falls on our head. 3 spites, 4 ires, couple of clerics and assorted others &gt;&gt;&gt; raid. It was so bad, we had a clericless wipe. No problem, through the power of Tremendous Foresight, I had given vexana our lovely necromancer some EEs. So we rez a cleric, who promptly gets eaten by an ire. Then vexana gets eaten when she logs back in after /q'ing for aggro.<br><br>Sigh. It was not the best of times. An hour passes trading fun emotes in the bazaar between the naked peeps as we wait for rescue.<br><br>Thankfully, the MnM pack offers to help with two groups for a rescue party, and the rescue proceeded very quickly thereafter. Thank you very much for coming to save our butts. Some people leave and some people from MnM stay. We leave the port-in area, do a quick north wall run (( two deaths, one from sendador going the wrong way. ;D )) to sw camp and begin the slaughter. Grats One on indo bp, grats doomsinger on bard bp, grats ikky war bracer. <br><br>Sigh, there are no demis up but maestro.<br><br>Clear clear clear, very smooth all the way to forge. Pull some more junk, assorted cleric and war pieces drop /grats clerics and warriors. Pull the right side, rats trap on swoober throwing star. <br><br>Finally, it is maestro time. Trap masterfully pulls mastro to D arch, and your humble raid leader nurses him back from there to forge. It was a good clean kill, I don't recall any deaths there, and maestro coughs up two shields of the stalwart seas which are greed rolled to the raid as there were no erudite paladins present (( how many erudite paladins are there on the server? 5? 6? )), and then hand is spanked. Grats one on hand of the maestro.<br><br>Then it was all over. Sorry about the wipe. (( I'm changing my tag line to &quot;leading people to their deaths for sixty-four levels&quot; when I aa ding next )), but there was a modest amount of shwag to make up for it. No essence for your humble raidleader, which means I'll be doing Hate again as soon as I recover from this last one. ;)<br> <p><center><BR><img src="http://www.velvet.net/~benton/journal/eq_sig_ole.jpg"><BR><small>turning people into whirling slaughter machines for sixty-one levels.</center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uultravoices.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ultravoices</A> at: 5/14/02 6:42:14 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uerasthecleric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>erasthecleric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/9/02 6:21:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2306.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.webdeveloper.com/animations/bnifiles/demon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I HATE MONDAYS -- PoH 5/13 6pm PST -- Olenari leads</span><hr size=1> count me in<br><br>Eras<br> <p><html></head><body><p><img src="http://members.aol.com/erasthecleric/eras/eras.jpg" width="600" height="200"></p></body></html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udurdyhairy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Durdy Hairy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t dood!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/9/02 6:29:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2306.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I HATE MONDAYS -- PoH 5/13 6pm PST -- Olenari leads</span><hr size=1> WOOT!<br><br>If you'll have lil ole me along again, I'd love to help out<br><br>Durdy Deeds<br>50 Rogue of Arma Aquetatis<br>(should be 51 by then got 1 orange to go) <br><br>Oh Hate Exp.....lots as my Shaman about a year ago....only a few times so far as my Rogue <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udurdyhairy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Durdy Hairy</A> at: 5/9/02 6:31:08 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uaenladarie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aenladarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/9/02 7:42:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2306.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I HATE MONDAYS -- PoH 5/13 6pm PST -- Olenari leads</span><hr size=1> Count me in =)<br><br>Aenladarie 55 Outrider<br><br>No hate experience but i listen and learn =)  <br><br>/cheer <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/utrapoflanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TrapOfLanys</A>&nbsp;
