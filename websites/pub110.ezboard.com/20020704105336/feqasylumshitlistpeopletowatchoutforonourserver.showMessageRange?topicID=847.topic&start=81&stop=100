<br>
He let a FRIEND borrow his Cleric while he was away.<br>
<br>
It isn't like he had to pay Bret a rental fee on the Cleric, all he had to do was continue to pay the fees to Verant IF he wanted to keep him active. He CHOSE to keep him active, he CHOSE to level him up. He also CHOSE to throw away a friendship over a video game when he refused to give Bret back to the rightful owner when he returned. <br>
<br>
I remember when Bret first came to EverQuest and it appeared that he and Jugger were very good friends. I know I personally know the value of friendship and it is a hell of a lot more valuable than level 60 in EverQuest with some decent gear and a guild. I think most of us here know that. It's just going to take a lot more growing up before Juggernaught realizes his mistakes.<br>
<br>
Some day in the future Jugger is going to look back on this situation and realize what an absolute cock he was to his so-called friend. <br>
<br>
You could have been a friend Jugger, the one thing in life that truly lasts. Money doesn't last, posessions don't last, video games don't last. Friendship is the one thing that can last forever. When EverQuest is dead and gone, I will still have the friendships I entered into this game with. Can you say the same? You made the choice not to be a friend, now you get to live with it. I hope you are happy.  <p><IMG SRC="http://kaeleighshadowboxer.homestead.com/files/xantheus.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ubrambler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brambler</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~damiene/3dlgowu2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/13/02 1:54:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=847.topic&index=84>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~damiene/legalize1.jpg width=90 height=138></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Juggernaught The Wavecaller and Bret Buffalosoldier</span><hr size=1> Wow, this has got to be one of the most childish and pathetic moves I've ever read about on these boards.<br>

Objection, your Honor!  Assuming facts not in evidence.  While plaintiff acknowledges he allowed respondent access to his account, he maintains he never conferred ownership of the account to the respondent, nor was it his intent to do so.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the issue of reimbursement by the account owner is not relevant since the respondent was not initally requesting reimbursement for costs incurred, but rather  simply refused to relinquish possession and control of the account by maintaining the account had been gifted to him.<br>

Both parties are in the wrong, its a shame it couldnt be worked out reasonably, deffinately not the first time we've seen this type of shit on lanys. Oh yeah, accounts, items, characters are owned by VI, not the user. The user owns a license to use the said accounts, items, characters as VI sees fit.

Regardless of how close of a friend one thinks the other is, the feeling may not be as mutual as you think or wish it to be.  Yes there's people you can call true friends out there, but if you trust everyone of them, eventually you get the short end of the stick.<br>
<br>
Stripping him of the stuff <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> got him is one thing (you camped/raided/paid for it), it's yours to destroy.  (Yes if I buy bob a cd-changer for his car, and he then says I cant use the car when he said I could before, I take that cd-changer back).<br>
<br>
Deleveling him although was a kinda shitty thing to do.  (you were given Bobs car to drive for 3 months, you cant take the mileage you put on it back, leave that part alone).  My guess is that this was an over-reaction to the fact that he's losing a character he gained lvls for and helped build.  Getting him to 60 could've been the payment for him letting you use his character.  This was maybe your only mistake, imo.<br>
<br>
<br>
Technically, they should both be suspended/banned/whatever.  His account wasnt hacked, one was given permission to use it, with that they both disregarded Verants policy.  Neither is more innocent/guilty then the other because of that.  If it's not looked at that way it could be assumed that the real bret didnt want to lvl and earn all his stuff, so he let someone do it for him and now he's taking it back.  Not saying this is what happened, but who would want to try to determine who's right when they're both wrong?<br>
<br>
Good luck with whatever happens, both of you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ubrett0550.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brett0550</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/13/02 3:14:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=847.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Juggernaught The Wavecaller and Bret Buffalosoldier</span><hr size=1> Well, just to update everyone...here goes. I indeed am on Bret again. He is level 44 and low on armor. All these facts are ture. I called Jugg and we have worked this out. The binding in the Hole comment will be discussed Jugg, do not lie, there are no time for lies. Our friendship is on the rocks still but we're finding shore. We've agreed to be friends. But I will say one thing, both our reputations are shit now. Visions wants my ass and a lot of the rest of the world wants Jugg's. Whoever said that I brought this to the Shit List too fast? I tried everything EVERYTHING, I even played the replacement cleric, but you must understand it was HARD having to zone into unrest after years of never entering there...too hard.But if the people who run SL wish to lock this, please do. I no longer hold the Shitlisting of Juggernaught as valid in my eyes, and I am sure Juggernaught feels the same. If Juggernaught wishes to update his situation, he may. <br>
As for you Venr, get off my back in the game. I have seen your name for a long long time, hell I remember you in Necro best of the best when my guildie Jedaka was fighting. I had respect for you then, even if my guild did not. I have respect for leaders. Xanth takes his shit, but he is a leader. Abraham Lincoln took his shit, but he stodd up to it. You however have not by calling me shitty and calling me a no good friend and whatever foul filth spewed from that hellish crevice you call a mouth. You want to come at me personally? Get the fucking facts. While I will state a disagreement of being deleveled to 44 and indeed the fact that I lost the planar armor is pretty bad, these can be fixed. You however must fix yourself. Leave me alone. And anyone else who wishes to come out of me, you crush the sproutling of a growing friendship, trust me, Jugg and I have come out of some pretty bad situations, hell he got me to wrestle, but get back to your normal lives, indeed bringing it to the shitlist brought that, hell it's clearly stated in the rules, but I salvaged something dear to ME! My friendship, and thank you Xantheus, you have stated what must always be known. No matter who you hate and despise on this game, it is a game. It's little bits of data being transfered to your screen. That's why I am not up in arms over losing the equip. It's just a piece of equip with numbers, shit loads of numbers, I will survive.<br>
&lt;P.S anyone who wants to help in the recovery if a GM can't do it, hehe we can talk...we can always talk.&gt;<br>

- Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860)<br>
<br>
This sums up what we went threw.  For both of us.  Truth be told that we both had to give something up to get the greater reward.  <br>
<br>
We are both happy, yet sad.  The time has come to re-new a friendship and fix flaws and come to agreements.  Truth be told thought I may have lost more time then bret, He lost some as well. <br>

Our friendship is sumed up to this:<br>

I know some of you dont agree with the way it was handled.  Hopefully you will be able to move on and just remember this as a past.  A memory.  We have worked things out, and hope that people will respect the wishes of trying to refrain from comments that are not supportive to the decisions and conclusion of this problem.  <br>
<br>
For those that hate me, im sorry that actions happened.  The event are over and hopefully you can look upon this as a mistake that 2 people made.  If you can forgive like we have, wonderfull.  If you cant then the best of luck to you.<br>

You have NO sense of friendship what so ever, to delvl and destroy gear on a char that was &quot;loaned&quot; to you and to make matters worse,to fucking speak in &quot;say mode&quot; (which is what it must have been for someone to actually hear you)about binding him in the Hole?You will claim it was a joke probably,and im sure there will be idiots who will accept that as a excuse but some people here im sure will see you for the slime that you really are.<br>
This upsets me cause i have friends,dear friends who use my char just as i use theirs and i would never even dream of moving a single item off their char let alone do anything else.Im just damn glad i dont have a &quot;friend&quot; like you.<br>

ANYONE that has proof of me saying I will bind in these places show me proof.  If i did say this out of anger i will delevel to 1 again and start over. <br>
<br>
I do remember somone saying that i should, and me laughing about it, BUt I did NOT say i would or allude that i would.  People suggesst a lot, doesn't mean the persons morals would ever put that thought into the persons head.<br>
<br>
Find me proof i said this and i agree with anyone saying that i would bind in such a place.<br>
<br>
And the loaning of gear, i deleted the stuff that i got.  Not bret.  Anything that i earned was destroyed.  All items he had that i deleted were replaced in a form of me giving him a item that i earned.  <br>
<br>
Nothing more about this binding somwere till valid proof is shown please.  I wouldn't do that to ANYONE, mad or not.<br>

Its been my view that everything here gets commented on my unaffilated people who know nothing what there talking about.  And probably by commenting on this i am turning myself into one.  But since my name was mentioned by bret i feel the need to comment. <br>
<br>
I see alot of people saying its such a shitty people to do to delevel bret to 44 and destroy all the loots that the first bret has not gotten.  If the first bret wanted the acount back with all the loots and levels he did not earn he is wrong.  But i dont see that is what he is asking for.  I see jugg and bret come to a common solution that there both somewhat content with.  (first) Bret gets his acount back with nothing more then what it was.  Jugg basicly loses a ton of time and cash invested in the charactor.  I stand by what i said to bret when we talked.  Its still a really shitty thing to do to someone since i was told that bret had given jugg the acount.<br>

I was supa-dupa friends with one of you,  and I know you two have been pretty involved in playing eachother.  I used to duo with a Juggernaught in Howling Stones,  the Juggernaught that used to have incredibly bad grammar,  and was possibly the best friend I had (Although I did not deserve it in retrospection).  This Juggernaught tended to go...<br>
<br>
&quot;Something something exciting&quot; <br>
next line<br>
&quot;!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
He also told me some about himself irl,  now the Juggernaught I've spoken to recently,  he writes rather... fluently. He also doesn't mis-type his words any more. <br>
<br>
The kicker is Bret sounds a hell of alot like Juggernaught did 3 or 4 months ago when I was best buddies with Juggernaught.  Actually,  it's essentially the same style of writing.  Which of you did I used to duo with in Skyfire and Howling Stones back in the day?  Or did the Juggernaught I knew before just mature while I wasn't looking.  Notice his ez-board handle is Jugernaught and his characters name is Juggernaught,  this is a typical good ol' Jug mistake,  I&quot;m assuming the handle was created during the time I was &quot;best buds&quot; with him,  so this leads me to beleive he simply matured while I was gone.
