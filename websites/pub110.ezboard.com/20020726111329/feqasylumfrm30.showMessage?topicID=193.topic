The news was too much, her stomach churned and heaved. She sat quietly watching the waves roll by the ship. Out there it was vast and unending. As she thought she would have been. But it was not true. Her gaze fell to her pack, inside was the letter; a summons from the Masters of the Ivory towers. She had been called back to Erudin. While not fully achiving her hearts desires, it was her turn to tend the city, and teach its youth. Those would be enchanters and enchantress' needed guidance, this was her new calling.  <br> <br> Her gaze slipped back over the side of the ship as the waves rose and fell in a gentle rythm. Too much had been lost. Too much that could never be recovered. It was her hopes to return to her calling of adventuring again one day, but for now her place was in Erudin. <br> <br> A few days past before the ship reached the calm seas of Odus. As the ship docked with the shuttle, Elsana looked back at its deck wondering when next she might set sail. She turned then as her shuttle reached land and took her first tentative step, gathering her strength and her land legs once more. The walk to her chamber was a long but familiar one. But her sole steps seemed hollow. The key fit the door as it always had and she let herself into the small but cosy home. <br> <br> The tiny bed and table greeted her as she'd left them. Neat and organized and full of notes of the world about her. How much she could add to them now!  She was eager to pen the images and places she'd been. To record the journies and the beasts she'd encountered, and to put to paper those whom had become a part of her life. Settling in she looked about before  moving to hang her pack upon a hook, and her cloak behind the door. <br> <br> The room was quiet now, as she stood there holding her breath. It seemed so boring to her now, what once was a room that brought her joy in study now felt like a cage. The distant ring of armored footfalls came before her door, two voices beyond. <br> <br> &quot;Mistress of Bloodfang. Lord Kin'Ri is here to see you.&quot; Standing the Erudite straightened her robe.<br> &quot;Come.&quot; she addressed the Sentinel. The door opened after a moment allowing the Wizard entry to the room. He nodded once to the guard and waited for the door to close behind him. Elsana looked upon the man then lowered her gaze. For she'd broken every rule of her household and her family to leave on her adventures. <br> &quot;Hello brother.&quot; she said softly. The Erudite sighed slowly. <br> &quot;Are you harmed, sister? I shall take the household sentries with me if I must to seek justice..&quot; he began, but a gentle touch to his arm by the Erudite sought silence.<br> &quot; I am well brother. And unharmed. &quot; a moment of silence passed them before the wizard took his sister firmly into his arms holding her close. <br> &quot;It is good to have you home Elsana..&quot; the wizard spoke. <br> &quot;And it is  good to be home.&quot; the Erudite lied. &quot;Everything is in order for you to begin your teachings.&quot; Another long moment passed before the wizard spoke again. When he did it was soft and comforting to her.  &quot;Patience and peace, Elsana. Those are His teachings. Keep them in your heart sister.&quot; she nodded once to the words of Quellious' teachings.<br> &quot;Patience and peace.&quot; she said softly. &quot;Patience and peace.&quot;<br> <br>==========================================<br> <br>OOC: <br>It is with a very heavy heart I announce that I am retiring Elsana. While you can't keep a good dog down, neither can you keep a chanter; or for that matter an Erudite. I'm sure eventually the winds and the sea will bring this chantress back into the fray of things yet to come. But for the time, and given the circumstances, I have no drive left to play her. <br> <br>I want to thank each and every one of you who has been there along the way to assist me, teach me, buff me or what have you. The past year has been the absolute best times in my EQ life. <br> <br>I am still playing, though not so much on Lanys anymore. I've ventured off to join some offline friends on another server. I still have some alts floating on lanys and will try to contact all of my friends with them so you know who I am. To everyone else, I say thank you. Should the need arrise, I will bring Elsa out of the cupboard to help  friends and family (Vita Infinita) on their EPIC or anything else. But for regular play, I'm done. <br> <br>Good luck to you all, and safe travels.  May whatever diety you selected watch and guide over your toons both big and small. <br> <br>Thank you for the BEST memories and the BEST good times. <br> <br>Sincerely and sadly,<br>Elsana Bloodfang<br>Retired Enchantress of Quellious of the 49th Year<br>Ever PROUD member of Vita Infinita<br>~Everfaithful. Everloving. ~<br> <br>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucybecon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cybecon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/26/01 11:08:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Elsana Bloodfang - RETIRED</span><hr size=1>  You too Elsana?<br>Glasse and I (Garnette, sorry this is my AO name) have gone to Vazaelle to play.
