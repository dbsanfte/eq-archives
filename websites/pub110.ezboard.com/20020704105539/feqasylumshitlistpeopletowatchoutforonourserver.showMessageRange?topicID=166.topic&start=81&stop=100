Ok.. for those who think he was only like this at a lower lvl..<br>
<br>
<br>
BULLSHIT!  Good god he was over 50 when I met him.. and even NOW he hassles me for the stupidest shit.  (ie, reporting me for SOMEONE else calling him ebay) <br>
<br>
*small rant - goes with the ebay comment* Sure Uzzi, whatever.  Call an entire zone a bunch of idiots for participating in a GM distraction.. people are bound to tell you to shut up &amp; that they're having fun.  Act like a moron &amp; people are going to call you on it.  Not my fault you can't tell the difference between &quot;Vexana - heretic&quot; &amp; &quot;soandso - paladin&quot; *end of rant*<br>
<br>
<br>
I thought he was an awesome guy, I did.  He was made Raid Officer (yes that's right.. put in charge of raiding).  Raid after raid was set up (sound familiar)  I worked my butt off to get 45 so I could attend raids with him &amp; guild.  We can guess where that led.<br>
<br>
Ok, MoTD isn't a big guild.  That's a fact.  And at the time we were smaller than we are now.  Uzzi knew it.  &quot;It'll get bigger &amp; better&quot; he says.  Then he get's all sorts of pissy, mad at the guild for not lvling fast enough for him, etc etc.  We aren't getting him what HE wants.  So he left.. fine.<br>
<br>
<br>
So just you wait.  He'll be great for a while.  Then he'll have one of his psychotic episodes.<br>
<br>
<br>
ps, Neesha.. for a while his bro was playing the char off &amp; on.  Even while still guilded in MoTD.  I noticed the slight (very slight) difference.<br>

Ive known uzziell probably longer than anyone, and probably hurt worse by  him than most, but  he has never left, it has always been him, i always just ignored his tangents. Uzzie will never give up his account, and i sincerely doubt that he will change. All i can say is enjoy it while  it lasts but hold it against no one if the forewarnings turn to be true.<br>

He helped break up a great guild and good friend (Sacrificum - Mohjoh).  He backstabbed Monarchy of the Dead (I was a member), because we couldn't do level 50+ raids.  Uzziell will camp an entire zone and say &quot;Fuck off!&quot; to everyone else.  Uzziell cares for nobody but himself.  He is a real life psycopath.  Ask Diacide about him.  Ask Crux.  Ask Vexana.  Ask myself.  We were all good friends of Uzziell (or we thought we were) and guilded with him for 4-6 months.  Ast, you're not 'immune' to him, and if those other 3-4 times he claimed he was &quot;cured&quot; of being an asshole were lies - what makes you think he's telling YOU the truth now??<br>

Note:  Uzziell is a good wizard.  I have seen him do CC and he is incredible with the math and mana management ... but high IQ or skill is not an excuse for low EQ.  As long as things are peachy ... all will be well.  But there will always be conflict ... as we are human beings ... and that my friends is where he looses it.<br>
<br>
Not that it bothers me as I don't play anymore ... but truely if anyone has a heart of mercy as I have had ... and demonstrated time and time again for the 2 years that I did play ... note this ... Uzziell has time and time again wounded and betrayed friendships over loot and power and preference.<br>

I was running around auctioning for a port in CS, said I was paying a lot for a port.  Uzziell sends me a tell, &quot;how much?&quot;.  I say 50 pp, which is a lot for spending 1 minute and a little mana for a quick translocate.  He goes &quot;hahaha that's not a lot you idiot&quot;.  A friendly druid heard some of his offensive shouts and offered to do it for free, so I paid the druid 100 pp.  Uzziell then proceeds to call me a moron and other such names and left. <br>

I do not KS anyone and I try my hardest not to be rude to anyone. I'm not in game that often, but the people in my guild that I've met and conversated with and stuff are really nice good people. No one wants to be judged just because they're in a certin guild. I know I've heard lots of people talk shit about other guilds on Lanys. But I never make a comment about them that's negative, just for the fact that I know I do not want to be judged as a bad person or whatever just because I have &lt;Iris&gt; beside my name. I'm just trying to say that I think it would be unfair to judge every member of Iris just because of what 2 members may have done. Go ahead disagree, agree or flame me for all I care. <br>

Second SLing Glorifundel for the events at that Kedge raid is bad judgement, for he was not in the wrong.<br>
<br>
    I posted on Holy ancient one's webpage and when i went back to check my post a few min later my post was deleted and the thread was locked.<br>
<br>
Which is also odd, i guess my view on what happen is not important enough to be seen.<br>
<br>
I know a few members from Holy ancient ones and they aer good people, however i am EXTREMELY Dissapointed that you would attempt to blemish the good name of Glorifundel, who is possiably one of the nicest most helpfull wizards on Lanys.  I will be informing him of this post as soon as i see him next, and he will probibly be posting his view on the subject.  Lyriannia im sorry you feel this way, and im sorry you had a not good experiance with us (Iris members) in kedge, but the small happenings at Kedge were in no way SLable, and i think this shows bad judgement on you, or maybe you are just trying to hurt him in some way.<br>

Thank you for adding my name to this as I believe its really comical that you think I did anything wrong.<br>
<br>
My guild was preparing for a phinney raid as both me and Uzziel are on the last peice of our epic.  He then ran into lyrianna, and instead of putting together our own and racing to kill phinney (which we easily could have) he told me that everything was fine and that we would be combineing since shes only defaulting the mage peice.  (so we all said great we don't need to look for a bunch of people for this, as she had a good number already, and only brought 8ish people)<br>
<br>
I was told by Uzziel that Lyriana had told HIM that me and uzziel had defaulted wiz peice to either me or him, because we were on last peice since holy ancient ones took default on mage peice, They didn't even have a wizard present.  10 minutes later one of their wizards shows up, and she claims that he should get staff defaulted from what I understand of it(not that I have anything against the other wizard as he seemed a really nice guy).  Uzziel got angry because of this, and then loged off (he went to check the lanys boards for a scheduled phinney raid that she claimed she had, yet another reason we were being patient with her.  But it turned out there was no such post)<br>
<br>
In any case I started talking with Lyr and told her three times that if she had a problem with us being there, or the deal that uzziell had made with her that I would leave immediately, no harm no foul good luck to you, and all of my guildies would leave as well,  letting her have COMPLETE control over phinney untill she gave up or killed him.  SHE TOLD ME TO STAY AND YES YOU GET DEFAULT SINCE ITS YOUR LAST EPIC PEICE.  I was not bullying her in any way shape or form.  Infact I had done phinney with her before and let her try the CoH trick (which had failed, and wasted 3 hours of my time in KK cause people gave up due to nothing happening).  Since it was her raid I let her try it again this time.  (once again it failed miserably and we did nothing but kill seahorses for 3ish hours).  In the end we didn't kill him, infact the only reason we even saw him before we gave up was because I pulled him to zone.  In any case he didn't die and she gave up, the same with all of my people as 3ish hours of doing nothing can get to you after a while.<br>
<br>
I don't know what uzziel had said to you, be it right or wrong, but I know that I was never rude to you in the slightest, and I know that none of my other guildies present were rude in the slightest.<br>
<br>
Phinney droped the wizard staff later that night to another guild.  Had me or uzziel put together our own raid one of us would have our epic right now, but because of our pateince and willingness to cooperate we were left with nothing, and she is the one who feels a loss in this situation?<br>
