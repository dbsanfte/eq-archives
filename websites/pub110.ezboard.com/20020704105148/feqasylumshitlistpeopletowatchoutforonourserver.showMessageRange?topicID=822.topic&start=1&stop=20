He has demonstrated that<br>                            he has no appreciation of anyone's <br>kindness, <br>charity, or honesty, and that he is both a thief and a<br>                            compulsive liar, and is not worth playing <br>with.<br><br>                            On April 9th, this young man took advantage <br>of <br>the fact that my daughter had not properly logged off<br>                            of the server screen to go into her account <br>and <br>take all of the items off of a character there which I had<br>                            agreed to hold for a third party. The theft <br>was <br>not discovered for several days, and we assumed the<br>                            loss was due to a patch error and contacted <br>the <br>server GM. Much to our surprise, the GM on checking<br>                            official VI logs told us that the items had <br>been <br>dropped on the ground by the mule they were on, and<br>                            shortly afterwards picked up by Rolexia.<br><br>                            As we learned later, Rolexia proceeded to <br>SolB <br>where she/he asked the assistance of a guildmate and<br>                            officer of Norrath's Blessed to help him <br>transfer some items that "a high level friend had given him," and<br>                            the items were then passed to the character <br>Foilvein. My daughter and I tried, from Saturday, April<br>                            13th, to Tuesday, April 16th, to persuade <br>the <br>young man to return the items. The leader of his guild,<br>                            several of the officers and the poor fellow <br>Foil <br>had involved by seeking his assistance in transferring the<br>                            items, were all as appalled as we were and <br>did <br>everything in their power to help. Because Foilvein was<br>                            refusing to cooperate, the GM's were again <br>contacted to inform them of the evident "hacking." They,<br>                            too, wanted us all to find a peaceful <br>solution, <br>but time was running out. On Tuesday the 16th, this<br>                            petition was pending and the clock was <br>running <br>out on official prosecution of a criminal case. He could<br>                            have faced up to seven years in prison for <br>the <br>offense, and my daughter's account - even though she<br>                            was the innocent victim - would have been <br>frozen <br>for a period of one to three weeks as well, while VI<br>                            thoroughly investigated and made sure her <br>account was secure.<br><br>                            At that point I finally saw the young man <br>face <br>to face, and persuaded him it was in the best interests of<br>                            all to simply return the items, and I <br>helped him <br>to do so, promising the matter would end there. We are<br>                            talking about 50k worth of equipment, which <br>was <br>no small matter, with items including a Red<br>                            Dragonscale Breastplate… All of the major <br>items <br>came back except for a Rallic Pack, a Large Soiled Bag,<br>                            Hero Bracers, and 2237 pp, the latter of <br>which <br>he said he had simply destroyed.<br><br>                            The officers in Norrath's Blessed had <br>promised <br>to replace any items that were not returned, if possible,<br>                            but I felt it was not entirely right to ask <br>them <br>to pay so much for something not their fault. I raised the<br>                            2237 pp myself with the help of a couple of <br>dear <br>in-game friends, and returned that and a Rallic Pack to<br>                            the fellow the items belonged to, and NB's <br>leader pledged to replace the bracer. Because the items were<br>                            returned, we all thought we could put the <br>whole <br>thing behind us and get back to enjoying the game….<br>                            Foilvein seemed truly contrite, admitting <br>to me <br>he had made a mistake and it was all his fault.<br><br>                            I learned yesterday, just one day after <br>this, <br>that Foilvein is now telling everyone the items were his in<br>                            the first place, and that we had somehow <br>rigged <br>the offical logs to make it APPEAR he had stolen them<br>                            and then threatened to prosecute him (we, <br>not <br>Verant) and thereby forced him to give them to us. He<br>                            didn't name us evidently, but referred to <br>"his <br>girlfriend and her mother" in his lying tale, and one of the<br>                            group members at the time actually <br>happening to <br>be a friend of mine and having heard from me what<br>                            really happened, called him on it but <br>Foilvein <br>continued to insist his version was the true one.<br><br>                            So in return for saving this young man from <br>jail, I am now being slandered, as is Yaar, who was the<br>                            innocent victim.

I Said ok roll on bag everyone,everyone rolled including Foil,a druid in my party won the roll,Fostben.
