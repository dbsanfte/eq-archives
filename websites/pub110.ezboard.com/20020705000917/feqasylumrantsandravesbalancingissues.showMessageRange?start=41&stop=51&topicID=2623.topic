A feature allowing players to allow for friends to find them.<br>
<br>
It wasn't presented as a way for people to 'look up scuzbags'. It also wasn't presented as a definate idea. It was stated that they may or may not offer that as a service.<br>
<br>
However, obviously due to the overwhelming response from the player base on this, they're stating that they will. And that's a start.<br>
<br>
I want to briefly address a couple of things.<br>
<br>
The concept of time/manpower being the reason they would not do name changes is bullshit. Yes, bullshit. <br>
<br>
GMs have the tools to change names, as most people are aware. And anyone who played EQ from the beginning also knows that surnames <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> were originally granted by the GMs when a player hit level 20</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. They had no automated system in place. In fact one was not put into place for a long time.<br>
<br>
They had <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> easily</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the manpower and time to manually give every player over level 20 surnames. Yet...it was an issue for name changes? /boggle<br>
<br>
GMs also (for free) changed surnames, provided you had a good reason for the request. (I don't like it anymore wasn't considered a good reason.)<br>
<br>
So given the fact that they had GMs manually granting surnames, and the fact that GM's for free would change surnames...the entire concept of just not having enough time to do it is total horse shit.<br>
<br>
And the only thing offensive about that, is that they think the customers are stupid enough to buy that line.<br>
<br>
The <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> main</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> reason given from day one on why name changes would <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> never</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be allowed was that EverQuest was a social game. Your name was an extension of your repuation. Most people cannot identify other players visually...even now. Turn off the name tags in a large zone. Unless they're a close friend...odds are you can't tell one halfling from another. You may be able to tell their class based on what you can visually see...but even that can be a crap shoot. <br>
<br>
A character name is the prime identifier of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> who you are</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. And now that's changable.<br>
<br>
We'll have to see how well the database works. Unfortunately *most* assholes don't make it to the shitlist. Most guilds have a blacklist, either privately listed on their boards, or known in the guild...where they haven't shitlisted the people. Often when someone is shitlisted, we'll see a flood of people show up, offering their bad experiences. How many times have you seen someone post &quot;Heh, I wondered when Bob the Asshat would be posted here, he was a prick in X situation&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now though, once caught out, they can change their name and their reputation.<br>
<br>
Hell, one good haul, and the ebaying alone would pay for it. One decent sized guild bank, coupled with a name change, and you not only paid for it with your profits...but escaped any consequences. <br>
<br>
You wouldn't even raise suspicions...if you merely changed around character names to a alt no one knew you had. It wouldn't be a &quot;new&quot; name.<br>
<br>
Will it be abused? Yup. Will it have a negative impact in the game? Yup.<br>
<br>
$50 for a name change that realistically the GMs did on a larger scale before with surnames for free isn't merely covering their cost of time.<br>
<br>
It's a complete and total cash cow, and a good one.<br>
<br>
Also remember, they've stated that people who didn't have the original account info couldn't server move either...yet we've seen that happen too. The benefit was they couldn't take their loot with them. The loot being the driving force (often) behind most assholes.<br>
<br>
Well, now they can keep their loot and get a new rep too. And generally people who want a new rep are those who have made their haul, and achieved a level where they find that their past actions prevent them from doing things with others.<br>
<br>
An asshole tax? Certainly. But by the time they're discovered to be an asshole, or by the time they've done things that cause people to look up their names...I wonder how many people will be fucked over? Even with well known assholes (coughUzziellcough) how many people has he been able to fuck over time and time again <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> with</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> people warning others of him? <br>
<br>
How much more difficult will it be without that warning? <br>
<br>
Bottom line, server move charges were a huge money maker for them. They see this as the same thing. And if it has some negative effects, it doesn't matter. They'll make more money from implementing it than they'll lose. At least for now. <p><a href="http://marian333.livejournal.com" target="_blank">

I am sorry, but do they think no semi-intelligent programmers read this garbage.  I can't understand how changing a player name could be anything more than a single row edit in a database.  If it is something more than that, then the code of this game is utter sheeeeaat.  I can't believe that.<br>

<br>
I agree that this service will mainly benefit those people who have, for one reason or another, ruined their reputation.  But that being said, I must admit that I am coming here after completing my registration for a name change.  Please bare with me while I tell you a story about a little monk named &quot;Jdoe&quot;, and why not only &quot;Asshats&quot; will benefit from this service.<br>
<br>
Two years ago I created my first ever Character;  A Monk by the name of &quot;Jdoe&quot; (no relation to J.Lo).  From day one I grouped this character with a very good real life friend.  For many months we enjoyed exploring Norrath together.<br>
<br>
During our adventures we failed to make a signifigant amount of new friends, but the few new friendships that we did forge were absolutely amazing.  Too say that I love these people would be putting it mildly.  Now, calling my friend anti-social on the other hand goes way beyond putting it mildly.  He absolutely refused to group up with anybody new, and his sense of community was severely lacking, to the point of non-existence.  He was unfortunately one of those infamous &quot;asshats&quot;.  He had no qualms about tossing the PnP in peoples faces.  &quot;Oh you were here camping for the last two hours?  Well I'm here now, too bad&quot; was his usual attitude.  <br>
<br>
Needless to say, this type of behavior made both myself, and our friends extremely uncomfortable.  When we tried to talk him into moving on and finding another camp it would always be met with the &quot;I pay to play this game, and I'll camp what ever I damn please&quot; arguement.  Of course, always followed with &quot;Verant doesnt recognize camps, so tough shit for them&quot;.<br>
<br>
Slowly, one by one, my friend burned his bridges.  All of our good friends would no longer have anything to do with him, and of course I couldn't blame them.  I often took breaks from EQ because the arguements we were having in-game put our real life friendship in jeopardy.<br>
<br>
Finally after about a year of playing &quot;Jdoe&quot; I could take it no longer.  I told my friend that I was in need of an extended break and that I had canceled my Everquest account.  In reality though I had only put my beloved monk, whom I had raised to the ripe old age of 54 into retirement and went to work creating a steady parade of Alts, none of whom I was ever fully satisfied with.   In time, these alts became nothing more than identies used to chat with my EQ friends. My friends would fill me in on all their amazing adventures and I would pine to play &quot;Jdoe&quot; with them once again.<br>
<br>
On two occassions I petitioned to have my name changed, knowing full well that the odds were greatly stacked against me.  But still I tried. And failed.  I had lost all hope of ever playing my monk again, and had made the decision that when my six month subscription runs out, my Everquest days would be over.  Over time, the friendships I made in EQ would fade, and all I would have left were fond memories.<br>
<br>
Now today I log into Everquest and my heart almost stopped beating in my chest.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  I read the message three times.  I truely couldn't believe it.  I had even considered that it may be some elaborate hack by somebody trying to steal accounts... this was the extent of my disbelief, though it was short lived.   I didn't even finish logging in to EQ.  I ESC'd back out to desktop and went right for the eqlive site to fill out my application.  I didn't even bat an eyelash at the $50 fee.  I was going to get &quot;Jdoe&quot; back!!  <br>
<br>
You can not even begin to believe the feeling of elation I am experiencing.  At the same time I feel a twinge of guilt, because I know that I am benefitting from a service, which on the whole does nothing to benefit our community.  In fact perhaps just the opposite, for I fear that the vast majority of people using this service will be the &quot;Asshats&quot; of Norrath.  We can only hope that they have either changed their ways, or their particular brand of &quot;assholery&quot; will quickly rear its ugly head.<br>
<br>
I just hope though, that not everybody feels that any &quot;new&quot; high level character who appears on Lanys over the next little while is a jerk in disguise.<br>
<br>
