I PREVAILED and WILL continue too </span><hr size=1> See the amusing thing about this post is this.<br>
<br>
I won't answer to what Gus and Aste have said. Gus covered pretty much everything with what happened with Riders, and in an extremely accurate way. She left out some things though. Namely that Riders took some guff over adding a known piece of shit like you. However, of course they decided to judge for themselves. Which is admirable...if sometimes naive when someone proves time and time again what a scuzzbag they are. However, some may not have been aware of your history, it's certain others were. I tend to attempt to judge people on their own merits as well, so can hardly damn anyone else who does the same. It's admirable when guilds do that. Sometimes it works out, sometimes in cases like yours it bites them in the ass. Fortunately they found out quickly what a true asshole you are.<br>
<br>
Time and time and time again though that's happened with you Uzz. You talk a good game, until you lose it. Time and time and time and time again people on the server have attempted to give you numerous chances. From you ninjalooting and gating on that long ago raid on fire giants until now you've <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> repeatedly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> shown your character to people. <br>
<br>
Your rewriting of history is funny. You claim you didn't know the item was nodrop when you ninjalooted so long ago. Your first (but certainly not last!) shitlisting. There's a glimmer of truth in that, but only a glimmer. You did know, because you had been told. Repeatedly. As <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> everyone</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on that raid had been. First you denied looting it. Then you claimed you didn't know. And you didn't sit down and discuss it. That was also part of the problem. You ended up gating out with it. Unfortunately EQ also didn't have the strict rules against ninjalooting that they do now, or you'd be banned. Nice attempt though, really.<br>
<br>
And other here, and on other posts have said the thing most telling about your character. The people you seem to turn on most viciously are the people who have given you additional chances. And you've burned 'em all sooner or later. Generally sooner. /shrug<br>
<br>
Most of your alts, when it wasn't even *known* they were your alts...made a poor name for themselves by their actions. I find it laughable that you would attempt to tout being on numerous servers with level 60 characters. Even if it's true, and frankly given the way *I* have seen you act, I'd look out my window before believing you if you said the sky was blue...I sincerely doubt you have a stellar reputation there. <br>
<br>
This isn't a case of someone who made a mistake long ago and is still damned for it. Oh no, that would be far too simple. This is a case of where someone has pulled the bullshit of telling people :<br>
<br>
a) I didn't do it.<br>
b) It happened, but not quite like that.<br>
c) Yes, that happened, but I was wrong. I've changed.<br>
d) Yes, I acted that way but the reason was (insert an excuse here). I've changed, and I've learned from my mistakes.<br>
<br>
And my personal favorite, which I experienced after hearing all of the above after refusing to group you long ago. (Yes, I remember it well scUzziell)<br>
<br>
e) (insert insults here, neither poetic, nor lyrical, in fact sad attempts that a 3rd grader could improve upon, generally designed poorly in an attempt to attack the person very personally and make them feel bad...which ends up being laughably pathetic)<br>
<br>
Generally you seem to try combinations of a, b, c and d before progressing to e.  <br>
<br>
It seems like every wave of people who've leveled up has seen this from you. And gives you chances 'til you burn them too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The shitlist is chock full of people who gave you additional chances which you blew. Chock full of many people who amazingly enough <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> never</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have anything bad to say about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> anyone</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. I can't remember ever seeing Istrahd be critical of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anyone</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->....except you.<br>
<br>
The general consensus has been that you're nuts. Whether or not that's true, I have no idea. But more than a couple people have come to believe you're totally psychotic. I'm sure it's not difficult to see why.<br>
<br>
You came to the boards screaming at 7 Dreams, and talking about the calendar. Yet...not only do you seem to lack an understanding of the purpose of the calendar, which is laughable given the amount of time you've been around. But you had <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> also canceled your raid </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. What was it you were bitching about again? Or were you merely attempting to drum up sympathy and support for you and your guild. I know it hasn't *quite* been working out well for you. Too many people know about you.<br>
<br>
I'm sure though that some people will never have that cusp event that causes you to completely come unhinged in front of them. And since you started your own guild now (which is frankly funny in soooo many ways) officers of guilds won't see the bullshit you have caused in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> every single guild</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you've been in. Won't get the reports of your actions against others. Frankly, running your own guild is about the *only* way you'll have a guild tag for any length of time. Maybe.<br>
<br>
Even then I'd be surprised if you can maintain 10 people for any length of time. Perhaps you might, maybe you have other accounts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you only had a problem with Riders...people could say, ah well it was just that guild. Or even just with Gus, someone could say, ah well it was just a personality conflict it happens. But when you see the amounts of people who have posted, and that's only a small fraction of people who've had problems with you...the only constant in the pattern is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
You won't change. You're absolutely incapable of it. You've repeatedly demonstrated that. Some people will be able to take the warnings of others, see what you've done and steer clear of ya. Others will learn by experience. <br>
<br>
You can think whatever you like, that you've somehow prevailed. /shrug I certainly don't care what you think, and most others don't either. The only thing you've ever prevailed at doing in EQ Uzziell is repeatedly demonstrating to numerous players what an absolute piece of crap you are, how dishonorable you are in action (ninjalooting, stealing), word (verbally attacking numerous people, attempting to cause trouble in every guild you've been in) and deed (repeatedly fucking over anyone who worked to give you another chance.)<br>
<br>
Congrats on your numerous &quot;successes&quot;. /roll eyes You're the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> player I've ever seen that has managed to piss off sooooo many people. And such a variety of people too. Woot what an accomplishment.<br>
