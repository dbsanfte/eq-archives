<br>
I was on the Kael raid he was on when he won the Kael plate BP.  He then also won the silk bracer or whatever as his greed roll a little while later, and people were laughin 'cuz the guy was so lucky.<br>
<br>
I do know he was considering selling the plate BP MQ rights so he could buy a Cobalt BP.  He had a buyer for his bp and a seller for the cobalt, just no flawless diamonds.  I do know though that he ended up not doing the deal, because I saw him later with a Thurg BP.  <br>
<br>
He asked me what I thought about him doing that, and I told him I didn't think it was the most honorable thing to do, but since he didn't have the diamonds or the ability to easily get the diamonds, I wouldn't hold it against him, mainly because I hadn't rolled against him.  I told him though that if people that had rolled against him found out he sold the thing, there would be some pretty angry people.<br>
<br>
The ninja loot doesn't neccesarily seem like something that he would do, but I don't know the guy all that well so I can't really say, but it could be possible he was *EXTREMELY* tired of hanging at 52 so he could get that scale (I know he was 52 when he won the bp in like, early February or so) so he felt he was justified in taking it or something, but then it sounds like he already had gotten and sold a scale earlier.<br>
<br>
The fact that he ninja'd the red scale seems undeniable, but whether it was him or his cousin, I can't tell. <p><img src="http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/tests/giantrobot/optimusprime.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><a href="http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/tests/giantrobot/">Which Colossal Death Robot Are <i>You</i>?</a><br>Agent of SANOKA

Thanks for posting in here dood, you've made this thread so much better than watching Neighbours (Aussie Soap). <br>
 <br>
Lugorr..<br>
<br>
I was in a group af BnB's in SolB. Lugorr kept coming into our camp and asking the chanter for speed every 2 seconds, and our druid for chloro and skin every other seconds. Didn't like what he was doing to my group. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
But then again, there were people /shout'ing Lugorr, you suck! get outta here. That's not that nice either. What should we do to these people that beg for things and the people that hurt other people's feelings? There isn't an appropriate way to deal with such problems. Lets just post and share our bitter experiences, not to bang on someone over and over again over a period of so many posts. <br>

<br>
Adam, you really need to have Lugorr post here himself, and he needs to post something that makes some sense.  He didn't get suspended?  The GM didn't make him give it back?  Does he still have it then?  If not, what happened to it?  What happened to the previous red scale he had?  Where is this cousin and what does he have to say for himself for doing this?  Who is the cousin's 56 warrior, so that char can be shitlisted if he were the one actually doing the ninja-looting?<br>
<br>
And last but not least, how are we ever supposed to know if it were really his cousin playing or if that is just a convenient excuse?  Are we just supposed to take your word for it?  What if a total stranger wanted to buy something I was selling, and wanted me to give it to that char while they logged on a mule to give me the money?  Should I just take their word for that, too? <p><center><a href="http://www.amybrownart.com"><img src="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/adjsig11.jpg"></a>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Thats exactly what he said when (whoever it may be that was playing Lugorr at the time) took off with and disbanded with a guildy lended Lammy. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Did the &quot;real&quot; Lugorr ( not saying I beleive the story, but just giving it the benifet of the doubt until I learn more) ever return the &quot;lended&quot; lammy?<br>
<br>
If not, then I won't buy his story here for a second either..<br>
<br>
Might I remind everyone of something also?  Does it matter if it was his cousin or not?  Someone claims it was his cousin ( a 56 something, so he knows better as well, someone in that family is all screwed up anyway.. ), but even IF it was.. does it matter?<br>
<br>
I NEVER give access to my account to ANYONE, but if I ever did, am I not still responsible for the actions taken by my char?  It seems to me that I would be..  The only time you wouldn't is if your account was hacked ( which I'm sure is the excuse everyone will be using next /sigh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
I find it very hard to buy this story that it was his cousin mainly for the reasons that Tarot has laid out, but EVEN IF it was, I still feel he is responsible for the actions taken by his char ( even those by people he has given access to his char too ), and to deny that tells me alot about his personality anyway.. <br>
<br>
I know IF I ever gave access to my char to someone, and IF they used it to screw someone else over, I would be the first one on here appologizing, doing WHATEVER it took to make it right, and instead of making excuses I'd be accepting responsiblity ( after all *I* gave the access to the dirtbag, there for *I* AM responsible, IF that person screws someone over ), and then I would begin the task of rebuilding my rep as best I could.. After the first time my &quot;cousin&quot; screwed someone over, I can PROMISE they would never have access to my account again for ANY reason ( :: points to the post above about the &quot;cousin&quot; taking off with someones lammy :: )<br>
<br>
I can honestly say that even IF it was his cousin ( and his cousin is also the person who took off with the &quot;lended&quot; lammy ), that I will not attend any raid Lugorr has anything to do with.. For all I know, it's really his &quot;cousin&quot; on that day..<br>
<br>
In closing, I'd like to agree with Barurol about a point he so :: coughs :: elequently made.. :: cough ::<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If any friends lie to me theyr not MY friend anymore.

It really is that simple, the more lies you tell, the more friends you lose, the harder it will be to rebuild.. I really can't explain it any better than that.  I think everyone has heard my &quot;Faction in RL being like EQ&quot; speech before, so I won't bother to repeat it.. It still holds true though..<br>

Oh and yes foir the people that will ask a dumb question like well how does he get online HE WAS AT MY HOUSE thats the only time he can play. Oh and one more thing take my word for IT? how the hell in the first place can u take the person saying he did its word for it you got no proof your nothing u can't really have proof in this game except for screen shots so don't talk about that i consider myself a honorable player and why would i lie about this. He was at my house when his cousin did it, he gave it back to try to make up for what his STUPID cousin did. NO he is not a bad guy so please stop saying oh the old my cousin did it ya well HE DID and i know it for a fact. Think of when you know something 100 percent and people say no i don't think so and your like IM SOOOO DAM SURE well thats the way it is he DID NOT DO It he takes his responsibility and he knows that his true friends will understand that he should not have let his cousin on but the bottom line the only thing he did wrong was let his cousin play...nothing else. So get off of your high horse people and look. Thanks you guys who stick by a friend.<br>

<br>
You are NOT helping him one little bit. As someone that met Lugorr before and liked him, I am asking you to STOP posting!!! Let Lugorr himself post here to defend himself. Your posts are barely readable and hurt my eyes attempting to. Go back to school and learn some grammar and punctuation and you MIGHT be taken seriously.<br>
<br>
As for Lugorr, I kept from posting as I wasn't directly involved. But I met him on a Hate raid and he was VERY nice and polite so I have been watching this thread. In this case, I HOPE it is the cousin that actually did it and not Lugorr. <br>
As for someone mentioning how old/young he is.. he told me he was a teenager.. can't remember exact age, but think it was 16 or 17... but could be wrong.<br>
<br>
Hope this gets resolved and all misunderstandings cleared,<br>

The night of the red scale incident, I noticed there was a raid and I didnt have time to go because I had plans that night.  So I called up my cousin, who lives in High Point, NC by the way, and asked him to fill in for me in a raid.  He has a level 56 Warrior on Xegony at the moment anyway so I figured he could handle the task of attending a Lord Nagafen raid.  The following day I logged on and went about my business, about a week or so later I was confronted about the scale, now I may have been a little defensive, but I was being accused of being a jack-ass ninja looter and I am not.  So I hesitated to think that I really had it, but sure enough, I went to the back, had the scale, so I gave it to Thehitokiri for distribution to the rightful people.  I was ticked off at my cousin and just so all of you know, I havent talked to him since.  About him posting on here, I will call him or go give him a visit so that he can talk to anyone personally that wishes to speak to him on Everquest, but I will try and get him to post on here.  About the lamentation, I didnt get Lugorr the character until about level 42 or somethin like that, a friend of mine quit Everquest, so I took all the armor and stuff that I had on my character and moved it to Lugorr and took over, he told me nothing of any debts he had but if anyone wants to contact me of something I need to pay back then I would gladly do so, just e-mail me at  KingBlu1@aol.com with the subject name Lugorr's debts or something of that magnitude.  I just want everyone to know that this was not my doings, and I know it was my character but I will do anything and everything in my power to fix the problem that has happened.  Thank you all for your time.<br>

Beyond that it's been a while since the lammy incident and the guild bank has not really missed the item. I was far more concerned with the character of the person behind the name Lugorr than any past incident. I hope that you manage to work out the rest of these problems. <br>
<br>
As for lending an account to anyone else, I have always viewed this as extremely risky. I too have a cousin that plays as well as a number of tried and true real life friends, but as far as giving out my password? I cant imagine a circumstance serious enough to demand it. <p><center><img src="http://fp1.centurytel.net/sect/Stored%20Sigs/AeonSignitureGMlrg.jpg"></center>
