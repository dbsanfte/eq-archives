I know i may have forgot some people.... im sorry if i did. <br>
Ive been through this so many times in my head.  Ive debated with myself whether or not to quit for the longest time.  For over a year now ive played this game, made many friends and learned a lot.  as of right now i think im taking an *EXTENDED* break from eq.  Ive lead DoTC since a month after i started playing the game.  Tonight i disbanded it, hoping something good will come out of it.  Everyone of you guys is precious to me in your own right, especially the ex members of DoTC.  Theres a huge list of people and friends that i truely adore that i would like to thank.<br>

Cuukey...you have been a great impact to me in EQ, You were always uber. Its been great being your good friend and will never forget the golden...erm...platinum days of dotc. Its been fun, and for me I will go around and act homeless for a new guild, if any guild likes me, heh. Who knows I'll probably join a lvl 5's guild in greater faydark, and them asking me for sow. :P<br>
