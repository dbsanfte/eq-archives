Nasty guy in general.</span><hr size=1> I had done nothing by the time that hartland trained the first time.  I didn't provoke him, I didn't do shit until he trained me.  I hadn't laughed out loud, I did nothing except sit there and wait for Shoot and Hartland to finish.  yes, I admit to not telling anyone to shut up, and in group I said somethings, totally invalid since it was in group, until HARTLAND trained me.  At which point I feel that I have all rights to call him a rude fucker and he better stop the shit or I will petition him.  And he still refuses to appologize to me, even before he was shitlisted, and I sent him a tell, with all intention of resolving this, I said I want to talk to you about what happened, and you know his response?  Talk to a GM, I don't care.<br>
<br>
Same response from all officers from CR.  Even the leader.  Now at that point, the situation is over, I am on an alt, talking to him, and he still refuses to appologize, if he was such a great guy, and didn't deserve to be on here, he would have said something, anything, about he took it too far.  But no, he didn't, so screw him, he deserves this, and if he was anything of a man he would come here and say, &quot;yes, I Hartland trained, and it was wrong.  No matter what reason, I was wrong for it and I am sorry for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Go ahead, talk to Aashna, she has my log, I am sure she sent it to many people already too, I say nothing to Hartland in say, tell, shout, or ooc.  Yet I was trained, so how can you even possibly say I provoked him?<br>
<br>
I mean how can you say that we, being everyone in the group that wasn't Shoot, provoked him.  He came over and provoked us by saying he was going to train us, and that we are lowbies, and kept going on and on.  There was a point that no one in our group said anything, and Hartland kept saying your all lowbies, like 3 times before he figured none of us cared that he was saying it so he moved on to other insults.  There was nothing about his armor as he states there was (another lie), and how we all were harrassing him, but it wasn't true, the truth is he came over and was provoking us until we told him to fuck off so that we could pull, in which case he trained.<br>
<br>
As far as being a whiny crybaby, screw that, Hartland is a piece of shit, who admittedly trains, refuses to appologize for it, and deserves to remain at the top of this list for another month.  If I had done ANYTHING to warrant being treated without respect, then I wouldn't still be here, but I did nothing, I said nothing, I emoted nothing, I did nothing, and got trained.  For that, Hartland should appologize to me, seeing as how I was the first one to try and keep it off this board anyway, which was more respect than anyone in my group gave him all night.  And for that, I am the one that is harrassed, because I didn't provoke him yet I still want an appology.  Shoot is the one that wanted his attention, I am the one that took the prroblems that came with it, and yet Shoot is ok and I am not?  You have some screwed up thinking Longfeller, obviously you don't know the truth.  Ask them how much I said before he trained.  Go ahead, because I did NOTHING to provoke him until he trained, and he trained BEFORE ANYONE SAID TO HIM TO PULL completely sarcastically meaning are you going to train us again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ubinnar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Binnar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t dood!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/24/02 3:40:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

Are you saying that it was ok to train because he was annoyed?<br>
If so:<br>
You<br>
Are<br>
A<br>
Fucking<br>
Moron<br>
 <br>
<br>
And as for 1/2 the server being on your ignore list. Well, good. If you're that easily annoyed/offended you:<br>
A. Have some serious anger managment problems or a very short temper in which case good I don't want to group, talk, or be anywhere near you.<br>
B. An over sensitive little person who shouldn't be playing this game and I don't want to group, talk, or be anywhere near you.<br>
<br>
In either case good. Put me on ignore and stay the hell away.<br>
<br>
And please people the whole &quot;Heh you must be &lt;enter age here from 5-15&gt;&quot; argument is beginning to wear a little thin. Almost as much as &quot;HA u r a n00b I know everything&quot; argument. I now atuomatically classify anyone who uses them as an elitest asshole or a fucking moron. Usually both.<br>
<br>
Try something new for a change. I know it might strain your tiny little brain to think of a new bullshit argument or maybe a real one, but please try.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daiko to your analogy:<br>
Difference is this. One is real life one is a game. In RL you don't have a /ignore, would be nice if we did sometimes. In EQ you do and it takes all of 5 goddamned seconds to use it. And again I say.

Nasty guy in general.</span><hr size=1> From what I have read so far, both individuals (Hartland and Shoot) were in the wrong and admitted to it.  People do stupid things occasionally, deal with it.  The first person that says they haven't is a darn liar.<br>
<br>
Now, on another note...I look forward to seeing several of the people replying to this thread being put on the SL themselves (if they haven't already had it happen) because several of you seem to think that BSing in OOC or shout is a trainable offense.  <br>
<br>
I don't give a darn if someone is being so rude that it makes you want to punch your computer monitor, there is NO valid reason to train.  NONE.<br>
<br>
Guess what?  I use the OOC and shout to occasionally chat to guildies in the zone, I COULD use guild chat.  But I don't because I choose not to.  Does this excessive spam warrant training?  Refer to what I said earlier, &quot;there is NO valid reason to train.  NONE.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, I have had numerous times where I had to read things over zone wide chat that was just plain disturbing and/or annoying.  What did I do?  Train them?  NO! (refer to quote of myself the paragraph prior)  I do an ooc asking them to take it to tells and then IGNORE them, notice I did not say /ignore, I just ignore them as in quit paying attention to their BS.  If you do not have the ability to do this, then you really should find another method of entertainment...maybe go play football or take up boxing so you can hurt the people that make you mad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udiako.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diako</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/29/02 5:11:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

<br>
People don't like to feel forced to avoid a situation cause someone else wants to be a dick.<br>
<br>
If I go into a zone, and I purposly act like a freaken morron...  And the people in Zone tell me to STFU...  Is it my right to bitch back at them and tell them to use /ignore and tell THEM to STFU ?  It's a free world, isn't it ?  I'm forcing my Ignorance unto others, and TELLING them that if they don't like it /ignore me.   Now...  is /ignore a good reason to act stupid ?<br>
<br>
Again, since people have lost track of this whole thread since it's so long....   Someone from this bunch of Idiots said at the biggining, You don't like it use /Ignore... in other words... Don't bother us, we like acting like dicks.<br>
<br>
Real Life or In Game.  A tool like /ignore does not give you a licence to piss people off.   I said it then, and I say it again.  If there was a Guide/GM in that zone seeing people telling them to stop and they would have continued...  THEY would have got a warning for purposly causing undo Irritation to others.<br>
<br>
Either way, Shoot was the main trouble and he apologized about it.  I think it's funny that the others involved that were with him are so defensive...   Usually when someone gets hyper defensive, and pointing fingers...  They know they fucked up.   Otherwise, you shut the fuck up if you didn't do anything.  All Binnar has done in the beginning is shifting everything on Hartland...  and yes, Hartland shouldn't have done what he did.  It DOES NOT EXCUSE that their groups were Total idiots, and had no Respect for anyone else in that zone.   Again, Shoot is the only one I respect after all this.  He can admit making a mistake...  That, I like of people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ubinnar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Binnar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t dood!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/29/02 1:19:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland... Nasty guy in general.</span><hr size=1> Daiko:<br>
Damn straight I shifted everything to Hartland.  Except for the fact that I say many times over that Shoot was probably being an asshole, but that still is no excuse to train.  Hartland is the one that trained.  Now if you read what I said, I said nothing, emoted nothing, shouted nothing, ooc'd nothing, until he started training us.  If I had acted the way shoot had, then yes, I would admit fault.  But what fault do I have, as all I did was sit there and wait for MY group to pull to me, not for Hartland to pull.<br>
<br>
Now I wasn't quiet because the same person that started this was slandering my name in the first post by saying I was being a rude asshole because I was drunk, when I hadn't said a damned word in anything except group chat.  And when the hell did shoot admit fault?  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm not saying I'm blameless here<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> is this where you say he admits fault?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As I'm sure I could have found a more mature way of dealing with him... but I was too damn tired <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Or is that where?<br>
<br>
I am sorry, but just as shoot said himself, his group did not deserve to be trained, yet Hartland refuses to say, Hey I am sorry.  This whole thing would be resolved if the trainer would come up to a person that had said nothing, did nothing, just sat there and got trained, and all he has to say is &quot;I am sorry I wasn't thinking&quot;  But instead he says I don't care, Talk to a GM.<br>
<br>
Also, yes a GM or Guide might have warned Shoot had they been in zone, but they would not have banned him for it.  If they saw what Hartland did, they might have banned him.  See the difference in severity?<br>
<br>
So, Yes, I have a problem with Shoot, and I have dealt with it.  But the fact still remains, I did not deserve to be trained, and I was.  And Hartland refuses to say anything to me except &quot;talk to a GM.&quot;  His Guild Crimson renegades has the same view.  His leader stated, &quot;Really, I don't care.&quot;  when asked to talk about the situation.  So, where am I left, I am left with Hartland treating me like shit, an ex-guild leader that wants to talk shit, embarass, and generally defame his own guildmates, and people on the message board saying that I am guilty because I don't enjoy having my guild leader talk shit about me publically and I don't enjoy being trained.<br>
<br>
Look at what Aashna posted, the only thing that she has me for is saying that I would shitlist Hartland, at the very end when I was logging, which I then rethought, and logged back in to talk, and to get information on their guildleader.<br>
<br>
So, go ahead, try to assume that I am the guilty one here, with Hartland training.  Try to invision my guilt as I said nothing, didn't spam the zone at all, didn't provoke.  I did nothing and was trained, when I ask that something be done, even as little as an appology, I am told that I am at fault, unfortunately, I am joined by many others, Training is NEVER acceptable.  If it is an accident, then, well no big deal, but when you state that you are going to train someone, and then do, more than once, that is not ever acceptable, and According to the leader of Crimson Renegades, and multiple officers, what hartland did was fine by them.<br>
<br>
Until someone can come up with something to blame me with, Diako, please just take the facts and realize that I am defending myself from what Shoot had said, more than anything else.  I am pointing so much blame on Hartland because he did something that has no excuse, no matter what, and is bannable, and his guild &quot;Doesn't Care&quot;.<br>
<br>
But yes, Shoot is to blame also, he spammed, provoked, shouted profanity, sent tells back and forth saying how he was having too much fun to stop, and in the end he finally says that he isn't blamless, so I guess he deserves all the respect.  Compared of myself, who didn't provoke, didn't spam, got trained, tried to resolve it before the shitlist, and tried to bring the truth to the matter by sending out my log so people could compare them to their own, or read what there was, completely unedited showing all guild and gruop chat.  Yeah, I see your logic how I shouldn't be respected at all, whatever.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udiako.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diako</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/29/02 1:57:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

I don't think Shoot is an Asshole, mostly cause I hear he apologized about it and even admitted he did wrong.  Below is the quote that got me started, and from what I see, it also got Longfeller going after you in the same way.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Yeah, unfortunately my alt was in that group, and you know what, Hartland even said to zone, just put them on /ignore.<br>
<br>
If he had heeded his won advice this would have been fine. But he didn't. This is the problem I have, I don't care how much someone shouts to zone, if they offend me, I put them on ignore. Training over and over, since this wasn't the only incident of him training on us, isn't acceptable.<br>
<br>
Come on people, use /ignore for what it is made for, it doesn't turn off all shouts, it just turns off this one person. You don't get tells, you don't get shouts, ooc, auc, nothing.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
1st, I've used /ignore on someone that was being a pain in ooc/shout... didn't work.  Do you have to zone/log and come back for it to take effect ?<br>
<br>
2nd.  Telling people what to do in response to you or your friend is going to insult very many people in game or in real life.  It's human nature to hate people telling us what to do.  We Goddamn do what we want, when we want.  And if someone wants to act like an asswhole cause of /ignore, fuck em.  I would have petitioned them if it bothered me that much, I wouldn't play a /ooc tag bulshit.  And I'd be on Sullon zek if I wanted to train someone...  Believe me, I remember some trouble makers doing that every night in Everfrost at permafrost entrance...  You'd have 1-2 IG's waiting for you when you zoned...  BAM!  ouchy.  No rules there.  hehe  Never agreed that Training was right in here.<br>
<br>
Again...  Don't write a freaken romance novel...  so many posts from you are so freaken long... I give up before I get half way through.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uqinipure.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QiniPure</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/29/02 8:35:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

Binnar is NOT saying this : People can do whatever they want and if you don't like it, put them on /ignore<br>

Binnar IS saying : If someone is annoying you so much that you want to train their group, put them on ignore, do NOT train the group to solve the problem.<br>

As Qini states, it is a possible action, not me saying that you have to use ignore, just something else that can be done.  I may have been heated when I said that quote.<br>
<br>
We are not on Sullon Zek, and therefore it isn't acceptable, and since I am not the one making an ass of myself in zones, please do petition people that need it.

Training is an immature to handle any situation.  Well, any harm to others is an immature to handle a situation.<br>
<br>
eitherway, this has happen weeks ago...  Issue being dragged for ever on a Mute point by now.<br>
<br>
Hartland handled it wrong, but is not a person that I would consider Shit listable.  Why ?   Cause he did an Eye for an eye...  Well, he did way worse to you guys of course which makes him look bad.  But One in your group was out to piss the hell out of him.   People in this forum being SL are ass holes, they don't need a reason to be just that... an Ass hole.   You can't push someone, and then bitch cause they retaliated too hard.<br>
<br>
If Shoot really did apologize to Hartland, and vice versa... I think you all should just handle this out of forum (Should have been done that way from the beginning).<br>

That's why I have no problem with this being here and staying here right at the top of the list.  I would agree that Hartland training shoot is not Shitlistable, but Hartland training me, now that is, I refuse to agree that I should be punished for being grouped with someone 1 time and they make an ass of themselves...point in case, I have not grouped with him since. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udiako.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diako</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/30/02 11:47:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

<br>
Going through the whole thread, you got more heat than Hartland.  IT's probably cause you were so defensive, and lenghtly at that.<br>
<br>
Some people thought Shoot deserved it...   Shoot ain't back here... Who else was there when it happened, you...  And more you got defensive, and more you got the heat that was intended to Shoot...  It's like pouring more oil on the fire thinking you'll drown it...  doesn't work too well.<br>
<br>
I probably did take what you said the wrong way, but it doesn't change that I don't appreciate that some people think that /ignore is a Have to if someone decides to annoy a whole zone.  Eitherway,  this has been long enough.  You can keep this topic in here for a few months, won't hurt Hartland a bit.  You might want him to get hurt, but it won't.  Mostly cause of all the inner battles in this topic.  If I see Hartland out there and we both were looking for a group..  I wouldn't fear him being an Asshole.  He's Human, and made a bad call.  We all do.  Again... His bad judgement was a response...  Again why many called the Group hypocrits.  Don't make it a vendetta...  You've probably caused more attention to you then to Hartland in this whole thread.<br>
<br>
Oh.. .and sorry for jumping all over you as for the /ignore.  I mis-read it, and never went back until I posted the quote here.  Just hope you're buddy Shoot knows better now.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ulongfeller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>longfeller</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t dood!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/4/02 7:56:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

SHOOT DID NOT, jeka that is why this post is invalid, thx <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . binnar if you want to post your own post, then by all means, go for it. you got trained, and for no reason. you said nothing in /say /ooc or /shout. but maybe that was the problem to begin with. maybe because of the fact that you DIDNT say anything, is the reason why this post was here. when shoot said in group that he enjoys pissing people off when he is tired, people laughed. what did you do? did you laugh? did you sit there like a lump of shit not doing or saying anything? or did you tell shoot to shut up, and stop being an ass in /ooc /shout and /say? what did you tell your group? just because you did nothing to PROVOKE hartland,  you sure as hell didnt do anything to stop your group ( or try and prevent your group) from provoking him. that is my problem with this binnar, that is why i say that you are also to blame. because you were &quot;just going with the flow&quot; if you want to use that term. if you want to sit here and defend yourself ( which is why this forum is here, to defend yourself) then please explain to me why you didnt tell your group to shut the hell up. that is why i still post. because to me, being to chicken shit to tell someone to shut there mouthis just as bad as spouting off at the mouth in a zone. <br>

and by the way, you refrencing to me trolling, you can kiss my ass. because i stop at my regular forums once a day, so if you call that trolling, then yeah i guess i am a 400 pound big green machine. <p><p align = "center"><img

   That reminded me of a few topic I've had to get over with my kids...  My oldest one keeps doing things she shouldn't do, and one of those things is Stealing.  I tried to explain to my 2 youngest that if Their sister is doing something that is &quot;Wrong&quot; and they are going along with it...  They are as much to blame as She is.

   As I said before,  Guilt by association sucks...  And it's the main reason Binnar got the heat.  If he would have written this complaints instead of Shoot, it might have had a different flavor.  Oh well.  Still think this post is bogus.  Hartland was wrong...  But he's not an Ass Hole that causes other people to suffer across the board.  He had a bad judgement call once, and apologized to the main instigator.  Binnar, if you weren't so strongly accusing him... he probably would have appologized to you.
