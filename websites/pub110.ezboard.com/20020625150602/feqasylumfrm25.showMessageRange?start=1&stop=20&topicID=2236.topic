1------- note date change<br>
Time is 4th May 2002 1830 PM US PST (sorry for the late start, but that is 11:30 am Sun here and I can't face EQ any earlier than that).<br>
<br>
PLEASE BE AT LS RINGS ON TIME <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->                     OTHERWISE IT TAKES A LOT LONGER.<br>
<br>
lev 45 to 52 <br>
Healer types lev 40 to 52.<br>
There may be certain exceptions.<br>
<br>
If we are short in some classes, please try and get some to join us.  We'll let you know what we need in NaggyChat.<br>
<br>
If you have lots of xp raiding please read on (and say so in your post).<br>
<br>
CHAT CHANNELS - Channels are NaggyLead and NaggyChat.  Because Sol B is a popular zone, I would rather not be forcing them to listen to our pulls in shout, and I know people on naggy raids have so much to say so can't do inc in chit chat channel.  (to set the colours of your chat type /usercolor in game for instructions.  36 is chat channel 1, 37 is 2 etc).<br>
<br>
PLEASE JOIN NaggyChat some time before 1830 US PST.<br>
<br>
PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING - What I would like you guys to do now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->                      My aim is to get naggy dead and loot distributed within 2 hours.  This is not going to happen yet, because I have not found the secret of doing so on an open raid, but I am still aiming for it (don't get your hopes up, expect 2.5 hours or a touch more).<br>
<br>
I believe that the key is to have experienced leaders in each group.  When organising raids you are spending so much time getting the right classes to come, and answering many questions that you cannot easily spend time &quot;leading&quot;.  I will have a coleader to help with that sort of thing, but in any case ...<br>
<br>
IF YOU HAVE GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF NAGGY RAIDS/RAIDS IN GENERAL, PLEASE SAY SO HERE SO I CAN MAKE YOU GROUP LEADER.<br>
<br>
KNOWLEDGABLE GROUP LEADERS - My plan is to get good organised knowledgable people to lead the groups and hopefully answer any questions that arise.  The group leader will also be responsible for noting who is MA, SA, crack, haste, shammy buffs (not sure on their names), cleric buffs (reso/HB, SHoW and Symbol), GMR ... (what have I missed plz?) and keeping the groups informed.  They will be responsible for organising all buffs including fakes when the time comes.<br>
<br>
I am of the opinion atm that the swiftness and success of the raid depends on all the group leaders (as well as all who attend of course).  <br>
<br>
INDICATE CERTAINTY WHEN YOU SIGN UP - Please indicate if you will be there for sure, or possibly so I can be as organised as possible up front.  I will try and post groups before hand, but they will prolly change.<br>
<br>
Please sign up with Character name, level and class, and include any other info you think is relevant (or funny<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->                    <br>
<br>
I will organise groups in LS.  Some may be permanent, some may be temporary.  This will allow everyone to make their way to the FG platform safely.  Make sure you pair up with someone who knows the way if you don't please.<br>
<br>
NEW STRATEGIES PLEASE - So far I have used the typical open raid strat on Naggy where we pull to bridge.  Healers stand around corner, MA and those likely to get taunt stand in doorway and the rest stand behind him.  This has worked, but I am also keen to get other strategies.  If you have any please either post them here, or let me know below so I can get your ideas in game.<br>
<br>
EVERY CLERIC AND CHANTER 44+ please make sure you see me for a stack of peri's at some stage.  <br>

INFO ON RAIDING NAGGY<br>
http://www.crimsontalon.com/raidnag.htm<br>
<br>
2------- LOOT<br>
YOU WON'T ALL WIN <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->                     Firstly, a lot of nice things WILL drop.  However you will PROBABLY not win something (no defaults, loot rules below).  So please be patient and please do not bitch.  We can't do this raid without all of you, but we have not got something for all of you either.<br>
<br>
Please pass all cash and cash items to me if you loot them.  I spend well over 1K each raid because I believe no enchanter or cleric should ever be out of pocket.<br>
<br>
DRAGON LOOT WINNERS TO HELP COVER COSTS - If you intend to roll please bring a stack of peridots or around 210pp (I prefer peri's to be honest).  Those who win nice items from Naggy (not including FG loot) please be prepared to cover the difference between cash items and overall cost to me (should turn out to be = to a little less than a stack of peris to each dragon loot winner).  Hehe to clarify, if you don't win, you dont' pay (unless you wish to), if you win dragon stuff, please help dissolve the costs.<br>
<br>
NO DEFAULTS BUT... - There are NO DEFAULTs, however the coleader and I would like to take an extra roll on a couple of items.  If drums or Orb of Tisharn drop I would like an extra roll.   Cassandria 48+ rogue as coleader has chosed to take an extra roll on the CoF if it drops.<br>
<br>
LOOT - If you already have the item please be honest and don't ask to roll on it. If you have a similar item and would like to upgrade, I think everyone at the raid would appreciate it if you offered your old item up for grabs. This is not expected though.<br>
<br>
If you bring a couple of characters to the raid (eg high level for FG's and 45-52 for naggy) you may choose to roll for either class, but only that class.<br>
<br>
Treasure Hunter's Satchel 100% weight reduction bag (all/all) MONK AND CLERIC (Sorry monks I know you are the best class for it, but it is often such hard work getting enough clerics along).<br>
Red scale Bard/War epic so only they can roll. 1 roll to 51 and under, 2 rolls to 52.<br>
Selo's drums of the march (bard only).  I would like an extra number on this roll.<br>
Gaunts of fiery might (mellee types only including hybrids)<br>
Coat of flames (mellee types only including hybrids) Coleader Cass has 2 rolls on this.<br>
Heirophant's crook (druid only)<br>
Bladestopper (mellees)<br>
Blight, Hammer of the Scourge (shammies only)<br>
Red Dragon Tooth (all/all) may not drop anymore. I am thinking that as it summons a necro pet, perhaps necros need not have one.<br>
Gold Plated Koshigatana (those that can use)<br>
Orb of Tishan (very nice item - those that can use) I would like an extra roll on this item.<br>
Prayers of Life (all/all)<br>
Book of scale (pally epic) 1 roll 51 and under, 2 rolls 52.<br>
<br>
PALLY BOOK - All paladins who wish to roll on the book and who do not already have one will be given a number before the fight. If the book drops a roll for them will be done immediately and the winner rezzed if necessary. <br>
<br>
SPEEDING UP ROLLS - Preliminary interest will be taken on as many items as possible whilst rezzes are happening. The roll will NOT take place though until after everyone is rezzed. Please only send a tell once to say you are interested in an item.<br>
<br>
eg - Naggy down, 4 raid members down - prelim interest taken on Coat of Flames. Those that know about it send one tell. Once everyone rezzed, everyone else will be able to send a tell regarding interest. Please do NOT resend your tell.<br>
<br>
each person will be listed with their number. NOW is the time to send another tell if your name is not listed.<br>
<br>
SEVERAL ITEMS ROLLED ON AT ONCE - Be prepared to have a couple of items going at once. If I can get others to help, several items may be rolled for at the same time. In this case send the tell to the appropriate person (one item will be rolled by each loot person) stating which item you need. Again, please send only one tell until it is clear that your name has not been listed with a number.<br>

4-------- more info for those interested<br>
1 GROUP TO KEEP ZONE TO PLATFORM CLEAR - I would like to have 1 group &quot;camping&quot; the line from zone to lava to keep it free of critters and to guide others who don't know the way. If you are familiar with that area please indicate so.<br>
<br>
At the reassemble point &quot;the lava&quot; (see map) we will stop and make sure all members are present. You will need lev to run over the lava past this point. A scout with FD will run ahead to check if clear and we will fight at the next stop. After clearing the area we can make a way through as per the map.<br>
<br>
You can buy FR +5 earrings at the gypsies in LS just south of the rings for around 26p each.<br>
<br>
On the day I will designate crowd controllers for the FG's. They cannot be mezzed, however they can be charmed. Those that can charm will get the first adds, any additional adds should be agroed by a hybrid with root and taken away from the fight and rooted there. This may not work as planned, but is the intention. (Anyone had trouble rooting them?).<br>
<br>
BIND - If you can bind yourself in the lair and don't mind doing so, then please bind at the spot located on the map. Make sure that you don't bind in the agro range of any FG's in case you have LD problems on the day and cannot come back in time, or alternatively you forget to rebind yourself outside hehehe. I know you have all forgotten to do so at some remote time in your glorious pasts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->                     <br>
<br>
It is intended that, depending on numbers only standard fighting buffs from within your group will be carried out at the LS rings. Real buffs will happen at the buffing point inside.<br>
<br>
---<br>
Buffs<br>
People will be assigned to do GMR, HB, haste and shammy buffs. There should be a fake buffer in every group.  Your group leader should be helping you all look after this.<br>
<br>
Depending on numbers this is how buffing should work. Ideally 4 fake buffs would be good (for he mass dispells) in the following order -<br>
1 - see invis (longer lasting buff would be better, please suggest)<br>
2- resist disease<br>
3- resist poison<br>
4- resist cold<br>
<br>
However depending on how many turn up we may not need to worry about having too many fakes up, coz they take time to cast.<br>
<br>
Shammies, druids, hybrids and lower level clerics can do these.<br>
<br>
with fakes up dispelling should not be an issue unless we only have a small number of people. However if you have a bard in your group and you get dispelled too many times (you lose all your fakes) make sure you click off the flashing bard buffs so that next time they cycle (up to 18 seconds later prolly) they fill the first spot and get dispelled recast each tiem. You can also call for another fake from your group. This is why I have suggested an order for fakes, so that person can keep up that one fake (eg see invis) and cast when needed.<br>
<br>
Next mellee steroids and brain buffs, then HP buffs then resist buffs.<br>
<br>
HP buffs should include cleric HB or similar, symbol and AC and also the 2 shammy buffs. Please don't ask for more buffs than you need, coz it will only make the raid take longer. Also keep in mind that you need those MR/FR buffs, so keep enough slots open for them (you get max 15).<br>
<br>
Lastly resistance buffs. These include<br>
Resist magic (hopefully chanter GMR)<br>
Greater Null potion (shammy made resist mag potion +25)<br>
Resist Fire (or better still circle of winter if we can convince a nice very high level druid to help out).<br>
Resist fire potion (shammy)<br>
Mage fire DS (which will include FR component as well).<br>
Bard songs which up Mag/FR and also Mag resist.<br>
Mage summoned items that give FR.<br>
Mage focus items<br>
<br>
Shammies and clerics are under lots of mana pressure during buffs so for shammy would like a standby healer so shammy can cannibalise. A twitch would be good too if we are lucky enough to have a necro along.<br>
<br>
Necros please steer clear of the cool &quot;change to skellie form&quot; spell as it can make life difficult in these intense times. (Come on, we know you are itching to solo him, just give us a break <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->                     .<br>
<br>
Make sure you stay by your group leader in one area so you are easy to find. This is really important, yet .......<br>
<br>
Don't let naggy fall into lava or press against wall. If this happens a command will be given to move back to original fighting area, please do so quickly.<br>
<br>
You will need levitation to get over the lava area as indicated on the map. This will be cast either at LS rings or reassembly point. Please make sure you have a lev. Talk to your group leader if you don't.<br>
<br>
Don't move ahead of person designated as &quot;person not to move ahead of&quot;<br>
<br>
If you have complaints/suggestions whilst on the raid send tell to me (Lunitune) or the coleader . There are always ways to do it better, but we may already be committed to a particular way. Please refrain from whinging in shouts, oocs and chat channels as it just makes for a negative and unpleasant atmosphere.<br>
<br>
Healers heal from around the corner at the Assemble point. This way you avoid the AoE blasts (until you get summoned <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->                     .<br>
<br>
If you have the new agro management spells from Luclin (chanters) please be prepared to use them. With this spell you should be able to Tash naggy fairly early on without facing instant death.<br>
<br>
Naggy fears, so please turn off run before we start to attack him. I am not sure whether you run away or not, for the odd occasion I have been feared I stayed in one spot. Yet I see others run off. Anyone got a definitive answer to this connundrum? Anyone read this far :?<br>
<br>
This post will be updated often so please visit regularly if you are interested. I will make sure Naggy is up the day before and also a couple of hours before, and will indicate here if the raid has to be postponed. In the absence of a notice of postponement here, please assume the raid will go ahead.<br>
<br>
If you are interested and can possibly make it, please note it here. If you have to withdraw (which happens to the best of us) please indicate so here. The more we know here on the drawing board, the faster and smoother the raid will be.<br>

It is 6:30 pm US California time.<br>
<br>
Verti - whilst it would be great if you could bring your friendly ubber druid for buffs, I feel it only fair to let you roll for one class only.  Eg druid or monk.<br>
<br>
Deliria - will you be available to pull FG's for us?<br>
<br>
Plz note all I have changed it so that on the epic items 51 and under get 1 roll and only 52 get 2 rolls. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ureinnhardt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reinnhardt</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.mordwin.barrysworld.net/muziek3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(4/23/02 4:48:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2236.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mordwin.barrysworld.net/60reinn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Naggy 4th May no defaults [Edit 1 date change]</span><hr size=1> Would also like to jump in on this if there is room for another Bard needing a roll on the scale.<br>

52 Warrior<br>
Bufie <p><b>I Am A:</b> Chaotic Neutral Elf Bard 
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Chaotic Neutral</b> characters are unstable, and frequently insane. They believe in disorder first and foremost, and will thus strive for that disorder in everything they do. This means that they will do whatever seems 'fun' or 'novel' at any given time.
<br><br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Elves</b> are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.
<br><br><u>Class:</u><br><b>Bards</b> are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.
<br><br><u>Deity:</u><br><b>Erevan Ilesere</b> is the Chaotic Neutral elven god of mischief and rogues. He is also known as the Trickster and the Chameleon. His followers are always looking for fun and adventure, and are notorious pranksters. Their favorite weapon is the short sword. Erevan Ilesere's symbol is a nova star with asymmetric rays.
