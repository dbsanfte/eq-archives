People are not going to stop the general chat and personal communication in /ooc and /shout.   Just get over it already and move on.<br>

The only thing I find unacceptable is profanity in any public channel.  And don't give me that &quot;Turn the filter on&quot; crap.  Go reread the policy if you don't know that it is no excuse for profanity.<br>

Nasty guy in general.</span><hr size=1> lol so he pulled to many..... and tryed to root them.... but it was a bad spot (sarcasm) kinda like what the person said when they told him to pull /boggle. you may have not said anything in /shout or /ooc but you fully admite to provoking hartland in /say...... so that makes you almost just as bad as shoot, except you didnt polute the zone..... and no i wasnt trying to enforce my beleifes into anyone else btw, just stating that if somebody is going to be a loudmouth in a zone that i am in, then yeah, they need to be told to stfu. Btw binnar, you kept saying that ppl were having fun........ do you know this for fact? do you know if they were enjoying it? they might have just turned ooc and shout off... eleviating the problem in the first place. but the problem still stands that the issue was ATTEMPTED to be resolved by derek, and aashna. by attempted i mean, shoot flat out said he was having to much fun, when derek asked if this could be ended.......  doesnt that make this thread invalid? or am i missing something here? cuz i think the rules uptop on the list state that the situation has to have been talked about by the officer(s) of both guilds... now seeing as shoot is the guild leader, and he was &quot;having to much fun&quot;, then how is this trying to resolve the situation? i realize that when you talked to an officer of CR that they may have said that they really dont care.... but what shoot did was no better than what they did... so both parties were at fault here......... maybe.... maybe more so than others. point is, if shoot is going to be a guild leader, hes supposed to set an example, and im sorry, if this is your example of what guild leaders are, then ill either stay in my guild, or go guildless. because i certanly as hell dont want to be associated with that particular kind of people.<br>
<br>
this is a quote from the top... i dont know how to do the fancy little quote thingies, cuz it was never a big deal to me to try and figure it out.<br>
<br>
<br>
We'd like to stress the severity of being posted here. A post here means that the said player should be avoided at all costs, as they have proven themselves to be dishonorable. Please make every attempt to resolve the issue with the player's guild, the player's friends, the player, etc., before posting here. Please treat this as a last resort. <br>
<br>
didnt somebody say earlier that shoot logged straight from EQ to come here and post his SL? without trying to resolve anything through the opposing guild? even though it was attempted by people in CR to try and resolve this before shoot got to the SL? although many people may not see this as a problem, it is simply because it wasnt even attempted to be resolved by shoot nor anyone in his group, binnar all you were trying to do was get him kicked from his guild, and to me that isnt resolving anything. <p><p align = "center"><img

Now, if this post is invalid because of the timing, well then, fine, when its removed we can repost it because he trained people and won't appologize, and his guild &quot;really, Don't care&quot;.<br>
<br>
I never did antagonize him until he threatened to train us.  Not in shout, not in OOC, not in say.  Once he was doing that, yeah, I told him to get the fuck out.  Hartland was asked to appologize to the people he TRAINED, and he stated that he would not.  Hence this post stays put.  He trained, his guild doesn't care, he doesn't care, and he says he will do it again.  I personally feel that this means he should be avoided at all cost.<br>
<br>
Now, once again, this post is about Hartland training, if you think that Shoot was sooo wrong, then shitlist him for it.  Once again, I would recommend staying away from Hartland and his comrades for they seem to support his actions. <p><PARAM NAME=quality VALUE=high> <PARAM NAME=bgcolor VALUE=#000000> <EMBED src="http://www.geocities.com/ferretess2000/binnar2.swf" quality=high bgcolor=#000000  WIDTH=460 HEIGHT=92 TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"></EMBED><br>

I am the one who said to Hartland &quot;you gonna pull for us?&quot;<br>
<br>
If you were there, you would have known what I meant. He had just tranined us... and we lived...<br>
<br>
He said he wasn't training, that he was &quot;pulling&quot;...<br>
<br>
Are you trying really hard not to understand?<br>
<br>
Not only that, but is it that crazy to start giving this guy shit? Are you telling me you wouldn't say or do anything when some guy goes ape-shit because someone in your group said his girlfriend wasn't a power ranger? Someone threatens you, calls you names like &quot;lowbie&quot; and you would just sit there and take it? <br>
<br>
We didn't just decide out of the blue to be mean or cruel to someone. We were making fun of this freak who got bent out of shape, was being rude to us BEFORE we were ever rude back, and was TRAINING us. <br>
<br>
I don't understand why this keeps going on. You are sticking up for Hartland, yet you are the one who keeps his name right on top of the shitlist...<br>

<br>
The great thing about the ignore list is that you can (this may surprise you) remove people from it. So if it gets full you can unignore people who have already forgotten about you a long time ago and ignore a new person.<br>
<br>
Ignoring people whom you do not wish to deal with is what the ignore list is for. You don't ignore your friends just for fun, you don't ignore random people to make things interesting, these are not typical uses for the ignore list. Just what the fuck do you think it's for? It's purpose is for your control, not to give them a reason to be rude.<br>
<br>
If anyone is being a whiny bitch in this situation, Hartland is the whiniest bitch of them all. He gets pissed his little online 'girlfriend' got called a fucking normal ranger rather than a power ranger for fucks sake.<br>
<br>
Fuck Hartland, if he's gonna train people just because he can't handle his own problems, then I don't need to know a piece of shit like him. I'm sure he's all fun and games till he pokes your fucking eye out. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ujekakiril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jeka Kiril</A> at: 5/23/02 3:03:55 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ueqduffy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQDuffy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/24/02 5:54:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

Hartland appears to have lost his temper, and has more or less admitted to it.  No one else posted here saying Hartland's a dick, so I personally (and probably most people) won't hold it against Hartland.<br>

      Shoot didn't deserve to die, or be train.   But he should have been accountable for his action.  And in so, talked to Hartland and in his eyes it seems to be all taken cared of.<br>
<br>
      I though Binnar was the Guild leader, and not Shoot.  One side, it's a sight of relieve... at least Shoot is not being a Defensive idiots, mostly cause he knows he did his own &quot;Wrongs&quot; in all this.<br>
<br>
     If if you're playing in a zone and 5 people decide to spam, and you ask them nicelly to stop... and they tell you to use /Ignore if you don't like it.  You won't feel irritated by that ?   So if someone does something you don't like in the street in front of where you live and you think it's disgusting...  And you ask him to stop.  Him telling you to look elsewhere if you don't like it...  So that's also right.  Just ignore him, and shut up... Righ? <br>

     I also didn't know that this bunch asked Hartland to pull form them...  Ok, Hartland decided to push it too far.

I hadn't laughed out loud, I did nothing except sit there and wait for Shoot and Hartland to finish.  yes, I admit to not telling anyone to shut up, and in group I said somethings, totally invalid since it was in group, until HARTLAND trained me.  At which point I feel that I have all rights to call him a rude fucker and he better stop the shit or I will petition him.  And he still refuses to appologize to me, even before he was shitlisted, and I sent him a tell, with all intention of resolving this, I said I want to talk to you about what happened, and you know his response?  Talk to a GM, I don't care.<br>
<br>
Same response from all officers from CR.  Even the leader.  Now at that point, the situation is over, I am on an alt, talking to him, and he still refuses to appologize, if he was such a great guy, and didn't deserve to be on here, he would have said something, anything, about he took it too far.  But no, he didn't, so screw him, he deserves this, and if he was anything of a man he would come here and say, &quot;yes, I Hartland trained, and it was wrong.  No matter what reason, I was wrong for it and I am sorry for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Go ahead, talk to Aashna, she has my log, I am sure she sent it to many people already too, I say nothing to Hartland in say, tell, shout, or ooc.  Yet I was trained, so how can you even possibly say I provoked him?<br>
<br>
I mean how can you say that we, being everyone in the group that wasn't Shoot, provoked him.  He came over and provoked us by saying he was going to train us, and that we are lowbies, and kept going on and on.  There was a point that no one in our group said anything, and Hartland kept saying your all lowbies, like 3 times before he figured none of us cared that he was saying it so he moved on to other insults.  There was nothing about his armor as he states there was (another lie), and how we all were harrassing him, but it wasn't true, the truth is he came over and was provoking us until we told him to fuck off so that we could pull, in which case he trained.<br>
<br>
As far as being a whiny crybaby, screw that, Hartland is a piece of shit, who admittedly trains, refuses to appologize for it, and deserves to remain at the top of this list for another month.  If I had done ANYTHING to warrant being treated without respect, then I wouldn't still be here, but I did nothing, I said nothing, I emoted nothing, I did nothing, and got trained.  For that, Hartland should appologize to me, seeing as how I was the first one to try and keep it off this board anyway, which was more respect than anyone in my group gave him all night.  And for that, I am the one that is harrassed, because I didn't provoke him yet I still want an appology.  Shoot is the one that wanted his attention, I am the one that took the prroblems that came with it, and yet Shoot is ok and I am not?  You have some screwed up thinking Longfeller, obviously you don't know the truth.  Ask them how much I said before he trained.  Go ahead, because I did NOTHING to provoke him until he trained, and he trained BEFORE ANYONE SAID TO HIM TO PULL completely sarcastically meaning are you going to train us again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ubinnar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Binnar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t dood!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/24/02 3:40:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

Are you saying that it was ok to train because he was annoyed?<br>
If so:<br>
You<br>
Are<br>
A<br>
Fucking<br>
Moron<br>
 <br>
<br>
And as for 1/2 the server being on your ignore list. Well, good. If you're that easily annoyed/offended you:<br>
A. Have some serious anger managment problems or a very short temper in which case good I don't want to group, talk, or be anywhere near you.<br>
B. An over sensitive little person who shouldn't be playing this game and I don't want to group, talk, or be anywhere near you.<br>
<br>
In either case good. Put me on ignore and stay the hell away.<br>
<br>
And please people the whole &quot;Heh you must be &lt;enter age here from 5-15&gt;&quot; argument is beginning to wear a little thin. Almost as much as &quot;HA u r a n00b I know everything&quot; argument. I now atuomatically classify anyone who uses them as an elitest asshole or a fucking moron. Usually both.<br>
<br>
Try something new for a change. I know it might strain your tiny little brain to think of a new bullshit argument or maybe a real one, but please try.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daiko to your analogy:<br>
Difference is this. One is real life one is a game. In RL you don't have a /ignore, would be nice if we did sometimes. In EQ you do and it takes all of 5 goddamned seconds to use it. And again I say.

People do stupid things occasionally, deal with it.  The first person that says they haven't is a darn liar.<br>
<br>
Now, on another note...I look forward to seeing several of the people replying to this thread being put on the SL themselves (if they haven't already had it happen) because several of you seem to think that BSing in OOC or shout is a trainable offense.  <br>
<br>
I don't give a darn if someone is being so rude that it makes you want to punch your computer monitor, there is NO valid reason to train.  NONE.<br>
<br>
Guess what?  I use the OOC and shout to occasionally chat to guildies in the zone, I COULD use guild chat.  But I don't because I choose not to.  Does this excessive spam warrant training?  Refer to what I said earlier, &quot;there is NO valid reason to train.  NONE.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, I have had numerous times where I had to read things over zone wide chat that was just plain disturbing and/or annoying.  What did I do?  Train them?  NO! (refer to quote of myself the paragraph prior)  I do an ooc asking them to take it to tells and then IGNORE them, notice I did not say /ignore, I just ignore them as in quit paying attention to their BS.  If you do not have the ability to do this, then you really should find another method of entertainment...maybe go play football or take up boxing so you can hurt the people that make you mad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udiako.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diako</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/29/02 5:11:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

People don't like to feel forced to avoid a situation cause someone else wants to be a dick.<br>
<br>
If I go into a zone, and I purposly act like a freaken morron...  And the people in Zone tell me to STFU...  Is it my right to bitch back at them and tell them to use /ignore and tell THEM to STFU ?  It's a free world, isn't it ?  I'm forcing my Ignorance unto others, and TELLING them that if they don't like it /ignore me.   Now...  is /ignore a good reason to act stupid ?<br>
<br>
Again, since people have lost track of this whole thread since it's so long....   Someone from this bunch of Idiots said at the biggining, You don't like it use /Ignore... in other words... Don't bother us, we like acting like dicks.<br>
<br>
Real Life or In Game.  A tool like /ignore does not give you a licence to piss people off.   I said it then, and I say it again.  If there was a Guide/GM in that zone seeing people telling them to stop and they would have continued...  THEY would have got a warning for purposly causing undo Irritation to others.<br>
<br>
Either way, Shoot was the main trouble and he apologized about it.  I think it's funny that the others involved that were with him are so defensive...   Usually when someone gets hyper defensive, and pointing fingers...  They know they fucked up.   Otherwise, you shut the fuck up if you didn't do anything.  All Binnar has done in the beginning is shifting everything on Hartland...  and yes, Hartland shouldn't have done what he did.  It DOES NOT EXCUSE that their groups were Total idiots, and had no Respect for anyone else in that zone.   Again, Shoot is the only one I respect after all this.  He can admit making a mistake...  That, I like of people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/ubinnar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Binnar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t dood!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/29/02 1:19:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland... Nasty guy in general.</span><hr size=1> Daiko:<br>
Damn straight I shifted everything to Hartland.  Except for the fact that I say many times over that Shoot was probably being an asshole, but that still is no excuse to train.  Hartland is the one that trained.  Now if you read what I said, I said nothing, emoted nothing, shouted nothing, ooc'd nothing, until he started training us.  If I had acted the way shoot had, then yes, I would admit fault.  But what fault do I have, as all I did was sit there and wait for MY group to pull to me, not for Hartland to pull.<br>
<br>
Now I wasn't quiet because the same person that started this was slandering my name in the first post by saying I was being a rude asshole because I was drunk, when I hadn't said a damned word in anything except group chat.  And when the hell did shoot admit fault?  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm not saying I'm blameless here<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> is this where you say he admits fault?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As I'm sure I could have found a more mature way of dealing with him... but I was too damn tired <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Or is that where?<br>
<br>
I am sorry, but just as shoot said himself, his group did not deserve to be trained, yet Hartland refuses to say, Hey I am sorry.  This whole thing would be resolved if the trainer would come up to a person that had said nothing, did nothing, just sat there and got trained, and all he has to say is &quot;I am sorry I wasn't thinking&quot;  But instead he says I don't care, Talk to a GM.<br>
<br>
Also, yes a GM or Guide might have warned Shoot had they been in zone, but they would not have banned him for it.  If they saw what Hartland did, they might have banned him.  See the difference in severity?<br>
<br>
So, Yes, I have a problem with Shoot, and I have dealt with it.  But the fact still remains, I did not deserve to be trained, and I was.  And Hartland refuses to say anything to me except &quot;talk to a GM.&quot;  His Guild Crimson renegades has the same view.  His leader stated, &quot;Really, I don't care.&quot;  when asked to talk about the situation.  So, where am I left, I am left with Hartland treating me like shit, an ex-guild leader that wants to talk shit, embarass, and generally defame his own guildmates, and people on the message board saying that I am guilty because I don't enjoy having my guild leader talk shit about me publically and I don't enjoy being trained.<br>
<br>
Look at what Aashna posted, the only thing that she has me for is saying that I would shitlist Hartland, at the very end when I was logging, which I then rethought, and logged back in to talk, and to get information on their guildleader.<br>
<br>
So, go ahead, try to assume that I am the guilty one here, with Hartland training.  Try to invision my guilt as I said nothing, didn't spam the zone at all, didn't provoke.  I did nothing and was trained, when I ask that something be done, even as little as an appology, I am told that I am at fault, unfortunately, I am joined by many others, Training is NEVER acceptable.  If it is an accident, then, well no big deal, but when you state that you are going to train someone, and then do, more than once, that is not ever acceptable, and According to the leader of Crimson Renegades, and multiple officers, what hartland did was fine by them.<br>
<br>
Until someone can come up with something to blame me with, Diako, please just take the facts and realize that I am defending myself from what Shoot had said, more than anything else.  I am pointing so much blame on Hartland because he did something that has no excuse, no matter what, and is bannable, and his guild &quot;Doesn't Care&quot;.<br>
<br>
But yes, Shoot is to blame also, he spammed, provoked, shouted profanity, sent tells back and forth saying how he was having too much fun to stop, and in the end he finally says that he isn't blamless, so I guess he deserves all the respect.  Compared of myself, who didn't provoke, didn't spam, got trained, tried to resolve it before the shitlist, and tried to bring the truth to the matter by sending out my log so people could compare them to their own, or read what there was, completely unedited showing all guild and gruop chat.  Yeah, I see your logic how I shouldn't be respected at all, whatever.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/udiako.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diako</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/29/02 1:57:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=846.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hartland...

<br>
1st, I've used /ignore on someone that was being a pain in ooc/shout... didn't work.  Do you have to zone/log and come back for it to take effect ?<br>
<br>
2nd.  Telling people what to do in response to you or your friend is going to insult very many people in game or in real life.  It's human nature to hate people telling us what to do.  We Goddamn do what we want, when we want.  And if someone wants to act like an asswhole cause of /ignore, fuck em.  I would have petitioned them if it bothered me that much, I wouldn't play a /ooc tag bulshit.  And I'd be on Sullon zek if I wanted to train someone...
