The fact is they tried to break it, got adds and i used my shield to get thru the rest of the mobs and draged his corpse to zone. When you wanna joke for it or just complain about something then complain to yourself about yourself.<br>

I always found myself wanting to SL her myself but I never found the time to waste in doing it... /ignore worked just as well...<br>
<br>
On to my experience with her... Well, back when I first came across her, I was around level 35 I believe... She joined our guild (Sword of Truth) at that time... At first, I did not hear anything about her... But after a couple weeks, when I was around level 38 I believe, I started grouping in DL... Well, I was in a group and we were pulling singles and I think I was the main healer at the time... We had an open spot and Mish shouted for a group... Being the friendly guildie I am, I asked if she could join... <br>
<br>
So she came and casted every resistance buff (no Symbol, etc... /boggle) she could on every person in the group... I didn't think much of it all at first... Well, Smashey, an ogre warrior that some of you may know was our main tank and was doing a great job pulling... He asked if she was ready to go and she said yes... So for about 5 minutes everything was going ok... Then she started on her Tunare this and Tunare that crap... I just took it all in stride... Well, I believe she may have healed Smashey once, but shortly after both the rogue and the ranger died (despite my heals)... When asked why she didn't heal, she replied that they deserved to die because they did not know how to play their character right... Promptly, both Smashey and I left the group and she was removed from the guild after we did some investigating on how many times this had happened...<br>
<br>
So a couple of weeks passed and she sent a tell to my RL friend/roomate/fellow EQ player, Korlinga Bloodcaller... She was complaining non-stop about how she had died in Nurga (i believe)... So being the nice guy and rogue Korlinga is, he went and searched for her corpse while she repeatedly sent tells bitching... <br>
<br>
After about 2 hours of searching he asked her for the 10th or so time when she had died... And for the 10th time she replied &quot;a couple of days ago&quot;... Well, we both had figured out this wasn't the case with the help of a generous necro and after we explained to her that her corpse had decayed because it had been a week, she immediately logged without any reply... So then, a couple days later, she came on saying she wanted our guild to help her get &quot;new uber gear&quot;, because the GM's were stupid and wouldn't give her gear back to her... This was about enough for me, as I said she would not get our help this time, as she had demanded it so many times before, bitching in the process of us helping her... <br>
<br>
So then she started to the /ooc'ing and /shout'ing in DL and she promptly went to my ignore list where she will stay for good...<br>
<br>
A sad story of what sounds like an in-bred trying to take advantage of other people... I am sorry for all of you have had the bad experience of ever dealing with her... She deserves to be here and in my opinion, should have her account banned... Just my 2cp...

<br>
Most members of SoT know her well, and not fondly.  I first grouped with her in Overthere during an Experience gathering we had there with all our guildmates we could find.  She *tried* to roleplay non-stop which is np with me but was getting on a few groupies nerves.  Then she decided not to heal, despite repeated requests from every single group member.  Our puller nearly died (a lucky Backstab and probably HT saved his ass).  She still refused to heal.  (puller at &lt;1bub Hp, rogue at 2bub hp, druid OOM from keeping us alive)  I promptly told her to either begin healing or disband from the group.  She began to roleplay (I never did decipher it all) and still doesn't heal.  I send her tells and finally she seems like she understands her objective....seems.  The next 15 mins are a repeat of the last scenario and all the tanks promptly left (I don't blame 'em!).  We promptly got another cleric in our group and let her sponge exp from all us who were, for some unknown reason, suddenly resistant to all the godamn elements!!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Not long afterwards (a week? two?)  she sent me a tell that she had died in the mines off of FM.  I ran down there and snuck all the way to the Jail where she claimed to have died.  No corpse.  Me and the two others in the zone (both lvl 50+) searched the area for her corpse and couldn't find it.  On a hunch, I told her to run into the zone and do a /corpse.  She did and got the message that she didn't have any corpses in the zone.  She logged immediatly.  The next couple of days were about how she recieved a &quot;starter package&quot; from a Gm and how we should begin to raid higher lvl places so she could get her &quot;Uber armor&quot;.  /sigh   The guild was made up of lvl 15-36 at the time with one lvl 53.  We could barely raid Unrest! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
A few weeks later, I recieved a tell that she just let half a group die in DL.  I send tells to all her group members and recieve confirmation.  I find that she had claimed to be OOM for half an hour straight and looted every corpse that the tank didn't manage to snag out from under her.  Me and Fahdazz began investigating and found that she had a VERY impressive reputation in DL for not healing and letting groupies die for little or no reason whatsoever.  I logged on and explained to her and the guild what was going to happen and promptly /guildremoved her.  <br>
<br>
After recieving at least 3 tells a day for at least 4 days straight, I began to be slightly rude and told her to stfu research her damn class.  The tells consisted of &quot;Why did you unguild me!  I be UBER CLERIC!  All says so!!!&quot; ,  &quot;I talk with my friends, they say that was the worst thing ever you did do&quot;  and &quot;You say I am not GOOD cleric??!!?!  I will shout in all zone and you will see!!&quot;.   That was followed by an immediate shout asking if she was uber, LoL.  I told her that was a good idea, and to be sure to ask that in the next 50 odd zones.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

I figured that was a bunch of crap she had told us.  <br>
<br>
Mish came off as being a nice person, and she joined my guild at the time (Sorcery &amp; Steel).  She claimed she needed EVERYBODY'S help in the guild because she lost all her &quot;Uber Gear&quot; to corpse decay.  We did indeed help her out....Too much.  We got together giant groups to get her cash and camped items for her to get gear.  Her &quot;Non-Uber&quot; gear was about 10 times better than any gear I ever had.  She ninja looted EVERYTHING.  Again, we just kinda let it go because of her circumstances...<br>
<br>

You removed me for no reason without telling me who was complaining with *anonymous* , and everyone I asked what was this excuse of some sort told me it was rude of you and not justified. I was questioning about why, and what i got is that there is a few chars *anonymous*  who complained and never got the name to fix the problem if there was one. For Smashey I dont have any problems with him and we're good buddies when we meet , shrug. You say she started to get on the nerves of some in the group because i was roleplaying , well you better know that i always roleplay when not too tired to do so and it never is something to be BLAMED because EQ is *roleplaying game in case you did not know. If someone died when I was the cleric its not a good reason to get mad and I died MORE times in a day than you ever did so please get in mind that im 54 and still do NOT mind to die unless I loose a lvl which could start to bother me or get afk and die for no reason which is a little sad but thats another circumstance and no point in it because it happened and ive tried to figure a way to res my corpses , it ended no to be a big thing. In all I do what I can and bringing old things like that is not justifying anything for they are not accurate anyway.<br>
<br>
Hey Cadmium, you never lost your stuff that was worth that much so please let them know what it was. I did NOT begged I asked for help after I was always questioned about what happened to you gears etc. And the fact my gears were better than yours is not justying the fact that I should not get them back which I did after 3 weeks of camping mobs by myself and a few with friends. It was a selfish call from you and a low one. Anyone who had a problem with helping someone should revise his/her perspective, and I did NOT ninja loot anything since ive asked and it was a day organised to get me some cash which Sanadyen and Ragnarokz did NOT mind at all. You had problems making cash well i suggest not being jealous and get on someone's back for the matter. If you minded THAT MUCH about giving it a shot to help me well , just do NOT DO IT next time someone who asked her friends do so because it seems hypocrite and you should get yourself an opinion of what we do. I gave everything I got in bank before removing myself from Magicks Gambits, and I dont care about loots to *clarify* the saying of many who dont know what they are talking about. If someone good drop when im in a group that i need which is rare for a time now ( last thing I needed was a Medaillon of life in Akheva and I think a loot in chardok which I got both by campng them for many hours with friends) because when you give a bracer to a druid you dont know asking her why she is naked and answered I got my account hacked and it was not a funny sotry, well i UNDERSTAND what it means and gave her a Nathsar bracer which BTW I NEED and USE, but now i got only 1 and plan on going in chardok again and camp those Di'zok again probably need to camp Obs.<br>
<br>
Oh 1 last thing about when I lost my gears, many got pissed off if I can say that way( sorry if its impolite, it seems to mean angry or something like mad and jealous ) because I have a wis of 214 before i lost my stuff and i tried to get it back. When I said only 183 when compared to 214 is not much quite afew were almost sayong only 183...bbla bla bla etc...But the fact I care mostly only for wis when i get a new gear is why I got a high wis, and 130 wis base does not hurt also. If I got better than you ask yourself why, I camped stuff for many hours and got not only in one group in chardok and places where i got the gears.<br>
<br>
The ONLY thing I did not deserve in a case were we take the problem with the EM bp is that bp. EVERYTHING else is earned.<br>
<br>
Well, enough is enough we went thru more than 8 pages for nothing, and the point is the BP if Jannaka sees it to be returned will be, and that you bring things who are not even worth stopping by and read it.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day all!<br>

The SL is just a pretext to shot down someone who does not even need to be *agroed * with comments that bad. There is another possibility which is to help everyone who got an attitude or got a bad day or anything that might get on your nerves .... Just help her/him in anyways you can because its not a good way to waste your time on someone if its not to let that person improve. For an old saying : Time changes things in a all around view, with bad sides and good ones.<br>
<br>
You shot someone, then you may be the next....think about it.<br>
I dont care for what is said on SL for ive been thru most post of every topic on SL ( not only the one im in but every i saw)<br>
, and what i saw was just not positive in anyways so it should not be taken care ( exceptions due to a few who knows that it does not do anything good to jump at conclusions or be mad at someone because 1st its a game, 2 have fun and 3 dont care about others if you got your plan in mind for comments which are not of any help.) <br>
<br>
Next time I play a char like a drow in gonna play so evil it will not be even worth trying to say be nice! You ask someone why he is not nice or good, well A Drow= Dark elf =EVIL so dont bother us who plays evil races and prolly will make a pleasure to let you crawl at our feet ehehe!<br>
<br>
For any of you who says oh and what about *good races* , well as all rpg you can be eveil within all race with a proper background etc, or be good as an *evil* race which in BOTH case is very rare.<br>
<br>
It was just to say all is clarified now, and its the end of the discussion. You got someone thing to tell me or anyone do it in game. But if got anything to add then tell me in game with decent words and comment about what you have to say and why it would be soooo horrible for yourself P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub110.ezboard.com/uwaramanicerunner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>waramanicerunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/8/02 8:37:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=825.topic&index=174>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mishakaal</span><hr size=1> Go join team PvP then.

<br>
What about those Em arms? o wait didnt you say you destroyed them? Gratz on totally dicking over cleric the world over who are better at their jobs than you are.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is, it seems about 95% of the server doesnt like you, so either shape up, or ship out.<br>
<br>
you can blame this and that on RP, but when you have this many people posting about how shitty of a cleric you are, it doesnt really matter.<br>
<br>
Telling people you are gonna train them, doesnt make the training ok.  &quot; Well i gave you fair warning...&quot; STFU and get a rogue or monk. Im sure that if that group would have had either of those classes, they would have offered their services instead of being trained.<br>
<br>
And i got news for you, even if you DO start a DE, and Roleplay being an asshat, which i can see you doing, people WILL figure out who you are and youll have to go through it all over again.<br>
<br>
Roleplaying an evil race doesnt give you the right to be a assclown, and you would be ostracized for it.<br>
<br>
And Roleplaying  isnt an excuse for being a shitty cleric too.<br>
<br>
O and last point, even if you get that EM BP returned, your STILL a shitty cleric. Doing the right thing isnt gonna stop you from being a little fucktard who cant play their class correct.<br>
<br>
Go play DAoC and make a Middy and go kill a bunch of Hibby's then you can be as asshatish as you want.  <p><center>
