                      now young ones" Lorgrim shouted out "It is time for another 
                      story." It seemed as if the last word of his sentence had 
                      caused a stampede. At least two dozen children appeared 
                      out of tunnels cut into the wall of the chamber or from 
                      behind the large stack of practice weaponry and armor that 
                      hung from racks long the wall. The guild had grown and so 
                      had the need to have someone watch the members children 
                      as they hunted and so the guild officers agreed to take 
                      turns watching over and teaching the young the arts, physical 
                      and magical. Some of the officers balked at this though, 
                      it was like a jail sentence and they would rather be stuck 
                      baby-sitting orc pawns, but Lorgrim knew that they felt 
                      the same as he did when they saw the future of the guild, 
                      proud. It was times like this Lorgrim wondered why he had 
                      never tried to have another child since Lori, she was so 
                      talented, imagine the first Ogress necromancer since the 
                      great war of the gods. A wave of sadness passed over Lorgrim, 
                      how much he missed his daughter.</font> </p>
                    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Uncle 
                      Lorgrim, we are all here now" a small voice chimed waking 
                      him from his memories. He recognized the voice even before 
                      he saw young Selrina's face or the tattoo of his guildmate 
                      Ashensoul's house upon her arm. Selrina had shown amazing 
                      leadership qualities for such a young age and all the officers 
                      watched and groomed her, to help her take her position as 
                      one of the guilds leaders one day.</font> </p>
                  </div>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Glancing 
                    around Lorgrim did a quick headcount to verify that all the 
                    children where present. He only counted twenty four, there 
                    was one missing, then lorgrim noticed a small set of flailing 
                    legs and heard the muffled cry of an elf child. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Zurgre, 
                    how many times must I tell you watch where you are sitting?! 
                    You have sat down on Tramble again!" Lorgrim worked hard not 
                    to laugh, it was Zudz young boy and even for an ogre he tended 
                    to be a bit thick but like his father the boy was all heart.</font> 
                  </p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Huh, 
                    oh, ya" as Zurgre stood, Tramble, a tiny dark elf boy scrambled 
                    out from under the ogre child and sat catching his wind with 
                    a terrified look on his face.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I think 
                    I saw Innoruk" Tramble reported, then his face contorted into 
                    one of those faces only children can do "He was laughing at 
                    me." This sent an instant ripple of laughter through the group 
                    of children, even Lorgrim smiled. Tramble, Just like his father 
                    Thambala was always the joker, though in that family it was 
                    a good way of avoiding jail when they where caught with their 
                    hand in an others purse.</font> </p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"OK 
                    enough now children its time for your lesson". Twenty five 
                    faces stopped and looked up at him in sudden disappointment. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"But Uncle 
                    Lorgrim you said it was time for another story, not a lesson", 
                    Azeranth announced very even and diplomatic voiced. Agerath 
                    had taught his son well, the boy was growing to be a very 
                    level headed troll and was a natural at all the trade skills 
                    already making earrings for the girls in the class as well 
                    as mock armor for the boys. He was a very popular young troll.</font> 
                  </p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Your 
                    right Azeranth I did say story," Lorgrim smiled at the boy 
                    "but many things in this world will teach you lessons and 
                    I hope this story will be one of those things." This seemed 
                    to please the children after all a story is a story even if 
                    a lesson is part of it.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As you 
                    all know this age has been dubbed the Age of Strife, but today 
                    I am going to tell you a story that will span from the Golden 
                    Age till the Age of Darkness". Lorgrim settled into the chair 
                    cut out of the stone face of the wall. "This story begins 
                    within the Golden age when Ogres ruled over the lands, wars 
                    were brief and cities stayed untouched by the machines of 
                    war, as was laid out by the law. The Great Tier'dal, or dark 
                    elf as they are known now, built towers for the sole purpose 
                    of studying and storing knowledge both arcane and academic. 
                    This knowledge was shared as the Tier'dal held open classes 
                    and debates for all to attend, these libraries grew so large 
                    that a single being could not read all that was stored within 
                    even one of them&quot;.</font> </p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;But 
                    then times changed, the humans came brought by their gods 
                    to this plane. These despicable beings waged war among themselves 
                    constantly, and this violent mentality began to surface even 
                    in the great ogre legions. The humans also stole knowledge 
                    from the Tier'dal. Spells and information that would be free 
                    to them in time was stolen not learned. With the stolen spells 
                    not properly monitored the humans opened portals to other 
                    planes and freed the creatures there to attack our world. 
                    General discord spread over the land as brother fought brother 
                    and monsters roamed the lands destroying all they could see&quot;.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 
                    Ogre Emperor, Rogan Soulcrusher, called for his trusted allies 
                    in the Tier'dal and Troll nations to rally their troops and 
                    help cleanse the lands of these monsters, and so began the 
                    Age of Cleansing. For many years the combined troops fought 
                    back the tide of creatures till only a trickle came through 
                    the portals. The magic users of the allied nations began the 
                    long process of sealing the portals, and were forced into 
                    seclusion to finish this massive spell. For all the years 
                    that the allied nations fought back, the monster hoards, the 
                    humans, and their new allies, the forsaken Elves, Dwarfs, 
                    and Gnomes, grew in strength. For every fallen Ogre, Troll 
                    or Tier'dal another warrior grew to power in the human's alliance.</font> 
                  </p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then 
                    the day fell upon the allied nations, the Human alliance attacked 
                    the allied nation while their mages were away sealing the 
                    portals and the allied troops were low in numbers from the 
                    long battle with the monsters. This began the Age of War, 
                    when it looked as if the great alliance would fall to the 
                    Humans and their allies, but it was not to be. The Ogre Emperor 
                    had a hidden weapon. Even as the Ogre stronghold itself was 
                    being sieged, the Emperor used a magic stone to call forth 
                    the hidden mages from their seclusion. With the arrival of 
                    the great mages, the humans were caught by surprise between 
                    the remainder of the allied troops and the most powerful mages 
                    of Norrath. The attacking armies were decimated in a single 
                    day, but only at a great cost. Many of the mages fell, and 
                    most of the remaining troops where lost. With the loss of 
                    so many mages the allies had no way of closing the portals 
                    and were forced to monitor them and attack the forces that 
                    would trickle though. The Ogre Emperor enraged at the damage 
                    done to the lands by the Human alliance, ordered the rebuilding 
                    of his armies at all cost, and with a great decree announced 
                    war upon the human nations. The ferocity of the allied forces 
                    was a sight many would wish they had never seen. The allied 
                    forces destroyed village after village, razed city after city 
                    till only a few gathering places were safe for the humans. 
                    Once again victory was taken from the allied forces as the 
                    pathetic humans cried out to their gods. Their gods answered 
                    with a wraith that smashed the strongest allied armies in 
                    moments. As the human gods forced the allied nations to flee, 
                    many of the human nations stole what remained behind in the 
                    allied cities. The human alliance gained so much knowledge 
                    so fast that their greed kept them from joining the attack 
                    their gods had begun. Instead they sat back laughing, and 
                    growing in knowledge. The lack of help that the human gods 
                    received may have been what saved the allied nations as the 
                    Tier'dal retreated to the place that the mages had created 
                    to work their portal closing magic, and sealed the great underground 
                    vault to rebuild with most of their knowledge intact. The 
                    Ogre and Troll nations did not have such a place and ran for 
                    the depths of the swamps, the ogres found a chasm that was 
                    easily defensible, and began the long process of rebuilding, 
                    and the trolls with their healing powers ran deep into the 
                    swamps to hide from the human gods&quot;.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;And 
                    so began the Age of Discord, with no enemies to fight the 
                    humans and their allies quickly fell upon each other separating 
                    the lands into distinct realms. With the stolen knowledge 
                    of the Tier'dal, a group of humans set sail for the island 
                    Odus and began to study the Tier'dal knowledge. Others turned 
                    the great citadels of the trolls into ruins out of hatred 
                    and still other great structures where taken by the now unchecked 
                    tides of creatures that came to Norrath&quot;. </font> </p>

                    has been many ages since those times, but today the allied 
                    nations have begun to rise again and seek war with their enemies. 
                    This is what I wished you to hear, it was in one such raid 
                    that a young Ogre saw his mother and father slain by human 
                    knights in gleaming armor. Do any of you know who that Ogre

                    the children were unready for a question still daydreaming, 
                    placing themselves next to the Emperor as he charged down 
                    a human village, or by one of the great mages as he cast spells

                    told her daughter the story already.</font></p>

                    to be one of their elite. The Regent hoped that the dark knights 
                    would help him find and slay those who killed his parents. 
                    He was saddened to find that most of them were only interested 
                    in warring with the Ogres militia, in a long past attempt 
                    to regain their name&quot;. Lorgrim sighed, he remembered 
                    the fights with the Craknecks and how useless it was to attack 
                    each other.</font></p>

                    land in the names of their gods. With these few friends he 
                    set out and attack a few minor villages but found that he 
                    could not even put a dent in the number of humans, not even

                    Ogre Emperor and so he gathered Ogres and Trolls under his 
                    banner and his guild grew. Soon The Regent was told of the 
                    great allies that the Tier'dal were, and so he set forth to 
                    find the lost city of the Tier'dal." Lorgrim smiled at the 
                    children each glued to his every word "After much searching 
                    he found the city and made many allies there, with so much 
                    force The Regent decided it was time to show his might and 
                    lead an attack upon all the villages of the human's in Rath 
                    Mountains. The battle raged for only two days and left most 
                    all of the villages in ashes, but one thing stopped their 
                    blood lust charge." Lorgrim paused to take a drink knowing 
                    the children would squirm anxious to hear what happened next.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Uhmm... 
                    lets see where was I?" in unison the children cried out "the 
                    villages, the battles." Lorgrim smiled "Ahhh yes." </font> 
                  </p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 
                    Regent was leading a charge on a small farm stead and the 
                    defenders were a small pathetic band of farmers who fell quickly 
                    to his troops, but Dorje noticed a small boy hiding under 
                    the stairs leading to the front door of the house." The children 
                    looked shocked and horrified at the mention of a child in 
                    the battle, they all been taught the guild tenants - Never 
                    harm the innocent they are not our enemies. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This 
                    is when the regent realized it was not these farmers he must 
                    punish but those who harm others in the name of the spiteful 
                    gods of good, and so the guild changed. Since then we have 
                    adopted a more honorable stance in this matter, and seek to 
                    defend those who are innocent, against those who are blinded 
                    by their own goodness." The children sat caught in thought, 
                    it was a lot for their little brains to soak up.</font> </p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lorgrim 
                    turned sharply to see the person who walked into his class, 
                    "Alight children, enough story it is time for you to find 
                    your parents and remind them to eat" it was Darruk one of 
                    the guilds great Necromancers and a fellow leader.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The children 
                    jumped up, many hugging Lorgrim as they passed, this was the 
                    feeling he missed most with his Lori being gone, he thought 
                    to himself. Lorgrim stood slowly giving his old bones time 
                    to adjust to his weight.</font> </p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"How 
                    long have you been listening Friend?" Lorgrim said in a calm 
                    pleasant voice to Darruk.</font></p>
                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Long 
                    enough friend, you know I enjoy how you tell the story. It 
                    often helps my spirit lift on those days that I spend more 
                    time meditating than fighting." Darruk smiled at Lorgrim, 
                    and Lorgrim remembered why loosing his family did not hurt 
                    so much. He still had so many other family members in this 
                    band of nomads.</font></p>
