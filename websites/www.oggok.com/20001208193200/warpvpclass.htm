                    PvP" nice play on words eh? Its a well known fact that warriors 
                    (and all Melee classes) are the most difficult classes to 
                    play for PvP encounters. This guide will hopefully shed some 
                    light on the best way to play a Warrior, and to stay alive, 
                    and hopefully be successful in player vs. player combat. This 
                    guide is also geared for the level 20+ players. If I do not 
                    mention a class here then it is one I have never had experience 
                    fighting against.</font></p>

                    Melee Classes:</b><br>
                    One of the most important rules you will learn is to NEVER 
                    stop moving. This is extremely important, why? Because your 
                    opponent won't stop moving. Your target will do their best 
                    to use your size against you (especially for Trolls and Ogres). 
                    They will do everything they can to get behind you, beside 
                    you, or as close to you or just out of your weapon range, 
                    so that you can't hit them. There are many good methods to 
                    combating your opponent. A good method is to act like your 
                    running away then suddenly pull backwards until your target 
                    is in front of you, then move in for a shot to there backside. 
                    In my PvP experiences the most successful warriors are those 
                    that master controlling their character with their Keyboard/Mouse. 
                    One of the most potent styles of moving through a fight is 
                    the circling melee. It is performed by hold down your right 
                    mouse key and using your direction keys on your keyboard to 
                    circle around your target leaving them in one spot for a few 
                    seconds enough time to land a good blow. It also gives you 
                    advantages of keeping your target in view most of the time. 
                    Many players when faced with these tactics will stop and spin 
                    in place to try to keep you in view. This is often their deadly 
                    mistake. They become open to your attack and their attack 
                    becomes useless.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Rangers:</b><br>
                    Rangers are a tough lot to kill, but fortunately for us there 
                    damage spells aren't very powerful, so they can't simply sit 
                    back and nuke like a caster can. This means that they will 
                    have to do some type of melee with you to do damage, and that 
                    is a bad position for them. Their first attack will be to 
                    snare you. If you are snared, wait for them to come to you 
                    and time your attack by keeping your weapon attack turned 
                    off, then quickly turn it on as they get close. This causes 
                    your weapon to go off just as they come in range. After a 
                    few shots for 40 to 50 points and possibly a double attack 
                    on them for close to 80+ they will back off and will usually 
                    run. This is where a ranged weapons (bow & arrows) come in 
                    handy. This is a skill that is Way under utilized by the warrior 
                    class. Many use bows to pull monsters and such but don't take 
                    the advantage that it gives seriously. To a warrior with full 
                    armor and 600+HP a bow is little threat to our lives on their 
                    own. But to a ranger that has half as many HP and not near 
                    as good AC this can be a weapon to be dealt with when in a 
                    warrior's hands. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Monks:</b><br>
                    Monks pose a real problem especially at higher levels. They 
                    are extremely fast and do a lot of damage in a short period 
                    of time. There are 2 schools of though on fighting monks. 
                    </font></p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Because 
                      they are so fast, a warrior would be best to use two 1H 
                      Slash weapons that has as slow of a delay as possible (Dragoon 
                      Dirks or FS Spears). This will give you the best chance 
                      of hitting a monk when they come in for the attack. Warriors 
                      are very dependant on HP and AC at this point. If you can 
                      nickel and dime them for long enough they will run out of 
                      HP before you do. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Because 
                      they are so fast, you won't be able to hit them very often 
                      regardless of your weapon. Since your damage shots will 
                      be at a minimum against this class it is best to do as much 
                      damage as possible with a powerful 2H Slash weapon. When 
                      they charge for the attack they're probably going to hit 
                      for around 30+ damage in that combat round (base level 20) 
                      but you hitting them once for 50 (with something like a 
                      BIBS) is really going to upset the balance in your favor.</font></p>

                    Knights:</b><br>
                    This class can be a tough class to fight. At level 20+ they 
                    can do massive amounts of damage in a short period of time. 
                    They can use dot spells, and can deliver a Harm Touch (Level 
                    x 10). There best DoT spell is "Engulfing Darkness" which 
                    is a very long lasting snare type spell. This is a fight that 
                    you want to treat similar to fighting a pure caster. You need 
                    to get on them and attack relentlessly, to try to disrupt 
                    their spells. When they do get a spell off this is where you 
                    want to have as much Magic Resistance as you can get. With 
                    enough Magic Resistance you can resist these DoT spells, and 
                    you can even resist their HT. If possible you want to force 
                    them into an enclosed space and force them into pure melee 
                    combat (this works very well in the Qeynos sewer system) save 
                    bash/slam for when they start to cast. If you can force them 
                    into a pure melee fight you will win hands down. No other 
                    class can out damage a warrior in pure melee. If the fight 
                    isn't going their way, they are going to cast "shadow step" 
                    so be ready to bash/slam if you see it coming. If they do 
                    get the ST off immediately look around you especially in wide 
                    open areas with no cover. A bow can be very handy to keep 
                    them from casting again, but be prepared for them to get away.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Paladins:</b><br>
                    Not nearly as tough as a SK but darned annoying, especially 
                    if they use lay on hands. Paladins have no major offensive 
                    spells and can be dealt with mostly as a monk except with 
                    better defensive qualities and less offensive qualities. Its 
                    very important to make sure they cant cast heal on themselves 
                    or you will be in a world of hurt later, but even with a few 
                    heals if they are around the same level you should still be 
                    able to win. Now, dealing with lay hands is a different matter. 
                    If they cast Lay Hands and you still have around 2 1/2 bars 
                    of life left, keep fighting for it takes them a while to switch 
                    to themselves cast the spell and then start attacking again, 
                    that is usually enough time for 2 combat rounds, (now imagine 
                    hitting for max damage and having double attacking going off 
                    twice, 200 damage with something like a BIBS, and around level 
                    20 they will only have about 650+ HP, that's a major blow 
                    to them.) Another thing is that more than once has a Paladin 
                    in his haste cast Lay Hands on me by accident. :)</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Rogues:</b><br>
                    If your fighting a good rogue there much more difficult than 
                    you think, if there skill is level 30+ at level 20 they can 
                    backstab for 70+ damage, not including there other weapons, 
                    duel wield and double attack make them little machine guns. 
                    Of course, what you want to do is keep your back to the wall 
                    at all time making sure they can't get a backstab in, the 
                    problem with this is more than once has a rogue snuck behind 
                    my backside while it was next to a wall and preformed a back 
                    stab. Fortunately for us, that's all they really have going 
                    for them, they have the same amount of HPs as a Shaman and 
                    if you can land a few good blows they will almost always run. 
                    Many will use the Hide and Move tactic so that they can sneak 
                    behind you and give you a good shot. Their problem is that 
                    they need to stop moving to hide. If you stay on them you 
                    can usually land a shot and disrupt their hide attempt. If 
                    they DO hide then keep trying to shoot your bow because you 
                    will still have them targeted and you don't have to see them 
                    to hit them it, and that will bring them out of hiding and 
                    give you time to use your melee weapon. Don't worry to much 
                    about poisons, you need to be a master potter to make them 
                    and they are quite expensive so most rogues don't even bother. 
                    But if the do poison you be careful.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Warrior:</b><br>
                    Stay on the move! They are your equals so you will have to 
                    use strategy. Move around constantly and every once in a while 
                    go in for the attack and pull out, being a warrior yourself 
                    you should know what to expect and how to counter it. If you 
                    have more hit points than them and better equipment you can 
                    always just pull them into a pure melee. Generally when similar 
                    characters meet the person with the best control over their 
                    characters movement will win.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Wizard:</b><br>
                    These are the classes that devastate us, of course no one 
                    is invincible and we can always gain the upper hand if we 
                    know how. There are a few important things to remember about 
                    fighting any caster. GET ON THEM! If you can engage and hit 
                    they will have to spend time retreating. Casters have the 
                    lowest HP and AC of any one you will face in the game. A few 
                    good shots mixed in with a bash/slam here and there can disrupt 
                    their spells and keep them off balance. Magic resistance is 
                    of great importance here as well. Get as many magic resistance 
                    items as you can. It can be the difference between life and 
                    death. If a caster gets resisted once or twice they are in 
                    serous trouble and generally won't have enough mana left to 
                    kill you by nuking you. Another important factor against casters: 
                    always use ranged weapons. Some bows have a range that is 
                    further than the casters range, so you can nickel and dime 
                    them from a safe distance if they Shadow Step. Don't get your 
                    hopes up though. Once they Shadow Step you can bet they are 
                    running for the closest zone or safe spot.</font></p>

                    I HATE these guys. Enthrall is what is going to bring you 
                    down. GET ON THEM! As SOON as enthrall drops try to interrupt 
                    there casting so they can't cast again and if they pull off 
                    another mez or enthrall, your in bad shape. Another problem 
                    is the Rune series of spells, you wont be able to hit them 
                    but they still can cast. When fighting a enchanter, its best 
                    to get on them and do major damage to them or to get to a 
                    safe spot.</font></p>

                    They have similar spells to SK's but with more powerful dots 
                    and pets. Unfortunately due to dark pack and allure of death 
                    you can't count on them running out of mana. The best you 
                    can do is GET ON THEM and try to disrupt them as much as possible. 
                    Get them into an enclosed space if possible. Also count on 
                    having their pet on you but I suggest ignoring it. If you 
                    can kill the Necro the pet dies as well. The main problem 
                    your going to run into is their life drain. They will life 
                    tap you and dot you then kite you. If you feel yourself falling 
                    into this situation, my only suggestion is to get out of it. 
                    Run to a zone or safe spot. Most of the time the best you 
                    can hope to get against a Necro is a stale mate. Magic Resistance 
                    can help you accomplish this.</font></p>

                    With the mage you will face some of the same problems as with 
                    the Necro but your chances of victory are somewhat higher 
                    if you are prepared. As you probably know mages use the earth 
                    pet and they use root as their attack. There is one sure way 
                    to nullify their pet though. MAGIC RESISTANCE! MAGIC RESISTANCE! 
                    MAGIC RESISTANCE! Their pet becomes virtually useless once 
                    you can resist their root spell. Once this happens you can 
                    ignore the pet and go after the mage. When you do happen to 
                    get rooted, switch to a bow and arrow. Small amounts of damage 
                    still effect the casters in a larger way than they do us. 
                    Then the mages are just going to sit back and cast on you. 
                    Always try to keep them at bay to make sure they can't cast, 
                    and like most other casters, just try to use ranged weapons 
                    to keep them from pulling off spells. You are probably going 
                    to have to ignore the pet for it has too many HPs and casts 
                    root too often it wont be effective to devote your time to 
                    it. When the earth elemental's Root spell starts to fail chase 
                    down the mage and keep him running until he starts to try 
                    to cast a DD spell, then go in and use bash/slam and a weapon 
                    attack.</font></p>

                    Probably one of the toughest class to face in PvP. Basically 
                    your only hope is to lure them into a space where you can 
                    keep track of them and where they don't have many places to 
                    run, unfortunately that's not going to happen to often. They 
                    are, basically no matter WHAT going to kite you. Snare, SS, 
                    DD, that's what is going to take you down. I suggest investing 
                    in a few Pumice Stones to take those spells off yourself. 
                    This is also another case where MAGIC RESISTANCE is important. 
                    If you can resist one or two spells, and pumice off one or 
                    two spells the druid isn't going to have enough mana to kill 
                    you. Also another trick is to run up and pumice them when 
                    they look like that stupid mutt dog. Once they're back in 
                    their true form they will almost always run for the hills 
                    because their class is only one or two spells deep, and that 
                    mutt spell is the main one. Nullifying it, usually nullifies 
                    them. If you have no MR, and no Pumice Stone, then my suggestion 
                    is to run.</font></p>

                    Clerics are kind of a strange class. They can do melee damage 
                    (not enough for us to be extremely worried about) and magic 
                    damage (again not enough to kill us)but their biggest attribute 
                    is HEAL. If you have good magic resistance and can hit them 
                    for a few good damaging blows be prepared for a blind spell 
                    or them to try to heal themselves. Keep a bash/slam saved 
                    for them once you see them start to cast. If you can stay 
                    on them long enough they are yours.</font></p>
