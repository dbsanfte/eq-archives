The Human Necromancer is one of the most over-looked race/class combinations in all Everquest.  Most people will simply laugh at the idea of a Human Necro.  From my personal experiences, balance wise, a Human Necromancer is the best around!  Now you won't have the power of a Dark Elf, nor the vision, but you certainly are much more welcome in a lot more places, saving you needless corpse recoveries.  Start off by putting as much as you can into Intelligence (I believe it maxes at 110) and then put the other 5 into Agility or Dexterity, you'll need it, especially early on.  Note that while your intelligence is a little low, you can take a little more beating at a lower level thanks to your more balanced stats, and this is a big help to get to those later levels.<br>
Also, this guide is going to be based heavily upon you choosing to follow Innoruuk which starts you off in Freeport.  While this guide is still usable starting in Qeynos, you'll have a very difficult time getting to the areas it deals with.  Also note that this is certainly not an easy path to follow, but can be a very rewarding one!<br>
Now lets begin!<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>   </tr></table><br><br>

Like I said above, a good choice is Innoruuk, and is what I personally have chosen.  Once you get in, scribe/memorize your spells, equip your dagger and candle, and head off to your guild.  As far as I can see, you're not KOS anywhere in your home town of Freeport, though i may be wrong.  Head on over to the docks, and go under the wharf, there's a door to the right if you're facing the ocean.  Go through there and make your way through to your guild leader.  I'll leave the rest to you, the exploring'll do ya some good!  Once you do find your leader, give her the letter, put on your guild robe, and throw those 5 practice points into Piercing.

That's right! We're leaving Antonica! Some people might think I'm crazy when they read this, but hey, ya gotta be a little nuts to be a Human Necromancer.  Hop on that boat and head on over to Butcherblock.  I advise staying on the boat, and near the center the whole time, I had a close call with falling off once, though it was only lag, in any case, be careful.  When you zone into ButcherBlock, the tricky part happens.  When you see yourself approaching The Wall and docks, you'll see a hill before The Wall off to the left.  Jump off here and swim to shore.  Don't worry about the Dwarf along the edge, he's okay with you, but all of the guards in Butcherblock are certainly not, which is why you had to jump ship.<br>  
Welcome to Faydwer!  Carefully pick your way through ButcherBlock towards Greater Faydark (highly suggest getting a map if you do not know the area well, you can pick one up at www.eqmaps.com) While you're heading that way, make sure to shout/ooc for anybody who can give you a bind at the BB/GFay line.  You certainly don't want to start back at Freeport should you encounter any mishaps!<br>
Now you're in Greater Faydark, and hopefully bound.  If not continue to call out for a bind here, there's usually someone around, this being a rather heavily populated area.  Make your way along the path to Felwithe.  Note that you are not KOS in Felwithe or Kelethin (but be careful around Kelethin, if you step into the Rangers guild you sometimes are murdered!).  Find a man named Tacar Tissleplay and talk to him about delivering mail.  Once you have the letter head for Kelethin.  
Another Note:  You should get bound in Kelethin, this will be your main hunting area for a while. <br>
Now deliver the letter to Jakum Webdancer in the Bards Guild (I'll leave that to you).  Congratulations, you got some faction, exp, and money.  Now the fun begins!<br>

I suggest delivering mail until 3 only because you get some good money (1 to 3 gold for ever letter), which you'll need for spells later.  If you don't decide to deliver mail (which can be a bit tedious), head out to the ruins near Kelethin.  If you don't know where it is, there's plenty of people around to point you in the right direction.<br>  
Start off by killing bats, giant wasp drones, wolves, and decaying skeletons (save those bone chips!) You can do this on your own through 3rd or 4th.  Then start looking for Orc Pawns and Pixie Tricksters, plus the occasional widow hatchling (be careful for the poison though).  You can do this until 5th.  Always keep your Minor Shielding up, and with lifetap and your dagger you can easily kill most of these creatures.  If you want to get your low level spells now, in comes the tricky part.  You're probably thinking, "But Isn't the Necro guild back on Antonica?" Yes and No.  While your guild was there, there is another here on Faydwer, in Ak'Anon.  Make your way back past Felwithe and into Lesser Faydark, again highly suggest getting maps, and make your way to Steamfont mountains.  Once in Steamfont move along the path towards Ak'Anon keeping your eyes peeled for Pumas, Skeletons, and Kobolds, which arne't too fond of you and will eat you for breakfast at these levels.  Also, IMPORTANT!  Avoid the guards! They will kill you!  Once you see the entrance to Ak'Anon, go left towards the entrance, keeping a safe distance from the guards, and climb up the wall as far as you can.  Then make your way over to the tunnel; the guards can't see you yet.  Drop down into the tunnel and run towards the zone, they shouldn't be able to catch you.  Now the reason I say don't do this until 4th or 5th, is because using the Gate spell is a crucial part of getting out of here.  Any younger and I can't help you.  Head down to the Necro guild, they will deal with you here.  Good place to sell loot if you can't get someone to do it in Kelethin (make friends! They are your source of food and loot selling!).  Buy up all the important spells (pet spell, gate, clinging darkness, lifetap spells, poison bolt, disease cloud, etc.)  You should be level 5 by this point like I said, so Gate back to Faydwer and its on to new things.<br>

Group like your life depended on it (and trust me, it does).  You will be heading up to Orc Hill now.  Make sure you get a good pet (cons white or better, at least at levels 5 and 6).  Try to find a group, this is very important.  You won't last too long on your own, and people are always looking for group members, so you shouldn't have that much trouble.  Always send your pet in, cast Clinging Darkness and let them do the rest.  Even as a Human, you are NOT a tank!  This should be your strategy until at least level 7, then you can move on.<br>  
Now at level 7, with great caution, you can go into Crushbone.  Once in Crushbone head out of the tunnel, and to the left, there's a bridge, cross the bridge.  This is your hunting area.  Do not go over the hill to the left unless to pull a centurion off the hill (con it first!).  Most of the orc centurions in this section of CrushBone will be white/black or blue to you.  Yes fighting these does lower your faction with a certain part of Neriak, but it shouldn't affect it too bad, and you'll be able to get it up later if needed.  Summon your pet, pull with Clinging Darkness, then Poison Bolt, send in pet, cast a lifetap if needed with occasional melee.  Collect all the belts you can get.  You can do 2 things with these belts.  You can sell them for money (good for buying your spells) or turn them in to Canloe in Kaladim.  Now, after killing this many orcs you may not be KOS in Butcherblock/Kaladim anymore, but remember to con from a distance to see.  You can turn these in for good exp, faction, a little money, and a piece of small patchwork (which you can sell).<br>  
Do this until 8th.

Go back to Ak'Anon and buy at LEAST these 4 spells:  Gather Shadows, Bone Walk, Ward Undead, and Lesser Shielding.  With these you can start fighting the skeletons here in Steamfont.  They will con yellow to you, and are VERY dangerous.  Head out of Ak'Anon and head right over to the Skeletal Dragon formation.  There are 4 spawn points here.  Spawning either a decaying skeleton (not the newbie ones you're used to though), skeletons, or sometimes decaying gnomes, or gnome skeletons (weaklings, about as strong as newbie decaying skeletons in GFay).  Pull these one at a time, and only one at a time, with clinging darkness.  Then send your pet in and chain cast Ward Undead until you're out of mana, or its sure your pet will win.  If you have to tank for your pet for only a few hits, then let him do the rest.  Note that Ward Undead will fizzle alot as it is your first Evocation spell, you may want to put a few practice points into this before you go out and fight. <br>

Good.  Because you're gonna be here for a while.  This is the best place I've found until you hit level 12.  Here you get more bone chips than you could ever want, and some decent loot.  Its relatively safe if you're careful, but beware, the guards most likely don't like you(though inside town you're fine).  So no running to the guards here, I suggest getting a bind inside.  When in trouble throw your pet into the fray then gate to safety.  Anyways, you can try Numb the Dead to break up the big groups, but be warned: this spell seems to be resisted about 30% of the time, and when that happens you're in trouble, for the skeletons will instantly start running for you, so don't heavily rely on this.  This gives insanely good experience at first, slowly winding down to where its a little bit of a chore at 12th, but this is the best place for you right now.  Once you get to 12th grab your new spells (engulfing darkness, heat blood, new pet, bind (woohoo!) are must haves, they will make the road ahead much easier) and head for Freeport, back home!<br>

Head to West Freeport and find the Hogcallers inn.  You'll see a Monk in front of the counter, and a merchant behind, they shouldn't bother you.  Take a left and head through the little winding passage towards the next room.  Be careful for Lady Shae, she is a High Elf Paladin that will attack you on sight, and she's around level 13, but she can still be pretty dangerous if you're not ready.  She spawns and comes downstairs once every 20 minutes, so you can time this.  Nobody else here will help Lady Shae.  When you kill her you get negative faction with Felwithe guards and a few silver.  You'll notice Trissa Whistlesong standing near the far corner.  She will not help Lady Shae, but Lady Shae will help her.  Now before you begin, its faction warning time!  Killing Trissa will give you negative faction with Knights of Truth (paladins, unfortunately the guys who patrol North Freeport, the area with the bank, so you may want to kick some deathfist orc butt before you go in, to raise your faction.  Currently at level 16 I'm just above dubious due to not upping my faction earlier, so becareful), also negative faction with Qeynos Guards and Antonica Bards (so no more mail runs).  This gives you positive faction with Ring of Scale and Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
Now for the good parts.  First of all this gives you insane experience, even with your pet (which you'll need).  You'll go through these levels very fast.  Also everytime Trissa dies she drops at least one mandolin, which you can sell to the merchant behind the counter (she conned indifferent to me) for about 1.3plat. Trissa also drops between 10 copper and 4 gold, as well as the occasional extra instrument, pages for enchanter research, runes for wizard research, and Words for Necro research!  I did this pretty successfully only dying once when I wasn't being careful and Lady Shae walked in while I was killing Trissa and proceeded to beat me to a pulp.  Trissa usually spawns 6 minutes after you kill her, usually giving you time to med up before she reappears.  Also later you can time this so you kill Trissa 3 times, wait for Shae, kill her, then repeat.  With the money I earned I was able to buy multiple pieces of jewelry, all my spells for 16th, many other spells I had wanted to get earlier but did not have the money for, as well as a Stein of Moggok (definitely get one of these, well worth the money you need to purchase one).  Other benefits are the occasional young Monk or other traveler wandering in and watching you in awe.  For some reason they think you are godlike for being able to kill Trissa, very amusing, get for roleplaying purposes.  Also other Necros, Dark Elves, Erudites, even other Humans will wander in occasionally.  General rule is if someone is already there, you ask permission to camp with them, or just simply accept the fact they got their first, and ask the person to send a tell to you when you're done.  Through this I have made a few Necromancer friends, and only once got into an arguement with a guy, who, after thinking he was being tricky by attacking Trissa while I was medding, was instead killed by her and learned his lesson.  Happy hunting and I'll continue this guide to 20 when I get there myself!<br>

Whatcha think of her music now? What, you hate her? Good, you'll be killing her for a few more levels.  With your new found level 16 pet Trissa will become very very easy, usually I'd just throw one or two DoTs on and send in my pet, which could easily take care of her.  Once you hit level 17, you can most likely take Trissa without your pet, providing a little more experience per kill.  Also if you're not KOS with Trissa yet, stand in the corner near her, Lady Shae won't see you there.  Also Lady Shae will not in fact help Trissa, Shae will only attack you if you get to close to her. Best tactic is pull with engulfing, leech, heat blood, then heart flutter, and melee her to death (the skills come in handy to boost your offense and defense, which helps you survive that one or two extra hits at higher levels).  This can easily be done until 20th.  At 19 the experience is much slower, but just remember, you're earning loads of cash in the meantime.  Save up for those INT boosting items, and grab yourself a FBR while you're at it, us Humans look great in them! Happy Bard Killing!
