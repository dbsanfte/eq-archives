<div>
Valadian tried hard to not let his surprise show upon his face.  He did 
fairly well, too.  The woman smiled a little at him, and he merely 
stared at her, his mind working furiously.  The famous ruler of Myrgar 
was a woman.  Not a Lord at all.
<p>
Did that change his strategy at all?  Of course not.  Male, female, 
makes no difference when there's a dagger in their back.  He recalled a 
few odd stories he had heard of the vicious "Lord of Mygrar", and worked 
to envision them with a woman as the dark heroine of the tales.  It 
wasn't easy, considering some of the things he had heard...
<p>
"Who are you, and what are you doing here?"
<p>
The voice startled him.  He hadn't realized that he had been staring, 
and the woman's cool voice, with a touch of an odd accent, brought him 
back to reality.  Thinking fast, he replied, "I come only to serve in 
thine company, Great One.  The stories of thine power and rule range far 
and wide across the land."
<p>
The woman's smile broadened a little, and she looked down upon his 
kneeling form as a cat would upon a trapped mouse.  "Really...?  I am 
impressed, of course.  But also suspicious.  Heard tales, have you?  
Then surely you wouldn't expect me to simply accept a vagabond warrior 
like yourself?"
<p>
Valadian grew silent, pondering, considering how to respond to this 
one.  "Of course, My Lady.  I never expected to not have to prove my 
worth to thee.  To test to see if I am up to thine standards."
Lady Myrgar tilted her head to the side a little, her blue eyes alight 
with amusement.  "A test, you say?  Hmmm. Yes... a test... not a bad 
idea."
The two guards at Valadian's side suddenly released their hold, and 
allowed him to stand.  Straightening his tunic, he silently faced Lady 
Myrgar and waited.  Finally, she clapped her hands together, and said, 
"So be it, then!  What is your name, man?"
<p>
"Valadian."
<p>
She nodded, and said gently, slowly, "Now, my dear Valadian, as you 
must already know, I have very high standards.  Wanted to meet them says 
you?  Worthy, are ye?  Well, we shall indeed see.  Here is the test for 
you, Warrior.  Below this castle Mygrar, there exists a small series of 
dungeons and labyrinths, in which lives a peculiar beast.  The Crimson 
Hydra, Pyrode.  For years, the beast has attempted to storm the upper 
levels of this castle....claims it was his before I ever arrived.  Of 
course, my guards easily forced him back.  But I, and my men, grow weary 
and annoyed with this dragon's behaviors.  You are to venture down to 
the labyrinths, and kill him."
<p>
Valadian frowned.  Killing a noblewoman was one thing.  But a dragon??  
He had never taken one on in battle before. "Now," Lady Mygrar 
continued, "Pyrode happens to be a direct descendant of Vaevictus 
Daggoth, the most eldest and chosen child of Veeshan.  So you may find 
it a little bothersome tackling the beast.  I will outfit you with the 
necessary materials, of course.  You leave tomorrow, at mid-day."
What could he do?  Certainly not say no, and find himself almost 
immediately leaving the tower in a most unpleasant way (probably out a 
window).  So Valadian nodded sternly, and one of the guards grabbed his 
arm, ushering him out of the room.
<p>
The great door slammed shut with a resounding boom, and Mygrar waited 
silently until she could hear no more footsteps.  Then, turning to the 
remaining guard, she said, "Make sure Pyrode gets word that I myself 
will be traveling down to his lair, to 'dispose of him for good'.  Let 
him think I come in the form of a ragged human warrior.  Valadian will 
not survive his stay down there, not while Pyrode thinks he is me."
<p>
The guard smirked, and bowed low, before showing himself out of Lady 
Mygrar's room, going to fulfill his task.  The Lady leaned back into her 
chair, and slowly swiveled back around, her back to the door once more.

<div>
    The area across the grasslands was easier than he expected.  His going
was as easy as could be; probably, he realized, so that archers upon the
battlements of Mygrar could easily pick off any enemy forces in the wide
open fields.  When Valadian finally arrived at what appeared to be the
entrance, the rain had picked up, as well as the startling booms of thunder
and bright bolts of lightning that illuminated the night.
<p>
    At first, his presence outside received no response, and he thought with
grim amusement if he should venture so far as to knock on the gigantic oaken
doors which served as the main entrance.  However, just as he was getting
up his courage, a dark, cloaked figure clutching a crude spear appeared over
the top of the wall, and called down at him, "Who the hell are you, and what
do ye want here?"
<p>
    Valadian lost his train of thought, startled at the rather unchivalrous
reply, but soon enough regained his voice, as he hollered up, "My name is
Valadian, and I journey from the city of Qeynos!  I have come to grace the
presence of the Lord Mygrar, and to offer my blade to his wise rule!  All I
ask is that I be taken in from this terrible storm, and given warm food and
shelter!"
<p>
    The soldier appeared to consider this a moment, and Valadian even thought
he saw the glimmer of a smirk upon the man's face as he called back down,
this time with a more friendly air, "Sure, come on in!"
<p>
    Ah well, Valadian thought to himself, it does not matter.  I'm in, at
least.  And in he was.  With a slow, rumbling creak, the great wooden doors
cracked at the center, and slowly began to slide inwards.  Two men in armor
walked out, and stood at both sides of him.
<p>
    Valadian slid his gloved hand slowly to his sword hilt, just in case.
But the soldiers simply gave a swift salute, turned to face inwards with
him, and waited. An escort service, Valadian realized, and gathered a stern
pose about him, as he kept his eyes and upper face hidden in the confines of
his hood.  Then he walked slowly in through the gigantic double doors.
<p>
    The first thing that struck him as he passed through the wall was
surprise at how thick the walls were from the outside.  The second thing
that struck him happened to be the hilt of a sword held in the hands of one
of his 'escorts'.
<p>
    He never even saw it coming, only felt a sudden thump against the back
of his skull.  Then, with an "oof", he lost his balance, and pitched
forward, everything going black.  As he lay upon the floor, losing
consciousness, he heard the sound of low chuckling, and felt two pairs of
hands wrap around his arms, and begin dragging him...
<p>
    When Valadian awoke, he found himself lying upon a damp straw mattress.
He didn't move at first, in case unwanted eyes were watching, but instead
just partially opened one.  He appeared to be in a cell-like room, with very
few pieces of furniture.  The only exit to the room was a small door, more
than likely locked, and there were no windows that he could see.
<p>
    Figuring he was alone, Valadian opened both eyes, and pulled himself to
a sitting position, groaning uncomfortably as he did.  And too late he
realized his mistake.  He cut his groan off short, but it was not soon
enough.
<p>
    The door burst open, and two armored men entered, one of them being the
guard he had spoken to outside the castle, when he was trying to gain
admittance.  Furious at the treachery, Valadian reached for his sword blade,
only to realize the space was empty.  The guards had, of course, stripped
him of all weapons.
<p>
    The guards sneered, and grabbed him by both arms, dragging him out of
the room.  Valadian decided not to waste his energy resisting, as even if he
did break away, he could not yet escape.  They led him up a long, spiral
staircase, which, he assumed, could only be the staircase for the central
tower which he had gazed at earlier that day.  At the top, they came to a
heavy, iron door, with what appeared to be an intricate engraving of a
gargoyle head upon it.
<p>
    One of the guards banged upon the door, and a muffled voice came sharply
from within.  The guard opened the door, and the two of them dragged him
into the room.  It was lavishly furnished, with beautiful rugs and
tapestries hanging from the walls and upon the floor.  The back of a large
oaken chair faced them, resting upon a thin, circular platform.
<p>
    The guards forced him to his knees, and the one that he had spoken with
outside said in a sneering voice, "May I present, sir, the 'Lord'
Mygrar..."
<p>
    The circular platform turned, causing the large chair to slowly spin
around.  As Valadian lifted his head, he looked  into the coldest, blue
*female* eyes he had ever seen.
<p>
<a name=3></a>
<font color=000000 size=2>1/14/99</font>
<div>		
Valadian cursed the fates that put him into the position of his present.  He
wandered wearily forward, his legs moving mechanically now, through the
pelting of the hard rain.  It was almost Midnight and he, in the name of
duty, found himself climbing up a small hill towards his destination.  The
trees grew scarce around this area of plains, the grass and scrub filling in
the gaps.  The impeding foliage was up to his knees now, he noticed with a scowl.
<p>
He pulled his hood lower over his face.  His face... the visage even he could
not bare to see in a reflection without a shudder.  Years ago, in the name
of duty, he fought off two trolls and an ogre, to distract them so his
comrades could raid a supply wagon heading to Paineel.  He lost the battle
with the beasts and figuring him dead, they left his battered, bleeding
body in a ditch by the road.  However, the battle had left him alive, but with only one
eye and a ghastly scar running from his forehead down the right side of his
face, ending at the chin.
<p>
Now he once again found himself at work.  His comrades had been successful
before, and he had managed to crawl back to their hideout.  He was uncertain
if this mission would be so successful, however.  For he was to come into
this one alone, and it was far enough from civilization that if he ever had
to crawl to safety again, he could never make it.
<p>
All the more reason to send me, he thought grimly to himself.  Easily
dispensable.  Then again, from what he understood, this mission was of
relatively high importance, so they must have at least expected him to be
successful.
<p>
He mentally went over the details of his job in his mind.  He was to enter
Mygrar Country, a land that had been seldom explored.  It was supposedly
ruled by a noble Lord with an iron fist, who had a fortress in the middle
of the area.  The castle, it was said, rested upon a patch of plains, in the
center of thick woods that made up the bulk of the land.
<p>
And so he journeyed now in the dark of this wretched, stormy night to the
castle, in order to meet with this noble.  Upon meeting the Lord, he was to execute him and all of his
descendants, and then escape from Mygrar.
<p>
Valadian muttered a curse under his breath.  It was all a big public
relations job anyway.  His group had been killing so many humans and elves
recently that they needed to establish a good picture for themselves, that
their unlawful actions could be better cloaked in secrecy.  How it was that
killing an uptight nobleman would accomplish good relations with humans
Valadian could not yet figure out.
<p>
He shrugged it off, and kept on trudging forward up the hill.  It mattered
little, the rhyme and reason behind it all.  The fact of the matter was that
this was what he did, what he had to do.  And do it he would.
<p>
Valadian reached up and pulled the hood lower over his eyes.  The rain
seemed to be pounding harder and the lightning flashing brighter.
The wind was picking up, as well.  He uttered a curse under his breath
again, figuring he may have to find some shelter.
<p>
But there would be no need, for as Valadian reached the top of the hill he beheld a large stone structure standing far below, resting firmly at the base of the hill and upon the wide-open, grassy plains. He
caught his breath and stared upon what lay before him. 
<p>
The stone towers of the great structure reached up from the ground like
great golem hands, and the wall surrounding the structure like the side of a
cliff, seemingly impenetrable. In the middle of this wall rested a gigantic compound, with rooms
and windows and substructures littered almost aimlessly here and there.  But the thing that
caught Valadian's eye was the tower near the center of the complex.  Rising up from the
jumbled collection of buildings and structures below it, the great pillar of
stone rose  high into the sky, as if arrogantly reaching for the clouds and
the gods themselves.
<p>
Valadian smiled.  This would certainly prove to be interesting work.  For
before him he beheld the great fortress Mygrar.

<div>
Malon grew up a strong lad, energetic and bright.  Even though he lived in
Erudin with his Guardian, Minaires, he followed in his father's footsteps
and became a Paladin.  After years of training, the great council called
Malon to them.  There, they told the young man of his past, of how they had
cast a powerful blessing upon him at a young age, and of how he was destined to
destroy the Dark Necromancer, Zelmryl.  Malon soon grew to hate their
portrayal of Zelmryl, and swore an oath to the council that, with Minaires'
help, he would himself defeat Zelmryl and return his dark Horde to the
ground and dust from whence they'd sprang.
<p>
Pleased with their results, the council sent Malon, along with Minaires,
away from Erudin, to the continent of Antonica.  There, Malon spent many
years in the human city of Qeynos, studying with the fighting guilds
there, becoming more and more at ease with his skills as a Paladin.  He grew
popular amongst the townspeople, and as his strategic and fighting skills
grew, he rose in rank, until he became Captain of the Guard.  But all the
while, he waited, looking towards the sea, until the time when Zelmryl
would come to meet him.
<p>
And that day did indeed come.  One eve, just as the sun was beginning to
disappear over the western mountains, the ground began to shake violently.
From his position on the city walls, Malon could hear people shout in
surprise from the grounds below. Then, suddenly, Minaires appeared at his
side.
<p>
"He comes!" Minaires gasped,  "The Dark One comes at last!"
<p>
Malon turned his gaze westward, and as was foretold, the sea parted, creating a
path.  Far below, Malon could view the makings of a twisted fortress,
glowing in a magical light.  And spewing from the fortress, by the
thousands, by the hundreds of thousands, came beasts of great horror.
Zombies, wraiths, skeletons, even Liches, poured from the fortress, making
their way towards the Human City.  And behind the hordes, commanding them, flew a tall man
draped in fluttering black robes and dark cloak.  In one hand, the
Dark One clasped a black spellbook with the engraving of a skull upon it,
whilst in the other he held a staff carved into the shape of a long Serpent, its
eyes glowing a dark, menacing red.  Malon knew at once that this dark, evil
man must be the one known as Zelmryl, with whom he was destined to do battle.
<p>
But destined to defeat?  Malon did not know.  He believed that now, destiny
was in his own hands, to shape as he saw fit.  He drew his sword, and pointed down
towards the oncoming horde, shouting, "Guards!  Paladins!  Warriors!  Our
time to fight has come!  We see before us a Horde of such despicable evil
that even the Gods must shudder in loathing!  Let them feel our blade, and
with one great blow, be sent back to the ground from whence they came!"
<p>
The Guards gathered at the wall, looking meek compared to the great army
stil rushing up at them.  But from the blade of each Guard, a soft, blue
glow took shape, showing that they were blessed by some great force.  And Malon,
his own blade glowing brightly, stood at the head of the columns.
Minaires was beside him, his staff held forth, his spellbook at the ready,
preparing to cast his magicks.
<p>
Zelmryl did not so much as speak a word... floating above his Horde, he merely
pointed at the guards.  The beasts screamed, and charged forward.  Like
tidal waves from the ocean near which they fought, the two forces collided.
The Undead beasts fought as they had at the battle of Erudin so
many years ago; they fought untiringly, without care for personal safety.
And the Guards fought valiantly themselves, their enchanted blades sliding
easily through the rotting flesh as if it had been made of snow.  Slaying three in
each broad swipe, the Guards would cut down the many of the Horde, but then thrice as many
would crawl forward to take their place.  The undead creatures were absorbing heavy casualties, but
for every dozen that would be slain, a Guard would scream in agony
and fall.
<p>
Minaires fought beside Malon, bolts of lightning and balls of flame spewing
from his hands, burning the undead to cinders by the hundreds.  Zelmryl calmly observed
his army be decimated, and then his sharp, piercing, mocking
laugh cut throught he sounds of battle. 
<p>
"Ha ha ha!  Fools!  Godly weapons
do naught against my children!  Why do you kill that which will only be
reborn?"
<p>
Malon shouted in return, "You will not succeed, Dark One!  You will never
become one with the Gods!"
<p>
Zelmryl chuckled once more, cynically, his mouth parting slowly. "Say your prayers, Paladin, for you
shall soon serve me alongside those whom you know vanquish!" With that,
Zelmryl held out both staff and tome, chanting, "Come my minions,
rise for your Master!  Let your darkness shine!"
<p>
From the very ground upon which the Guards fought, hands thrust upwards.
Some grabbed the ankles of Guards, striking them with Fear, while yet others pulled
were followed by rising zombies who climbed upwards out of the ground, only to
immediately join in the melee.  By now, the Guards were taking heavy
losses, and even Malon was breathing heavily, still killing scores of creatures on every side.
After cleanly removing the head from an oncoming zombie, Malon turned to make his way towards
Zelmryl.
<p>
The Paladin saw Zelmryl hovering above the ground not far from where he stood.  Before the
Necromancer stood Minaires the Wizard.  The Necromancer sneered mockingly,
and then threw a bolt of lightning at the old Wizard.  Minaires neatly
dispelled the attack, and returned with a pillar of flame beneath Zelmryl.
The Necromancer screamed in apparent agony, but the shriek twisted into a
cackle, as the Dark One merely shook his head at Minaires.  Then, stepping
unscathed from the column of flame, Zelmryl lunged at Minaires.  Clasping him
by the throat with one free hand, he placed the head of his snake staff up
against the old Wizard's heart with the other, and spoke three arcane words.
Minaires gasped once, as the life drained from his body, and slumped to
the ground.
<p>
Zelmryl bestowed a cold gaze upon Minaires' twitching form, and then held forth his staff once more.
"Your pathetic soul is mine!", he hissed,  at which point Minaires felt the last of his
life drain from him and into the Necromancer.
<p>
Malon screamed in fury at the sight of his mentor and friend being murdered by
Zelmryl.  Brandishing his enchanted sword, Malon rushed towards the
Necromancer.  Turning lazily, Zelmryl caught a glance of Malon
rushing at him, and merely laughed in amusement, as he brought his staff up
to block Malon's strike.  Then, easily tripping Malon with the butt of his
staff, he stood triumphantly over the fallen Paladin.
<p>
The Necromancer bellowed his laughter and glared at Malon.  "Pitiful worm, you shall soon serve
me in eternal, walking death!"  The Necromancer brought his hand near to Malon's
heart, preparing to wrench his life from him.  Before he could speak the
necessary incantation, however, a blade of blue thrust through his left shoulder.  Gasping in surprise,
Zelmryl turned around, to see a weaponless guard--a man Malon recognized--gazing steadily upon him.  The Necromancer
cursed, and spoke a few words.  The sword blade sizzled, and then cracked,
turning into ashes to be carried away with the ocean wind.  His wound
healed, Zelmryl prepared to take the soul of the petulant warrior with a word and a touch, but stopped his actions as
he realized with horror that his Horde had dwindled to less than a hundred wraiths and
skeletons. The old Wizard and his student had distracted him.
<p>
Zelmryl's mind raced, trying to decide what step to take, but before he could speak
another word, he felt another blade pierce him, this time through the chest.
Spinning around, he saw Malon standing over him.  Zelmryl opened
his mouth as if to speak, but only blood came forth.
<p>
<i>'No!'</i>, Zelmryl
thought to himself, <i>'this shall not be my grave.  I have Miragul's infinite
powers, his knowledge, I must not die here!'</i>
<p>
Instead of speaking the words that would have dragged the Paladin to
death alongside the Necromancer, Zelmryl spoke a healing cantrip. His staff glowing, 
the sword crumbled from his chest, and Zelmryl's wound began to close. 
<p>
"I have not been vanquished, boy!" Zelmryl snarled, "I shall see the death of your children's children".
<p>
Hunching over, the Necromancer traced a circle into the sand beneath his feet as Malon reached for a blade concealed within his boot.
Immediately after the design had been sealed, the few remaining Undead stopped their
onslaught and began to sink back into the earth. Before Malon could strike with his dagger, Zelmryl began to fade, and then disappearred altogether.  The Sea,
which had parted for the Dead One's arrival, rolled back into its previous position
with a loud crash of water and surf.
<p>
The Paladin and his guards celebrated the day as a
victory, despite Zelmryl's dark omen of return.  As for the Necromancer
himself, he has yet to be heard of even to this very day.  Some say he returned to
Fad-el, and had resumed his plans to defeat the Crystalline Dragon.  Others insist that
he died of the Holy Wounds inflicted upon him, and joined his minions within
the grave. Whatever the speculation, the fate of this one remains a mystery.
<p>

<font color=000000 size=2>1/1/99</font>
<p>
Many know of Norrath's legends and mysteries, and also of the Powers of
Necromancy, and how they were formed.  History tells of a great Necromancer
named Miragul, who, before the great Erudite Civil War, created different
identities, and learned of all four Schools of Magic.  Miragul, so the
legends say, gathered three of his four identities during the war, and fled
to the Frigid Plains of the north, where he spent the remainder of his life
gathering vast amounts of knowledge and magical artifacts.  Miragul's life
ended when he transformed his body into that of a Liche, and accidentally
locked his soul away in a phylactery.  However, history is very vague as to
what happened to that fourth identity of Miragul's, the one he left behind
when he fled from Erudin.  All that the world has given us to explain what
happened to this identity is rumors and tales and legends, and one such
legend I shall relate to you
this evening...
<p>
The fourth identity of Miragul happened to be a Necromancer, a student of
the arts of Death and Life, who worked with the secret underground movement
of Erudites, before the Civil War.  Miragul and his other three identities
fled from Odus, but the fourth identity, named Zelmryl, stayed, and fought
in the battle with his fellow Necromancers.  Once the Necromancers
themselves fled, Zelmryl went with them, and aided in the building of the
dark city known as Paineel.  Zelmryl acted like the very minions he helped
the Necromancers to raise from the dead, for without Miragul's attention,
Zelmryl had no soul, no personality.
<p>
But that was not the case for all of time.  One day, Miragul came to Paineel, at the
last strands of his life, before he cast his final spells.  Zelmryl was
there to see his old master, but Miragul did not recognize his minion.  When
Miragul left, however, and cast his spell, things changed for Zelmryl.
Miragul got his soul caught in a magical artifact, and when that happened a
split, mirrored version of Miragul's soul entered the only body it had left,
the one it left behind so long ago: Zelmryl.  Zelmryl resisted, however, and
what occured was Miragul managing to enter Zelmryl, but Zelmryl had
control. Zelmryl then became a twisted version of the old Necromancer and acquired all of Miragul's knowledge and power, but left behind his overpowering ambition.
<p>
Zelmryl, now in full control and with a soul of his own, glanced for the first
time at his surroundings.  He saw his fellow Necromancers diligently raising
wraiths and zombies from the grave, preparing for their attack upon Erudin.
Zelmryl knew that these beings could be of grand use to him or his new
plans, and knew also that it would take him a lifetime to raise as much as the
group had risen in months.  So, under the cover of cooperation, Zelmryl
helped the others to raise the undead, all the while hiding his true power.
Then the day finally came.  The Necromancers, with an overwhelmingly large
horde of beasts, marched out of their hiding place on Southern Odus and
headed towards Erudin.
<p>
But things did not go as planned.  When the horde reached Erudin, the
Magicians, Wizards, and Enchanters of the magical city came out to fight
them.  It was grim for the Erudites, for the Undead fought with a ferocity
unlike any of the living mages.  But just as things looked completely
uncertain for the Erudites, Zelmryl unleashed his true power.  Rising above
the chaos of the battlefield down below, he spoke forbidden words that none
could understand.  And as he finished his chant, all of the Undead, in their
thousands, broke off their attack and fled east across the Island.  Zelmryl
had siezed sole control of all of the Undead!  The Necromancers were
furious, and would have engaged Zelmryl themselves, but the Erudites, seeing
their chance, rushed at the Necromancers.  Hence they broke up, disbanded, and
spread to the four winds.
<p>
Zelmryl, along with his newly-acquired Horde, traveled east over Odus, until
they came to the Sea.  There, the Great Necromancer spread his hands, and
the very sea itself parted, giving a trail down to the depths of the ocean
floor.  For Miragul, in his many years of searching the lands of Norrath for
artifacts and power, had discovered an ancient fortress, totally magical in
nature, beneath the very Ocean.  Miragul had intended to raise the fortress
from the ocean floor and place it upon the Frozen Plains of the north, but
did not live long enough to acquire the power to perform such a feat.  Now
Zelmryl knew he needed a safe haven; a base to house his Horde and prepare
to launch his full attack.  Thus, he parted the sea, and led his horde down
to the Underwater Fortress, Fad-el.
<p>
Zelmryl spent many years in Fad-el.  The magicks of the Fortress kept back
the mighty ocean, and allowed his horde to wait peacably, even as Zelmryl
alternated his years between raising more Undead minions and searching the world, all the while acquiring more and more power.
Zelmryl's plan was fairly simple.  He intended, when the time was right, to
raid Miragul's old home in the Frozen Plains and steal his artifacts.  And
from there, he would seek out Brell's Portal, the mystical entryway which
allowed one to enter the very realm of the Gods.  Zelmryl would defeat
Veeshan, the great Crystalline Dragon, and rule on high as the greatest of
the Gods.  He had already made pacts with Bristlebane, the King of Thieves,
and Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate, both of whom had promised to give him
their aid and loyalty, should he truly enter Brell's Portal and offer his
challenge to the Crystalline Dragon.
<p>
But Zelmryl was not without his adversary.  A great Erudite Wizard named
Minaires had learned of Fad-el through an ancient tome, and had sought out
the City beneath the Waves whilst Zelmryl was away, searching throughout
Norrath.  When Minaires reached Fad-el, he discovered, to his horror,
the great Horde of Undead as spoken of in Erudite legend, and had immediately
rushed back to consult the Council.  After much discussioin, the Council
deemed that they would use their magicks to bless a child, and create a Paladin of
such holy power that could defeat Zelmryl and his dark Horde.
<p>
So Minaires searched, and looked, and soon found a child, Malon, born of a
Holy Paladin.  Minaires convinced the father that the lands were in grave
danger and that young Malon was needed if the world were to be saved.  The Holy
Knight gave his consent to the Wizard, and Minaires took the child back with
him to the Council.  There, Minaires, along with the most powerful Enchanter
and Magician, combined their magicks to create a powerful blessing, which they bestowed upon
Malon.
<p>
Years passed after that.  Zelmryl knew of the Erudite's plot to stop him, as
his Undead told him of Minaires' coming to Fad-el so long ago.  He did not
try to stop Malon, however, for he anticipated, and even welcomed, their
plot to bless the child.  For when the child grew, and came to face him, he
intended to kill Malon, and then raise him from the grave.  The Blessing
that the foolish council had put on him would remain, but would be twisted
by Zelmryl's necromantic powers, and the result would be a Shadow Knight of
awsome powers, rivaling even Zelmryl's, but completely loyal to him.  Thus
he planned to twist the council's plan to stop him into a grand advantage.
And once Malon was on his side, none would have the slightest chance of
thwarting his plan.
