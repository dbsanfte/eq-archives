<p><a name=6><b>Journal Entry - 000411 - 10:19am</b></a>

<p>Okay, let's get this show over with.

<p>As you all probably know, I'm back in EQ again.

<p>UO was great. For a while =). It's true I found a lot of my old german friends there this time, but they were more involved in their PvP guild. I've always been a sucker at PvP (the adrenaline rush seems to paralyze me instead of aiding me), but decided that this time I would give it a shot (mind you, PvP, not PKing).

<p>Of course, the bane of UO is the amount of macroing you need to do before you can survive in battle, especially when your opponents are all grandmaster mages or maxxed out dex monkeys. So I did a little calculation on how long it would take me to become somewhat good in skills. I came to the conclusion that if I played my 12 hours a week I would be like, adequate for combat the next fall or something. Ehrmm... =).

<p>While I was doing all this macroing I spent most of my time in the stratics irc chat channel #Atriarch. I actually had great fun discussing things with the nice people there, and I still do. However, as always when there is a new game in town (or one being developed) you see this perfect world that you wish for, and everything will be soooo great. Well... I've since stepped out of that illusion and come up with a couple of conclusions:

<p>Atriarch will most likely have a similar combat engine as EverQuest. Ie, hordes of hps, little defense, small weapon damage (and not many buttons to press). I made a post about this, comparing Swedish RPGs (yes Soma, I had to mention it =)) with American. I wont go into detail explaining the differences just say that they are reversed to each other. In Swedish RPGs one hit kills are very likely, but since blows are lethal you actually parry and dodge every time a blow is aimed at you, instead of having a skill called parry that procs every once in a while =). I sent a detailed email to Serafina (Atriarch's equivalent of Brad) about these things, and the reply I got was that it looked "complicated". Oh well, at least I gave it a try =).

<p>Atriarch will also have a similar tell command as EverQuest, I'm not sure if they'll add /oocs and /shouts though. Thus, with this, Atriarch will also become a great chatfest where puritan roleplayers will scream in vain as the socializers will conquer yet another MMORPG =). Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything directly against chatters/socializers, it's just that for once I would actually want to experience a MMORPG where everyone roleplays. But of course, until someone comes up with a code where you are given experience based on your roleplaying skill, this will never happen.

<p>One thing that could prove to be good about Atriarch though would be the statement that Serafina made that Atriarch will not revolve around combat *gasp!*. Hey, if that's so we might not need a game engine that respawns mobs in order to prevent their extinction because of the masses of adventurers that reside in the game. Imagine that EQ movie... it's not just one group doing combat in a world where everyone else is a peasant.. but there are 10 adventurers on each peasant... fun world =).

<p>What Atriarch will be revolving around are empires. You'll actually be able to build your own house (in lego-style!), town and empire! And it has been told to be a dynamic world. Imagine that, with a Freeport that is actually overtakeable (a couple of dark elves and trolls/ogres that rush forward and kill every freeport guard on the racewar server is not my definition of conquering =)). Battles will be fought over resources, raids will be performed on important trade routes etc... Well well... IMAGINE THAT; there'll be a reason to fight, others than for accumulating platinum pieces and rusty swords =).

<p>Hmm... wait a minute... I was supposed to list all the negative things about Atriarch here... seems I still have great hope in this game... *shrug*.. ah well =).

<p>Interesting tradeskills will diminish the huge masses of warriors in this game, but I'm not sure about that. The tradeskills are much like the ones in UO and EQ, where everything is determined by skill. You'll be able to produce most items in one area even with a low skill, but the better skill the better the quality will be. I would have wanted something more EQ like though, where you actually have to research stuff (having alchemy in mind). Wouldn't it be fun to read books about plantbreeding and dna recombination (sp?) and try for yourself until you've discovered something you're pleased with instead of saying "Oh yeah, I'm an adept plantbreeder.. now I can make those High Quality fungus spore bombs!"?

<p>But enough about Atriarch, only god knows when it will reach the stores. Right now they're preparing it for a closed alpha of it. Even the beta will be off limits to the public.

<p>Anyway, I still haven't really explained why I'm back in EQ, others than saying that I quit UO. I'll give it another try.

<p>Once I decided to cancel my account on the 23rd of December I was shortly thereafter informed that bandwidth technology (a.k.a. flatrate for me) would come to tinytown! And here I am cancelling EQ because I'm sick of the stress and frustration it gives me. Much thanks to the constant fee that I have to pay - just to play.

<p>Another thing that came into consideration was/is that I'm no longer in school. This fungi infection of mine has probably derived from my time spent there working with this school project. I just have to open the door to the school now and I'll get excessive tear production in my eyes. With no school around, EQ can't do much harm by taking up a little of that time that I should have spent working with homework, which are non existant at this point.

<p>The bad part is that the recovery from this could take a very very long time. I'm not sure about the exact number, but I wouldn't be surprised if I'm still feeling sick in a year from now =\.

<p>And that brings me to the very sad part of this entry.

<p>I am forced to quit working on this journal.

<p>This fungi infection affects the brain and I am suffering from both concentration and memory problems. I can no longer sleep off any tiredness, so I'm pretty much drowsy all day long as well. With that, concentration peeks are few and far between nowadays. This is actually the second time I am writing this last entry as the previous one was written when I wasn't really feeling ok. Trust me, you don't want to read that garbage I composed =).

<p>Of course, there is a slim chance that I'll come back in a couple of months if I'm already feeling better. Miracles are bound to happen, right?

<p>For now I'll just enjoy EQ for what it is, and not for what it could of have become. I guess I'll be sticking with Atherion as well. I did try to play a halfling cleric but I got tired of him at around level 9, so now it's Atherion all the way. Hopefully I will be getting to lvl 29 where I'll get my new DD and heal (wooh!). And of course, I can sit to med at 35.. I must get there. However, playing a Warrior seems like fun as well.... hmm.. we'll see =).

<p>I'm not sure as of yet if I'll drop the site entirely, or keep updating the screenshots section and keep adding stories. I haven't the slightest idea on how popular the screenshots area is for example. If you, by any chance, would like me to keep adding screenshots then drop me a line. I just added a couple of funny ones when I decided to take the boat for once. Of course, there was a gnaked gnome race to Everfrost at the time so I had to share it with 22 gnomes or so. Horrid experience I say, no wonder they raised the age limit to 13 for playing online games... hehe.

<p>Before I drop the pencil I would like to take this moment and thank the following people who helped me in one way or the other in making this journal and making sure that EQ has been a fun experience and keeping it like that:

<center>

<p>[In no particular order whatsoever.. ok.. it might be chronological in order of appearance, but don't quote me on that.]

<p><b>Den and the Stratics Network</b>
<br>I thank Den for taking interest in my site. Without him I do not think that I would have gotten as many readers as I have. Thank you, and everyone else who is a part of the Stratics Network.

<p><b>Beldin (Gual The DragonSlayer)</b>
<br>For being a good friend since the Daggerfall days and telling me about his adventures in EverQuest, thus inspiring me to buy it. He was also the one who first introduced me to IRC (back in 95 I believe?) and showed me how huge my phone bills could be =).

<p><b>Gram (Lamron EbYhw)</b>
<br>The author of gramsplace.com. For giving me a joyful experience reading his work about Ultima Online and inspiring me to start my own equivalent for EverQuest. Another thanks goes to him for meeting him ingame, touring me around in the thicket as well as giving me an armor piece or two along with a couple of boxes (a small treasure for a newbie).

<p><b>Soma</b>
<br>Another very good friend of mine (also from Daggerfall) who kept me company through my many hours of meditating and making sure that the Evil Eye camp was a very hillarious experience =). He also took me out of the Greater Faydark and escorted me to Rivervale, a journey I will never forget. Unfortunately you decided to take priority to real life instead of EverQuest... so now I'll stop sweettalking you =). I'll see you in Atriarch though.

<p><b>All of my old Daggerfall friends</b>
<br>Arcade, Balinor, Beldin, Berserker, Camber, Fairus, Jason_Els, Ka'Non, Languard, Rhionmist, Simeron, Soma, Sorrowind, Unicron and everyone else I can't remember right now. It's been such a long time but I still love you all =).

<p><b>Chalise</b>
<br>For introducing me to what combat was like and how it worked in EverQuest. She's also a good friend of mine.

<p><b>Darelduin</b>
<br>For giving a complete stranger (who happened to be me =)) 1pp and some patchwork armor, giving me a little head start. Later I found out that he was a fellow Swede. It's a small world we live in, hehe.

<p><b>Teron (Xaanin, Derin, and many other names =))</b>
<br>For being a very good friend ever since I came across him at the Britain West Bank of Catskills in UO. This guy has helped me a lot in both EQ and UO, and I enjoy discussing real life matters with him as we're both from Sweden (which is another plus I guess =)).

<p><b>Aiin</b>
<br>This guy has been so generous to me giving me teleports, great discounts on items (some even for free) and helping me out in an allround style that I fear the day I will get my own flatrate as I've promised him to make up for everything he has done for me =). He was one of the few higher level people before summer that treated me with respect even though I didn't know him. Why he did/'still is' remains a mystery =).

<p><b>Kalo</b>
<br>For giving me that teleport back to Greater Faydark in the early days. Haven't spoken to him much, but that teleport meant a lot to me. Another high level person who didn't mind helping a struggling newbie.

<p><b>Newf and Nexxis</b>
<br>For being my favourite two wood elves =). Two awesome friends who've helped me more than I can remember. If I would sit down and scan my memory for all the things that they've done for me I could probably fill out a page, but I hope they won't get angry with me for leaving it just like this =).

<p><b>Sephy</b>
<br>For being a fun guy who made the orc camp in misty a very fun experience. I would also like to thank him for making me go almost KOS to kelethin because of his puny powers he showed when I duelled him =P. Just kidding, you're a great friend Sephy =).

<p><b>Yilbiku</b>
<br>For being the first person ever to accuse me for kill stealing (when I had actually done it thanks to a bug =)). Thankfully we sorted it out and she has now become a very good friend of mine.

<p><b>Wintereyes (Panyck) and the late Obsidian Circle (guild).</b>
<br>Atherion's first guild. I thank Wintereyes for asking me to join it and for being a good friend. I would also like to thank everyone who were a part of the Obsidian Circle. I never got to know you all that well but it was a nice guild.

<p><b>Balkoff</b>
<br>For being a good friend and a humorous dwarf that appreciates a laugh or two =). Funny thing is that when I first met him I was working on my roleplaying traits, including the one that Atherion didn't like dwarves. Good thing I scrapped it, as Balkoff is just such a friendly guy. In a perfect roleplaying world were we'd just looked upon each characters we would never have become friends, so I must agree that a socializer's world can be good, to some extent.

<p><b>Jeni</b>
<br>This Wood Elf proved to be very useful when I was fighting griffawns in East Karana. She often had that last ignite to spare when I was all out of mana. Since then she has been my friend, and proved to be a very good one. Unfortunately she is one heck of a leveler so I haven't been able to play with her much. Even though her character was deleted at around level 19 she has still been able to race all the way to level 50 by now. Geez =).

<p><b>Slippeth</b>
<br>For being a good friend and for sharing his ideas on numerous quests. Some day we will solve the WHOLE High Keep Battlestaff quest =). Once we've done that we'll keep it under a lid, farm the light sabres of all wis casters, sell them on ebay and become economically independent for the rest of our lives. Once we've accomplished that we finance our own MMORPG and take over the entire market putting an end to Verant's success. Now there's a thought. Just kidding!!! =).

<p><b>Black Company (guild).</b>
<br>For being a funny and friendly bunch of people, and letting me join the guild. You know who you are =).

<p><b>Tyrell, Silvok and K'ardi Drasad (guild)</b>
<br>I would like to thank all of you in K'ardi Drasad for letting me join your ranks. Special thanks goes to Tyrell for being a very nice person and Silvok for giving me the honour of wearing his old shabby bone leggings =).

<p><b>Citgo and Rikarnak</b>
<br>Without these guys I had never gotten that Crown of Leaves that later resulted in me getting a Chipped Bone Bracelet. I gave Citgo a polished bone bracer, but I still feel like I owe these guys.

<p><b>Remelio</b>
<br>For being a good friend (how many times have I begun a sentence with that now? =)) and helping me out with the journal. Keep those stories coming, please =).

<p><b>Alan, the Norwegian guy =)</b>
<br>For just being a fun guy who've kept contact with me through emails giving me hints, support and whatever =).

<p><b>All of my readers.</b>
<br>And last, but not least, I would like to thank all of my readers who have taken joy in reading the journal. Thank you all, and I hope I've entertained most of you through my writings (which lasted a whole year... phew).

</center>

<p>Well, I guess that's it then. I hope I didn't forget anyone, if so I apologize for my short memory.

<p>Anyway, a last thank for all the support. I'll see some of you ingame. Do not hesitate to throw me a "hi", it's always nice to hear what the readers have to say about the work I have done.

<p>[Note: There seem to be some confusion about which server I play on, so to set things straight: I play on Tarew Marr. So there, any other Atherion Calaquendis out there are frauds that should be sent straight to the cluthes of Veeshan =).]

<p>Until the better days, consider this journal closed.

<p>Farewell for now.

<p><a name=5><b>Journal Entry - 000126 - 2:37pm</b></a>

<p>Phew... been a long time.

<p>Just got home from a surgery gone bad, so don't expect one of those huge entries. I dunno if that's good or bad :).

<p>Anyway, bad news; I have officially quit playing EverQuest. Yes, now it's a fact :). My account was deactivated on December 23rd and has remained so. My subscription has always been the 3 month plan though, and the last time they billed me was in November. So, with that I guess I still got some time in there before I get completely shut down. I won't enter Norrath though.

<p>The first days were great, as you all know. I was able to get a black pearl and even a Bark Shield off of that little Halfling Synger Foxfyre. After a week or two though the frustration came creeping in again and for my own sanity, I've decided to stop playing EverQuest.

<p>I could go on and on about the reasons why, and as much as you would like me to post them, I won't. At least not right now. I'm too tired for that :). Let me just ask you one question; What is the purpose of getting to level x, and then going for level y?.

<p>Think about it, and if you happen to come around with the answer please do not hesitate to drop me a line.

<p>As for now, I will be playing Ultima Online. I happened to come across a lot of my old German friends and my language skill is booming :). At the same time, I am able to surf the net and hold IRC conversations, talking to my friends and hanging around on the stratics server, talking about the very anticipated online game, Atriarch.

<p>More on that later in another entry.

<p><a name=4><b>Journal Entry - 991214 - 4:27pm</b></a>

<p>Things are going terrificly well in EverQuest and I'm starting to enjoy it as much as I did when I had first bought it. 

<p>The only thing that directly bugs me in-game would be the consistent packet loss and connection-dropouts that make life in Norrath a lot harder. It's funny that Verant claims these things to be strictly internetial issues (which they can't do nothing about) when I've never experienced these problems with UO, nor AC (and that was during beta). Lag is pretty accepted by most, but consistent connection drops (which only has to do with EverQuest) is nothing you would like to experience on an hourly basis.

<p>Others than that it has been great. Atherion has been spending time, killing both Avocets (which gave me a black pearl... yay, golden black pearl choker! (7agi/7dex))... and Cyclops. Let me tell you... it's quite the experience being a puller for a 30+ party just because you know how to track :). Fortunately, it turned out to be pretty nice as I, somehow, were able to both crud and snare those big thingies. We even considered taking down Hill Giants, but at that time I had other things to do. Afterall, I originally went to Rathe Mountains for just one thing... Cynthia's pet.

<p>Yes, thats right! I found out about this little sweet spawn on one of the shaman boards (by accident I might add, clicking on the wrong message :)), and let me tell you it was a blast... hehe. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this spawn then let me tell you that near the Gypsy camp in Rathe Mountains there is an enchanter. The nice thing with this enchanter is that she keeps summoning a pet... a pet which wanders off... just to be attacked by a bunch of opportunistic people who knows nothing better than to watch EQ boards in search of quick, easy, kills ;).

<p>I was able to get into a group during one of the nights and it was _the_ place to get some of that juicy orange stuff. There were two other druids in the group than myself, and that pet went down outrageously fast when we were all casting dismiss summon (140dmg, occasionaly resisted half the damage). Even though I was in a group with one or two red members I made up to one bubble every 20-30 minutes!

<p>It became pretty boring in the long run though. There was nothing wrong with the spawn time, but the mob itself made it utterly boring. What do you say about just pressing two buttons to get this mob down? Sounds fun doesn't it? 1 for assist, 2 for dismiss summoned... rinse and repeat ;).

<p>The 'fun' came to an end though, as we accidentally pulled Cynthia as well during one spawn. She quickly charmed two of us. She wasn't mad at the rest of the party though, so we just stood there while two of our members went for the zone. No one had died, but there was just one problem with that. Cynthia were no longer convenientally placed in the gypsy camp, and with that, the pet was not wandering off.

<p>Since it would probably take a while before she would decide to walk back I went up the hill and camped.

<p>Anyway, the next day I returned (when I was hunting cyclops with the higher level party) Cynthia had either been removed or wandered off to nowhere. I'm actually hoping for number one since beating on that pet was very unfair to those others who had not heard about this or those who could not find room in a group. I do however feel like Verant should learn something about this 'mishap' though, and that is that mobs should spawn quicker and give less experience all while the downtime of all players should be lowered as well. It's much funnier doing more 'constant' fighting than hitting one big thing for good experience just to sit down and med for 5 minutes or so.

<p>Back in South Karana I was given more and more information about the new implementations of paw. If they all hold true, Verant is surely doing something right.

<p>First of all, new items have started to drop... better items than before, such as the new paw gloves which are just like the old snakeskin gloves with just one exception, and that is a +2wis bonus. I tried buying a pair for 30pp, but unforunately they are pretty rare right now so I was overbid by about 200pp ;). If you thought that was much I've heard rumours of them going for over 1800pp! That alone shows how screwed up the economy system really is.

<p>Second of all, when asking people who dropped these precious gloves, word has gone that they are a random drop! RANDOM! Say it with me... R-A-N-D-O-M! If this holds true there wont be any specifc mob camping in Paw... woohoo! Could this possibly be true?

<p>This brings me to another point, and that is that dungeons should have a list of specific items that would all be random drops on ALL of the inhabitants of that dungeon. Of course, this could lead to people just going for the lowest leveled creatures in the dungeon. My suggestion to that would be to decrease the level range of mobs in a dungeon. As we have it now, some dungeons are 30+ (up to 50), which is bad in my opinion. What I would like to see would be more dungeons with low level ranges. Imagine having a dungeon with mobs of the specific levels of 20-25. You'd then have a fair balance between the mobs and instead of people going for the juicer stuff (those who drops specific items) downstairs you'd see them killing stuff all around the place. Of course this would lead to a lot of people just pulling from the entrance, but this is all about dungeon design. Just design it so it's safer to stand around in a group than having a puller doing all the work.

<p>I don't know if this would worsen or ease the problems with trains though. You wouldn't have some high level group fighting meanies in the basement just to take them up to the surface if things would go wrong. However, if people would need to fight themselves in and out of dungeons it would might be better to just make a run for it, taking everything with you to the entrance...

<p>I'm up for discussion on this though, and it would be nice to see your thoughts on this.

<p>The random drops could also be tuned so that when a player has gone through the supportive levels (in this case beeing 19-27?) you'd have gotten most of the items that dropped in that specific dungeon. This would decrease camping, and to hold off any farming players you'd just make items non-appealing to the higher levels. Farming in higher level dungeons would be hard since every mob there would be difficult to handle on your own. A person would not be able to go from mob to mob without having to rest up a for quite a bit of that person decides to solo...?

<p>Anyway, the random drops in paw (if they are random) is a great enhancement to the game as a whole.

<p>Speaking of paws, I've been trying hard and long now to get my hands on my own Paw Of Opolla. As I haven't had the ability to camp Mitty for the gold ring, I have created theories on my own. I believe that there has to be another place where the gold ring spawns. It has been known that Mitty's primary drop is the copper ring and that the gold is just a secondary drop. If Verant has not done this on purpose (to hold off the numbers of Paws on one server) I believe we are yet to find the 'true' gold ring. It's quite a long shot though.

<p>Since most people (99.9%?) have gotten their severed paw from Vin Moltor by killing him, I believed that we could have missed something. What if the gold ring spawned on one of the vendors in Qyenos as soon as one gave Vin that pie and three bottles of Kalish (which is the second way of getting the severed paw)?

<p>It makes sense in someway as Vin mentions that his father probably 'sold' them (sold... as in not from Mitty, not from Gynok and not from the Blackburrow pond)... There is yet a ring to turn up from a vendor and my thoughts are that the gold ring does indeed originate from a merchant.

<p>I tried this theory as late as last night, with no success. The Lion Mane tavern in south Qyenos was my biggest hope (as there have been reports of people finding rings in there), but there was no sign of a ring during the whole time my friend, Jeni, was down in the sewers speaking to Vin Moltor, treating him with some of the best pies and kalish man had ever seen ;).

<p>We gave up on the Lion Mane tavern and quickly made our way through both north and south Qyenos. One place which would seem logical to suggest a spawn would be the jeweler's shop in North Qyenos, but it was as empty as the tavern when it came to gold rings.

<p>As we had searched through most of the shops and stores of Qyenos I now believe that IF there is a gold ring spawning it is probably in Erudin or in Freeport. Erudin is pretty empty of players, so a gold ring could spawn there without being noticed by people. Freeport is a longshot, but there have been claims of people finding rings there as well. The rings in Freeport could, however, be secondary rings dropped from Gynok.

<p>Try it yourself if you want to. I refuse to find it acceptable that you must camp Mitty in order to get the gold ring!

<p>Since we're discussing quests here I might share my story on another one:

<p>The High Guard Battlestaff quest, or more commonly known as the High Keep staff segments quest.

<p>This information was taken from Allakazam's Magical Realm:

<blockquote>-- INFO BEGIN --
<br>High Guard Battlestaff:  After you finish the Peacekeeper Staff quest in Erudin, Lumi will comment that you are ready for more advanced duties, she says "We have heard that there is a person in the mountain keep called High Hold who is hiring mercenaries to attempt to obtain a High Guard Battlestaff.  We are missing one of our staffs and believe this person has it.  Go to Highpass High Hold and find this person and return the High Guard Battle Staff to me."  

<p>She is supposed to give you a container to put the staff pieces in, but I have been told she does not do it, so this may be broken.  Go to Highkeep and talk to the banker.  She says she will clear out old strongbox accounts if given the key. The key is gained from an npc named Tallus Holton, who is located in East Karana.  Attacking him also draws his bandit cronies so I suggest a team approach or a level 25 to 30 individual.   If you kill him, you get a staff segment (a lore item) and a Highkeep Strongbox Key.  Give the banker  the key and she gives you a few gold,a little experience and a faction adjustment plus one more staff segment.  Combine them in the box and return them to Lumi to get a High Guard Battlestaff (Not sure of the stats, but I think they are Eru Pal Cler only,  5/33, +10 char) 
<br>-- INFO END -
</blockquote>

<p>Now, we may have two possible ends to this quest. One being the one above (still a bit vauge on how to get that box tho), or that it continues beyond that once you've gotten the staff.

<p>First of all, let's look at some basics. At some point/somewhere you should get hold of a name to one of these mercenaries. Maybe it works with just asking Lumi "what mercenary/ies?". Anyway, Brollus Hoorst (sp?) is the person you are looking for, and he is located in one of the huts in Kithicor, near the border to West Commonlands. If you ask him about the staff he will tell you that he and his friend, Tallus Holton, were hired by someone to get this staff as it's supposed to be a present for Carson McCabes. Obviously, he is a weapon collector.

<p>That's (probably) how you get hold of the name of Tallus Holton, and now you have a bit more background story than you had if you just killed Tallus and asked "What does this staff segment do?".

<p>Well, now the problem comes in. You got the staff segment and you get the other segment by returning the key to the banker of High Keep, we all know that. Problem is, how do you combine them into a staff?  And what kind of staff do you get?

<p>My thought is that you combine them, somehow, get a cracked Battlestaff or whatever and then when you return it to the quest giver you get the final staff of this quest, which is the High Guard Battlestaff.

<p>I do have a couple of other thoughts regarding this quest though.

<p>Those are that there are still people around who wants the 'final' piece of this quest, being the Battlestaff. Since the guards of Erudin are using the exact same staffs you can skip the whole, known, quest to try these thoughts of mine. Of course you'll be getting some nasty Erudin factions in order to obtain this staff, so gather your best evil friends and let the bashing begin.

<p>It's a hard task though, getting the staff... From what I have heard from Soma (who, unfortunately, decided to leave EverQuest. I miss you buddy!) they're pretty hard to kill. They're around 30ish level, but, of course, they can use a lot of Lay Hands on themselves (more than one every 1.5 hours.. go figure). It could probably be done in a small group though.

<p>Since the battlestaff is lore you can only keep one at the time, so keep a druid or wizard to travel between High Keep and Tox Forest. I'm saying this because those people who wants this staff are located High Keep. As Brollus Hoorst indicated, they were hired by someone to steal a High Guard Battlestaff from one of the High Guards of Erudin, and was to be given as a gift to Carson McCabes.

<p>So, what would happen if one would take the staffs and give them to the following people:

<p>1. Carson McCabes
<br>2. Lady McCabes
<br>3. Mistress Anna
<br>4. Princess Lenya

<p>Carson is a no brainer, but since it was someone else who hired the mercenaries I'm thinking that it's more likely it's either Lady McCabes or Mistress Anna. Princess Lenya is a longshot, but she's involved in a couple of quests there...

<p>If this would work I'm placing my bid on Lady McCabes. She reacts to the words "what staff", and if you ask her "are you sure?" she will mention something about "he who dares, wins"... or something similar. I'm thinking you play your way through the casino boards, gain her trust, and be given this quest to return a High Guard battle staff to her? If so, all it would take would be to give her the staff and it would trigger even though you wouldn't have done it from 'scratch'.

<p>Anyone else have any info on this?

<p>Another thought of mine would be to do the same thing with the Paw Of Opolla, that is giving the Paw to Caninel in West Karana. After all, he is in search of it, but then again... I doubt there'd be anyone risking their paw for a raw-hide tunic or something similar ;).

<p>I will be posting my thoughts on both these quests at the Druid's Grove in hope that someone will help me solve them. Please feel free to email me with any additional information that you might have.

<p>While we are still talking about quests... let's have another go with the class specific armor.

<p>[Note: I don't know if I've discussed the things below, I can't remember nor find the journal entry where I have done so. So, if this contradicts any of my earlier thoughts then don't bother pointing that out. These are the thoughts I have now, and these are the ones that count. Thank you for your consideration ;).].

<p>As most people have found out is that in order to get these items you'll be doing a lot of camping! Most people, including myself, thought that this new armor were to rid the heavy camping of the rubicite, not to spread it out all over the world.

<p>Shamans have it bad where they'll have to kill the glacier bear which is a very rare spawn (so rare people just log out there characters in the cave and wait for a server reset to make it pop again), not to mention Grizzleknot, in order to get their totemic parts. Clerics have it bad as well, and as you all probably know they made a demonstration on Fennin Ro (go Clerics!!!).

<p>Verant is probably looking over this right now, but I don't think they know how to address it. Personally, I think that the level of a mob should decide whether you will be able to get an item, in this case being armor, or not. As it is right now, pure luck determines your chances of getting that and that armor piece. It's right down stupid, and it's so unfair to the players. Here you'll have Bob camping a spawn for hours just to see Bill happening upon a spawn and get the item imediately (just take the Paw Of Opolla quest as a VERY good example).

<p>This is probably to reduce the amount of each item on a server, but that serves no real purpose, does it? What's wrong with having all, let's say, Shamans above 30+ wearing totemic armor? Sure, all 30+ people were not wearing rubicite before the patch, but I believe that all Shamans (or any other class for that matter) should have an equal chance of getting an item, and having rare spawns with strange randomizers does not lead to equality (the person with the most luck/time gets the item). Sure, we're all playing by the same rules, but people who can play more than the average player should not have an upper hand against those who can't. And, seriously, no one should need to camp something for more than 30 minutes to get what they are looking for. Right now it's like if I can't load off a good 8 hour haul of EverQuesting I'll never get to see any of that armor.

<p>I'd like to see parts which are required for these armor quests to drop EVERY time, but make it so that you will have to kill 30+ mobs, or whatever, in order to get these items (and perhaps make it so that you'll have to work on your class specific abilites where you can do so... i.e druids/rangers would have to track wandering mobs for their pieces and enchanters would have to get in and get out of nasty places using their illusions). Make them no drop (both the items and the final armor) to hinder twinks. Better yet, make the armor no drop and have a level barrier on the quest itself. If you're below level X then sorry, you can't do the quest.

<p>This will prevent level 11 players wearing full suits of great armor and at the same time decreasing the time needed to camp a mob. Also, keep the items needed on mobs that are common, and not named ones (waves to Grizzleknot).

<p>If all items are easily accessable at a given level and lore/no drop you will be forcing everyone to do their own armor quest, and that is how it is supposed to be done in my opinion. The bottom line is that I feel that items should be made more accessible, but at the same time, be more levelrestricted. All druids should not be wearing mammoth cloaks, but (almost) all druids at level x and above should. I'd rather see a "Get in and get out" system than having some player with all the time (and money) in the world, camping 'rare' items for long hours.

<p>You could even make them all quests. Instead of camping Goonda for those Chipped Bone Bracers have a druid or something asking for his head (which he would always drop). Then once you've given him the head he will ask you to take this item x to give to person y. Problem would be that person y would be at a remote (or dangerous) place where you would have to use your class specifc abilites to get to that person. Of course, with the different classes we have (and the ability they possess) there would have to be some hard thinking for the quest division in order to make these quests as nice as possible for each and everyone one.

<p>Feel free to comment me on any of the above, it would be interesting to see what you readers think about this as well.

<p>Anyway, let's leave that for now and instead look at what Brad said about the Guise of the Deceiver and the Patch message as a whole.

<p>Information taken from EQSS newstand:

<blockquote>Brad on Mask of the Deceiver 
<br>Community News [ 11:52 PM PST ] - Alethal

<p>Ok, let's talk about Guide of the Deceiver 

<p>The failure to communicate here actually is that we've not been clear WHAT kind of information we should be communicating via patch messages.

<p>It is indeed our intent to become much better at writing patch messages and including more detail.

<p>It is NOT our intent to document changes to specific NPCs and item spawns, nor quests. We might say something like "quests in this area have been improved" but we're not going to say "quest x now gives you y experience and a z instead of the previous item."

<p>The fact that new NPCs will appear and old ones dissappear, and the fact that items will change will typically NOT be documented. 

<p>There is a fine line here, and you will get more information from us, but the patch message is not going to turn into EQ'Lizer 

<p>Also, changing a treasure table is NOT punishing people. The game changes. Treasure changes. You can never expect it to be the same. There are many powerful items in the game now that were not available earlier -- is that 'punishing' players who started playing EQ earlier? 

<p>The 'punishment' rationale is simply incompatible with this genre of game.

<p>-Brad
</blockquote>

<p>My first reaction to this was WHY are you so secretive with everything? Sure, we don't need full details of quests in the patch message but you could at least add a "quest x now no longer gives you the z item, it has been removed from the game" note so we know what's going on. You told us when Rubicite stopped spawning, why not do the same with the rest of the items that disappear from the game?

<p>I also believe that you should document some changes you make to NPCs. For example, it's not fun realizing, mid-fight, that Nagafen has gotten a beefy update on the coding so it regenerates in just a couple of seconds if left alone for a while. This was not the case the first time Nagafen was slayed, it was upped just because it seemed too easy to slay this dragon. I perfectly understand that, but the coding had nothing to do with the actual 'game', it was just an update of the previous coding, and it should have been listed!

<p>Btw, changing a treasure table is INDEED punishing people. Sure, the game changes, but change it in a decent way. This change of the Guise of the Deceiver is terrible! At first when I heard about it the only change that had seem to be made was that you now had to equip the mask in order to work. I was furious by this, because now the people who had gotten the old guise had an advantage over those new seeking this mask. They did not have to wear it in order to activate it. Now, if that wasn't enough, the new guise is now Bard/Rogue ONLY!?

<p>Brad, you're doing the exact opposite! You're punishing those people who started to play EverQuest at a later point!

<p>Sure, I understand that the item was originally supposed to be Bard/Rogue only, but why did you not do that from the start? In a game such as EverQuest you should not alter existing items once they have been implemented into the game, you should not change the items that has dropped nor those who will drop. Changing items that has dropped is, obviously, not a good idea, since people have spent a lot of time and effort camping (usually) for these items, so you would get a lot of people upset if they realized that their, for example, Paw Of Opolla did not give them that 9ac 9wis 9agi 5sta -5cha anymore, but instead a mere +15 mana bonus. Nor should you change (or replace with a similar item) an item after it has been implemented. People would go, and are, furious because of this. Imagine those new questers for the Paw Of Opolla wanting that same paw as those high level people have (with the old stats) just to realize that the _new_ paw is now a mere +15 mana bonus. I ask you, how fair is that?

<p>It's like endorsing people to go out and powerlevel. Those who did and were able to get 'their' Guise 'in time' are okay, while the rest of us have been smoked, bigtime.

<p>And let's go back to the patch message. In one of the latest patch updates there was a note that a number of spears were now available to the Shaman class. Would it have been too much to list some of these spears, such as saying that they can now use the ordinary line of Spears (Spears.. FS... Combined...)?

<p>On a similar notice, would it have been too much to tell the players what the druid tracking peaked at before, when it was changed, and how much it was changed for?

<p>Lastly, is there a reason why we can see how many hitpoints we have in numbers but why we can't see how much mana we have (others than looking at that blue meter)?

<p>Phew... talked about a little bit of everything today. I'll spare your eyes from total dehydration by ending this journal entry here. Now I just have to figure out a way to get the attention of the coding crew. We need that inspection key! (Second time I've died now because of it).

<p><a name=3><b>Journal Entry - 991211 - 11:54am.</b></a>

<p>It's a fact; I am _not_ quitting EverQuest.

<p>I took a leave of absence for about two weeks, pondering the meaning of online games, and I've come to the conclusion that, for now, EverQuest is the most 'entertaining' product.

<p>A trip to Najena with Crobaaz, fighting aggro green skeletons for 3 hours trying to pin down at least two or three of them white Ogre Guards, made me go ballistic. So I logged out, persistent never to enter Norrath again.

<p>During this time I came to think of all the negative sides of EverQuest, primarely issues like zoning, camping and Verant's lack of foreseeing the future. Not to mention the gamesystem, which is highly resistant to fundamental changes, such as not being able to dye things in different colors (without dying a whole area of a character, mind you!). I feel sorry for those rangers, running around with their newly painted arms.

<p>With this, I have also changed my view on EverQuest. And as much as I would like this to not be the case, EverQuest is NOT a roleplaying game. It's a virtual cafe, with a fantasy theme. At first, I didn't like the way that sounded, but since Brad came in during thanksgiving, saying "happy turkey day!" or whatever, made it very clear on what kind of product EverQuest really is (I know he made it just to be nice, but still...).

<p>It'll never ever substitute the old pen and paper rpg, and I feel more than stupid for not coming to this conclusion earlier. Some of you will agree wholeheartedly ;), but bare in mind that if you had as much offline time as I do, you'd have a great deal of time, wishthinking the possibilites and potential that EverQuest could possess.

<p>So with that, I will bash down and abandon any thoughts of a virtual roleplaying session, and just go for having a 'fun' time, chatting with my friends and group members while getting that orange juice pumping. I'm not saying it's not fun talking to your friends, but it would be "extraordinary fun in a god-like manner, that you can not comprehend' if we all went along roleplaying.

<p>What's this? A phrase coming from Ultima Online?

<p>Yes, during my 'vacation' I decided to dust of the old package of UO and give it a go, thinking that without the tells and long distant conversations, roleplaying came more naturally in this game. To my amazement, both Sephy and Teron had done the same thing.

<p>Unfortunately, I had left the account inactive for a little too long, and the characters (an adept mage and a GM rogue) that I had built up a year ago were no longer there. It wasn't a disaster though, with some hints and tips from Teron I had a pure mage up and running during the first week (he wasn't close as powerful as my old mage though). Although it's faster to develop a character in UO there is no real pleasure standing next to a bunny rabbit, double-clicking like crazy, in order to get your strength up. On the other hand, if you're using a script program you can have your character go into auto-macro mode while you're comfortably surfing the net for news...

<p>... about Asheron's Call.

<p>Some of you might remember my first thoughts on AC, which weren't that positive. The graphics are still the same, but there are things in AC which EQ does not have. For instance, you have a world which feels more alive than the one in EQ. You got birds in the sky, leaves in the forest (an actual forest!) and a lot more that makes it feel more realistic. I happened to discover that the world is very similar to Daggerfall too. No zones, just 'waste' lands with several towns and dungeons (note: 'several' is more than EQ's, what?, 10 dungeons?). It definetly makes exploring fun, where you'd actually be able to climb the mountains and walk down to the beach. There wouldn't be about 30+ people around in the same area as well.

<p>Although Asheron's seem supperior to EQ in many areas, there are some things that I do not like about it. While a warrior has a larger solo potential than the one in EQ, you do need to get your hands on better armor as you go up in levels. With that (according to Teron) you'll be seeing a lot of people running around in platemail, even those who are not warriors (and then you'll be experiencing the old problems of UO). I've never been a great fan of heavy armor, so with that my plan on being a Sho monk with just a headband and pants went down the toilet. Then we also have the aggravating fact that there are no 2h weapons in Asheron's (!). Even spears are all 1h in that game... it makes me sad.

<p>So with that, and many other reasons, I've decided to give Asheron's a couple of months to mature. We'll see what it looks like in about 6 months from now.

<p>Ultima Online didn't turn out to be as fun as it used to be either. The old guild I was in, GdG (Gilde Der Germanen), had lost a great deal of members and I was short on people to train my German on :/, not to mention the awesome treasure hunts we organized in the good old days (while it never had the depth of an original pen and paper session we at least acted as we were having one). I guess I had been spoiled by the way EverQuest coped with lag too. In EQ the lag does not restrict you to move, as it does in UO, so there are a lot more frustration in UO trying to move your character away from an incoming Ogre Lord (whereas in EQ you'd just turn 90 degrees, hit num lock, and keep running).

<p>So I'm back and running in Norrath, but it took me a while to figure out what I would be playing as.

<p>Crobaaz is pretty boring at the time. Troll talk DOES get old when no one else is around to roleplay. Another fact that makes troll talk bad is that you don't have the time altering your speech to trollish when two tentacle terrors are beating the crap out of your group. During those times, and any other time which comes with group fighting, I will always step out and take the role as the group communicator. And with my limited game time it is not seldom to see me directing a group in a big fight while, at the same time, keeping several tell discussions with my friends. Just the thought of trying to switch between troll talk and normal speech in those situations make me dizzy, and it's an insta-kill of both my troll talk and my troll.

<p>With Crobaaz out of the picture I decided to try something totally different... a bard.

<p>I had received a tip from a reader that with my limited gametime, and the frustration of downtime, a bard was the answer for me. If you think of it briefly, bards are pretty good. They have a healing spell which makes it unnecessary to sit down (!). Selo's Accelerando is also a peak of their class. However, they do lack a Bind Affinity spell.

<p>It didn't take long though before I realized that bards were not the answer for me. They have to use their spellbook to store their songs, and scribing with a bard takes a long time, not to mention memorizing a spell. And how fun would that be? Dying as a bard? You'd have 8 songs to remem, and without meditation you'd be stomping the ground in frustration. There are also some bad coding examples of the bard that ticked me off as well.

<p>Do like this... sit down, open your mouth, and start humming on your favourite song. Does it work? Good. When I tried doing that in EverQuest all I got was a message saying "You must stand up in order to cast a spell". Argh!!! It's so stupid!

<p>My bard is long gone and forgotten by now.

<p>So, the only thing that made sense to me at that time was to revive old Atherion (to be honest I don't think I would be able to start from scratch again). With some help from the Black Company I transfered a couple of things from Crobaaz, and it was once again time to put on that owl-feather clad robe (which does not exist, mind you :)) and go out for some tracking in the outdoor zones.

<p>Ahhh... back as a mid-level character again, and with a character I felt familiar with. With the new gear from Crobaaz (Darkwood Shield, Jagged Bands, Bracer of Erilossi...) I got Atherion's AC up to an impressive score of (somewhere around) 475 (with skin and coat on). Not too shabby for a lvl 24 Druid.

<p>Currently, I've been grouping in the Aviak Village as an assistant tank. It's great fun, and I've had the luck to get into some awesome groups. It was especially fun last night when I happened to come across a very balanced group. With Wolfform, Quickness and a couple of AC buffs on both me and the prime tanker we had heaps of fun, managing to keep everyone alive during the heaviest spawns consisting of two avocets and several rooks and harriers. I only happened to die once when I'd been a little bit too overambitious, cruding both of the avocets which spawned. Creeping Crud will eventually overdamage any tanks so I often find myself in the center of attention at the ending of a battle. With a lagged out Cleric standing behind you there is not much you can do in a situation like that ;).

<p>Shortly after, luck shined on me again as I happened upon the path of Synger Foxfyre, another member of the rare South Karanian spawns. I knew she was tougher than Narra Tanith though, so I threw out a tell to Xaanin (yes, Teron decided to start playing EQ again as well) to come help me kill her. It wasn't the easiest task to be done though. She was SoWed and moved around a lot. Eventually I'd chased her all the way from the undead ruins to the border to Lake Rathe, just to see her vanishing into thin air! She hadn't zoned though, as my tracking indicated that she was now behind me, as in north of my position. I quickly ran back whence I came just to find her northeast of the Aviak Village. This time she made it straight for the village, and I was terrified that any other players would decide to kill her.

<p>She started to pick on some player pets and one person even got wacked by her AE spell. Xaanin was coming in though, and while Synger was busy dealing with his pet, and many other pets I might add, I began nuking like there was no tomorrow :).

<p>Even though she conned yellow I was amazed on how easily she fell. All it took was a creeping crud followed by a couple of Careless Lightnings. I got quite the experience, counteracting the loss of experience when I died to the avo, but unlike Narra Tanith, there was no faction attached to killing Synger.

<p>If this had been late beta or early final I would have probably been a very proud owner of an Oaken Scimitar as sources indicate that she was the mysterious person keeping that item. It was changed somewhere along the lines though, but the price I got now was not that bad either.

<p>A Bark shield (15ac +5agi) was lying on the corpse of Synger, and it had a pretty unique look which looked pretty nice. I guess I'll be wearing this one until I get my hands on one of those Charred Guardian shield.

<p>That pretty much covers the things I've been doing the past two weeks, but the journal entry doesn't end here. I've decided to change some things in this journal. I'll no longer go into as much detail of my adventures. It was entertaining when I was a little newbie, expressing my thoughts on the big big world and telling tales of fear as Atherion ran from a red young kodiak. Those days have passed. I have few new things to say right now. In a couple of levels you might just change kodiak to Hill Giant and you'll know what I am doing. Also, I am no longer feeling any lust of going exploring. I know how the world is built in EverQuest (and it isn't round) and since I've almost been everywhere (not counting them damn dungeons) I don't have much news to come with. 

<p>So instead, I'll be saving more space for more rants and my views on the things that goes around EverQuest, not necessarily stuff that happens in-game (though I'll add that too :)).

<p>For starters, let's discuss the upcoming changes of Paw, and the dreaded forest of Kithicor.

<p>At first, this seemed like a pretty good idea, making Kithicor an actual zone with actual monsters to kill, than just having the occasional bixie scaring the most low leveled of all halflings. There are, however, a couple of things that need to be addressed.

<p>First of all, this upcoming change of Kithicor was vaguely addressed to the public. This caused a lot of anger coming from those people who had the mishap of getting squished unknowing of the terrors that now occupied the zone. Not to mention those unlucky few who were bound in the area! I heard daunting stories of one poor guy loosing almost 4 levels of experience, just trying to get the hell out of there!

<p>The higher level people, tired of the crowded dungeons, were having a wonderful time while the lower level people were screaming in terror as they were brought to the center of the zone because of a fear spell just to be slain by 10+ spellcasting super skellies. Good luck trying to get that corpse out of the fire.

<p>Of course, this created a big gap between the lower and higher level people. The higher level people, which did not want to see this place reset to it's previous state, told the newbies that there was nothing wrong with the zone, and that if one wanted to pass through all you had to do was to go during the day or use SoW (just like you do in order to avoid the hill giants in the karanas). Unfortunately, this did not hold true, as SoW, while a lifesaver against griffons and hill giants, would not help you against spellcasting mobs. Going during the day would seem to be safer, but then there was the fact that some undeads (mostly the higher level ones) did not disappear during the day. There's nothing like getting wacked by a couple of undeads at 1pm ;). 

<p>Personally, I would never sit down and wait till daytime (thank god I'm a druid with tele spells!), and the next time someone comes with the grand idea of taking the south route (lake rathe-feerrott-inno...) in order to get from the western parts to the eastern (or vice versa) they'll be scraping my lunch off their shoes. Or as a poster wisely put it in one of the EQ forums:

<blockquote>"If I want to go to New York City from Chicago, I sure as heck don't want to go through Salt Lake City first".</blockquote>

<p>So, what is the reason behind this? Well, halloween was one thought (which just shows how stupid it is, importing real-life holidays to Norrath. It happened in UO as well), but the main thing is because parts of the world are getting very very crowded, it especially holds true with the high level dungeons.

<p>This is a well known problem by now (I say "by now" as Verant has not shown many sollutions to this before the change of Kithicor and the itemization of Kedge), so I won't go there. I'm just saying that you shouldn't throw in things which would make level 50 people nervous in a zone bordering to your central newbie spot (now that's like putting Sol B next to Rivervale!). And what many players fail to grasp, saying Kithicor was dead before the patch, is that Kithicor is actually one of the most heavily trafficated zones on Antonica.

<p>It is, however, a waste of space if you're looking at it on a support-player base. Kithicor could very well stay as it is, IF there are some changes made to help travelling newbies/lowbies.

<p>First of all, make both zone entrances safe for resting (and hire two gms to watch for any exploiters if you can't figure out a coding to get rid of it ;)). Place undead spawns (non-wandering) all over Kithicor but don't you dare cutting the road off with any undead mobs. With that, the higher level people could wander into the forest for their precious spawn while the rest of the EQ population could make it safetly through the zone, whether it would be day or night (make up a story about ruin bound spirits or whatever to make it fit, if you care that is).

<p>The changes to Paw, however, are great. It's a dungeon in the middle of South Karana so it bothers no one, and you have the choice of entering it or not, unlike the chokepoint of Kithicor. Paw, while supporting some few players, has a lot of potential of becoming a great dungeon. The problem with Paw has been that once people have discovered it, most of the things inside would be green to them.

<p>Another area that could be upped as well would be Kerra Island. That zone is supposed to be the Erudites' equivalent of Black Burrow/Runnyeye, but since most Erudites emigrant to the mainland it holds little purpose.

<p>Just my two cents on it.

<p>That ends this journal entry. There'll be another one coming next week, taking up things such as the Patch Message and the changes to the Guise of the Deceiver.

<p>Woah, been a while. It feels strange opening this document again. There's been so many changes to the game since my last update.

<p>For starters, the new class based armor has gone through a couple of changes. Totemic parts only acquire one dufrenite now, instead of two, but now you will have to take it to an Ogre camp to smash it or something. For what purpose, I ask?

<p>The stats are widely known on the totemic parts as well, and I can but sigh at Verant's logic. It seems that the stats have just been tossed out randomly. I mean, what kind of metal gloves grants the wearer intelligence? It's abstract, to say the least. 

<p>It's the same with a lot of armor though, just not totemic armor. Only the Bone Armor and the Barbed Armor show some kind of logics. The Bone Armor is heavy, and thus the armplates trade off a little dexterity for some strength, which makes perfect sense to me. It's the other way around with the Barbed Armplates, which, while heavy, grant the wearer to swing a little more precise. Now some may argue that they should instead, as they are heavy, give the wearer some negative points on dexterity, it does at least have the right stat involved. It makes perfect sense to allocate dex/str on bracers/sleeves, agi for leggings/boots, int/wis for headpieces, sta for breastpieces...etc. You get the idea. Now the funniest piece of the totemic armor would be the leggings, which give you a +5 charisma bonus. In those pants? Lol, no way :).

<p>Another thing which got my attention was the fuss about totemic parts (don't know about the other armor) having more AC than the paladin armor. Of course, this made a couple of players upset, and... instead of decreasing the AC for the shaman armor they actually upped the AC on the paladin armor! Unbelivable ;).

<p>I've already stated out that I will not be using totemic parts though, no matter how good they are. And now when I've seen a troll or two running around in it, I still haven't changed my mind. The only part that would actually be useful would be the helm (+5 wis), but it's nothing I will be looking for, actively. First off, it involves camping a 6 hour spawn, which is a good no no. Second of all, I play a Troll, not a Triceratops (you know... those dinosaurs).

<p>Then we got the colors to discuss... joy :). The color of the totemic parts isn't that bad, it's the plate that bothers me. Barbarians, of all races, look awesome in their newly gathered armor. Not to mention Bards... electric blue, wow! It may not be medieval (looks like techno rpg actually :)), but it's sweet! I dunno if it really fits in EverQuest tho... Those Half Elf males already looked a little bit too droidish (not druidish) in their plate armor. Now we'll probably see the EverQuest equivalent of Terminator running around playing with their heavy metal ;).

<p>I'll laugh at the first rogue I will come by though. As far as I know, their armor look like dark bronze (plate). Now what rogue would run around in full plate looking armor? And it's all because they got that stupid color code dilemma. They make the new armor plate'ish in look to avoid the fact that if you change the color of an item area to, say, red, all colors of that area will become red. Just look at an Ogre wearing a Bloodstained Tunic, and you'll know what I mean. Personally, I've gotten used to Crobaaz's red looking neck... Redneck... there we go.

<p>Hmm... wait a minute, the ranger armor wasn't plate... that was green chain. Maybe it's because all of the races who can be a ranger don't show naked spots, unlike the ogres/trolls, in chain armor? I guess it'll be the same with the rogues then... 

<p>"Hey, watch out! There's a scary looking man behind you!"

<p>On another equipment side... I got the reports on the Lionskin Gloves which are finally in the game, and I must say I laughed quite a bit when I heard about the stats. The AC is... are you ready for this?... 5!!! Same as the Bearskin gloves, with just the difference that more classes can wear them, and that they provide you with a little cold bonus! I reluctantly recall a time when I spent hours fighting Patriarchs in EK to get one of those fabled HQ Lion skins.

<p>Anyway, a couple of readers mailed me concerning their experiences with that same corpse bug I discussed earlier. One reader had the same thing happened to him, and the outcome was the same with the one I'm 'working' on right now - no reimbursal.

<p>My guildfriend had a mishap too, dying in the Aviak village a couple of weeks ago. His corpse didn't vanish though, it just decided to hover in midair. It was impossible to target it, even though he made several attempts while levitated. The /corpse command didn't work either. Unfortunately I could not vitness the whole thing as I had to log off, but I heard that the problem resolved... after waiting 14 hours for a GM to pop up.

<p>While that has been resolved, I still want to see what can be done about my friend's corpse, which insta-disappeared when he died.

<p>During one of the nights two guides responded to my petition.

<p>The first one was an apprentice guide, so he didn't really know how to help me, nor did he know about a situation where a corpse would entirely disappear from the server data. I was then forwarded to Guide Sagacious, and I was allowed to quote him on the conversation we had. Here's the rundown:

<font color=yellow><p>S - Greetings Crobaaz, Guide Sagacious here. What can I do for you?</font>
<br>C - If a corpse, by any way ... disappear ... and I mean disappear, as in disappearing from the server data, what can you do about it?
<font color=yellow><br>S - Well, I've never seen one disappear entirely due to a bug. Sometimes they are not visible...</font>

<p>I missed a couple of lines as I was fighting dervs during this whole time, but as he had said that I explained to him about what had occured with my friend.

<font color=yellow><p>S - A standard petition would put you in contact with a guide, who would discuss the circumstances...</font>
<font color=yellow><br>S - Then, once the guide had collected the information, he would forward the information to the GM, who would review the backup logs.</font>
<br>C - my friend got the answer that he needed a screenshot as proof.
<font color=yellow><br>S - Then the GM would determine the nature of the reimbursal.</font>
<font color=yellow><br>S - I personally don't ask for screenshots.</font>
<br>C - So, the chance of getting reimbursed is affected by which guide/gm who responds to the petition?
<font color=yellow><br>S - But in any extenuating circumstance like that one, as much information as can be provided is always useful.</font>
<font color=yellow><br>S - Not officialy. Our policies are pretty specific.</font>
<br>C - so... would an old screenshot of this particular person be valid as proof? Even though he lost newer items he could get those he had on that screenshot, ie. bronze armor, if provided with one?
<font color=yellow><br>S - I wouldn't think of it as *proof*, just additional information supporting the case.</font>
<font color=yellow><br>S - Officially, screenshots are not proof, but they can help.</font>
<br>C - so with that, AND people confirming what items he had would be sufficient?
<font color=yellow><br>S - Think of it sort of like a court case. Not in as much as anyone is at fault, just that you must present the information to the "judge".</font>
<font color=yellow><br>S - You might want to talk to Vyrinia. She can give you more official response regarding such matters than I can. I can only give you my own interpretation of policies.</font>
<br>C - picture this... a guy who likes to solo, looses his corpse... he has no screenshots. Now, is there even a virtual chance that he will get reimbursed?
<font color=yellow><br>S - yes, I believe he will be.</font>

<p>After that we talked a little about everything regarding this issue, and we came to the agreement that my friend and I should petition Vyrinia once she came online.

<p>I've yet to see her online. Unfortunately, you can't just "/who all gm" anymore due to the spam they receive :), but it does work throwing a "/t Vyrinia ." once in a while.

<p>Anyway, it's clear that, reading what Sagacious said, whoever answered my friend's petition did not follow their specific policies. The normal case for them would be to look through the backup logs and find whatever data necessery for them to actually see what that and that person was wearing at the specific time. Now, of course, this will be damn hard to do, as those backup logs are probably deleted now (thinking the bug occured several weeks ago). There was, however, no requirement for a screenshot or any other proof for that matter. Even a lone person who has NO friends and NO screenshots, ie NO PROOF at all has a very good chance of getting reimbursed. So this "You need proof", witch the gm/guide said to my friend at the time was just plain bullshit.

<p>Nevertheless, it'll be fun presenting this whole situation to the "judge".

<p>My thanks goes to Guide Sagacious though. He is a hardworking and decent guy who is worth an applause for his efforts helping us ordinary players.

<p>/applause.

<p>Oh yeah, that reminds me... the new animations are in, as you may have noticed already. It's nice, for a change, to see that Verant takes time in inplementing things which can, at first glance, seem rather trivial. However, imho, they add a great atmosphere to the game. The only critisism I could share would be that the text that comes along a few of them are more leaned towards the "happy family ircing" than traditional roleplaying, but others than that they are great!

<p>Anyway, I'll leave the things above for now, and just do a rundown on the things I've been doing.

<p>Crobaaz is currently lvl 15, and it has only taken him about 2 days and 15 hours something getting to that point. Unlike the time spent with Atherion, Crobaaz was twinked up a great deal during the lower levels and he has gotten a lot of help leveling.

<p>South Ro has also probably been my favourite place when it has come to leveling. At 8th level, when I first got there, I could take out some orcs in a group. Unlike the Thicket, with it's many players who want's to own the few camps that are over there, South Ro offers a lot of camps, six I think, so there wouldn't be a problem having a couple of newbies running around there.

<p>The zone was pretty empty of low level people like myself though. There's a constant number of higher level people there though, maybe 10 or so, looking for the rare Sand Giant or even rarer Terrorantula. So, I had to spend a lot of time soloing there, which wasn't really a big problem. At 8th all I did was hunting down tree snakes, and once at 9th, when I got SoW, I was bold enough to try soloing an orc or two. Now, the sweet part about sro is that there are a couple of places where an orc spawns by himself, which is most often easy to solo. The spawn varies though, and sometimes I found myself running to the zone. Apparently, Orc raiders know how to cast spells.

<p>At around level 10 or something you can easily bring in blue to yellow sand scarabs, a mob I found easy to solo. All I had to do was to throw a drowsy, melee, and make sure I had a steady flow of my tainted breath. I dunno if it was because I was wearing banded and other nice items at the time, but it was sure easier soloing these than the Giant Scarabs in misty thicket with Atherion. Back then, melee wasn't even an option (of course... you could always give it a go, and die in the process :)).

<p>Later on I got to spend more time in the sand area (which never made the zone feel old btw...), and it's a bit tricky there. A lot of dry bones and madmen hang around there, and don't even think about going to the evil merchants to sell some of your stuff off. I found myself overwhelmed by 5 madmen and a drybone. Thank god I had SoW.

<p>There are also two dervish camps in South Ro, which are almost never camped (except for Saturdays :)), and both of them, like some of the orc camps, have a mob spawning outside the camp, which can easily be pulled. I found the western camp to be of lower level than the eastern. The eastern had a lot of spellcasters in it, and most of the time a red thug spawned in that single spot, and no one wanted to touch him :). Then we had the fact that a lot of crypt mummies roamed around in those parts. They even climbed the walls once in a while, scattering the groups meditating there =).

<p>The western often spawned with ordinary humans and barbarians, but once in a while when I was in a group and cleared it out quickly I'd have two of those super blue spellcasters dropping in and nuking the hell out of everyone. At one time I got both of them on me, and I died so fast that my life meter was still full when the loading kicked in... wow...

<p>At around level 13 I started to do some short trips to the Oasis as well. Most of the time it had a lot of people in it, and the lag was insane, but once in a while there were about 30 people in it, which made it very playable. From that point and on, I left South Ro. While there were a lot of dervs to fight in South Ro, I wanted to experience how it would be to group as a shaman, and since I didn't have Harmony the dervs were a little too tough on me. I could handle two blues by myself if none of them were one of those super monk dervs who keeps stunning and beating you into a bloody pulp.

<p>Overall, South Ro has been a pretty safe zone, with lots of things to hunt at 8-13 (if you keep fighting the dervs there I'm sure it could support you into the high teens). There's not many Sand Giants around, and those who rarely spawns are quickly taken down by the higher level players, searching for 'plans' and whatnot. The terrorantula doesn't hold a big treath either. Even though it's blue at level 50 it's painfully slow and while it's not as big as some screenshots want you to believe it is, you'll be spotting it from a mile's distance. If not, you need to see an optician or make an auction for a greater lightstone =).

<p>Anyway, I got lucky in the Oasis, and I was quickly invited into a party consisting of a gnome enchanter, named Falben, and a highelf wizard (a trigger-happy one I might add ;)), named Sifle. Now, of course, I experienced the same dilemma as I had done earlier with my druid - What will my role be?

<p>We quickly found out that, inspite the heals I was holding, I needed to be the tank. Of course that felt a little awkward, since I wouldn't be able to throw many heals around, but then again, Light Healing at level 13 isn't much to waste your mana on (I'd rather be Inner Firing at downtimes).

<p>It wen't pretty good throughout the night, and while we didn't see a glimpse of Lockjaw we did, however, have a lot of renegade Sand Giants running around the shore wreaking havoc. Let me tell you... standing at the dock thing with a bunch of other people is no fun when an SG comes along. All the suddenly you'll see all of these people disappearing in clouds of smoke, everyone but you, and the SG is still hungry :).

<p>The number of people increased during the night though, and at some times we had a looooong downtime just trying to find stuff. Still, we had a blast when the mobs came dropping in.

<p>Oh, a fellow troll gave me a Silver Ruby Vail, for free! I'd never seen him before, and when I asked him why he just said "It's taking up space" :). He didn't want his name to be posted by some reason *shrug*, but whoever you were... thanks!

<p>Also, got word from Gual that they'd been on a raid to Kedge Keep after it had been itemized. All I know is that they got a pretty neat hammer for wis users, and that they were able to kill Phinagel Autropos (Kedge's own version of... what?) himself. The loot wasn't that good though, or as Gual said: "he dropped a crappy staff and a crappy but awesome-looking robe". Well, there you go.

<p>Anyway, I dropped by to the Oasis the next day, being just a bub from level 14. I soloed a couple of white camains and DRONG!!! The level was mine.

<p>Now, with Atherion I got a lot of criticism for taking me over 4 days to reach level 14. All I had to an excuse was that "I'm not a powergamer" :). Well this time I was able to cut it in half, ending at 2 days 6 hours and 38 minutes. I guess Lady McCabe is correct then, when she mumbles the words "Those who dares, wins!". In other words, I've been treating blue mobs as they were green, just going for the white and above.

<p>I quickly went back to Grobb, got my spells (Bind Affinity, Root, Spirit Strike.. etc!!!), and I was all set for my destination: Lake Rathetear.

<p>There was just one itty bitty problem though, and that was the fact that I had to through Feerrott which was one of those few places that I had yet to visit.

<p>It was amazing how dark it was there though. I'd always pictured myself a jungle, with LIGHT! :). This looked like a dark jungle version of Kithicor. So sad, I actually had hopes in this zone, being one of the last outdoor zones I hadn't been in (the only one left for exploration is now the Erud's Crossing, and then I'll be all set). Anyway, I didn't want to get lost in here, and following the road wasn't really a viable option since there'd be Ogres around there and since I'd been hearing of Trolls getting jumped by them in the past I wasn't gonna try it myself. Luckily, a fellow guildmate, named Xylem, was around and that bastard made me swim twice, in wolf form, to get to the Rathe Mountains ;).

<p>Aaah... the Rathe Mountains. Last time I visited this place was with Soma during our Norrathian excursion, zig zaging between Cyclops, Giant Skeletons and all kinds of evil mobs. I was fearing for my life by a great deal with Atherion, and I knew that _crossing_ this zone with a level 14 Troll wouldn't be the nicest thing I could do to my nerves.

<p>It was safer than I had thought though. With the help of the 'Traveler's Map of Norrath' (thanks goes to Arcke for making my trips safer :)) I was able to skirt the walls in the right order and before I knew it I was at the Gypsy camp I had spotted earlier with Atherion. I knew my way from here and I was set.

<p>Once I'd bound myself in Lake Rathetear I began my search for the beggar Jonah, which is to be a nice mob to camp during the mid teens. At first, this sounded like a great idea. It was a fast spawn at a safe place and I could do this during short logins, opposed to grouping which just takes an hour to get the group set up.

<p>I came to realize though that there was a reason why I hadn't been exploring this zone as much. Let me tell you that there is not a feeling more horrible than swimming around in the lake, going through a Swedish connection which could break in any second. Looking at those lights on the modem made me go crazy after a while and I decided to abort the whole thing. I cried out that Jonah was lucky this time, and then I gated back to the beginning of the zone.

<p>Oh, btw... before I forget about it... The adjustable clipping plane really did the trick in Lake Rathetear. I could actually see to the other side of the zone now, and all of the suddenly the zone shrunk in size by a great deal. I'm still not gonna search for that beggar though :).

<p>I decided I'd just fight some bears and stuff in Rathe until I'd thought about something else. But before I zoned I came across a very strange sight. No... it wasn't the legendary Loch Rathe monster, but something far more intimidating...

<p>Who decided the Ogres should be the equivalent of the Flintstones??? Those huts over at the hill made me puke! If it continues like this we will soon be seeing a new type of Ogres in the land which we call Norrath. Picture yourself an Ogre in a Flintstone car, just trying to get the motor _running_. Gee... I'd want that in a coming patch ;). If Oggok is the same, I don't see a good reason visiting that city, others than doing the Stein of Moggok quest.

<p>Anyway, I zoned, cleared my mind of the horrors than I had seen, and got my new spells ready. It was time for some testing.

<p>Just outside the zone border, there were a lot of high lvl people, bringing in Cyclops stuff. In other words it was pretty safe (if you disregarded the cyclops) in case I would get outnumbered.

<p>The first Grizzly bear I found (it was blue) got to me and made me zone. The root broke instantly and a young kodiak joined up and I was forced to hightail out of the area. The second bear went a little smoother though. I opened up with a Tainted Breath and rooted it at a safe distance. Thinking this was the time when you're supposed to lay in with some Spirit Strikes I righfully did so, screaming as I saw my mana meter going white in less than 5 seconds! I had to melee the rest, but it was pretty safe since the SS had taken him down to about 30% of life.

<p>It was, however, the downtime that bothered me. Empty manameters were the reason I dropped Atherion, and I wouldn't want to experience the same with Crobaaz. At times, I'd watched in envy as Shamans would nuke something for a good 75pts wereas Atherion had been limited to a 37 blast until level 19. However, if you look at the mana efficiency (when it comes to blasting) the Shamans end up in the bottom, next to the Monks and Warriors. Yes, it's (almost) that bad ;).

<p>Fortunately, Shamans (not counting them weak pretty boy barbarians (who seem to take for granted that everyone who is a shamans is a barbarian one... baah!!! :))) can tank pretty good. By playing the cards right I'll get out of an even fight with 60% in both life and mana. All it comes down to is using those debuffers and keeping your DoTs alive throughout the combat. Heck, I take less damage than those pure tanks because of those debuffers!

<p>Unfortunately though, the bear hunting was just a waste of time. They were all either blue or green and sometimes it would take some time finding a safe pull, since there were other bears and cyclops everywhere. Since I had abandon my plans on staying in Lake Rathe I really didn't have a reason to stay here either. There'd be plenty of other places which could hold better mobs for me at this level.

<p>So, with a quick tell to Soma I was invited to follow him to the Nektulos Forest (via a gate of course). There was just one problem though, I was going to meet him in South Karana. I thought it would be impossible at first, as I would have to run through a gnoll/undead encampement in Lake Rathe, and with the change of SoW not being able to unroot I'd be toast if one of those Gnoll Shamans would root me.

<p>It was daylight when I jumped into the lake though, and if the camp was busy with other people I just might be able to pull through. Once I got there I realized that there weren't any people there, and it was filled with Gnolls of all sorts and devices.

<p>I climbed out of the water with no other intention than to die. With a big shrug I just gave it a go.

<p>Strangely, none of the gnolls attacked me, not even the High Shaman seemed to care about me. With a smile on my face I made it to the aviak village and met up with Soma.

<p>Once we'd arrived in the forest I heard a very strange booming sound. I thought my CD player had gone wild again (which it often do), but that would have been strange, as I didn't have a disc in it. It turned out that the noise was coming from nothing but Soma's Shimmering Orb, how annoying.

<p>Anyway, with Lake Rathe being a no no I decided I'd just stick with going in the footsteps of Atherion. The Kodiaks would be great for my level, as they would probably be yellow, and the West Commonlands have always been a favorite zone of mine.

<p>First things first though. I'd been missing out on one spell for a long time, called Flash of Light, and it's the reason why my divination is as high as (1) at level 15. I dunno if it really is being sold in Grobb, or Oggok for that matter, but personally I've not seen a single flip of it. It is, however, told be sold in any Cleric's guild, and Neriak just happened to be one of those places which keep a guild of that flavor. With a sense of exploration I placed my first steps in this creepy looking city.

<p>Ay Chihuahua, creepy it was!

<p>I'd heard about Trolls getting KOS in here too, so I didn't want to venture too far into the city. The creepyness added a lot to that thought, and even the sound of the doors.. eerr.. jail thingies transformed me into a nervous wreck. It was a bit strange though that there was a lot of water in this place. It didn't really fit with the Teir Dal race. The place was really blue though :).

<p>A 'friendly' Teir Dal, by the name of Celery, helped me out with finding the spell for me. I thanked her, gave her a plat for the troubles and decided it was time for some kodiak barshing. Once I'd bound myself I made way for the West Commonlands.

<p>The first thing that struck me on my way there was the necessity of avoiding things, such as guards and innkeepers. There were a lot of travelling guards in the East Commonlands, and since it was during the nighttime I was forced to do the cheesy, yet safe, wall run.

<p>In the West Commonlands I happened to remember that there were two guards patrolling around the road, demanding payment for using the road. Unfortunately, they were still red at level 14, and others than that I have come to realize that they might be part of the Freeport Militia (ie the bad guys). While Crobaaz couldn't care less for them being humans he doesn't feel like making the Knights of Truth (etc etc...) a favor by killing these guys. So I guess I'll have to wait with the guard bashing until I've found a couple of good guards.

<p>The Kodiaks were ranged between yellow and white, and Crobaaz could handle most of them. It was a balance between 'wasting' mana and getting out alive though. If I rooted and debuffed with all I had followed by a couple of Spirit Strikes my mana meter went empty before I had even engaged the critter. On the other hand... if I was stingy on the mana I was pummeled down on the spot. It didn't matter how I turned things around. If I just kept them debuffed I was able to melee them by a great bit, but if it wore off I had to recast the debuffers, and sometimes, when the debuffs didn't stick long enough, I didn't have the mana to keep it going until I'd clobbered it with my GWC. If, I on the other hand, layed in with a couple of Spirit Strikes I'd get the beast down to below 50% of life, but that really didn't make a difference if I didn't have any mana for debuffs. My life deplentished a lot faster than the kodiak's.

<p>It was a 50/50 situation though. I learned to see when things was going bad and when not, and then we had young kodiaks to figh as well. While they were blue, they did go down pretty easily by just debuffing them once a fight.

<p>I also ran across a couple of wisps, and it was quite fun that I got a Greater Lightstone on the first wisp Crobaaz had ever slain :).

<p>A guildmate, by the name of Githean (I think I mentioned him earlier when I fought in the Oasis with Atherion... but it was a long time ago). He was level 22, but he decided he'd help me out a bit on the leveling. So off we went to the dervish camp.

<p>It was pretty empty of people and we practically had the whole camp for ourselves at certain times. Githean was a bit too good with his fighting skills though as he often overdid the damage. We decided it would be faster if we just teamed up and just fight everything around, and so we did. Even though he was 8 levels higher than me, I still received experience. It was of a small amount though, but it was still more or the same as it took an awfully long time for me to finish off some of the tougher dervs.

<p>Things went great from there. I managed to get over a Bronze Main Gauche, which is one of the very few piercing weapons for shamans. Sure, it looks odd having a troll the size of a small truck holding something as tiny as a toothpick, but the animation is great! :). And I'm pretty motivated of keeping this skill up, as there are some very fine weapons out there in the tougher dungeons (Gloomwater Harpoon 9/31 25hp 4str, Kedge Keep). The only thing that is really bad about piercing though is that it makes the 1st person view _entirely_ unplayable. I get too see Crobaaz nose every second now.

<p>I also met up with an old friend of mine, Raspberri. She was grouped with me the time I went to Unrest and she was currently standing at the entrance to Befallen, giving out Barbed Armor! She remembered me and even gave me a piece, Barbed Legplates (AC 8 +2 agi). Thanks!

<p>Gazlek, a fellow Troll, later gave me the Barbed Armplates (AC 7 +2 dex) which he in turned had gotten from Raspberri (I think). Much appreciated :).

<p>A couple of guildmembers of the Black Company appeared in the zone and one of them, Vithdos, buffed us up to godlike standards. 861hp! Gotta love those lvl 49 Clerical buffs ;).

<p>Githean had to leave at some point where I decided to keep fighting the dervs until I had to log.

<p>Currently, I'm level 15 and stationed in Lavastorm, for two good reasons. One is that the rock derves are great for increasing those melee skills, including piercing. I've put about 6 points in it and it's currently around 20. With a steady flow of rock dervishes I hope to have it up to around 50 at 16th level. The second reason for staying in Lava is because there is a rare spawn there which I would really like to get my hands on. A certain skeleton commander spawns *somewhere* in Lavastorm and he holds the precious Bone Spear, which is one of the few spears available for Shamans (with the gloomwater included there are about four spears that I know of).

<p>Things are going well with Crobaaz. I'm almost done with my equipment look on him, and that at a mere level 11.

<p>Aiin needed some help with some transferring stuff with his characters, and for my help with carrying his rubicite and chittin armor all over the world I got a nice deal I could not resist. For 50pp, I got a Bloodstained Tunic (13 ac, 4wis/agi. The usual price is around 200pp) and two Jagged Bands (Ring items, 5ac +3str,á 75pp). Nice indeed!

<p>Later, Soma came in and dropped off a pair of bracers, one being a Polished Bone Bracer (woohoo!) and the other one being a Bracer of Erollisi (5ac 5str Lore). Crobaaz didn't really need the latter, but I figured Atherion would have some nice use in it, as it has a good ac (that covers Atherion's bracers, one being the Erollisi, the other being a CBB).

<p>Like that wouldn't be enough, Teron was able to get his hands on a Savant's Cap for me in Unrest for the mere price of 15pp. All I now have to continue looking for would be a cloak of some sort (hopefully a Molten or Mammoth one) and, of course, the Ivandyr's Hoop (Quest Earring. 6ac 6wis/int 6hp). Oh, and not to forget my weapons... I still need to upgrade my 1h blunt weapon, being an ordinary mace.

<p>With the PBBs, my Crobaaz is now bracerless, which looks way better than having a CBB equipped, which makes you look... too rectangular (don't ask me why, it's just my impression of it). And with the second bracer and the Savant's Cap (when I pick it up from Feydwer) I will now have a spiffy intelligence of 67. That beats the starting score for Barbarians, Dwarves and Ogres, while it equals with the Halflings. Crobaaz isn't so stupid anymore (not that he'll start talking like a hummie...).

<p>I'm still not sure whether I want to wear the Savant's Cap though. At first, I thought the Large Leather Skullcap I'm currently using made Crobaaz look dumb like a rock (some may argue Trolls already look like that from the start...), but I've gotten used to it, and it now adds some color on him. Ah well, the 3wis/int will probably convince me to go capless.

<p>While we are still, somewhat, at the subject I must say that I have grown even more bored of Atherion. I played him a little while I helped Aiin, and it wasn't easy going back to small-small when I had gotten used with playing a Troll. Everything was so big with Atherion, and for the first time I really realized why Wood Elves are considered to be a small-medium race. While skirting the plains of Eastern Karana I automatically switched to the chasecam, and behold! Was I surprised when I saw Atherion being a small blip on my screen, as I had forgotten I had my chasecam on "big race" mode?

<p>I must say I prefer the big size with the small view of the Troll. The outside camera which is used in combat is even better when you play a Troll, as you can zoom out quite a bit (thus getting a broader view) before your character starts to disappear in the pixel soup.

<p>Something that was a little bit cooler though, and which I forgot to mention (*waves to Remelio*) were the new spell animations you get at level 24. I was a little bored in Rivervale while I was waiting for Aiin, so I happened to snare myself. It wouldn't go off, so I quickly memorized Cancel Magic and *sparkle*! Talk about spell effects!

<p>Atherion made a little circle motion with his arms and all of the suddenly millions of small lights emitted from where he stood, and while doing so he happened to impress half of the newbie squadron of Rivervale, hehe. It feels a bit stupid though that I will have to wait to level 24, again, until I can do the same tricks with Crobaaz.

<p>Anyway, let's go back to Crobaaz. At some point I did a little trip to the Oasis (to get some of my spells), and when I arrived I was not impressed. There were over 70 people in the zone and people were ooc'ing and shouting like there was no tomorrow. At first I thought that I had, somehow, been teleported to the Greater Faydark. The the abundance of druids, killing specters (which are the most gawdawful thingies I've ever laid my eyes on in EQ), and 'newbies' getting killed by them (not directly by the druids, but from the specters they were 'kiting') made my computer chunking, just like it does in Greater Faydark, because of the over use of the two message commands.

<p>When the heck did Oasis become Unrest #2? I remembered a lagfree zone (at least compared to what I was now facing) with Atherion, packed with trolls and ogres. Now all I got to see were elves, elves and elves, kiting those damned specters. Maybe it's because I this time entered the Oasis from the South, and not from the North, which I had done with Atherion?

<p>Ah well... let the elves and whatnot reclaim their Takish-Hiz. This troll is going to Lake Rathe at level 14. 

<p>Some may think this is one of my famous "contradictions", blaming elves for ruining the Oasis, while I've been there myself, with Atherion (who just happens to be a Wood Elf). It's not really them I blame, but the persons who thought out this zone mongering leveling system (or ZMLS for short). The Oasis already holds a lot of low-mid level players, and those were the ones I met when playing my Atherion. Now it seems that a lot of people has catched up to the levels 30-40+, and now Oasis is a merry place for them also, where they can hunt the specters... and of course... the sand giants.

<p>Now some people will say that I'm, again, contradicting myself, as I am the same person who said that there should be a mixed population of monsters in a zone, level-wise. That's true, but it's insane making a zone which is both one of the _best_ low-mid level zone, _as well_ as being one of the _best_ for those higher levels.

<p>If I'm still contradicting myself at some point, please drop a <a href=mailto:xplorer@stratics.com>mail</a> as this is getting confusing, hehe.

<p>Hmm... didn't plan on writing this much about the Oasis from the start, so I'll just leave this area with closing that Newf dropped by and helped me get the spells I needed. Thanks!

<p>One thing that is worth mentioning, is that Crobaaz has already joined a guild, called the Black Company. While I was thinking of starting my own, Troll/Ogre/Teir Dal, guild I came to realize that I just didn't have the time (nor money) to run a guild the way I wanted (and that's with barbed whips and a strong ironfist ;)). Now I don't even have enough people to even initiate the guild, as both Teron and Fray dropped their Trolls (Korbok and Tedo), and Thalandin has even taken a small pause from EverQuest.

<p>The prime motivator for joining the Black Company would be Nexxis, as that's the guild she's been in for quite some time now. They all seem very friendly (and when I write this they have already helped me level a couple of times), and it'll be fun grouping with these people once I get Crobaaz up and running in the mid levels.

<p>Btw, did you know that a red ghoul at level 9 equals to one _whole_ bub of experience!? Thanks goes to Pixxie and Thalia for helping me with that 'research'.

<p>I'm not really writing coherently here, but anyway... some things on the Troll talk:

<p>I've been through with Crobaaz for 11 levels now, and I'm still not clear on the Troll talk, as there are a lot of different ways of talking trollish, and I've yet to pick up 'my' version of it.

<p>If I let myself loose from all strings and all rules that say how you should speak I'll quickly transform my Troll from being a sinister shaman who likes to torture his victims in a cruel way, spreading chaos, hate and fear (okay... hold it there, or it'll get cheesy) to a rambling idiot who doesn't know the difference between a red ball and a gnome. In his eyes they are both edible as long as you chew thorougly for quite some time.

<p>Now, while that would be the perfect way of roleplaying a troll for a lot of people (especially for those who aren't trolls), it's not my kind of soup. I would like to picture my Crobaaz being a bit smarter than the average troll (some may argue with me on that point that Troll Shamans are smarter...), while still not sounding like a human in speech.

<p>Currenlty, I've altered my speech accordingly, so not to sound too stupid. First off, the "mez/me/Crobaaz" was dropped and replaced with the common "I". If I speak like "Crobaaz be Shaman" or "Mez be Shaman" I'll be struck down by the route o' dumbness before I even know what hits me (now that's dumb). "I be Shaman o' Innoruuk" sounds...err.. not maybe sounds better, but it definitely looks a little better, even though some may argue that the "I" is in a troll's vocabulary.

<p>Others than doing small speech changes here and there, I've been plotting on a personality for Crobaaz. The first thing that struck me was that it would be fitting if I turned Crobaaz into a somewhat silent troll, only speaking when it would really be necessary to do so. That would be going down the route o' mystic, being somewhat secretive and all that. Of course, that totally goes against my own personality, which is that I like to type/talk a lot (really? :)). I'll still be looking into it though. I mean... I can still keep normal conversations in tells (where I generally do not roleplay). And while I wouldn't be talking a lot, it would invite to some use of emotes, so to express myself through thoughts and gestures rather than 'normal' speech. And if, I would be playing Crobaaz with my own personality I'm sure that I would soon be watching my own troll standing there like a blabbing idiot. So secretive it is.

<p>On a sidenote, I'll try to stop playing Crobaaz as he would always try to think with his stomach instead of his brain. That also gets a little (if not very) stupid, and I remember one particular incident that made me totally clear on that point.

<p>Figure yourself a troll standing at the zone border in South Ro, beating on a tree snake. Suddenly, a dwarf comes running by, followed by yet another one. Now the troll shouts out that he is to make a dwarf soup, and intercepts the little ones as they run for the border. Both of the dwarves are using roleplaying colors, and with the invitation of a lil roleplaying session through the shouts, they stop. Now the troll (being a blabbing idiot of course) makes sure the dwarves understand that they will be cooked for dinner, if not eaten raw at the spot. The dwarves, while being given this information, raise their blades in a defensive stance. They halt however, and decides to play a trick on the poor fool. So as the troll continues to talk about his pepper and salt, the dwarves take out their Froglok Skin Masks (or Guise of the Decievers) and... voila! The troll is no longer talking to two dwarves, but to two Teir Dals!

<p>Now, of course... the player of this troll (in this case being me) has no other alternative than playing dumb (as he already got into that path with all the hunger and blabbing talk) and leaving the two Teir Dals in a confusing state, thinking where the heck those dwarves disappeared to.

<p>Lesson learned? Don't rave/blab as a Troll, do not think with your stomach (at least not if you want to show the other players that your intelligence do not peak at 5) and never ever play your Troll the way others want you to roleplay your Troll, in this case being nothing but a dryed out vegetable (I would still like to thank these two particular dwarves though, I got my own bad troll asteeme to blame).

<p>However, Crobaaz has been able to scare a gnome or two as well, and it's always nice seeing a spellcaster gating or invising out of there when I press that Sicken button... hehe.

<p>With that said I'll talk about some stuff that came in recently, not only being the patch, but something far more important; Vanishing corpses.
  
<p>While the friend of mine who utterly lost his corpse through a bug told me he didn't want to make a big deal out of it I still feel like it's something worth mentioning.

<p>First off all, if you would by any reason loose your corpse through a bug, do not except to get reimbursed. You, obviously, need proof. Now while that may sound all logical, thinking of all the people who would otherwise exploit it (in order to get items they didn't loose), I still think we need to work this out a bit better.

<p>The apparent question I have is: 'How do you get proof?'

<p>A screenshot of your inventory would be lame (let alone a shot of where your corpse disappeared), as you can't verify that that tunic of yours is really the Foremans Tunic. Of course, you could rightclick on the item and take a screenshot, and repeat that with all the items, but would we accept being enforced to litter up our harddrive in order to keep our precious items because of a damn bug? I clearly say no, my harddrive already keeps a steady gigabyte of EverQuest shots which I take in order to remember the things I've done during the week. Some people who are playing EverQuest doesn't even have a gigabyte to spare (not that I'm saying you would have to take 1000 screenshots, but the fact remains that they do take up quite the space, being 901kb a pic).

<p>Even though you would, by some reason, take all those screenshots, how could you possibly verify that that was really the equipment you had in your inventory when you died? A thought would be to do an Earthtime (/time) and take a screenshot of that as well. However, there is just one small problem... the time you are shown is linked to your computer's time, which is easy to adjust (thus, that wouldn't solve the problem of going around the exploitz).

<p>If a thing like this would happen to me it would be a good ground for leaving EverQuest. I'm even positive about the fact that they would in no way believe a level 11 Shaman demanding them to poof up that Blood Stained tunic for me. However, if I would be around the high levels I am sure they would not doubt me for a second. Grrr... even if I would loose a gear of full leather and a scimitar which I had put a lot of time in I would still be furious if I would not be reimbursed.

<p>Ah well... I can't keep on ranting about an issue I don't know all that much about, I guess I'll just have to do a petition during the week (5$ it'll be Guide Biktik who will contact me, as there are hardly any GMs around during the time I play).

<p>[Note (991017): I have yet to find any GMs online.]

<p>Now about the patch. 

<p>The first thing that comes to mind is the "Optional" patch system.

<p>Why optional, when it's probably meant as an "excuse for large downloads which would cause problems for the 28.8 modem users or/and the rate paying customers"?

<p>Yes, I am whining, but for good reasons.

<p>First of all, let's look at the basics. Why the heck would you NOT want to download these optional files? Sure, you might not need the Temple of Solusek Ro at this point, but you would probably need to download it later anyway when you, for example, want those new animations to show, as I hardly doubt that you will be able to choose which files you would like to download. As it would be now, if you choose not to download a file it will just place itself in a queue and you would still have to download it later to get to the "juicier" files.

<p>Secondly, I will not tolerate the fact that Verant would now be, by some reason, "entitled" to add larger files for users to download. Sure, we all want zone enhancements, new planes, new monsters, new items and all that, but I, for one, will not tolerate the fact of spending hours downloading stuff. The procedure of going through all those splashscreens with the logos, the high elf and all that is enough for me to produce a great deal of stress.

<p>A lot of people might and will disagree with me (you know who you are if you by any chance play through a cable modem ;)), but the bottom line is that I did not buy a game where it said in the User's Agreement that said that people who play through a phone rate may not be able to get access to some areas in case you're not overwhelmingly rich or don't have an hour or so to spare on downloading stuff.

<p>Baah... to be honest, I never read the damn thing.

<p>Anyway, let's leave that for now and let me address something else that was quite a blast (which knocked all shamans but the barbarians unconcious) - Shaman only armor.

<p>This was, with all the other class specific armor, implemented to replace the ever-camped Rubicite armor. I've been doing some research on the items, and they seem to be a lot better than their red counterpart with stat-bonuses and all. However, there are some problems...

<p>The most ridiculous thing is that it's made by the barbarians in the Lake Rathe fishing village. While it's stupid enough that Trolls and Ogres would even bother to talk, let alone trade, with barbarians (at least the NPCs) it's worse by the fact that they are KOS by them. WTG Verant!

<p>Of course, there could be another place with trolls/ogres, which make the same pieces of equipment, but that sounds a bit too logical for me to be Verant.

<p>[Note (991017): This has been fixed at this point, but it still holds an embarrassing point on just how stupid/lazy they are over at the patch division.]

<p>Then we have another fact that remains (which is even worse in my opinion), and that is that the armor is "pea puke green", as a player liked to put it. What's even worse, is that it's plate'ish in look. Barbarians have reported that it looks way awesome on them, but I doubt that trolls will look good in canned baby pukes. Why can't they have gone with a dark crimson color, and in chain? That would have looked utterly cool, but no...

<p>Ah well, people have gotten to level 50 before in just a BS tunic and banded, so why shouldn't I be able to do the same? And I'll even look good in the process of doing so. And, of course, I could always pick up the items which do not add anything to the model (which would be belts, neckpieces, masks, cloaks, mantles and all that).

<p>[Note (991019): Seems that the only parts available are bracers, sleeves, leggings, boots, cloaks, mails, helms and gauntlets, where the cloak would be the only part which would not affect the appearance... bleh.]

<p>Anyway, this entry is pretty large by now, and while I haven't talked so much about what I've been doing with Crobaaz and how South Ro is I'll sum that up in a later entry when I will hopefully be level 14 (thus the time when I will be leaving sro).

<p>There'll be another entry coming next week, which will probably be optional to read. However, to understand the following entries which will come I strongly suggest you to downlo... err... read it.
