If you are an enchanter, legions of players ask to be breezed/claritied.

Quite to the contrary, players relying on other players is a big part of the game by design.<br><font color=050056><br><br>This causes a lot of wasted time for those that can provide these types of services. For example, if a wizard is asked to teleport, the wizard has to meet the person somewhere, he has to memorize the spell, he has to cast it, he then needs to get back to where he wants to be and finally, at some point, he has to meditate to regain the mana lost by teleporting someone<br><font color="#a00000"><br>Very true, but there must be some cost to the dependence otherwise it is trivial. For instance, if there was an item in game that created unlimited money, the value of money would drop significantly as these items showed up in game.<br><font color=050056><br>When it comes to SOW, breeze/clarity, teleport, and binding, I think other solutions should be available. <br><font color="#a00000"><br>Some other solutions for some of these are available in the form of Alchemy. Not for everything of course as we wouldn't want to destroy class interdependance, or turn one class (shamans) into the class that replaces all others.<br><font color=050056><br>How about giving casters a new skill called &#8216;spell scroll&#8217; or something to that affect. The &#8216;spell scroll&#8217; skill could then be learned like any other skill. Using the &#8216;spell scroll&#8217; skill, casters could create single-use spell scrolls <br><font color="#a00000"><br>Any further expansions in the area of providing a craftable item that invokes a spell will be made via alchemy. Though I appreciate your opinion, we don't want to see classes excluded from a group on the basis of the people in the group being able to cast a bunch of those spells.<br><br>-Gordon<br></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></blockquote><font color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><font color="#a00000"><font color=050056><font color="#a00000"><font color=050056><font color="#a00000"><font color=050056><font color="#a00000"><br><font color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=3><br><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057049.html">I wanna be a werewolf!</a></b><br><blockquote><br><font color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><br><br>Remember the old RPG "Daggerfall?"

<blockquote><font color="a00000">I often get email from a few folks who make some very good arguments concerning risk in PvP. Basically, the standpoint is that if the environment does not contain risk, there is no sense in engaging in it. "Item loot" itself does not handle this risk, as players of casting classes are not affected to the same extreme as melee characters. <br><br>One argument is that we should implement experience-loss in PvP. I like this idea, unfortunately some core issues with the way life in EQ works makes implementing this unreasonable. For anything that couldn't be handled in code, an additional load would be placed on the CS staff. Believe it or not, even though people playing on PvP servers should be more tolerant of interaction with other players, 90% of the petitions there are for some kind of perceived harassment. <br><br>The core EQ system, meaning, the things that define EQ as EQ, do not allow some of these issues to be resolved without drastically changing the PvE portion of the game which we want to remain intact. <br><br>That said, I still firmly believe that some form of risk associated with PvP needs to be in game. Since that risk cannot be experience-based, and item-based risk doesn't hurt people who can bag their items or fight without them, I'm considering the following option: Making it so that everyone, regardless of class, can only bind in cities on the PvP Servers only. <br><br>City-only binding (again, on PvP servers only) would allow people to, for instance, eject an opposing force from a zone, and provide the additional risk of making all of them run back to recover their corpse and engage again. <br><br>What are your thoughts on this? Do you feel that PvP needs more real and equal risk associated with it regardless of class? <br><br>- Gordon </font></blockquote><br><br>This is the best resolution I have seen other then making it Coin + 1 non Magical/Lore Item Loot.

What--what in the world?--is the point in being the leader of an all-team anti-PK police guild, when Verant has suddenly made it impossible to commit a crime? How can you be evil if it's virtually impossible to do anything despicable? How can you be good if there's no one evil?<br></font><br><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">You're using Roleplaying as your argument here. However, Roleplaying doesn't require that items be looted in order to play your role as an anti-PK police guild. The "crime" of killing someone and taking their coin doesn't have to be any less important than the "crime" of killing them and taking an item. This is espicially true when the chances of getting an item back from someone, unless they are the honorable sort who always wears their gear, is very slim.<br><br>As for the rest, I have read it, and though I appreciate your opinion, we do not plan on changing Vallon back. The arguments here are roughly the same ones as on Tallon when the coin-only change was made there. Your arguments aren't any less important than those of the people who wanted coin-only loot, however the item-loot people was a much smaller population. <br><br>-Gordon

<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>June 23rd, 2000 - This evening the Stratics Message Forums will be brought down for maintenance at 6:00pm PST / 9:00pm EST. This maintenance has been scheduled so that we may implement a solution to the recent lags and slowdown issues involving our Message Forums. The problem has been narrowed down to the sheer size of the database that holds all of our forum data and how the scripts managing the forums access this data. The total downtime for this maintenance is expected to be no more than two hours at the most, barring any unforeseen issues that may arise. Stratics Links will also be disabled during this time frame.<br><br>We have devised a solution to increase the speed and performance of the forums and the true test will come on Monday afternoon (June 27th). We hope that after having installed these changes, the forums will perform at the level we have always expected here at Stratics. It is our goal to maintain not only mature and user-friendly discussions within our forums, but also to ensure that the forums are fast and reliable to use as well. The recent slowdowns have been a major concern for us, so we are excited to have this opportunity to have this improved code installed.<br><br>We certainly look forward to your feedback. Once the update has been completed, please try the forums out and let us know what you think and whether or not you notice any difference in performance.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Jhariden<br>Stratics Community Development<br></FONT>

From Sunmoon Glademaster of the Ranger's Glade:<br><br><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><br>As the trumpets fade, all eyes turn skyward and see the sky twisting a hue of crimson. Frightened, people began to scatter as a low moan arises from points unknown.<br>It seems a blood red cloud has formed over the fortress of Crushbone and a glimpse through a telescope reveals an abundance of strange shapes terrorizing any near.<br>The Ranger, crumpled from his latest battle, raises his hand to his side and finds his swords have vanished. Painfully reaching around, he notices his bow splintered and rendered useless by some unseen force. He calls upon his magics, yet finds his mind empty of the power needed to evoke the mystic powers required to heal his wounds or harm his foes.<br>Undaunted, the wiry form rises to his feet to faces this new challenge. Startled, the Ranger whirls to face a sound behind him.<br>Ahhh, he smiles, it seems that others have heard the call and have come to his side. He sees the forest of Kelethin come alive as Rangers detach themselves from the trees and stumble forward. He painfully gazes upon the countless scars and wounds his comrades bear and cringes as his own body tries to comply with his will.<br>For ages Rangers have come to the call of many battles and the hundreds of faces of Brothers and Sisters among the now-swelling crowds brings a lump into his throat. He has often heard their shout throughout the woods,"Ranger, looking for a fight!" and yet sadly go unanswered.<br>Solitary as wolf, yet at home among his kin, the Ranger begins to snarl at the impending forces amassed against them. He motions for the others to follow as he picks up a steady trot towards the gaping maw of the unknown.<br>Each Ranger knows this will be the fight of their lives, yet they have laid down their lives so many times in the pursuit of adventure that they know their tenacity will be not only seen, but feared!<br>The Rangers run towards Crushbone, many being cut down by the now swarming legions of Orcs. Hundreds of elves are fighting for their lives and the rest of the populace stops and watches the battle, slowly shaking their heads at the overwhelming odds.<br>The grass takes on a fiery red as the blood of so many stain its blades. Strange drops of blood start to spatter the land as the clouds burst their seams and spill their essence. The moaning becomes louder as the howling of the orcs strike an eerie chord.Somewhere in Crushbone lies the answer...<br>How will this battle turn out? You'll just have to participate to see.<br><br>(OOC)<br><br>The time has come to face this strange, unseen force crippling Rangers in their prime. The time is now to act! We will storm the Fortress of Crushbone and we will not desist until the land is covered in the blood of our foes,or us. <br><br>What: Wrath of the Ranger<br><br>Where: The Nameless<br><br>Zone: Kelethin to Crushbone<br><br>When: Saturday, July 1st<br><br>Time: 1PM EST<br><br>Levels: Please make NEW Rangers and only equip your newbie sword.<br><br>Restrictions: Please do not use the zone-wide channels to communicate. We had a great turnout at the last "sit-in" and it was peaceful. Although we are at war, we do not need to act immature here.<br>This is an in-game, roleplaying event to dispute the drastic role changes Rangers are forced to endure post level 45. with a serious lack of defensive skills necessary for a melee class, and a declining role in groups at this stage, the life of Rangers everywhere are coming to an end.<br><br>If we are going to die, we are going to do it with dignity and honor, not to some political in-fighting, misinformation and disorganization within Verant!<br><br>To arms Rangers.. to arms!<br></font></blockquote><br><br>Sounds like a good idea!<br>

<font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman" size=2><br>June 22nd, 9:00am<br>-----------------<br><br>***Today's Updates***<br><br>*The Hole*<br><br>We are pleased to announce the opening of The Hole, a high-level dungeon on the continent of Odus.  The Hole is a complementary addition to EverQuest, available to all subscribers regardless of their Kunark status.  The files necessary to enter The Hole are available via the "Optional Patch" button at the bottom of the patch program interface.  The files are quite large (about 9MB total), so if the download is going slowly, you may want to postpone downloading the files until later.<br><br>As mentioned above, The Hole is a high-level dungeon, designed to support characters starting at about level 40.  It should be regarded as extremely dangerous.  As a note, jumping in The Hole from Paineel is NO LONGER A SHORTCUT TO TOXXULIA FOREST.  The GMs will not recover corpses for people who fall, or jump, or attempt to levitate into The Hole. <br><br><br>*Vallon Zek is now Coin-Only*<br><br>As we announced earlier this week, due to the number of people specifying interest in "coin-only" loot on Vallon Zek, versus those wishing to retain item- loot, we have implemented "coin-only" looting rules for PvP combat on Vallon Zek.<br><br><br>*Resurrection*<br><br>Previously, players had to be resurrected within two hours after death in order to receive any experience back as part of the resurrection.  Due to the increased size and difficulty associated with Kunark zones, we've raised this limit from two hours to three.  This should assist players and make it easier for them to obtain an experience-returning resurrection within the time limit.<br><br><br>*Warping*<br><br>We put in some code that should help decrease the "ghosting" (NPCs appearing to be some place they aren't) being reported in some of the larger Kunark zones.  Please let us know how this goes.<br><br><br>*Locked Doors*<br><br>We noticed few weeks ago that it is common practice to use NPCs to open locked doors rather than by using the services of someone that is able to pick locks.  In order to protect and increase the value of the abilities of the lock-picking classes, NPCs have gained the ability to walk through locked doors without opening them. <br><br><br>*Vox and Nagafen*<br><br>Over the past couple of weeks, we've received more and more reports of these dragons being bested by smaller and smaller groups of higher-level (high 50s) adventurers.  As we've always felt that Dragons should be special encounters that require a large number of people, we were left with some choices.<br><br>One choice available to us was to increase the power of the dragons to a level where the level 60 folks would find them challenging.  This would have the disadvantage of forever placing them out-of-reach for those who did not buy Kunark, and place them further out-of-reach for those who did, but are just now approaching the levels where they could go on Dragon raids. Another possible solution was to make the dragons flee (depop) when engaged by a more powerful group of people.  This would have the undesired effect of allowing some people to deny others the experience of fighting a dragon.<br><br>Instead of raising the bar as mentioned above, we've instead decided that dragons, or at least these two dragons, should have the magical ability to pick their own fights.  Players of level 53 or above will now encounter some difficulty when attempting to assist in combat with these dragons.  This should help 40s and low 50-level characters with their chances to encounter a dragon without worry of getting forced out by much higher level players.  In addition, it also has the added effect of creating a natural progression from the younger dragons of Antonica to the elder and more formidable dragons of Kunark.<br><br><br>-The EverQuest Team</font> <br><br> <font color="#000080"><B>Come and join us <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7&Board=eqwestwood&Number=336870&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5">here</a> in the Westwood Tavern to add your comments/opinions.</b></font>

I'm not going to research spells. I would research if it weren't a time sink, but it is a ludicrous time sink, by design, I know, and I'm not going to be verant's sucker (small "v" intended). I want a game to be fun, not work. I was going to try most of the classes but seeing how my mage became a task at lvl 24 I won't bother. I know I will be as disappointed with any other class. I've spent about 15 days (over several months) on the character, if I remember correctly, so this isn't burnout. It's just not fun. I will never buy anything "little verant" makes, nor will I recommend them. I will advise people to steer clear of them. Here's your payoff, verant, on all your time-sinks... I quit. Toodeloo<br><br><font color="#a00000"><br>I'm not sure what you mean by "time sink". Does it take time? Sure, though everything takes time. Games are made to take time, it's the way they work. <br><br>I personally have never found research that difficult. I get the components as I need them, and would see what I could throw together on my periodic trips back to the bank. Of course, you don't have to research. You could simply choose to buy those spells off of other people making them, as there are plenty of people out there who are spell merchants for fun. <br><br>I think that most would agree that it is a good thing that we give you other things to do besides kill things non-stop.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><font color="#a00000"><br><b><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054279.html">Death Penaltys too harsh?</a></b><br><br><font color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><blockquote><br>"I suppose that everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I'm sure that removal of experience loss on death would be well-received by the majority in the short term. However, we also need to look at the impact on the long term game. Lessening the challenge associated with reaching a goal makes the reaching of the goal that much less fulfilling, which leads to less player-satisfaction overall. <br><br>There are other games out there, and others coming out that have little-to-no penalty for death, doing things incorrectly, etc. I guess only time will tell which method leads to greater player enjoyment overall." <br><br>Having recently been suffering from the Xp death penatly, I found this statement quite amussing(Not). I've spent entire to much time trying to recover lost xp, especailly in the post hell level (31 is mine). I think it is cruel to lose a full buble of xp at any time, but especially so because something like you walking thru West K and going link dead and then coming back to find out you've drowned. Or becuase some over zealous shaman accidently pulls the enitre kings room in permafrost on to the party. It's time for verant to fix this problem. <br><br>As for making the game less fulfilling, if you actually believe that I'm sorry you have such a low opinion of us and your game. I person would love to run up a character of each class to 60, but as things stand now, I'm probably going to quit before I even get one to 50. <br><font color="#a00000"><br>I don't think that I'll ever get everyone to agree, but my point has been, if a situation is too risky for your taste, then either don't put yourself in the situation, or take steps to mitigate the risk if fulfilled. <br><br>Many aspects of the game can be reduced to the statement above. We try to give you options in order to empower you to make the decision that is right for you. As it applies to death and experience loss, if experience loss on death is too severe for your taste, don't put yourself in a situation where you can die, or find someone who can rez you if you do. <br><br>The amount of risk that you assume is up to you. <br><br>- Gordon<br>

<blockquote><font color="a00000"><br><br>Hello all,<br><br>After a good deal of discussion on the Test server status, we've decided that having the right or the ability to do something doesn't necessarily mean that we should. Our thoughts were that everyone was aware of the risks of playing on the Test Server, and always did so with the understanding that something such as a character-wipe was always a possibility. It's apparent at this point, given feedback from players on Test, that many didn't understand the risk.<br><br>That said, we do need to restore the integrity of the testing environment in order to insure that we are able to catch and address issues prior to them going to the live servers. Test has served well in this capacity since release, however item loot issues and other factors have reduced Test's ability to do this. Given these issues, we still feel that a complete character-wipe represents the best possible solution for continued functionality of the Test server. However, this is a case where, in the interest of keeping our current testers and players satisfied, that we need to compromise on the solution.<br><br>After our discussions today, we've decided that an item-wipe, without deleting characters, will accomplish the majority of our goal to restore the Test server as a functional testing platform. Given that, the EQLive and Operations teams are currently at work restoring all characters that were wiped yesterday, with the exception of characters known to be artificially buffed. This process should be completed later today.<br><br>Furthermore, in order to allow those that did not understand the purpose or risks associated with the Test server a chance to avoid future problems of this nature, we will be allowing built-up (not buffed) characters a one-time chance to move when the next split-server comes up, sometime in the near future. As Brad mentioned in his message earlier, we do recommend that those who are on Test more for playing, and less for Testing, seriously consider moving when we open registration. The possibility of a future wipe, whether it is a player or item wipe, is not necessarily unlikely in the future.<br><br>We hope that the players on Test will find this compromise acceptable and continue to participate in the testing process. Furthermore, we apologize for the insensitivity of our previous decision to completely wipe the server.<br><br>On behalf of the EverQuest team,<br><br>Gordon Wrinn <br>Internet Relations Manager<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.<br>

I just wanted to speak on behalf of the news staff that we usually don't get such information directly from Sony or Verant. I was notified by two sources in the #Everquest and #Dojo (another non-Stratics site) irc.stratics.com chatrooms of this server wipe. I asked for a verification on this for a link, and I went myself to the Offical Gameplay Board. Both of my sources gave me the same link to EQ Caster's Realm, and no notice was to be found on the Gameplay board from Abashi/Aradune. I do not play on the Test Server, and I doubt many of our staff do, therefor we were not sure when this happened, although I did want to go give credit to EQCR for their extremely fast response which beat all the major news sites, and made it basically their "Exclusive". <br><br>Honestly, I would have liked to find this message myself without having to post an exterior link, but there are just some times when I can't get all the information and have to give credit to a certian source. And as Greebo said, sometimes getting the news out is just too important to have to find the sources yourself and waste more time.<br><br>Thank you for your E-mail though Jeff!<br><br>Wowous<br>EQSS News Staff

So, after discussing this issue with 180 or so players on Test tonight, we've decided to seriously consider the following 2 options:<br><br>1. Do an item wipe on Test (i.e. restore the characters but without items).<br>2. Move on a voluntary basis characters from Test to Live servers. The characters would NOT go across with items.<br><br>It is also possible we will do both.<br><br>I got a lot of good feedback and passionate opinions and responses tonight, and I really appreciate it. The spirit of the vast majority of the players on Test is truly amazing and I admire you all.<br><br>While a total player wipe with select individuals being buffed to test mid and higher level zones might be clinically best for the Test Server, I think it's more fair to the players and testers there to do one or both of the options above.<br><br>In closing, if we choose option 2 (or both 1 and 2) I would really encourage those players on Test who are there more for playing and less for testing to seriously consider moving.

I am always interested in hearing about how we're doing.<br> <br>While our news staff does actively go looking for news which comes from direct sources, such as quotes from forums and the like, as well as receives a large amount of news from direct email to our news mailbox, sometimes we don't get news like this directly from Verant and Sony, and must use second hand sources such as Casters Realm as a supplement for our news postings.  With an issue like a complete server wipe, the news is significant enough, I believe, that relaying the message is more important than being "first on the scene".  (Even though I wish we could be first on the scene 100% of the time.)<br> <br>That said, I too have seen the decline in the quality, quantity and quickness of our news postings.  As the new EQSS Project Manager, one of my first priorities is restaffing the news team.  We've got some great people on our news staff who put a lot of their own personal time and effort into keeping us current.  Sadly, we've also got some who just aren't pulling their own weight, as well.

OMG! That's all I got to say...<br><br>From <A HREF="eq.castersrealm.com" TARGET="_blank">Everquest's Casters Realm</a>:<br><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#A00000"><br><br>Over the past 15 months, the Test Server has been a fantastic platform for testing new and proposed changes to the live EverQuest servers. However, in the past couple of months, with the release of several new zones, plus the entire Kunark expansion, the characters on the test server, and the equipment they carry, have been further deviating from the norm that is expected on the Live servers. This has made testing certain aspects of the game more and more difficult as time goes on. <br><br>With great sympathy to those that have built their characters on Test and made the server their home, it is now necessary that we "clean the slate" on the Test server and return it to a state that will allow successful testing to take place. To that end, as of today, all characters have been deleted from the Test server. Though no reimbursement of characters, equipment, or levels is planned, strict guidelines have been established to govern future artificial buffing and equipment allocations on the test server in order to insure that the environment remains a clean testbed for enhancements proposed for the Live servers. <br><br>We would like to thank all of the Testers that have been helping on the server since release, and we hope that you will continue to do so. An email address (testserver@verant.com) has been set up to receive your comments on this issue. We will make sure that your comments are forwarded to the appropriate people.<br><br>Thank you for your understanding,<br><br>The EverQuest Team<br><br>It is worth noting also that up until today the Test Server disclaimer (which is viewed when logging in) made no reference to the possibility of character wipes.  This was added today however with the following new line: <br><br>"Finally, it may be necessary from time to time to execute character and/or equipment wipes in order to maintain the integrity of the test platform. " <br></font></blockquote><br><br>Well.. uh... my sympathies to you test server guys...

Camping has been changed to getting lucky says Gordon on <A HREF=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052852.html target="_blank">this</a> post on the <A HREF=http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true>Official EverQuest Forums</a> : <br><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><br><blockquote><FONT color=#a00000><br>Most of the complaints I see in regards to these rare spawns for quest components is related to the general feeling that there is an "entitlement" to these items. There isn't. No one is entitled to any particular item. <br>You can't fix a situation where everyone is camping by making what they are camping for more plentiful. That just encourages camping, as the camp duration gets shorter, and more people feeel that the camp time is worth the effort. As it is now, maybe people will get the idea that the camp is too long, and just choose not to camp. Then perhaps someone happening by can get lucky and find the spawn in question. If people are still choosing to camp it, perhaps we need to look into making it even rarer, closing the quest, or look into creating other items that represent reasonable alternatives to the item that people are choosing to camp.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br></font></blockquote><FONT color=#a00000><br></font>

Recently, the Stratics Forums have been experiencing significant decreases in response time during the Forum "Prime Time" (approx. 10AM - 3PM PST).  This slowdown is a result of the tremendous popularity of our forums.  The same data engine is used to maintain the forums for not only the EQSS sites, but the UOSS, ACSS and most of the other Stratics Gamesite Networks.<br><br>At the core of the issue is the master Posts table, which has several hundreds of thousands of rows of data in it, and is taking longer and longer to access with each row added.  The Stratics technical staff is currently working on a fix which would split the master Posts table out into multiple Posts tables, based on the Category of a particular Forum.  This will allow us, when imlemented, to maintain multiple, smaller, faster post tables rather than a single, huge, slow table.  <br><br>This solution, along with the addition of additional hardware resources, we believe will go a long way towards restoring the forums to a usable speed during prime time.  We <B><I>hope</I></B> to have the main part of this solution implemented by early next week.  However, I can't stress enough, that we will take as long as we must to ensure that the fix can go in without risk to existing post data.<br><br>Thank you for your patience,<br><a href="mailto:greebo@stratics.com">Greebo</a><br>EQSS Project Manager

The Crimison Dragons held their first annual race : <br><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><br><blockquote><br>Greetings All,<br><br>On Thursday, May 15th, the Crimson Dragons guild on Fennin Ro hosted their<br>1st Annual Newbie Gnome Race.  The Race was started at the entrance to the<br>city of Ak'Anon and ended at the gates of Halas.  Over twenty-five members<br>of the Crimson Dragons guild created 1st level gnome characters of any class<br>and raced this tremendous distance.  None of the racers were allowed to use<br>any type of speed increasing buffs or buffs such as invisibility and<br>levitate that help to avoid creatures.  Teleports were not allowed, nor were<br>high level escorts.  Binding in cities along the way was permitted.<br><br>After the start at Ak'Anon, the stampede of newbie gnomes rushed through<br>Faydwer and boarded the ship at the docks in Butcherblock.  After much<br>singing, merriment and the spreading of sheer terror to the Ocean of Tears<br>population, the gnomish hordes spilled out onto the Freeport Docks and began<br>their frenzied rush to Halas.  Out of twenty-fave racers, only five gnomes<br>were able to complete the extremely difficult course.  Kilkin Cobblepot came<br>in first place, followed shortly by Taldor Fizzalot and Tahnlu Freestyler in<br>second and third.  The three victorious gnomes were awarded several flasks<br>of brandy and graciously drank themselves into unconciousness on the Halas<br>pier!<br><br>Congrats to all racers for an extremely amusing event!

This file may be edited to put in alternate keyboard definitions. <br>Editing this file isn't exactly an easy task, but we're hoping that enough people will log on from the various areas to present us with alternate Keyboard.txt files that we can put up on the web page. <br><br>If any users of alternate standard keyboards would like to try their hand at editing the file, please give it a shot and test it out. Assuming everything works out, please email your modified Keyboard.txt file to jbutler@verant.com.<br><br>Here's a copy of the patch message that will be on the test server shortly:<br><br>---snip---<br>Today the testeqgame.exe file was updated to allow users to modify their keyboard layout in order to account for some international keyboards. When the executable launches, it will create a file in your EverQuest directory named KEYBOARD.TXT. You may modify this file using an ASCII text editor to substitute keys where appropriate. <br><br>The beginning of the file contains un-shifted keys, and the end contains the character that will be printed when the SHIFT key is depressed. Feel free to edit this file as you wish, but take care to leave any unprintable characters or spaces intact. If you make a mistake editing this file and have problems, merely delete the file. A new default version will be created the next time that testeqgame.exe is launched.<br><br>If you use a standardized keyboard layout other than QWERTY, such as the French AZERTY layout, we would be interested in seeing your version of the file. After youve modified and tested your version of the KEYBOARD.TXT file, please email it along with a description of what standard it is for to jbutler@verant.com. <br>---snip---<br><br>-Gordon<br></font><br></blockquote><br></font><br><br>More good news from Verant, as of late!

A new patch message today : <br><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><br><blockquote><font color=#a00000><br>June 15th, 8:00am<br>-----------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Hello everyone,<br><br>Over the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on<br>The Hole, in preparation of its release in the near future.  Even so, a<br>number of changes and additions were made in today's patch.  Most of the<br>changes are in regards to quests:<br><br>- The "Fleshy Orb" quest has been completed<br>- We've received word that "Fabian" has been spotted somewhere on<br>Norrath.<br>- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should been seen more regularly.<br>- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.<br>- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of the Lost<br>Circle.<br><br>A few items have also been changed this week:<br><br>- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced.<br>- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have<br>a short casting time associated with their activatable effect (See<br>Below).<br>- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear<br>when you log off (See Below.)<br><br><br>*Casting Times on Staff and Rod*<br><br>We received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items<br>to "spam" other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them<br>to disconnect.  Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text<br>messages caused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to<br>filter out spell-effect messages for spells cast upon you.<br><br>The short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the<br>targetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will<br>have to stand still to use them now.<br><br>*Gunthak Harpoon*<br><br>In the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon<br>"rentable", meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff.  Basically,<br>one of our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded<br>that it must be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it.<br>Unfortunately, the stats on this weapon, despite its disadvantages of<br>weight and its non-magical composition, make it much too powerful for<br>its location and difficulty in obtaining it.<br><br>For these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear<br>the next time that you log out.  This is a retroactive change and will<br>affect weapons already in possession.  We do apologize to those who<br>acquired it within the last week expecting that it would be a permanent<br>weapon.<br><br>*Chat / Login Process*<br><br>The Chat and Login server components are now completely separate,<br>meaning that players will no longer have difficulty logging in due to an<br>excess of people in the chat server.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br></font><br></blockquote><br></font>

Well, after I gathered my wits (my corpse) and some help from Mystical Starfyre, Vassa Arvando, Byrdd, Renrickk and Wuggan, we headed to the wooden bridge to end this menace.   And end him we did...

I read a post somewhere where you said it was a trade-off for the exceptional AC, yet there is no more AC than the comparable paladin armor and theirs is a third the weight of ours.<br>Is it because ogres and trolls can be SK's and they start with such high strength? Why penalize the small races simply because the large races have higher strength? Do they not pay for this in the form of an experience penalty? Let them have their strength advantage. It isn't fair to the rest of us who play smaller races.<br><br>What is your vision of a shadow knight? From the history of SK armor and weapons, I gather that it is a troll or ogre with a huge axe. Can you guys tone down on the Vision thing, please? It doesn't have to be cut and dry. Just because you see every shadow knight as a troll and ogre doesn't mean that the VAST majority of shadow knights are these two races. In fact it is the opposite. They are the minority. Don't adhere so closely to your Vision. Parts such as this should be a little more flexible.<br><br>And why is it that, even though trolls and ogres can be warriors, the Cobalt armor is as light as the paladin armor? Why is it that when it comes to the weight on SK armor and weapons (axes), the class is always measured in terms of a troll or ogre?<br><br>I think the weight issues on this armor should be reviewed and drastically reduced. Either that or increase the AC. And lay off the Vision a little, will ya?

A random GM event on Lanys : <br><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><br><blockquote><br>Hail,<br><br>Last night, I was strolling around west commons when I heard a shout from a<br>man named Jeroth asking if any warriors, paladins, or shadowknights were up<br>to a challenge, a test of honor. Well, feeling that if I didn't respond my<br>honor would be in question, I answered his request and was then told that I<br>was the one who would face the challenge. I met Jeroth in the corner of<br>commons near the shadowmen camp and he proceeded to tell me what was in<br>store. I found out that I was to face his 3 brothers, one at a time, in a<br>battle to the death. Once I killed the first brother, I was to return the<br>amulet wore around his neck back to Jeroth and would then receive my clue as<br>to the location of the next brother. Also, I was able to choose a team of<br>companions to aid my in my fight. Well, I choose friends that were near,<br>Carbo, Stratten, Taycie, Kaetlyn, and Canalon agreed to help me and we were<br>off to the desert of North Ro to kill the first brother. After that fight,<br>we returned and were told to meet the next in Kithicor, and after that<br>battle, my final brother to meet was in lava storm.<br><br>The first brother's name was Drewyn Wyndsteel and he was a warrior as<br>myself. The second brother was a monk by the name of Zev Thunderfis. The<br>third and final brother was an evil dark elf shadowknight by the name of<br>Dalesk V'Syrn. All three were difficult competitors, but all three died by<br>the end of my blades. Upon returning to Jeroth after the third brother, I<br>was told I would face my final confrontation in the Arena in West Freeport<br>and this battle was to be me alone. Well, we all assembled in Freeport and<br>after some problems with some over zealous guards, I was in the arena ready<br>to face my final battle. My opponent was the Spirit of Honor, and I was no<br>match for his obvious powers. I knew my doom was pending, so I saluted the<br>Spirit before he made the final blow, and was told to STOP fighting. He<br>congratulated me for passing all the trials and two more spirits showed up,<br>the Spirit of Fury and the Spirit of Heart. I was congratulated by all<br>three spirits, and was then awarded a blade, the Blade of Champions. I<br>vowed to do my best to uphold the name of this mighty blade and thanked the<br>Spirits who had gathered to test me.<br><br>I am honored that I was chosen to take place in this test, and I am<br>greateful for all those that helped. I wanted to take a moment to thank<br>everyone who followed me around to all the different spots and congratulated<br>me in the end.

The only safeguard against that would be a skill-based system that doesn't let you switch to the skill-lineup du jour, but of course, then it would really be a class-based system.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br></font></blockquote><FONT color=#a00000><br></font>

Although this interview is a little out of date, it still has some interesting bits about how Bill got his start in the games industry, and a few interesting looks at the game play side of EQ. There's also a Real Video format of this interview for those interested. Here's a snip from the page.<br><br>        Bryan Reynolds: I have a question about being a game designer. If you had to take some of the standard things you do in a day when you were building the game, what would they be?<br><br>        Bill Trost: It was mostly just sitting with blank paper, and saying &#8216;this would be cool.&#8217; Luckily we had creative writers who would write the history. Our primary quest designer, Tony Garcia, really did an awesome job, Tony is another guy I played D&D with ever since I was 10 years old.

Abashi replied to a post <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051383.html" target="_blank">in this thread</a> made on the <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true" target="_blank">Official EverQuest Forums</a> suggesting a method of EXP loss for PVP. Here are a few quotes from the slightly lengthy suggestion:<br><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><br><blockquote><br><i>This is designed with RZ in mind, but could work on the other PvP servers as well. It would require both additional coding and an additional two pieces of data per character.<br>Each character would require a new counter, TimesLooted that would begin at zero. (I can think of some characters on RZ that should start at 1000 or higher). Each time that the character loots another, the looting character's TimesLooted counter is increased by one. Each time a character suffers a PvP death, is PKed, they lose exp equal to 1% of the amount needed to completely fill out the exp bar at their level, TIMES the current value of the times looted. So, somone who has never looted another character w/o consent, would never lose exp to PvP death, while someone with 100 loots to their 'credit' would lose an entire level each time he was PKed. This would permit angry victims of frequent PK item-looters to delevel the PKer. Meanwhile, you may PK to your heart's content with no risk of exp loss, as long as you NEVER loot. And, if you succumb to temptation once and loot that item you have been dreaming of, it would hurt as you lost exp every time you were PKed, but it might still be worth it...</i><br><hr><br><i>Ideally, one should allow for the possibility of a character 'reforming'. To implement this, we would need a second counter, LastLootedTime, that would be assigned the character's playedtime value at the point of looting w/o consent. Every time another loot happens, LastLootedTime is advanced to that playedtime. When the playedtime exceeds the LastLootedTime by 10 days (10 days of on-line time w/o looting) the TimesLooted counter, if not zero, is decreased by one.</i><br><hr><br><i>This is hardly the perfect solution. [It would also require a change in the harrassment policies].</i><br><hr><br>To read the whole thing, check the link above. The post is lengthy and details a fairly well-thought method. However, EQ was not designed form the ground-up as a PVP game, which would make this hard even if EXP loss were easy to implement/were implemented.<br><br></blockquote></font><br><br>Here is Abashi's response:<br><br><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><br><blockquote><br><font color=#a00000><br>Being very honest with you, any type of experience loss for PvP deaths is not at all likely to be put in EQ. The GM/Guide staff is already inundated with requests for customer service based upon harassment even though there is substantially little risk. The core engine of EQ cannot support the changes that would be necessary in order to implement experience-loss on PvP in an equitable manner. <br>That said, I do recognize the need for risk in PvP. One idea that I'm partial to is making it so that binding is *only* allowed in cities, regardless of class. That would encourage people to win battles, punish them if they lose, and be fair for both melee and casters from a PvP perspective.<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>-Gordon<br></font><br></blockquote><br></font>

We wern't the perfect party, but we were fairly well rounded and more than able to defend ourselves.<br><br>We were, one 54 necro, one 53 necro, one 53 druid, one 52 shaman, one 52 magician, and a rake, which I assume is some sort of gardening instrument. (Ok, we had a 52 rogue.)<br><br>Anyhow, we came in from the Overhere entrance (because auto-follow is buggy when the Z aspect changes a lot - READ: don't /follow over hills) instead of gating to Dreadlands and going through Burning Woods. We set up camp at in the entry corridor and pulled mobs to us for 5 hours. Here is what we found out.<br><br>We killed one level 39 or smaller mob. Only one greenie existed in the zone as far as we could tell. A "rich" mob dropped 6pp. Fair enough. Your poorer mobs dropped about 6sp each. After 5 hours of semi-constant pulling (necros in lich form) as loot master I /split 91 252 with the group. <br><br>As "special" loot, we recieved one Star Ruby. Oh good. =(<br><br>Admittedly we never managed to get the Ancient - as the only group in the zone (why was that?) we always had too much to clear; but we got PLENTY of mature mobs who dropped little nitlims, Rose Quarts, and even some other 5pp jewlery.<br><br>Of course, I did manage to get THREE PIXELS OF EXPERIENCE tonight.<br><br>Is the risk/reward set correctly for this zone? Will this zone exist SOLEY as a meeting groups for Veeshan's groups or were people meant to hunt here. MUCH MUCH better items on much smaller mobs (30-40) drops in Dreadlands. I should know, I killed enough of them trying to find out where that Dread Widow spawned.<br><br>In conclusion, the primary difference between Skyfires and Lavastorm is this.

However in Skyfire, *everything* is pretty nasty, with those encounters being the rule rather than the exception. Many groups can hunt there nonstop and never run out of things to kill. Given that, they just can't drop the 10-30pp per kill of other encounters.<br><br>As for the XP, the mobs in Skyfire give more experience than mobs of a relative level in any other outdoor zone in the world.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br></font></blockquote></font>

We didn't used to make norent items disappear on linkdeath, but many people then would go linkdead as the preferred method of leaving the game for the purpose of saving the bags. Also, once a character is out of the world, we don't maintain a record of them to allow removal of the bags after, for instance, an hour.<br><br>As far as moving the items out of the bags, that would present some major problems in the event that inventory is full. <br><br>Given these issues, the chance of losing the items on linkdeath will probably remain one of the risks of using the summoned bags.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br><br></font></blockquote></font>

Hgs are not always an option and when you are killing high lvl mobs you SHOULD get high lvl loot not crap that an orc pawn would snear at.<br><br>BTW, No I do not think that i should be forced into a dungeon just to get money, and if it is lower lvl plat we are talking about i will just go to cazic and KS lvl 20s or even upper guk and solo 7 mobs at once, since the loot doesn't go up after 30.<br><br><br><br></blockquote><br></font><br><br>Gordon responded with his opinion on the economy, and how that Verant is tweaking the cash drops of MOBs:<br><br><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><blockquote><font color=#a00000><br>It is true that cash drops in general are getting lower. In addition to the Kunark zones all being set up to drop less cash, other zones are likewise being modified. "Cash Cows", such as the dwarves in Butcherblock that used to drop an average of 27pp every six minutes, are being identified and adjusted.<br><br>Good items cost "thousands of plat" because of the amount of excess cash in the world. As the money sinks take their toll, the price of the items will drop to a level of equilibrium with the current cash drops.

Never has the idea of slaying Orcs and Goblins been<br>so attractive as when you can engage in said slaughter with friends over the<br>internet in a fully 3D venue. Even for non D&D fanatics, Everquest has an<br>enthralling quality that draws you into the game and keeps you shelling out<br>the $10 US per month to play. The quest for new items and experience points<br>can and will keep you up far past all respectable hours. And this is what Everquest (EQ) is all about. Acquiring that new fancy item<br>or getting a new set of spells when you hit level 22 is enough to keep most people playing the game for ages.

From L'vanon:<br><blockquote><font color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>Too long have the daydwellers of Norrath rested easily, thinking the <br>knowledge of the Will of Innoruuk buried forever. A new age has come upon us, and new lands have been discovered. It is time that Our Father's words be heard once more. <br><br>Many have visited the Library of the Firstborn and found guidance, but many more have yet to hear of the Glories of Innoruuk. Therefore, one year after its first opening, the Library of the Firstborn has been renovated and now stands open to welcome all who come seeking knowledge of the Will. <br><br>If you are Teir'Dal, come to the Library and learn of your birthright. Those of you who are old friends and have lost the way to the Library, we welcome you back. <br><br>If you are of another race, come and lessen your ignorance of the ways of the Dark Elves. <br><br>In the halls of the Library can be found many texts concerning Teir'Dal culture and the worship of Innoruuk, a forum for posting things of interest, and even a newly added discussion hall where you can meet with other visitors to the Library. <br><br>The doors to the Library can be found at <A HREF="http://firstborn.eqhq.com">http://firstborn.eqhq.com</a> <br><br>May Innoruuk use you well, <br><br>L'vanon <br>Firstborn Priest of Innoruuk <br>High Priest, Church of the Firstborn </font></blockquote><br>

We'll be holding another event this Saturday, June 10th, at 8:30pm PST, in and around Qeynos. This event is the second edition of YAAP (the Young dventurers Assistance Program). All races are welcome - we will be stationed outside the gates. We'll have food, drink, buffs, and weapons available for free for characters under 10 seasons. Armor for all classes available for free or for easy tasks. Magic items will also be given for simple quests and contests, which we'll customize for participants.  Expect role-playing, races, and anything else that looks fun. Equipment will NOT be "uber-twink"; expect fine steel, banded, raw silk and the like. If you have Crafted Armor or a Flowing Black Robe at 5 seasons, you've already had enough assistance :-).  <br><br>More experienced adventurers are cordially invited too! We'll have a free 6-pack for anyone who wants to imbibe, and you're welcome for storytelling, buffing the youngsters, helping out in your own way, or just having a good time.<br> <br>We hope to see you there!<br></font></blockquote><br>Hey, maybe I'll drop in!

The Skill of Pick Pocket, and it's pros and cons.<br>            <br>I play a Rogue, which happens to be the only class that gets the skill "Pick Pocket." This means that if the player base were equally divided, at most less then 8% of the player base (over level 7) would have ever even used this skill, let alone understands it. Rogues are one of the least played classes, which makes this percentage even smaller. It is my goal to share with you the workings of Pick Pocket.<br><br>Pick Pocket has been an issue nearly since release, and is often the deciding factor on a Rogue getting a group. Despite good, fast damage, unrivaled scouting and excellent corpse recovery, the Rogue class is still looked down upon simply because of this skill. Let me explain a few things about it.<br><br>Rogues acquire "Pick Pocket" at Level 7. It has a 10 second recycle time. First and foremost, nothing can be Pick Pocketed that is marked MAGIC or any items that are equipped; only humanoid creatures can be Pick Pocketed (i.e. no undead or animals). On top of that, no MOBs level 45+ can be Pick Pocketed whatsoever. Also, the Rogue has no control over what is taken items or coins. Even though items can be pick pocketed, it is a rare thing in the life of the Rogue. The majority of the time, coins will be stolen. Even then, it's not guaranteed that very much will be taken. At level 15, it is very rare for me to Pick Pocket Gold, Silver is almost common, but the majority of what I steal is Copper. I have never stolen Platinum. The deciding factor on how much is stolen (and how much can be stolen) is ultimately based on the MOB's loot pool. Although there was previously a bug that allowed a Rogue to endlessly steal small amounts of Copper, this has been corrected and everything stolen is now taken from the loot pool. So if the loot is considerably lower then normal, there has probably been a lot of Pick Pocketing going on (or an avid fan of the skill "Beg" hehe); you can also tell when a Rogue steal because many (mind you, not all) MOB's will yell, "Stop Thief! <Rogue's name>"<br><br>As unfriendly as this skill sounds it can be useful to others besides the Rogue. Although Rogues are a pure melee class, we don't get the skill "Taunt." Many of us would like it, to have even better personal crowd control (in addition to Evade). As Backstab has a taunt factor built into it, so does Pick Pocket. It is possible to taunt a MOB off someone with Pick Pocket.<br><br>One of the main reason we like to Pick Pocket is simply to keep this skill maxed out. Around level 20+, Pick Pocketing becomes more of a hindrance then a help to a Rogue. The constant loot of small change quickly adds to his weight, thus making the coins virtually useless.<br><br>I, and the majority of the Rogues I know, ask before Pick Pocketing in a group.

The player who selects the number <br>closest to the number of players on Each server, without going over, will win <br>70% of the prize. The next closest will win 20 % of the donations and the <br>third closest will win 10 %. All items donated will be awarded to the first <br>place finisher. <br><br>De rulez. <br><br>Numbers are secured by response to this post. No entry fee. You must list <br>your character's name and your prediction in Tallon Zek / Vallon Zek Order. <br><br>Your predictions should be in 100 unit increments i.e. 100/3000 meaning 100 <br>players on Tallon 3000 players on Vallon. <br><br>Predictions will close at Noon (12PM EDT) the day before the switch. <br><br>One post per character per Eqvault screen name, we will filter screen the <br>name combos. So please don't abuse the fun with multiple postings. Also all <br>anonymous names will be deleted. <br><br>Award will be made at the first available opportunity that the winners and <br>Zamzi can find a quiet corner of the world and trade. For obvious reasons <br>there will be no "Awards Ceremony". <br><br>All rules are subject to change without notice. I have never run a lottery <br>before and if I have seriously overlooked something critical I will correct <br>it. <br><br>Additional prizes, I would like to develop this to be a little more worthy <br>prize wise but as a 22nd level guild less Shaman I don't have more to offer. <br>If you like this idea and can afford to bolster the prize total please post <br>your donation here and I will give an in game tell to arrange pick up. I <br>would love a friendly Wizzie to help with this step. All money and items <br>collected will be given out as prizes. I am not keeping any thing, only doing <br>this cuz it sounds like fun. (And even if it is a screaming success I will <br>not be called on to do something like it again, the event is just too unique) <br>Open posting keeps it all honest and on the up and up if a little cumbersome. <br><br>The primary goal of the lottery is to have some fun. The secondary goal is to <br>smoke out who knows their smack versus the tongue wagers who don't know <br>squat. The final goal is to encourage a healthy player base on Vallon Zek so <br>all prizes will be awarded there. So put your thinking cap on, and post your <br>prediction and we will see you back on the First Saturday Night following the <br>switch, 10PM EDT if you cannot play at that time we will post the results on <br>this thread. <br><br>Zamzi De Troll<br>Vallon Zek (and staying)<br></blockquote><br></font>

In the mean time, they are bored to death. Our goal in these cases is to make doing more exciting things, such as fighting in a dungeon, "faster".

Specific's will be posted in the patch message tomorrow morning. If you can point out any issues that you think should be covered in the patch, please follow up in this thread.<br><br>In regards to possible moves or looting changes for RZ, none are planed or likely.

It will be announced in the patch message when it goes in. I can't say for certain whether this will be tomorrow or whether it will be held off until the next item patch at the moment. [Note: It wasn't added in today's patch]<br><br><b>-Spell Drop Rates-</b><br><br>We'll be increasing them, but do want to maintain a rate at which they are still desired drops, and not loot that you just destroy because it's taking up space in your backpack.<br><br><b>-Alchemy Prices-</b><br><br>We'll be adjusting these, making alchemy less expensive. It won't be in tomorrow's patch, but probably in the one after that.<br><br><b>-Poison-</b><br><br>Still looking good for an end-of-june implementation.<br><br><b>-Clipping Plane-</b><br><br>Several months ago some people complained that they were no longer able to adjust the clipping plane out as far as they had been. We've gone through all of the zone headers and put the "Maximum Clip" out as far as the data export would allow. This has been live for a while and we've been unable to find any other problems.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br></font></blockquote></font><br><br>Talk about good news!

There was a new patch today that modified a number of things to the game, and gave several reminders on various items. Here is the patch message:<br><br><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><blockquote><font color=#a00000><br><br><b>June 6th, 8:00am<br>-----------------</b><br><br><b><i><u>*Patch Day*</u></i></b><br><br>Greetings! The live servers have been updated to reflect the newest data on the Test Server:<br><br><b><i><u>*General*</u></i></b><br><br>- Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes. Check your Kunark spell vendors.<br>- Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall to their deaths upon zoning. The majority of these issues should no longer occur.<br>- Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including the Brain Bite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest.<br>- Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The Emerald Jungle, Sebilis, and the Frontier Mountains.<br>- Upon review we've increased the drop-rate of level 51+ spells in Kunark. They should be more plentiful now. <br>- Updated pathing information in many zones, making it easier for pets and other NPCs to get around the zones.<br><br><b><i><u>*Items*</u></i></b><br><br>- A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed Sword. Current owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade their sword out for a working one.<br>- The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain in your possession when you leave the game.<br>- A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced in weight.<br>- Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in Kunark.<br><br><b><i><u>*PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions*</u></i></b><br><br>Due to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently mesmerize or stun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, illusions will now automatically cancel when the person wearing the illusion casts an offensive spell upon any player-character. Players should keep this in mind before attacking with spells in an area where their faction standing is less than desirable. <br><br>Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different than they actually are. This includes all racial illusions, as well as other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series. <br><br><b><i><u>*Risk and Reward*</u></i></b><br><br>The concept of risk and reward is very important to the game of EverQuest. Ideally, situations that provide a greater reward should also provide substantial risk. Over the past several weeks, we've been identifying areas in game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and making necessary adjustments. <br><br>In most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward for a specific action. For example, we recently increased the experience awarded in many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-considerable risk associated with adventuring there. We also do this quite frequently by increasing the reward associated with a quest by enhancing the item, as we did last week with the Burning Rapier quest. <br><br>However, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in excess of the risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues like those above as we come across them. For example, there are many cases where a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast spawn", yielding the reward of fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk. <br><br>Though it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we did want to let you know that you will see risk/reward disparities corrected over the next several weeks.<br><br><b><i><u>*PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers*</u></i></b><br><br>As many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are aware, Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek have different rules regarding looting rights from PvP combat. Vallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin plus one item from the fallen, whereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot with no right to loot items.<br><br>Due to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek post-production, we've decided to allow characters on both servers a one-time character-move. Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT on Friday, June 9th, 2000, on both servers, and will be open through 12:00pm PDT on Monday, June 12th, 2000. You can register for the move by executing the "/movelog yes" command during the registration window. There is no limit to the number of people that we will allow to move between Tallon and Vallon Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter the command.<br><br>Please remember that once you register for the move, your decision can not be rescinded. The actual character-move will take place sometime next week, at a time to be announced later. Please keep in mind that corpses are not moved in a character-move, so we'd recommend against leaving unclaimed corpses around after Monday of next week if you've asked to be moved. <br><br>Questions about the move process will be addressed in the Gameplay Message Forum available via www.everquest.com.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br></font></blockquote></font><br><br>Sounds like some good news for many people in today's patch!

We've posted a brand new issue of <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo/default.asp">ASK MILO</a>. This week Milo talks about the well endowed character models in EQ, revenue the game generates on a monthly basis, Pirates and Metallica, and of course the usually barrage of ramblings and submitted questions. Head on over to the page to get the full hook up, here's a snip from a question. <br><blockquote>Hey I have a quick question for you. I'll give you a little background since I have started playing this game I chose a Paladin hoping to get awsome armor sword etc. Well I am satisfied with the human armor visuals except one thing, the helmet that whole tin man bucket head thing just doesn't work for me and I wanted to know if you had anything to do with that design because its horrible. I wonder why you just didnt make the Human helmets similar or exact to the militia ones those are nice. I'll give you props on those, your guard models are great but one more thing. The butts on the models??? why are they so screwed up are you just not good at modeling butts? because you handled the chest area very nicely. But the rear is a different story. I hope you can answer my questions and possibly fix those in the near future. If at all possible well thanks for giving me the time of day and keep up the good work.</blockquote><br>Catalyst<br><br>

Probably more than anything else it is an ability which singlehandedly can save people more time and reduce their frustration than any other spell or skill I can think of.

But I still believe that, as it stands, cleric ressurection spells have to be changed drastically removed.</blockquote><br></font><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><blockquote><font color=#a00000>Bloodlord,<br>Thank you for taking the time to write up your opinion. Though I understand the issues that you are bringing to light, we wouldn't be interested in removing resurrection or diluting it by adding it to a few other classes. Two classes have the ability to do high-xp componentless resurrections now, giving an advantage to those people who group with or make friends with those classes. <br><br>The game is meant to give an advantage to those who form relationships and/or fight in groups. The ability to get a resurrection when you'd like one is one of those advantages. <br><br>If there is a shortage of clerics and paladins in the early hours of the morning, it should only be a matter of time before some people move in with those classes to fill the gap. Clerics are one class that nearly everyone would agree is necessary for high-level groups, so the ability to go places that you couldn't normally go without a cleric will draw people to play them.<br><br>I do wonder why you would suggest that it be removed. There is no disadvantage to it being in game, only an advantage for when you are able to obtain a resurrection. My suggestion would be to start looking at resurrection as a benefit rather than an entitlement. Perhaps that way you could not expect resurrections, and be pleased when you are able to obtain one. There's nothing to gain by removing it.<br><br>-Gordon<br>

"What is that" Xiandru Cloudwalker yelled to his group.  A GIANT of giants was bearing down on the small band.  Spell after spell hit the great beast.  Slowly "The Folk" beat it down. Xiandru's blasts of power shook the beast to his heels while Celina and<br>Tylon chopped away at his exposed legs.  But the beast would not be put down.  A shimmer blue light encircled his body and he gained momentum and became more invigored.<br><br>Again "The Folk" beat him down.  The clerics, Landeth, Zardac, and Samsara could barely keep up with the heals.  Pandorae and Eynel were vigorously trying to gain enough strength to slow the beast while Celebairn rocked it<br>with blast after blast.  We called for help but noone was near.  The other members of the guild were not strong enough to face such a beast.  But slowly he was beat down again.  With a sliver of health left and all of "The Folk" near exaustion Xiandru Cloudwalker let out one last blast and fell to the ground as the Giant toppled over him.<br><br>Again and again the clerics tried to raise their companion with no success. In a last ditch effort they all joined hands to channel their energy through Samsara's spell of life.  A burst of light appeared before the group.  Soft and gentle the light floated above the ground.  Tunare in all her splendor stood before the humbled group.<br><br>"My children, do not fret.  Your friend has chosen a place beside me.  His deeds on Norrath surpassed those of all mortals.  I am in need of him now."<br>At that time the quiet, unassuming druid, Xiandru appeared beside the<br>benevolent god, a glow of soft white light surrounding him.  Each member he hugged and with his touch they each knew he would be fine.<br><br>"To each of you I bestow the gift of everlasting friendship. Treasure this gift above all others and remember I am only a thought or memory away"<br>Xiandru whispered as he faded away with Tunare.<br><br>/em bows his head in a moment of silence.<br><br>OOC<br><br>The Folk of Fennin Ro would like to take this moment to say farewell to Xiandru Cloudwalker (Joe Castillo), Guild Master, mentor, and dear friend to The Folk and many others.  Xia (Joe) passed away suddenly on May 18th due to pneumonia at the age of 29.  He leaves behind a thriving guild and many, many great memories.<br><br>Farewell Xiandru Cloudwalker you will be missed.<br><br>Signed,<br>Tylon, Celina, Pandorae, Landeth, Zardac, Eynel, Samsara, Celebairn,<br>Zaldaroo, Shakti, Cordak, Hamelon, Nuven, Jynzo, Deltrist, Uthuas, Talaren,Tebryn, Corinth, Enick, Archaegeo<br></blockquote></font><br><br>In behalf of all of EQSS and Stratics.com, I wish to send out our deepest condolences to Joe's Family, Friends, and Guildmates.

A farewell to Xiandru Cloudwalker: <BLOCKQUOTE>  <font face="Times New Roman" size="2" color="#050056"><br>Gathered at their favorite hunting grounds in Rathe Mountains "The Folk" slayed giant after giant.  "What is that" Xiandru Cloudwalker yelled to his group.  A GIANT of giants was bearing down on the small band.  Spell after spell hit the great beast.  Slowly "The Folk" beat it down. Xiandru's blasts of power shook the beast to his heels while Celina and Tylon chopped away at his exposed legs.  But the beast would not be put down.  A shimmer blue light encircled his body and he gained momentum and became more invigored.<br><br>Again "The Folk" beat him down.  The clerics, Landeth, Zardac, and Samsara could barely keep up with the heals.  Pandorae and Eynel were vigorously trying to gain enough strength to slow the beast while Celebairn rocked it with blast after blast.  We called for help but noone was near.  The other members of the guild were not strong enough to face such a beast.  But slowly he was beat down again.  With a sliver of health left and all of "The Folk" near exaustion Xiandru Cloudwalker let out one last blast and fell to the ground as the Giant toppled over him.<br><br>Again and again the clerics tried to raise their companion with no success. In a last ditch effort they all joined hands to channel their energy through<br>Samsara's spell of life.  A burst of light appeared before the group.  Soft and gentle the light floated above the ground.  Tunare in all her splendor stood before the humbled group.<br><br>"My children, do not fret.  Your friend has chosen a place beside me.  His deeds on Norrath surpassed those of all mortals.  I am in need of him now." At that time the quiet, unassuming druid, Xiandru appeared beside the benevolent god, a glow of soft white light surrounding him.  Each member he hugged and with his touch they each knew he would be fine.<br><br>"To each of you I bestow the gift of everlasting friendship. Treasure this gift above all others and remember I am only a thought or memory away" Xiandru whispered as he faded away with Tunare.<br><br>/em bows his head in a moment of silence.<br><br>OOC<br><br>The Folk of Fennin Ro would like to take this moment to say farewell to Xiandru Cloudwalker (Joe Castillo), Guild Master, mentor, and dear friend to The Folk and many others.  Xia (Joe) passed away suddenly on May 18th due to pneumonia at the age of 29.  He leaves behind a thriving guild and many, many great memories.<br><br>Farewell Xiandru Cloudwalker you will be missed.<br><br>Signed,<br>Tylon, Celina, Pandorae, Landeth, Zardac, Eynel, Samsara, Celebairn, Zaldaroo, Shakti, Cordak, Hamelon, Nuven, Jynzo, Deltrist, Uthuas, Talaren, Tebryn, Corinth, Enick, and Archaegeo.<br><br></font> </BLOCKQUOTE>  If you have any letter or anything to send to "The Folk" please write them to <a href="mailto:n.tracy@gte.net">this email address</a> and they will be passed along to The Folk's mailing list.

But, being the kind of person who makes the most of the time they have, I invariably am casting the spell the instant it is available and have been seeing the error message every time I do that.<br><br>I've noticed for a while that a lot of spellcasting is controlled client-side. It sounds to me like someone came up with a hack/exploit to ignore re-cast time on spells, so Verant made a fix to check recast times on the server side as well. <br></font> <br><font face="Times New Roman" size="2" color="#800000">It's actually not "controlled" by the client, but rather controlled by *both* client and server in a manner that allows it to prevent hacking, while negating the need for communication between the client and the server. <br><br>For instance, if it was purely the client, the server would just cast any spell that it was instructed to regardless of any other rules, thus it would be hackable. If it was controlled solely by the server, the server would have to send a message to the client telling it when it was OK for it to cast another spell. By having it done on both sides, the server only has to send a message to the client in the event that it was told to do something illegal. <br><br>Doing it in this method also reduces the effect of internet latency. Given pure server side control, any purposeful delays would be exacerbated by internet latency. For instance, someone running 1000 ping would have to wait an additional second before they could cast the next spell. <br><br>Anyway, we're checking on this issue, and should have a fix up the next time we patch the client, probably early next week. In the meantime, I'd suggest that people wait an extra half a second before casting the next spell in a chain-casting situation. <br><br>- Gordon<br><br><br></font><br></BLOCKQUOTE>

Gordon Posts <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/047848.html">here</a> on the <a href="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true">Everquest Offical Forums</a>:<br><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><br><blockquote><br><font color=#a00000><br>Some of you will recall that we made some changes to the druid root series a month or so ago that was supposed to make them function better. Though there was a bit of a placebo effect at the time where many agreed that they were working better, after a while it turned out that there wasn't a real difference. <br>The problem was that the damage being dealt by these spells would cause the spell itself to break. In the text window, the users of these spells would actually see the "wear off" message *before* the spell effect message. <br><br>Anyway, this is now fixed (really we mean it this time :). Damaged caused by a damage dealing root spell no longer have a chance to break the root. This includes the entire druid root series, as well as the necromancer undead-only "Hungry Earth" spell. The fix is live on test and should go to the production servers in the next patch.<br><br>-Gordon<br></font><br></blockquote><br></font><br>Ah. Nice.

This is a REAL problem..I've seen many high level casters with jboots KS lower level groups trying to get the Ring in order to do the quest.

If the fact that casters want to wear this ring is partly responsible for the speed that jboots are coming in game, we probably wouldn't want to change it.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br></font></blockquote><FONT color=#a00000><br></font>

Gordon talks about rangers <A HREF=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/047410.html>here</A> on the <A HREF=http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true>Official EverQuest Forums</a> : <br><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><br><blockquote><br>Rangers are reporting that at 51+ levels in Kunark we are becoming group-unfriendly because we are taking inordinate damage since Mobs are directing most of their attacks against Rangers while Warriors, Paladins, and SKs are unable to effectively taunt them off. As a result, Rangers have been asking for increases in defensive skills. We are basing these conclusions on the "real-world" results of playing in Kunark.<br>You, Abashi, have represented the Verant position that Rangers are "balanced" and that there is no problem with the class. You believe that the class has the capabilities in Kunark that you intend it to have and therefore no defense skill increases are warranted. You have based this upon the "paper and pencil" work done by the design team and a limited amount of testing in Beta.<br><br>MAYBE WE ARE BOTH RIGHT. Let's give each other the courtesy of assuming that we are.<br><br>What then accounts for the disparity?<br><br>I submit that one way that Rangers and Verant can both be right is if there is a problem in the way that the mechanics of Taunt and/or the "Hate List" operate. So here are some ideas that perhaps warrant investigation:<br><br>Taunt: As I understand it, taunting gives the taunter one more "point" on the hate list than the highest person on the hate list at the time of the taunt. Perhaps this needs to be reexmined. Because if true, a fast weapon wielder (e.g., Ranger) can immediately replace that taunter with a hit of as little as 2 dmg. Now imagine the taunter is a Paladin wielding a 2-hander. It's easy to see how that a taunting Paladin will never displace the Ranger on the hate list if the Ranger is wielding typical Ranger 1 handers. Potential Fix: Increase the effect of taunt to something like +25 or +30 points above the highest person on the hate list.<br><br>Hate List: We don't know exactly how this works. Obviously one factor on getting onto the hate list is damage dealt over time. However, we also know that movement reducing spells will get you to the very top of the hate list. We know that mez will get you to the top. There is some indication that, as implausible as it sounds, the mob will move you to the top of the hate list based upon your low HPs and/or low AC (hence Mobs' fascination with Rangers). But let's say it is primarily based on damage over time. The questions are: how often is the hate list refreshed? and damage over how much time? Maybe the mechanics of the hate list need to be reworked.<br><br>Let's look at the impact of the "hate list" refresh rate being too fast. Here is a SIMPLIFIED, CONTRIVEDand CONCEPTUAL example for illustration ONLY. Let's say the Ranger swings every time interval, the Warrior every 5 intervals, and the Mob every four time intervals. Now if a "new" hate list is generated every 1 time interval, and the hate list only accumulates damage for one time interval, the result could be:<br><br>(SNIP -Dhark)<br><br>Ranger Total damage: 400<br>Warrior Total damage: 450<br><br>In the above example the Warrior exceeds the Ranger's melee output by 12.5%. Nevertheless, the Ranger receives all of the Mob's attacks. Why? Because the hate list is refreshed too often and also because it accumulates damage for only one time interval. Please remember I have contrived the above only to illustrate the issue I am raising.<br><br><br>Now let's look at the impact of the "hate list" damage accumulation period being too short. Here is a SIMPLIFIED, CONTRIVEDand CONCEPTUAL example for illustration ONLY. Let's say the Ranger swings every time interval, the Warrior every 4 intervals, and the Mob every three time intervals. Now if the hate list is refreshed whenever the Mob attack timer generates an attack (3 time intervals in this example) and the hate list only accumulates damage for five time intervals, the result could be:<br><br>(SNIP -Dhark)<br><br>Ranger Total damage: 400<br>Warrior Total damage: 480<br><br>In the above example the Warrior exceeds the Ranger's melee output by 20%. Nevertheless, the Ranger receives 80% of the Mob's attacks. Given the high AC and high defensive skills of the warrior, there is a significant chance the Mob will miss (do no damage) in it's attack on the Warrior thus giving the impression that the Ranger was attacked 100% of the time (instead of the already high 80%). So why did the Ranger receive 80% of the Mob's attacks in this example? Because the hate list accumulates/tracks damage for too short a period of time. Now here's the point: If the hate list tracked damage for 10 time intervals instead of 5 time intervals, then in the above example on the Mob's third attack in time interval 09 the Mob would attack the warrior and remain aggro'd on the warrior for the rest of the fight. Please remember I have contrived the above only to illustrate the issue I am raising.<br><br><br>Now some argue that the Ranger should refrain from initiating attacks in order for the Warrior to "build up his position on the hate list". As any Ranger 51+ can tell you, and as I've attempted to illustrate with the above, that concept does not work since moments after finally beginning his own attacks the Ranger will receive all of the Mob's attention anyway based upon what I believe is are flawed "hate list" mechanics. Some also argue that the Ranger should periodically stop his attacks. Once again, while that would initially work, once re-engaging, the Mob almost immediately would return to the Ranger. However, this begs a larger question, is it really Verant's intention that Rangers should spend so much time NOT in melee combat? And why would any group want such a non-contributor in the group?<br><br>A few other thoughts: <br><br>Does the Mob's AI make it single out for attack a PC based upon the PC's AC or HPs? Now that Rangers have the lowest AC/HP of any melee class and lower than some caster-classes, if the position on the hate List is affected by AC/HP, then was this taken into consideration by Verant in design/testing? Perhaps the aggro factor of low AC?HP needs to be reduced.<br><br>Is the position on the hate list influenced by MISSED attacks? Many Rangers think it is. Thus even though outdamaged by Warriors, Monks, and Rogues, our fast attacks, many of which are missed may be raising us an inordinate amount on the hate list. Perhaps the aggro factor of missed attacks needs to be reduced.<br><br>I would ask that Verant reexamine the manner in which taunt and the "hate list" operate. SOMETHING is causing Rangers to receive an inordinate amount of attention from Mobs and we are getting creamed as a result. It is a balance issue because it is limiting our usefulness in groups. If we are "balanced" as you assert, then it can only be that things are happening in game of which you are unaware.<br><br>Verant, I urge you to look into the manner in which Taunt and the "hate list" are operating and the negative impact it is having on Rangers. Should you determine that there is any validity to the CONCEPTUAL issues I've raised, please fix them. If it turns out that fixes are too difficult to make because the mechanics of taunt and the hate list are buried too deeply in the game engine, then I believe you need to reexamine your position on Ranger defensive skill increases.<br><br>Balerius Silvae<br>Pathfinder<br>Rodcet Nife<br><FONT color=#a00000><br><B><I>Gordon Responds</i></B><br>Though the numbers are arbitrary, this is probably the best argument I've seen yet on the subject. Of course we have commented in the past that if you are getting hit too much, maybe you should back off for a few combat rounds and let the critter get stuck on someone who can take the damage. The frequent counter to this is that they shouldn't have to back off for a few rounds, yet other classes have to do this all of the time. A wizard can't just go in chain-casting ice-comment and expect to be ignored. A necro can't stack 5 DOTs on the critter plus have a pet beating on it and remain safe. Palys and SKs frequently don't have the problem of attracting unwanted attention, but Bards certainly do. <br>How about just backing off for a few seconds?<br><br>-Gordon<br><br></font><FONT color=#050056><br>>>>The problem is that stopping attacks and backing off simply does NOT work. Honest. First the mob continues to stay aggro'd on us for 4-5 attacks rounds at a minimum. Second, if and when it finally turns on the warrior (after we have not attacked for at least 4-5 attack rounds) as soon as we reengage we are INSTANTLY back at the top of the hate list.<br></font><FONT color=#a00000><br>As some have heard, we've put a spell up on test to check out this issue. I can't promise that it will go live at this point, but if it does, it will not only cause rangers to step out of combat for a few seconds, but will also reduce their hate-value as a reward. <br><br>-Gordon<br></font><br></blockquote><br></font><br>I had to snip some of the calculations, go check out the original post :)

Aaroon is just a dummy character which attacked Tolkar and pulled him near my character.

The core focus of operations will center on the games-developer studio Verant in San Diego, which is charged with creating more hardcore online games, a genre with which Sony has done well. Most notably, the subscription-based medieval adventure game EverQuest serves more than 500,000 subscribers who pay $9.89 a month for the game, plus up to $50 for the off-the-shelf software. <br><br><br>Other games coming down the pike include the sequel EverQuest 2, a new game called Sovereign, a Star Wars-related game and a proposed project connected to the upcoming PlayStation 2. <br><br><br>Flock previously ran the Sony PlayStation gaming studio 989 Studios but left earlier this year after Sony Computer Entertainment America rolled the unit back into the parent company. He has since been in discussions with Stringer and was lured back to the firm in April to lead Sony Online Entertainment. <br><br><br>Insiders say Flock didn't think much of the online entertainment unit's free offerings, which were advertising-supported, and chose instead to focus his energy on more-lucrative subscription games. <br><br>--Kenneth Li<br><br></blockquote><br></font><br>I wonder what this means to Verant and EverQuest as we know it?*fearful look* (PS - Snips included some different items in Sony)
