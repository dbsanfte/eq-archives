<p>Ok, continueing where I stopped writing yesterday.



<p>The next day I logged in again and thought about taking the last bubble to 14 by killing Mooto. By that I would also have a fair chance of finally getting that squad ring too.



<p>I sold off all my loot first though and did a /who on Rivervale. Mordor, from Runnyeye, was online and I asked him if everything went well the other day. Seemed they didn't encounter much trouble after that Evil Eye. He asked me if I wanted to take on Nillipus too. For you who don't know who Nillipus is I can tell you that he's probably the smallest citizen of all Norrath, running around stealing Jum Jum Juice from the merchants. He'd conned red to me for quite some time so I hesitated on Mordor's offer. He told me we'd have a fair chance killing him though, so we went to his spawn point.



<p>Another player, a gnome wizard was there already waiting for him though. As he saw us he threw an invis on himself, hoping that we would think he was gone. By using the /who command we could still see that he was there though, he didn't gate or anything.



<p>We considered it a fair figth and waited for Nillipuss to spawn. Once he finally did our wizard competitioner came forth and blasted poor Nillie to itsy bitsy pieces. I had the time to con him though and it turned out that he was a gamble (yellow).



<p>Oh well, that was a waste of time. Mordor decided to departure to Qyenos and I headed for the Thicket.



<p>Ugh. Misty Thicket is boring compared to what I've experienced by now. West Commonlands is both more beautifull and more exciting. After I had camped Mooto twice I was so bored out of my mind. With Derin offline I decided to try going to the West Commonlands by myself.



<p>I still trecked the wall in Kithicor, as it was dark. As soon as I get to do a trip through Kithicor when it's day I'll take the road. For now the wall would protect me from those werewolves.



<p>I found the West Commonlands to be more easy navigated than I thought. From the entrance point to Kithicor all you have to do is to walk north, staying somewhat close to the zone wall. Not too close though, I don't want to fall down in the Orc Camp :).



<p>As soon as I had entered TWC I threw a shout about grouping at the Dervs and a human rogue named Talus responded that he wanted to group with me. We went to the dervs but saw that we would need a pure tank. Another human, named Raddor solved that problem and we soon developed into a very efficient group.



<p>We practically had the whole camp for ourselves too. At times another group of 2-4 would come along and share some our kills, but that wasn't a problem. We were gaining experience so we had enough and after a fight with a Dervish Thug I reached the goal I had set out months ago...



<p>Can you say "Welcome to level 14"!? :)



<p>After a total playing time of almost 4 days I've finally gained access to SoW and Bind Affinity!!



<p>I cheered out to Talus and Raddor and told them I had to gate back and buy some spells. They were excited too, cuz now they'd be going on SoW as long as I was with them :).



<p>Back in Rivervale I just had to do one more thing before I went away and spent my 53pp. I had to know for sure that the spell Wind Strike had been removed from the game. I gave a quick tell to Aiin Wildfire (who was now in his high 30ies) and he confirmed that it had been removed.



<p>I went to the Farm Stead and with my money I bought the following spells:



<p>Befriend Animal, Bind Affinity, Skin Like Rock, Spirit of the Wolf and Stinging Swarm. They took me down to 18pp and I wanted to wait to buy the rest of the spells later, in case my money wasn't enough to buy them all.



<p>I have to tell you, it felt WIERD to throw a SoW on yourself. It felt like I was using a trainer and I know had access to all the spells in the game :). I crossed Kithicor in half the time now with SoW. Skin Like Rock gave me _tons_ of hp and ac and with all just a merry ride.



<p>It felt even stranger when I bound myself in West Commonlands. If I died now I wouldn't have a long treck to my corpse. Why was I returning to WC then? Didn't I tell you all that I would stop worrying about leveling after 14? Well yes, but I wanted to get a bub of exp as a buffert in case I died a couple of times.



<p>Back at the dervs, Talor and Raddor had been fighting thug after thug and they were pretty low on hp. I healed and buffed them up with SoW and Skin Like Rock. It almost depleted my whole mana bar (I'd just bound myself too).



<p>I didn't have time to kill a lot of dervs though, as I had to go and eat in RL. I logged out where I was meditating (which soon proved to be a BIG mistake) and told my group members that I would brb.



<p>After 15 minutes I was done eating and decided to log in again. When I was at the last splash screen and was just about to log in (at the point where you hear the sound that you stand) I heard "Waah... grumble.. Dunk! *Bone breaking* Waah! grumble...".



<p>Turned out that the camp had spawned up severely and all the other players had left the scene. Two yellow thugs and three dervish orcs took advantage of that and knocked me unconcious before I had my play screen up (which sucked :). One more hit, doing 30dmg, made my computer to start loading.



<p>Poof! Back at my bind point, but what's this?



<p>You've been slain by a Dervish Thug. You loose a level.



<p>NO! *sob*



<p>It wasn't that bad though. Thanks to the new patch which have made death less serious (i.e loosing less experience for dying) I just had 2 or 3 yellows to reclaim my level.



<p>I got contact with Talus again and we decided to form up, hopefully a full group, to be able to reclaim both my level and the camp. Soon our party consisted of Solarerist, Raddor, Talus, Sevrin, Sirgorath and I.



<p>We took it back with little resistance and I got my level 14 back, yay!



<p>Our group continued to be full and it was pretty fun fighting mobs. Everyone just surrounded the poor dervishes who happened to spawn and we got it down after just a couple of seconds :). Heck, I was continuosly gaining party experience even when I sat down and meditated, it rocked! :)



<p>The hours passed and soon I had my buffert up on one bubble. I didn't have any time to go out and explore though, so I decided to stay with them a little longer.



<p>I also found use for my panic animal for the first time (I think). Some of the people in our group had nothing against fighting animals during spawn time. As the druid of the party I just had to teach them some respect for our four legged friends. So every time they started to beat on a poor plains cat I threw a panic on it (nice animation too, green skulls circeling around the target) and they went on a merry chase :D. I stopped doing it though when my group members kept coming back with cat meat that they wanted to trade with me :(.



<p>Anyway, during one of our dervish fights I experienced that gawdawful frenzy feature that we have in EQ. I was just going along my business, throwing damage shields and heals on my fellow group members when this dervish barbarian, wielding a two handed sword came running for me. I dunno if it was because of my heals or if it was something else that had pissed him off, but he sure was mad at me.



<p>I ran away at 3 bubbles and with SoW I could have made it easily to the zone entrance to Kithicor. My friends were yelling at me to stop the damn running though. I sighed and did the mistake to go with their advice. I turned around and ran towards them, where the mob had a chance to hit me again for those icky 20dmgs. I stood still and my friends came swarming on him. Someone told me to "run now". I did, but the mob, as expected, was still on me. I saw my life dropping down and after three hits with that huge sword I was lying with my face in the ground.



<p>I, thankfully, didn't loose much experience though, and I was now on exactly one bub of experience. I felt that to be sufficient for now as time was flying away. I thanked my friends for a good time and headed back for Rivervale.



<p>Before I left the West Commonlands I thought of giving another experiment a go. I wondered what it would be like to gate, being in the same zone as the bound. Would you have to go through that pain of loading the palettes, textures and whatever or had Verant thought about that and programed it right?



<p>I gated and to my amazement I was instantly thrown to my bound place. The smoke of gating was still on me when I had gated, cool.



<p>Speaking of zoning. I earlier wrote about why Verant wouldn't add advertisement during zone times. Well if my thoughts are correct, the waiting time is primarly dependent on how fast system you have, not the speed of your connection.



<p>When you zone you download a "small" piece of information, giving you data on how many creatures and players are in the zone, what time it is (and thus which "sky" to be loaded). When you're done with that download your computer kicks in and starts loading all the palettes, textures and whatever that is needed for you to be able to reside in that zone. Think of it when playing Quake II, Heretic II or any other similar game. Whenever it is time for a new level the console tells you you're loading that and that palette, skin, whatever.



<p>Now if there would be advertisement during zoning it must be applicated during the "download" period, which often is not longer than a couple of seconds. If Verant would applicate advertisement during our "loading" time that would take chunks of the computer's performance and we would by that experience even longer zoning times.



<p>If that's the case I'm against advertisement and would be more than happy to pay that 10$ a month to reduce zoning time. After some zonings with advertisement I would have wasted those 10$ on just waiting with my regular phone charges anyway :).



<p>Anyway, back in Rivervale I found myself having 26pp now. That was enough to purchase all level 14th spells but two. I'm missing Cascade of Hail and Invigor. I now had 2pp in the bank I was feeling poor again... that's life :).



<p>Also saw a half-elf druid standing át the bank, wielding a Glowing Wooden Crook. Damn they look nice! I asked him how much he'd payed for it and he replied with "too much". I asked him to define too much and I got "120pp" in response. 120pp! phew... now that's too much, I said :).



<p>The staff was enough to tell me to start working on that 2h blunt skill though. I know it's pretty late to think about it at level 14. I've seen a decrease of skills raising at level 13+, I haven't even maxed out my 1h slash yet, which only takes a couple of blues to do at lower levels.



<p>So now I have yet another dilemma. I'm finally level 14 and have the ability to explore, and now I just came to the idea that "hey! it would be awfully nice to have my 2h blunt maxed as well". Oh brother... :)

<p>Before continuing on what I did yesterday I want to discuss an email I received from one of you readers.



<p>Adaron sent me the following:



<blockquote>

<p>Hello There Atherion, I just wanted to clear up a few things about powergaming.



<p>First thing though, I have been an avid reader of your journal since the first day you wrote it and I am overjoyed to see someone writing down what all of us had to go through.  Keep up the good work!



<p>Now as for powergaming. What you experienced with Talor was not powergaming, it was camping.  Now you may be thinking that they are the same but trust me on this, they are not.  Camping is the opposite to powergaming, after for this one reason: To powerlevel/powergame means to gain as much experience as possible in the shortest time possible, and camping is NOT efficient.  When you want to powerlevel you have to check your surroundings. 



<p>If (a) you are in an open dungeon (See: Unrest, Crushbone?), Then you must sit down and have a party member lure.  



<p>If (b) You are in a cramped or tunneled dungeon (See: Blackburrow, Befallen, Crushbone?), Then you must roam the part of the dungeon where the good monsters spawn.



<p>What Talor did was take matters into his own hands, as many people do.  Druids, as support characters, are not seen as much of an aid until after the battle (When you realize that the monster could have killed you 5 times if the druid wasn't there, lol).  Enchanters and Bards suffer the most from this because the group criticizes them for doing nothing but debuff and sing, but when the bard/enchanter leaves the monster the group was fighting seem more difficult.



<p>Ugh, my small note turned into a rant!  Well, I just wanted you to know that I am a powergamer and not a DoOd or a camper.  There ARE differences.

</blockquote>



<p>First of all, I want to thank you Adaron for taking the time to write to me. I appreciate it and hope to see more letters like these in the future. It's always nice to get feedback, whether it's good or bad.



<p>Now to reply your email:



<p>It seems that we do not share the same definiton when it comes to powergaming. What I mostly mean when I use the term "powergaming" is to totally forget about roleplaying, explorations and the likes and only go for one thing: getting your experience meter to start pumping up that orange stuff.



<p>Now when it comes to Misty Thicket, I have seen that the most efficient way to quickly, and without much trouble, raising your experience is to camp. The Orc camp is the best source for experience. The spawning rate is short compared to Mooto, and without a ranger it would take a longer time to track down those Scarabs who might be able to compare themselves with the orcs when it comes to experience. So the bottom line for me is that camping _IS_ the best way to gain as much experience as possible during the shortest time possible.



<p>I do not have much experience about the other zones in the game, as you know, but I've found it equally useful now to camp Dervishes in the West Commonlands. I know there is a _better_ way to powergame for me and that's by kiting. I haven't tried this much though, I'm still learning the basics about it.



<p>What seems strange in your email though is that your example with cramped dungeons (b) sounds like camping to me. You're basically "camping" in the area where the good monsters spawn. But I guess it depends on the size of the area. But where does the line from "powergaming" and "camping" go? 



<p>I do not feel like camping must involve an actual camp. Let's say we have a zone where some ugly creatures are spawning near a pond. Being anywhere near that pond (thus in the area where the good monsters spawn) would be camping IMHO.



<p>Seems to me that I've somehow put a bad stain on all campers/powergamers, saying they are nothing but d0oDs. That was not my intention, a lot of people are camping/powergaming whatever in this game, and most of them are nice people.



<p>I can understand if you're upset with my "The Way Of The Powergamer" as it's all about my own experiences with powergaming, in the form of camping. Now, you are probably (most likely) a much more experienced powergamer (noting that you've been to dungeons all over Norrath), and your definitons might be (and are) different from mine. 



<p>It might have been a fault from my side to add "I've seen real powergamers in action before". With that I ment people who've never roleplayed before and are only playing EQ to gain levels. You're definition of a "real powegamer" might vary.



<p>I thank you again for your mail though Adaron. You've given me some more insight on powergamers and I'll try to avoid writing something that might upset or come out the wrong way. And no, I don't think of you as a d0oD :).



<p>With that said I hope that the things I write will not have too much of an influence. These are all my experiences and thoughts, and mine alone.



<p>Anyway, back to my progress. I logged in yesterday and I imediately checked how many practise points I had. It said 66 and I said "what the heck" and put 6 on 2h blunt. I thought it would boost my 2h blunt skill to at least 20 or something, but it still said Awful when I'd "wasted" the points. I guess you only get one single point for each practise point, ugh.



<p>With my great worn staff I've had in my bank for some time I made it for the thicket. I wanted to collect some bat wings (for levitate) and rat whiskers (for befriend animal), and at the same time, raise my 2h blunt. I also had a couple of deathfist slashed belts that I wanted to give to Budo.



<p>I tried my staff on a couple of bats, but it wasn't moving an inch. I guess the fact is that you do not gain any points fighting stuff that doesn't give you any xp. I wrote earlier that you do gain points for killing greens, but I think I've gotten experience from them anyway.



<p>Oh well, guess I better be fighting yellows or reds then to gain points, ugh. The only place I can think of short handedly is the Dervish camp.



<p>*You find yourself considering whether to press the BACK button or not*



<p>Ok ok... I promised you guys earlier that I would stop thinking about leveling after 14th and go out and explore. Well, I've done both actually... so just keep reading, please? ;)



<p>I gated back to Rivervale and equipped myself to go to West Commonlands. I made an auction about my dervish rings, and this time I finally found a buyer. I sold two of them for 5gp each. I think that's a fair price. Dexterity isn't the most valuable statistic, so the rings aren't like necessary items. Still they're better than nothing.



<p>I bound myself once again in TWC and headed for the dervs camp. Wintereyes was online and we agreed to group up. I told her I wouldn't be much of a help when it came to melee, as I only had a couple of points in 2h blunt. As long as I threw a damage shield on her we could 1 or 2 at the same time.



<p>There was another group there at the time, but Wintereyes and I were getting _tons_ of experience by killing one here and one there. We got a half bubble each for killing 2 dervs, and that's at level 14. I sigh at the situation. I've been trying so hard to level, and once I don't care anymore I get more experience that I've never received before, go figure :).



<p>After a couple of foughts I did get a raise in 2h blunt though. I was very disappointed when I saw what I had in it. You raise 2h blunt (7). Seven? oh boy... this is gonna be a LONG haul.



<p>Also received some raw hide leggings from Wintereyes, which were about 2 points better than my patchwork (yes, I'm still covered in patchwork in some places, hell I even have a cloth cloak :).



<p>Later Talus, and his friend Makia, joined up. Raddor came too a little bit later. We were now two big groups competing for the dervs. The other group started to steal our kills and tried to attract mobs that spawned by running circles across the whole camp.



<p>I was once again called a kill stealer when a Erudite Dervish started to lightning bolt me. I reacted by answering with a couple of ignites and soon he was dead. The other group started to melee him after he had nuked me with lightning and they were not pleased when I came around and looted the body (which gave me a bronze weapon btw ;).



<p>Then things really escalated, and whenever our group had a mob on us the other guys tried to panic it or outdo us in damage. They got tired shortly though and left the camp.



<p>Wintereyes had to leave too at this time. We fought without her for a while but we lost control at one point and the camp spawned up pretty heavy. Makia died at one point and we needed people to help us clear out the camp. A halfling named Dagner joined up, as well as Sevrin.



<p>We rushed the place and we barely made it, with Talus hitting the ground. Later Dagner and Sevrin hit the dust too, and after that people just kept on dying and returning, just to die again.



<p>One situation was really scary. I and Makia stood ground outside the camp and suddenly a thug comes rushing at us. With us both being buffed with SoW I gave the command to run. He asked "really?" and I went back to check. I saw Talus grouped up, fighting with Makia and thought "ah, heck we can take it". Turned out that it wasn't Talus though, it was another human dervish. Makia dropped to the ground again and I panicked. I quickly turned around and ran for the zone.



<p>When I came across the Orc camp I saw that Thalandin and some other 6-9 leveled players where camping. I felt stupid leaving a train of a thug and a dervish on them, but "luckily" the thug stayed on me and I zoned.



<p>Later I zoned back, with the confirmation from Thalandin that they were dead. I stayed with them for a while and gave them a couple of dervish rings (heck, they're hard to sell anyway :). An elven female gave me some bat wings in return. Bat wings, now I could levitate I thought!



<p>I gotta tell you though... levitate is a really strange spell. Whenever I used it and moved up a hill and "floated" back to the ground none of the party members could see me. I even treeformed while I was in the air and no one could see the 100 feet high tree floating around in mid air. Strange...



<p>I tried my 2h blunt on the orcs for a while but I never increased in it. I decided to go back to Rivervale and buy some new spells.



<p>When I had sold off all my loot (a couple of bronze weapons, nice money) I had about 15pp. With the money I filled out my level 14 spells and also bought the level 9 spell Starshine. In one of the guides somewhere on the net it says that the lightsource is somewhat close to a Greater Lightstone. Baah... when I used it I had less effect than my ordinary Lightstone. I also tried out Halo Of Light, but it had only an AC of 3 and I don't think it showed on my character. And I must say that Atherion looks better with a cap on than none at all :).



<p>I gated back to West Commonlands and once I got there the Dervish camp had been taken over again. I grouped up with a couple of players, some that I had played with before.



<p>The cleanup went pretty ok, but just as we were about to rush I got a really pissed off derv woman on me. I tried to take her on a kite trip but I suspect that the Ogre Shaman had thrown a SoW on her, because she repeatedly continued to backstabb me as soon as I pressed either the left or the right arrow to change direction of my running.



<p>My group members told me to stop but there was no way in hell that I would do the same mistake I did last time I was in this situation. So this time I swallowed my pride, ignored my group and made it for the zone.



<p>Those derv rings came in handy though. When I once again passed the Orc Camp Thalandin's group came for my aid. When I zoned back they'd dispatched the woman and I said good bye to my group and disbanded. No more dervs for me for a while.



<p>I talked with Thalandin's group a while, but after a while I decided to make a treck to Freeport, just as a virgin journey with SoW :).



<p>As soon as the sun came up over the hills I began my journey. The scenery in the West Commonlands is just beaufiful at day, both the dusk and dawn is amazing. There's even a sun and a moon doing circles over the zone, depending on what time it is.



<p>Earlier when I've trecked TWC I've always been using the walls, to avoid the Hill Giants. I thought about this before I started to run. Of course I wanted to stay on the road, as I'd see much more of the zone if I did so (and more roleplayish too :). The first Hill Giant I bumped into forced me up the wall, but when it was gone I stubbornly moved down to the road again.



<p>When I'd been keeping the path for some time I came to something that looked like a parking gate. You know, the things you have to insert a couple of coins in to make the bar go up so you can enter the parking building :). There were two guards standing there and there were some corpses lying around in the grass.



<p>I didn't know what this was about so I threw a camoflauge on me, and by that I passed them with no problem at all. I checked their names... "Milita Guard" something.... oh well :).



<p>Soon I zoned without any warning I was afraid I had lost connection. Turned out I just zoned to the East Commonlands. The Giant Spiders were replaced by Spiderlings and I felt more safe here. I didn't feel like that very long though when I did a quick look to the left and saw two griffons "floating" around in the canopy.



<p>I continued along the road and the grass was soon replaced with desert sand. Aaahh... Freeport was in sight, at last. The sun was coming down too and the sunset was so beautifull, with animals runing through the down going sun, kind of like one of those western movies :).



<p>There were lots of rats here and I decided to kill a couple to collect some rat whiskers. Now, Befriend Animal is fun! I charmed a rat and when I targeted another rat and said "/pet attack" it charged like crazy. All I could do was to sit down and watch the show :). What didn't impress me too much though was that when one of the rats was slain it just disappeared. There were no guards around so I found it pretty wierd. Still it's a fun spell :).



<p>I thought that while I was here I could always bind some people coming out of the boat. I remember the friendly wizard who had once bound me to this place after the boat ride, and I knew that people really appreciated that.



<p>I ran through the streets of Freeport and soon found myself in Eastern Freeport. There were some people standing at the docks and while I waited for the boat I started to summon up a pile of water to get that conjuration skill kicking up. Luckily I've been using whirling wind a lot since I started to camp Mooto and the Orcs and I now have a skill of 61, which is nice.



<p>The boat finally arrived and my gating services came in handy. A fellow Wood Elf, just like myself, needed my services. I bound him for free and asked him if he was by any chance going to Rivervale. He wasn't so I decided to gate back to the West Commonlands to call it a night.



<p>In the West Commonlands I found Raddor fighting some Dervs... I helped him out but got a big derv on my back. She was a shaman, and I soon found out that kiting a spellcaster is no good :). I got her down though with a couple of ignites.



<p>I told Raddor I was returning to Rivervale and he asked if I could bind him there. Thinking "why not?" I threw him a SoW and we ran towards Rivervale. When we entered Kithicor it was night as always, and I had to do the wall run again. I still hope I'll get to see Kithicor in bright daylight some day :).



<p>Anyway, after I had bound myself and Raddor I had to log out. Just when I was about to camp though I ran into Maksatpa.



<p>She was 20ish now and was also working on her 2h blunt. I asked for some pointers but all I got was to work on it a lot. Heh... she's 20ish and she's got it at 50 now.. seems like a really long haul. She's got the other two maxed too. I know for sure I wont be using 1h blunt though, I've never been a big fan of maces and the likes. I'm happy if I'll be able to use my Scimitar and a Staff.



<p>I also asked Maksatpa which way to go when you're walking to Qyenos - through High Pass or the Gorge routine? She told me the Gorge routine is way easier, which baffles me. I got a map of High Pass and it doesn't seem to be that hard, oh well.



<p>She offered me to get me to East Karana right away but I really had to log out.



<p>Phew! and that's where I am right now. Because of my cold I've always been one journal entry behind, but no longer :). There may be some chronological faults here and there, it wouldn't surprice me. If there is anything that looks wierd then email me please, and I'll fix it (if I remember that is :).



<p>Anyway, time for some afterwords... what will I do now? Well I got this weekend coming, after that it's studying for the driver's license and nothing else. I will play EQ next weekend too though, and keep the journal updated, in case the theoretical test isn't on Monday that is.



<p>So what will I do this weekend then? Well, honestly? I haven't the slightest clue. I've been so posessed with this thing about reaching level 14. That's been my goal for months, and now when I've reached it it's like I've been playing the Demo of a game for some time and now all of the suddenly I have the Full Version and I have NO idea at all what to do :).



<p>I'm still getting used to the fact that I now CAN throw SoWs and Binds. It feels so wierd with people constantly begging for SoW and Bind and in the beginning I said that I couldnt by a reflex.. dooh :).



<p>I know though that I _will_ wield the Glowing Wooden Crook sometime in Atherion's lifespan, and that I must have a 2h blunt of at least 40-60. What makes it worse is that Druids are more and more becoming a spellcaster at these levels and by that our weapon skills gets harder to raise (as we do not use them as much anymore). I know for sure that I haven't maxed my 1h slash at 75 yet, but I feel that I better get my 2h blunt to whatever I can get until I reach level 15. At 15 I must change to 1h slash though and get it to 80. Btw, I'm only 2 bubbles away from level 15, it took me by surprice, really.



<p>I'm getting tired of the Dervishes already, but it wouldn't surprice me if that's where I end up tonight. I would love to go to Qyenos and check out the Karanas and, maybe, even Erudin. I heard there are a lot of bandit camps in the Karanas, might as well check them out. I've also set out goals to explore Paw, BlackBurrow and the icy zones around Halas. We'll see

<p>Woah, I've finally broken the ice!



<p>I've actually been somewhere else now than in the Thicket. Read on.



<p>I logged in on Thursday and checked my friends list. No one was online and I was just about to zone to the Thicket when Derin popped up in Rivervale and said hi. We'd talked the day before about trying out the Dervish camp in West Commonlands, and before I knew it we were zoning to Kithicor.



<p>I guess it had to come to this sooner or later. Even though I've been feeling safe in the Thicket it has come to an extent where I will/must trade my safetyhood for something fun and new.



<p>It was dark when we entered Kithicor and I've heard one or two rumours about the werewolves that spawn here during the night. Derin had been travelling here a lot before though, so we travelled safetly through the whole zone by sticking to the northern wall.



<p>You've entered the West Commonlands.



<p>As soon as I had zoned I was ready to run, in case there was a hill giant coming our way. The plains were pretty deserted though. This was not what I had in mind about the West Commonlands. When I first travelled here to get to Rivervale I saw tons of hill giants. I thought you would be running around hill giants all the time in a good old slalom style. I guess not :).



<p>After making sure that plain cats weren't aggressive to us, we continued following the west wall, going north. We were travelling a little bit on top of the wall and soon we found ourselves standing on a cliff. 30 meters below there was an orc camp with about 10 orcs in it. We made sure we walked around it, because if they all would come after us we would surely die.



<p>We continued around and found ourselves at a tower sticking up from the groun. Derin told me to stay out of there as it was an unrest keep or something, eeew. If he told me to stay out of there, he being a level 13 cleric, then it must surely be dangerous :).



<p>Anyway, we kept going and just a short distance away we found ourselves at the Dervish camp. It was heavily camped though, so Derin suggested that we went wisp and kodi hunting. I wanted to stay though, as I'd never seen a Dervish before.



<p>Turned out they were looking the same as any other human dressed in leather.



<p>Since the camp was heavily camped we ran around on the plains, looking for wisps. Derin proved to be somewhat of a master finding these things. He could see the light moving from far away and we took down 3 of them under just 5 minutes or so. At first when I tried to hit one it said the wisp was invulnerable. Guess they can only be hit by magical weapons. They didn't resist my burns though, and they were no match against Derin and I. 



<p>When I looted one it wielded a Greater Lightstone. Cool! I've heard they sell for 5pp to human players. Later I also looted an ordinary Ligthstone, which "only" sell for 1pp.



<p>We also took on some ordinary kodiaks. Unlike the young ones, these weren't amiably to me, so we gave it a go. With a dmg shield on Derin we could take down one with just little problem, sometimes involving a tag from my side.



<p>At this time the Dervish camp was getting less and less crowded of other players and we decided to camp it. I soon found out that there were more than one Dervish type. Others than the Humans there were Barbarians, Erudites, Ogres and Orcs. The Humans, Orcs and Barbarians proved to be somewhat easy to kill. The first spawn with the Ogre was an icky one though, as it decided to stick on me for a while.



<p>Without hesitation I left the rumble of Players vs Dervishes and ran to the Kithicor Entrance. I thought I had him on me all the time, as Derin said "Watch out for the fatguy!". I asked him if he was after me and later he said "No, but just in case". Dooh... I stopped running and turned around - nothing. I took a deep breath and returned to the camp.



<p>We continued killing the things we could and I could see my experience meter moving a little. I had 2 bubs of experience. I thought that with this pace I would surely hit level 14 before the night. There was a nasty spawn of Erudites though and they burned both me and Derin down to a bloody pulp. I think it was the Erudites who got us killed, forgot to take screenshots :).



<p>Poof! Back in Rivervale. I felt my stressy panic kicking in and I wanted to leave for West Commonlands pronto (I guess that feeling of someone looting your corpse since the UO days still haunt me :). A friendly Barbarian helped us out though and buffed us up with SoW. With SoW on we trecked through Kithicor in just a couple of minutes.



<p>I guess it's not that bad to die 2 or 3 zones away. And here I am, been afraid and stayed in the Thicket for so long... I feel awful :).



<p>Back in the West Commonlands I finally found use for my Treeform spell. With it on I could loot my corpse without attracting a single mob on me, which was nice :). It remained, and still is, one of my most used spells when camping Dervs. I can meditate, I heal faster (3hps a tick instead of 2hp) and I get left alone. Something that is strange though is if you equip anything while in Treeform you don't actually equip it. So when I've recovered my corpse I have to re-equip everything once again to really  get it to show, both graphical and stats'ical :).



<p>Also saw my first Griffon flying around closeby. It's nicely drawn, but I think it moves too slow. What's even worse are the plain cats. What a joke. It looks like they're running in water. I thought they would tip tap around a bit... move their nose against the wind and run for an attack. All they seem to do now is to run around in a very ugly animation. Looks like they got a big potbelly to carry around.



<p>Anyway, two players, named Wyven and Wintereyes, came up and offered to join me and Derin. As the camp suddenly spawned a thug or two we found use of them and with four of us we were pretty safe. We even took out the Erudites now with little problem.



<p>The loot filled up in my pocket (I have about 10 dervish rings in my bank now :) and I had to make it for a merchant to sell off my bronze and rusty weapons. Wintereyes showed me the way to one of the merchant huts not far from the camp. The rusty weapons sold for an incredible 2pp and the jade I gotten from an orc went for 2.5pp.



<p>Oh, speaking of 2.5pp. With Thalandin sitting next to me in school, also playing EQ I wanted to get some facts straigth. As you might have noticed, people can't make smileys in EQ. I dunno if it's just me because I'm using Swedish language in my computer and thus having those settings on my keyboard or not (it does go american in EQ though). If someone does a smiley such as this one: :) it comes out as ) and nothing more. Now if you do a space between the "eyes" and "mouth" you get it allright. Then it comes out as : ). Now it got me thinking what else EQ can't do. When I've tried to sell off clay totems I often give a price of 1.1pp-1.2pp. When I tried to sell it to a High Elf named Thaendril he gave me 10 gp. When I said the price was 1.2pp he just laughed and said "10gp is 1pp".



<p>So now I used a tell to Thalandin and said 1.2pp, and sure it did came out as 1pp. Talk about strange things. What is the purpose of this? I did the smiley thing to him and it was just as I had stated above. Is Verant taking out smileys on purpose or does it have something to do with the emote command which you can use by pressing colon (:). It just struck me also that you americans use your decimals and dots in another way than we Europeans. If we type one million in numbers it goes 1.000.000. You do it with commas, i.e 1,000,000. I've never thought about this earlier so I'll try to say 1,2pp this time.



<p>Anyway, thugs were spawning and I had to return to the camp to help my party members. Being the druid I stuck to throwing shields on the tanks (Derin and Wyven), and healed when necessary.



<p>Suddenly I saw Sephy shouting something across the zone. Derin told me earlier that he'd talked to him and that Sephy was now a lvl 5 monk (with 80pp in the bank :). He told me he'd level up to my level "soon" (Verant had a great definition of "soon" back in the early days, or so I've heard :). Oh well, there goes our plans on getting the Tomahawk and Darkwood shield in High Pass :).



<p>He was doing some monk quest, but I didn't pay attention at that time as the camp had spawned up really bad.



<p>The camp had spawned 2 Erudites, 2 Humans, 1 Barbarian and 1 Ogre. Derin had just left, and Wyven left short after, so there was no way Wintereyes and I could take them all out. People came though, and soon we teamed up with another group. With 6 of us we planned a rush and I sat down and got ready with the buffs. We did the rush and I think everyone made it out allright.



<p>I stayed for a little bit longer and we practically killed anything in sight, whether it was blue or yellow. Night was coming though and I had to gate back to Rivervale.



<p>I checked my experience meter and saw that I was only ONE bubble away from level 14! I also had 30pp in the bank now (made 5pp). When I was just about to log off I got a call from Sephy. He needed a greater lightstone, lego bracers and a dervish ring for that monk quest. I told him I had the GL and dervish ring and it was just to come and pick them up.



<p>When he arrived I told him if he could spare me any money for the items as I was soon to purchase the level 14 spells (pretty costly if you're like me and want them all :). I was chocked when I saw 20pp entering the trade screen and I threw myself over the trade button before he changed his mind :P. "How's that?", he asked. If he'd been a female I'd kissed him on sight (KOS :), but as he was this brute human all he got was a thanks and a handshake :).



<p>Yipes, 20pp. Sephy just doubled my amount of pps. I now had 50pp in the bank, 50pp! Heck, I can afford a Runed Totem Staff with ease now :). Need all the money for the spells though. Most level 14 spells go for 6-7pp, and I still need 15pp to fill out my level 9 spells (three missing).



<p>Anyway, I was hoping I had time to fill you out on my expedition I made yesterday too, but I gotta be in school in about 40 minutes, and in that time I gotta add some screenshots too. 



<p>Stay tuned for more tomorrow.

<p><a name=4><b>Journal Entry - 990622 - 11:24am</b></a>



<p>*Cough* *Cough*...



<p>Hey all!



<p>Been a terrible week for me. School was finally over, the journal entries were doing great and I looked forward to play an additional 30 hours of EQing and get this site really pumping...



<p>..but no...



<p>Instead I catch a summer cold and I have to stay home and feel miserable. And now, 7 days and 1 whole bag of toilet-paper later I'm feeling somewhat recovered :).



<p>I've had some time to play though, but before I write about that I'll cover the things which happened the Sunday after my last journal entry (2 weeks ago). Btw, this journal entry will actually cover 3 playing sessions... so it'll be big...er... huge I mean :).



<p>Anyway, let's get this over with. Note though that this was some time ago, and my memory isn't exactly great after my cold, so if I go into detail, I might be wrong :).



<p>I logged in and imediately sold off the stuff I had since my last adventure before the duel. The Halflings didn't seem bothered that my hands were full of elven blood. -I was still amiably to them. As there were no gms online to ask I talked to Soma about my faction standing. He told me I shouldn't really bother. It couldn't be much of a faction hit as people were duelling all over the zones. Hmm... I still don't like the fact that you actually get a hit though.



<p>Also remembered that I was only missing the Giant Fire Beetle Legs now for my bug collection. They seem to be too rare around these parts though. It doesn't matter how much I keep auctioning about it. Heck! people don't even know who the Queen Klaknak is :).



<p>Anyway, went to Budo and gave him a couple of belts I'd saved up. He didn't like the rusty flail when I gave it to him though. "Thank you very much", was all I got from him, guess that isn't the spikey thing :).



<p>Just being level 12 I killed some Scarabs and other blue creatures, just to get a "buffert". That way if I die I won't jump back to level 11 and miss out on hps, attack, AR and skill points. It was a bit slow killing those things though so I thought I'd just camp Mooto.



<p>He was taken already though, by a halfling named Frutti. He was nice though and I asked him about the Scarab Helm he was wearing. Turned out it was for small races only. I asked him if we could take turns on Mooto and he agreed. He was even nice enough to let me run off to the newbie area to hunt the Queen while he reported when he'd killed Mooto and I could come back.



<p>Then came the inevitable with powergaming/camping;  being accused for "kill stealing".



<p>Frutti told me he'd killed Mooto and I went back to take the next. When I arrived two other guys came along too. I asked Frutti and made sure I was next. They saw it differently though, and advanced closer and closer to where Mooto would spawn. He popped up and I started to burn in an orderly fashion, and they jumped in and started to pound Mooto. I outdone them in damage with a good marginal and as soon as he was down I was met by the, so familiar, KeWlDo0d speak. "WTF, U back off dick!", that I understood , but what the heck is "You wtq"? :).



<p>Anyway, I tried to explain myself that I was sharing with Frutti (I even used "sir" to be polite) but it was no good. Soon I saw my name in red across the whole zone being "a kill stealer and loser along that yky Frutti" (anyone know the translation for "yky"?). It didn't bother me much with the shout though. It only becomes a lie if someone beleives in it or something, but they didn't need to mention Frutti, he wasn't doing anything "against" them.



<p>Oh well, I left before things excalated and went back to my Queen hunt. Still none though so I talked to Soma for a while. He told me he could get me a couple of those wis rings for free, nice! Turned out he knew a person who made them and sold them for 3pp (I knew 9pp was too much). Soma told me to get him some food in exchange and then he was on his way to Rivervale once again.



<p>Then I got a tell from Frutti again, the d0oDs had left and I decided to meet up with him again. I had time for one more Mooto before Soma arrived. I gated back and headed for the Rivervale entrance.



<p>Woah, Soma had gotten himself a Runed Totem Staff now, nice. He gave me the rings and I supplied him with half of my food. We talked for a little moment and then he gated back to Freeport.



<p>With the rings on I now have an outstanding wis of 119. I'm not sure how that affects me, I thought it was an additional mana bubble, but I dunno for sure. I do know though that with one bub of mana I can gate easily, and that's at least 70 mana. So with my 5 bubs I now have 350 mana, that's 10 burns... nice :)



<p>I don't recall doing anything more that night after that... except for that there was a Bazaar being hosted by the Merchants Of Norrath in Rivervale, didn't stay long though.

<p>Now for the things that happened the Tuesday after that Sunday (i.e last week :).



<p>We'd (Thalandin and I) been given the additional 30 hours/week for our project. So I went down to school and connected my computer to the network... that's when things started to happen *Insert Ghost sound here*.



<p>Note: This entry will mainly be about tech stuff.



<p>First I had the problem that the computer prompted me all the time when I wanted to go somewhere on the internet. For example when I started my browser it wanted my modem to connect. If I pressed Abort I was fine and the network connection kicked in. Problem was though that it prompted me when I was in EQ and had just typed in my login name and passowrd. And as you all know, you can't just alt+tab out of EQ.



<p>30 minutes later I'd solved that problem (don't ask me how, I can't remember :). Now I could finally connect to the login server... but wait. Grrr... seems those ports aren't activated anyway (EQ needs 7000, 5999 and 9000 to work properly). 7000 was surely activated, cuz I had no problem getting through the patching process. I talked to the network technician and he said something about protocols, TCP/IP and UDP. Switching the server ports to UDP protocol actually solved this and I could now get to the server thingie (noting that there were only 341 players on Tarrew! Heck, I've seen more people in Faydark than that :). I clicked on Tarrew and it continued through and soon I saw my Atherion spinning around in 3D. I clicked Enter and waited.



<p>Some observations: EQ does not go notably faster with a T1 line, compared to a 28.8 modem. I think it all boils down to your amount of RAM, and the speed of your Hard Drive.



<p>You get the 0% 0% 500 something with both a 58.8k and a 28.8k modem, so if you want the loading times between zoning gone I suggest you put your money on a clean, empty, fast Hard Drive and tons of RAM (I heard it takes about 15s to zone with 256RAM, but then again... who has the money for 256 in RAM?).



<p>Anyway, more problems. Some of you might have observed that just as you're about to start playing you hear your character stand up (f-tschoop something) and then the screen goes black for a split second and you're in. Now all that didn't happen to me. As soon as I was about to hear that sound I was kicked out and was met by the "Connecting to the login server" message.



<p>At first I thought it was the monitor. But after a while I could establish that that was not the case, as the monitor went fine with the Tutorial.



<p>It was, and still is, a server problem. It seems that I can't send nor receive data. Anyone got any suggestions on this problem?



<p>Didn't get any further that day, because at about 2pm I had a fever and headed home and slept through the whole day...

<p>My cold was a persistent one and I didn't even have the strength to play EQ at home on Friday, nor on Saturday. That was 3+3 hours added to my pool for future enjoyment and on Sunday I felt good enough to take advantage of them.



<p>I logged in at about 1pm my time, and thanks to the time zones EQ was rather empty when I logged in. There was one more player in Rivervale with me, and 4 more in the Thicket :).



<p>I went directly to the Orc Camp to get some experience. When I got there two orcs had spawned, one green and one coning blue. I thought if I burned the blue the green wouldn't bother, but I threw a damage shield on me for safety anyway.



<p>BOOM! 

<br>Ick!



<p>They both came running and I prepared myself to strike them both down with lightning. Had a hard time getting through one though and I saw my health dropping fast. I kept on doing the occasional lightning strike and soon we were all three down to one bubble each. I knew if I ran now I would surely die. So I pressed through with a lightning and one of them went down. I was half bubble now and I could barely move. I switched target and threw an ignite with my last bubble of mana and BOOM! I had made it out safetly.



<p>This fight got me all shakey and it was not good for my cold as I started to cough uncontrolably.



<p>I went back to the wall gate to rest up. On the ground I saw something strange. It was a Wooden Statue, not too unlike the clay totems I'd got earlier from Mooto. When I asked in the zone what it did I got a reply from the one who had dropped it with nothing, but it might be a part of some quest. I've decided to keep it for now.



<p>Oh, also turned off the roleplaying switch. It would be a lie to have it on right now, and besides... I don't like the /anon that goes with it.



<p>Anyway, I didn't want to go Orc hunting again, so instead I went to... you guessed it... Mooto :). There were some high leveled wood elves there. They told me they were leaving though, and before they gated away they threw a SoW on me, much appreciated.



<p>After I had camped Mooto 7 times a friendly Halfling named Sunnen appeared. He was fighting goblin warriors, trying to get to level 5. Only lvl 4 huh? Talk about being courageous. As you know, I stayed in the newbie section till level 6 :).



<p>Oh well, I enjoyed his company, having someone to talk to during my meding times. Seeing that he had nothing in his shield hand I gave him a Herbie.



<p>After another 5 Mooto's I was encumbered and decided to head home to sell off my loot. Boy, do you get rich camping Mooto or what? He gives you the occasional clay totem, along with anything ranging from cloth armor to wooden shields that go for 8gp. He often give you 1-2gp in loot too. At this time I had about 11pp in the bank.



<p>Also worth mentioning. I've now killed gobs and Mooto so many times that I no longer get a faction raise with the local Halflings. I guess I'm close to getting my squad ring.



<p>Went back to Mooto again and camped him an additional 4 times. During this time I started to talk to a player named Duranidan. We talked for half an hour about computers, motherboards and whatever. I have no idea how we got into that conversation :). He also gave me some quest information about the Bloodforge Hammer.



<p>Our conversation came to an end and I decided to gate back to Rivervale and log out for a while. I was both hungry and dizzy in my head of all the camping.



<p>When I arrived in Rivervale I got a tell from Sunnen. He was trying out the level 5 spells and said "Wow! 22dmg that's a good spell". Guess he was trying out the Whirling Wind spell :).



<p>I sold off my gear and was just about to log out when I saw Maven shouting that he needed help at the first cave. Some of you might remember Maven from the times when I experienced some efficient group fighting :). I gave him a hi over a tell and he remembered me. I met up with him and threw him a camo, as one halfling girl didn't like him at all.



<p>He was looking for a Large Sewing Kit. I tried to help him but I couldn't find one. And soon I had to log out anyway. I gave him another camo, said good bye and logged out.



<p>

<p>1 hour later I had gotten some food in my system and was ready for some more EQing. When I logged in and went to the thicket I saw that Frutti was camping Mooto. He was level 14 now... aaaw.. sigh :). I left him alone to camp Mooto and instead I ran to the orcs.



<p>There I met up with Evany again. She was grouped with a player named Talor and I asked if I could join up. As I had just saved Talor's life from a giant scarab he invited me in. Seemed like Talor and Evany couldn't really get along that well. I didn't want to get dragged in to a feud or something so I remained silent. Later Evany was kicked out of the party. My morale failed me. Instead of breaking up I stayed with Talor. The powergaming philosphy had already begun my transformation.



<p>Talor turned out to be quite the fighter though, and soon we were getting along pretty well. Once we came across this yellow Legionnare and we fought him down by the book. We started out with attracting him, whereas I threw a damage shield on Talor. At 75% hp I started to burn him down with Whirling Winds and Ignites. When Talor was down to two and a half bubble of hp I tagged the orc, having full health. Soon the Orc dropped and we could check our experience meters moving :).



<p>Anyway, let me halt here for a while and dedicated the next "few" lines for an observation called "The Way of The Powergamer" :). I've seen real powergamers in action before, but I experienced them myself for the first time when I was grouped with Talor.



<p>1) Thou shalt not let the other players have the Mob.



<p>This is fun to watch when there are two powergaming groups at one camp. There's seldom an agreement on who's next. A party will only accept one agreement, and that's that they go first :).



<p>I experienced a similar, funny, situation with Talor that night. Another party came and took one of "our" orcs we'd been waiting to spawn. I told Talor they could have it but all I got was "NO! BURN BURN!". It was too late when I started though and Talor convinced himself to go teach the other guys a lesson. They were swearing at each other and whatever and I decided to stay in the background. Later I felt the urge to go and talk to the other guys about Talor's behaviour. Guess that was a wrong move, cuz when I got there I overheard their conversation about phone sex... ah, great induvidials :).



<p>2) Thou shalt throw out any of thy partymembers if they're not working efficiently.



<p>I guess this happened to Evany, and later it happened to me. Talor started to fight an Orc and I threw a damage shield on him. I was low on mana though so I sat down and meditated to get some mana up if there was need for a heal or something. The orc goes down, but before it does I get kicked out of the party. I got furious, and after informing Talor that the damage shield I just threw on him IS the most mana efficient spell we druid's have he felt remorse for his actions :).



<p>That'st just a couple of things I can think of short handedly... but I'll throw in some more when they pop into my mind.



<p>Note though that I am not an "innate" powergamer, and nor will I ever become one. As I've stated earlier, I'll stop concerning about leveling once I hit 14 and get SoW and Bind. I also want to appologize to any induvidial that I might have or will hurt in any way during this powergaming state of Atherion's life. It's a long haul to level 14, and the thicket is slowly turning into a battle field where everything is "up for grabs".



<p>Also mentioned this site to Talor (always do that before I add someone's name) and the replies I got from him were pretty funny :). First off he thought I was a GM or something, and before I could reply that he said "U Brad?".



<p>=D



<p>After I had explained that I wasn't Brad and that I couldn't hook him up with rub armor (Gotta love Talor :), I gave him the address and told him to check it out.



<p>Anyway, time passed by and I gated back to Rivervale to sell off my stuff. It had been a good night and I had 16pp in the bank and only a bubble to go for lvl 13.

<p>I was almost fully recovered from my cold yesterday, Monday, and I gave it a go in school again. This time I played under different circumstances (no firewall at all) and this time I got through!



<p>At this time there were only 5 other players in the thicket. Instead of describing every fight I had with Mooto I'll just say I camped him 16 times and hit level 13 after 12 Mootos.



<p>Didn't get much experience after level 13 for killing Mooto though. I talked around and found out that the dervish camps in West Commonlands are easy xp and money. If you're grouped that is.



<p>Well, I sure didn't want to go to the West Commonlands without a guide, so I stayed around in the thicket.



<p>Later (I'm speeding things up here... too hard to remember, and I'm getting tired of typing :) I saw a remarkable sight in the thicket...



<p>Garron auctions: Selling Giant Fire Beetle Legs!



<p>My heart was doing loops and I asked him where he'd gotten them. Turned out the legs weren't from the Queen Klaknak, but from the Queen Kliknik somewhere near Qyenos Hills. I've heard about people combining away their whole collection with a leg import. But I was assured by Garron that it would work, and if not I would get tripple the money back which I payed for the legs (5gp).



<p>Okay, I had all the parts. I double checked and everything was GO. Turned out there was one more problem though... where the heck was that Blixtin Entopop person? I had help from both Garron, who was a ranger, and the whole newbie squadron of the thicket (helps auctioning a greater worn staff as a reward for finding him :). A halfling named Fatbastard found him and I gave him the staff.



<p>I checked the ingredients once again and hit combine.



<p>You have fashioned together the items to create something new!



<p>Yay! I gave him the box. Nothing happened, no trumpet sound no experience, no nothing... I checked what he just said and told me I had to give him the note too... ah, phew.



<p>[Trumpet Sound]. Ok, got experience, 1gp 1sp, faction increase and... a potion of poison warding. Woohoo, cool! They sell potions for a lot of pps in Rivervale. This is going to be fun.



<p>I gated back and went down the basement in one of the houses to find the alchemist halfling. I checked his prices on some stuff before appraising my potion. Fish Gill extract, 12pp. Whoah! Then my potion of poison thingie must be worth millions!



<p>Hail Atherion, I'll give you 7gp for the Potion of Poison Warding



<p>[Faint Sound] [Dunk! (someone hitting the floor)]



<p>I've been through bad weater, bad spawns and a lot of hours of Queen hunting for just 7gp? 



<p>HELP! I'm going mad!



<p>Let's review some facts here. This is NOT a newbie quest. It involves killing a lot of level 11-12 Scarabs. At level 11-12 people are getting the money to buy full leather (heck, some guys got banded at this point) and an ordinary weapon. A basic patch of leather costs approx. 2pp and the ordinary Scimitar goes for 7pp. 7gp at this level is way too low as a reward. Heck! I could have sold off the Scarab Egg Sac to some guy for 3pp (you should see the spoiler /ooc's in the thicket sometimes :).



<p>There's no wonder why there are sites all over the world listing all the quests out there. Is it because we are curious? Well perhaps, but what I can see as a main reason for players is to know whether it's profitable and worth the effort or not. If I knew I'd be getting 7gp I'd never taken the quest. Some people might say (including me) that the point with quests are for them to be fun, not mainly profitable. That sounds great, but I'll tell you: Waiting for a Queen to spawn for hours is NO fun at all :). Nor is killing Scarab after Scarab, Wasp after Wasp with none of the ingredients.



<p>Anyway, after I had swallowed Blixtin's bottle of disappointment (swallowed might be a wrong term here) I went to the orcs, as Talor was online.



<p>We didn't get to group that much though, as I was soon offered a very nice "offer". Ekodas, a lvl 14 warrior something, wanted me in their party. They were going to explore Runnyeye. How could I turn that down? :). Talor wanted to join too, and soon we had a full party of six.



<p>Ekodas and a player named Mordor acted as tanks. Thori, a dwarven cleric, acted healer and fighter. Talor did the backstabbs, I buffed and a erudite wizard, named Soskas acted heavy artillery.



<p>Runnyeye is a very nicely design placed. It looks exactly as an abandon mine or something, with icky goblins running everywhere. Ekodas and Mordor had probably been here before, as we all formed up at a great choke point. I can't remember who fetched, but soon there were dazed goblin shamans and guards everywhere. I had trouble knowing who was doing what, so I ended up Shielding them all. I call that the overgrowth strategy :).



<p>Everything went perfect and goblin after goblin hit the dust. It was going to get worse though. Suddenly, out of nowhere, this huge red ball consisting of just an eye pops out. I hadn't seen an Evil Eye before and I thought we could take him on. Guess we couldn't :). No one typed, so we stalled for what seemed like 10 seconds before we all looked at each other and started running. I had no idea where to go or where the exit was so I just had one thing in my mind - stick to Thori who was running in front of me.



<p>We came to what seemed like an elevator or something and the loading kicked in. I thought we'd made it out ok, but I was surpriced when I found myself in Beholder's Maze. Now, Beholder's Maze must be the most gawdawful creepy place I've ever been to. With the wind howling and the dark "sky".



<p>I was yet again surpriced when I checked my life meter and saw that it was only showing 2 bubbles of hp. The whole party was badly injured and I think Mordos hit the dust. Soskas was lucky, as he'd made it out alright, even though he'd been rooted by the Eye.



<p>I figured this was way too dangerous for me, and as I would never be able to retrieve my corpse from here I said farewell and gated home.



<p>I thank myself once again for choosing to be a druid, because I just hate dungeons. They're narrow, you can't seem to get enough air and the walls seem to crush you :).



<p>Okay, this is enough... I'm not typing anymore :). Nothing happened after this, I just logged out and called it a night. I apologize for any lacks in my language or the lack of interesting stuff to write about. I just wanted to get these entries, worth a week of playing, out of my head :).



<p>Cya for now.

<p>Wow! This has probably been my most enjoyable session ever, but - at the same time - maybe my worst too.



<p>When I logged in I hit my friends list as usual. Lots of friends online, but they were pretty spread out over the continents. One name that caught my eye was Donadiel. Maybe some of you remember him as the person who gave me 1pp and some patchwork armor. I talked to him for a while, and he did remember me. He was now a Human Druid, level 9, making his way to Qyenos.



<p>Speaking of Qyenos. Sephy was there when I logged in, so I thought I'd just go scarab hunting or something for myself until he came back. There were about 30 people in the thicket now, but not many campers at mooto. I mostly went to the rune hill and killed off skeletons for good loot (got 3 rusty scimitars and 3 great worn staffs now), but once in a while I could come upon an empty mooto camp. 



<p>When I'd just finished mooto I got a call from Soma! He was currenlty I Freeport I think and we decided to meet up in the outskirts of Rivervale. Finally, I thought, I'm getting my FS Scimitar :).



<p>It took some time for Soma to treck over the commonlands though and I had some time to finish off some more mootos and skels. I wasn't alone the next time I came to the Mooto camp though. A person named Ophid stood there, camping for Mooto. We agreed on taking turns, and as soon as Mooto spawned I received a message from Soma, telling me he was near Rivervale now. Even though it was Ophid's time to take Mooto he let me have him as I'd split after that. Thanks Ophid!



<p>I gated back to Rivervale and met up with Soma. I cheered as he gave me the Scimitar, along with a Dervish ring (Cut-throat Insignia Ring, +2 Dex, +1 AC). I gave him some food and water, and then he gated back to Freeport. Thanks goes to Gual (for finding the scimitar for me), to Trey (for taking the scimitar, teleporting across the continent and giving the scimitar to Soma) and to Soma (for actually giving it to me :). Thanks guys!



<p>Anyway, I equipped my FS Scimitar and went to the bank to deposit my old one. Then I met up with Newf and I asked her if she had anything for sale. She'd picked up a couple of Mino axes during her journies and I bought one for the friendly price of 3pp. It'll come in handy in the hands of Thalandin, I am sure :).



<p>Back in the Thicket I instantly went up the rune hill and went skel killing. I was swinging twice my speed now, but strangely, I wasn't doing straight 11's with ignite on. I did a lot of 4-10, which seemed wierd. It continued to be like that when I later fought Mooto and the occasional scarab. I thought FS had the exact same dmg as rusty?



<p>After I had camped Mooto a couple of times I went to check out the Orc Camp. Turned out it was a bit crowded though, so I only killed one centurion. There were only 20 people in the Thicket now, so I decided to go back to Mooto again. Ophid was gone at the time so I could take on Mooto 3 times in a row, and at one time he yielded a clay totem. Also got a rusty flail from him. I don't know if this is the spikey device the marshals are talking about, but I'll give the flail to Budo and see what he thinks about it :).



<p>Ophid came back, and I ran off to the wall gate, as Sephy was standing there now. We grouped up and went straight to the Orc camp. Fortunately it was empty and we pick up an incredible pace of gaining exp, by killing the ever spawning orcs. When I first logged in yesterday I was almost halfway through level 11, and now I only had a bubble away from 12!



<p>Something went wrong in Sephy's real life though and he disappeared. I left the orc camp and went to Mooto again until he'd come back. I checked for Ophid, but I got a message that Mooto had killed him when he had just hit level 11 and now he was back to 10 again, ouch. After 2 Mootos I heard a halfling named Garic, wanting to buy a Scimitar. As I had 3 of them in the bank I told him to meet up with me in Rivervale, I was encumbered anyway. We came to the agreement of 2gp for the scimitar and off I went to the thicket again.



<p>Sephy came back and we went to the Orc camp again. Now the spawning was a little less and he went away during resting hours, bringing back anything ranging from a Scarab to a Kodi :). I didn't have the time to fight as I was low on mana, but Sephy's skills were good, and with a dmg shield he could take down everything while I was medding. Then he picked up a white scarab and we began attacking it. We got it down with little problem and when I looted it I gazed through his lifeless body...



<p>Woho! Giant Scarab Egg Sac! Now I only need the danged Giant Fire Beetle legs and I'm all done.



<p>While I was medding I also came across a barbarian named Farran. I asked him about his homelands, and after what he told me I'll go to the northern lands as soon as I get SoW. Icey plains, big animals and lots of snow :).



<p>Anyway, the orcs started to respawn again. Sephy asked me over and over if I leveled after a kill, and I thought he could just do a /who on me. Wrong move. It seems that using /roleplay makes you /anon at the same time. Why? I wonder. The extreme roleplayer would tell me that it's not logical to know other's levels and classes. I don't agree. 



<p>Having /anon on might seem like a good idea, because then you have to roleplay yourself through the introducing phase. But for me, an /anon makes roleplaying worse! You'll get tons of questions of what level and class you are, which could make potential roleplayers to go blue again. The extremes would tell me again that "So what? If they turn blue because of that they aren't true roleplayers anyway". Well, then I'd really want to see you roleplay yourself through a "What level are you" conversation. You'd probably do that through /tells and if so, what's so wrong of showing your level and class already? This could, and it does, kill the use of the switch for many people, just because of this little thing.



<p>My advice to Verant would be to take away the /anon with the roleplay switch, and let the very extreme roleplayers to go both /roleplay and /anon.



<p>Please throw me your thoughts about this, I would love to have something to bounce around with.



<p>Back to the story, where were we? Oh yeah... after one more kodiak Sephy brought in I heard the sweet sound... (btw, don't think I got a faction hit for killing the kodi, they are still nice to me)



<p><font color=yellow>DRONG!!!



</font><p><font color=yellow>Welcome to level 12.</font> Woohoo, only two more levels till I get SoW and Bind affinity, I smell travel! :) Before I could cheer out I got a message from Sephy: "Let's dual now! :)". So that's why he kept fetching mobs? :)



<p>Oh well, I had promised him earlier that we'd dual, and now came his chance. I knew from the very start that he'd just beat me down in melee and I wouldn't have a chance in the world to get through a burn.



<p>We went to the lookout tower in the newbie zone of the thicket and I started to med up. Already were my hands shaking, and I could feel the adrenaline rush through my body, sweet.



<p>Ok, all med and buffed up. I started to cast a dmg shield on myself once I had approved on Sephy's duel. He came rushing forward, trying to hit me. I just kept pressing my ignite button and to my amazement, I burned Sephy a couple of times. What baffled me though was that Sephy got out of melee and started to ensnare me and throw bad buffs on me (didn't even know rangers had those :). That gave me time to throw both whirling winds and ignites and he was soon down to only a bubble of life, whereas I had only lost one!



<p>I started to feel the victory creeping up on me, but then I just realized that I was out of mana. Dang, I thought, taking beat after beat from Sephy. I felt the panic coming on, as he threw 11s of dmg and continously kicked me on my knees. All the suddenly the combat turned to Sephy's side and I soon saw myself down to 2 bubs of life. I kept hitting too though, with my 1-4s of dmg I soon took him down to less than half a bubble...



<p>Suddenly Sephy dropped down before my feet. I saw on the group meter that he was purple, and as I didn't see the victory text I kept on pumping my 1 and 2s on him.



<p><font color=yellow>Atherion has defeated Sephy in a duel to the death!</font>



<p>Finally! I changed to the outside view and took a screenshot. Woah, first duel and I had made it out successfully, and I was still shaking :).



<p>Sephy came back in his newbie clothes and I told him I had to log out as the time was creeping close to midnight. I thanked Sephy for helping me to level 12 and showing me another side of Everquest.



<p>Once I logged out and checked my screenshots I was less happy though. Checking out the screenshot I had taken just after I had killed Sephy I saw the following message in icky red:



<p><font color=red>Your faction standing with many elves has gotten worse.</font>



<p>What the...?!?!?!?



<p>At first I didn't know what to think. I never thought you would loose a faction standing, probably comparably to a murder (i.e not good), by duelling a fellow wood elf in an honorable fight, while even being grouped!



<p>Now I know I've seen two kinds of duelling messages, well actually three (but only two are relevant). One is the fleeing, we can skip that one. The two others are either the one I got (duel to the death) and then the other about "X has defeated Y in a duel, Y has been knocked unconcious" something. 



<p>If that's the case that you have to interupt the duel when your opponent is unconcious NOT to receive a faction hit I find it... not good, to put it lightly.



<p>First of all, there's no documentanion about dueling in your EQ package at all (*cough* "manual" *cough*). Secondly, let's go through this example:



<p>The Barbarian McBash is going to duel a fellow friend of his, named McVictim. Now, obviously McBash has the upper hand througout the whole combat and soon McVictim's life is going down fast. Now both McBash and McVictim has told the other one to stop at the unconcious part so that they won't receive a faction hit. But, oh no!!! What happens? McBash gets hit by the lag daemon and he unwillingly continues to bash down our poor McVictim. McVictim becomes unconcious and soon he trips over to the death part of the world. Oh no! When McBash comes back he gets the icky colored text that he will now be FUBARed whenever he tries to enter Halas. It turns out that our McBash is now the victim. Is that the kind of system we want?



<p>Another example:



<p>The Erudin Efreetin duels the Half Elf Uilonos. They both duel under the situations that they will both stop when either one of them are knocked unconcious. Oh no! Turned out that Efreetin missjudged the hp meter of Uilonos, and took him down to no life at all with a very powerful burn (or a damage over time spell that keeps going uncontrolably)! Efreetin gets the message that Half Elves dont like him at all now. Good thing Efreetin is a wizard with teleportation spells though, because if I were him I wouldn't take the boat to Qyenos. Is that the kind of system we want?



<p>Yet another (and last) example:



<p>Two unfriendly players are duelling each other. The first player, called Boofy, has a trick up his sleeve, and even though they both have agreed to stop at the unconcious part Boofy jumps down a cliffside or something when he is low on life. The fall gives him a ticket to the netherworld and the second player is faced with a huge faction hit. Haha, what a looser! Is that the kind of system we want?



<p>I don't know about you, but I clearly say no. 



<p>As it seem to me now is that you must probably interupt your slashing/bashing/burning whatever as soon as your opponent goes unconcious. Now with the examples I've stated above, that's no good.



<p>The changes I would like to see are these:



<p>Give the players the choice of duelling, either with mode A or B. Mode A goes all the way to death, and could be used during race wars (with the faction hit, which would only make sense). Now, mode B stops when the person gets unconcious, no matter how much you damaged him for. That way a duel can take place and a winner can be taken out, while at the same time no one get a faction hit by mistake.



<p>As with the /roleplaying thing, send me stuff about this if you want.



<p>So what will I do personally now when Atherion is worth less than a fishing grub in Kelethin? Well, first of all I'm going to check how much I've gone down faction-wise. If it's as little as when you go up one step for killing a goblin in Rivervale I guess I'm pretty ok. On the other hand, if people start looking at me dubiously I'll take contact with a GM. I am no way making a new character due to bad information (or non at all).



<p>It says the following in game manual which lies in your EQ directory:



<p><blockquote>"/d  - challenges targeted PC to a duel - to accept, they type /d with you targeted as well. Duel is in effect until one "dies" (is knocked unconscious) or flees the zone".</blockquote>



<p>There it says "is knocked unconscious" and I kept beating Sephy down until I got the message that I had won, and I got the screenshot to prove it that I received that just a smash away from slain. And the manual says nothing about receiving a faction hit.



<p>The whole message:



<p>You slash Sephy for 1 point of damage

<br>You try to slash Sephy, but miss!

<br><font color=yellow>Atherion has defeated Sephy in a duel to the death!</font>

<br>You slash Sephy for 10 points of damage

<br>You have slain Sephy!

<br><font color=red>Your faction standing with many elves has gotten worse.</font>



<p>Obviously the message should have come after the last 10 points of damage. But it's always like that, I get the gain experience thing before I see the mob get slain and go down.



<p>Secondly I'm going to find out what "many elves" mean. Does it mean just Wood Elves, or does it include Half Elves and High Elves? (I guess Darkies don't count). 



<p>If everything goes well I'll won't experience much of a change, but then again I don't want guards coming after me with a "Wood Elves like you have no place in Kelethin/Qyenos/Felwithe!"



<p>End of rant... phew :). If I take away the part about the faction hit this has been my best session ever. I got my FS Scimitar, I leveled up to 12, I got the Giant Scarab Egg sac and I had tons of fun!



<p>That's all for now I guess. If you see an Atherion lying face down near Kelethin don't bother trying to wake him up.

<p>Okay, another entry, looking good :).



<p>I logged in with Atherion last Thursday, hoping to see Thalandin online. I thought that we could go and do that queen hunt, but unfortunately, he wasn't online.



<p>Instead I went past the wall and started to hunt some scarabs. Most of them are blue to me now, but there is one or two that are white to me. Unfortunately, those are too hard for me, even with all my buffs on.



<p>I also noted the changes of the last patch - almost every "good" animal (bears, kodiaks, wolves...) look at me aimably now, even though I've wacked a couple of them before. I don't see any reason for it though, as kodiaks have never ever been aggressive to me in the past. Heck! only a scarab (excluding all the annoying bixies who attack you when you're medding) has attacked me in weeks.



<p>Oh, received some information about the squad ring. You need to attain 1000 "points" in order to get your squad ring. Every runnyeye bead turned in to the Sheriff gives you 1p. Giving orc belts to Budo gives you 5p (or 20p, a lot of argue about this, but 5 seems to be the most logical one) and 20p for killing Mooto.



<p>Anyway, later that night I felt the urge to buy a new spell, having 6pp in the bank and everything (I know, I'm poor :). I thought about buying Wind Strike. I was certain that I had seen it in the stores before, but now I couldn't find it. I talked to some higher level druids and they told me it was removed... strange. Oh well, I thought, purchasing the spell Treeform instead.



<p>Thwomp! Ok, so I'm a tree, now what? I heard this spell could be a lifesaver when you're retrieving your corpse and medding in dangerous locations. Rivervale wasn't one of them I suppose, as I found no use for it. I tried to enter the bank, but instead of getting stuck at the door, I got stuck 10 yards away, just before the guards, unable to move. Crap! First time I try it and something goes wrong :). I clicked on the icon and I returned to normal, able to move again. One thing's for sure, I won't use this spell much, at least not for now. I've heard though that Hillies can't see through Treeform, so I guess I'll use it later when I'm exploring.



<p>With my bank nearly depleted of jiggeling coins I sat down and logged out.

<p>I logged in back yesterday, Friday. With school over I thought of doing a 5 hour marathon of straigth EQing. This time I shut down ICQ before logging in, and to my surprice I had no percential lag at all, cool.



<p>Thalandin was online now and I met up with him in the thicket. He'd been attacked by yet another Queen again. We decided to do a little hunt, but all we could attract to spawn was the princess, and after that nothing happened.



<p>Instead I headed for the Orc Camps, where Sephy was. We grouped up and went scarab hunting. Being level 11, my Sheild of Thistles usually hang around on Sephy for the whole combat, which is good. With Sephy's mino axe plus my Shield I could sit down the whole combat medding, while he taked out the mob(s) :).



<p>After a couple of scarabs we found ourselves at the Mooto camp, and to our surprice, there were no one camping him. I think we camped Mooto 5 times (with Sephy bringing in scarabs and spiders to keep us busy until Mooto spawned again). We also had a jester there, named Midean who performed acts of charming. Kind of funny watching a goblin being severely beaten up by a charmed spider :).



      <p>Oh, speaking of jesters. Go see their homepage at <a href=http://www.jestersguild.com>www.jestersguild.com</a>, 
        they got lovely music :). 
      <p>Anyway, at some point Sephy crashed. Mooto spawned again, and to my amazement, he wasn't that hard to take on. I just made sure I went into melee, and from there I could burn him pretty good with little interuptions (pretty easy when Mooto always tries to throw Drowsy on you :). I killed him twice when Sephy was gone, and I looted a clay totem at both times! I now have a horde of Herbies waiting for me in the bank ;).



<p>Oops, forgot to tell you. Sephy was AFK for a while earlier, so I went for a walk and killed a Giant Wasp. Surpriced was I when it had Giant Wasp wings as loot! That's right, wasp wings. Now I only need the Scarab egg sac and the Giant Fire Beetle legs and I'm all done for the bug collection. I wonder what my reward will be?



<p>Sephy was still gone after I had killed Mooto twice. While I was sitting there medding for a third time, someone named Cippo auctioned to sell a Snakeskin Jerkin. I asked him for the price, and he wanted 4pp for the Jerkin. 4pp? That's quite a bargain (9 AC, +5 vs Poison), I thought, gating back to Rivervale where he would meet me.



<p>I had just enough money when I had sold off all my loot (saving the Herbies). I was just about to get my remaining money from the bank when a bug struck me.



<p>I was unable to enter the bank screen, as well as changing interface mode by pressing F10. I checked for gms, found one and petitioned about my problem. There was no response, and I was forced to sit down and wait for the bug to "run it's course". With some help with Cippo opening the trade window, the bug eventually broke off and I could collect my money in the bank.



<p>The Jerkin lifted my AC a bit, but I was disappointed that it shared the same "skin" as patchwork. I thought it would be greenish, but... no :).



<p>Anyway, back to the thicket for some more mooto killing. When I got there Sephy had just "respawned" again. Long crash. We grouped up again and camped Mooto.



<p>I don't know about you, but I totally HATE camping. It's so boring, especially when the mob takes longer time to respawn than you can meditate up your lost mana. I don't have much experience with camping, but with Mooto it's just med, wait, then 5 seconds of BOOM BOOM, and then repeat. So why am I doing it you wonder? Well, mooto gives the 20p for the squad ring, he gives Herbies and as much exp as the scarabs. And the fact that there is virtually no risk at taking on Mooto at level 11. Now will I turn into a powergamer and go from camping site to camping site throughout my EQ career? No way :). The only thing that will tease me to level after 14 is if there's an area I encounter that I want to explore, but can't because of a low level (I know for sure I won't explore the 40+ dungeons, at least not for now :).



<p>Back to the story, after 2 more Mooto's the night was falling and I had to take my dog for a walk. When I came back after 30-45 minutes Sephy was at the Orc Camp, trying to level. We decided to try solo for a while. I checked out Mooto and it was now camped with tons of people arguing who was next to take on Mooto. As it would be too time consuming (and boring) to camp him with 4 other mad powergamers (probably also wanting to hit level 14 :) I left and tried on some scarabs.



<p>My path of scarab hunting led me to the skeleton hill. I took down a skeleton and just after, something popped up at the rune. At first I thought it was one of those mean dreadies, but it looked more like a Lesser Mummy. Turned out it was a zombie, coning blue. Now I had taken down one before with little trouble. So I burned him, not thinking of putting on a dmg shield on myself (big mistake). The combat quickly turned to the zombie's favor, where he was hitting me for 18-20 hits, interupting every burn I did. What was so different from the previous zombie was that this zombie was wielding both a sword and a shield, ugh. I thought about running to the guards, but I couldn't decide. I saw myself at 2 bubs of life and I knew that it was now too late to run. I kept pressing the ignite button as much as I could. I had gotten about 3 burns on him so far and he was at half life. Then he finally missed me again and I could pump in a quick burn. Boom, 34dmg, and then another, 20dmg - slain!



<p>Phew...



<p>He was carrying a Rusty Scimitar just like myself and a Round Shield (AC 6), no wonder he was hard. This brings me to some thinking; zombies must have one helluva' Strength to be able to bash me for 18-20dmg with a rusty scimmie.



<p>Healing up at the wall I gated back to Rivervale. The Round Shield sold for an impressive 1pp 1gp. I placed the scimmie in my bank as a backup weapon, just in case.



<p>Speaking of scimmies; still no sign of Soma. I've talked to him through ICQ though, and he told me he'd probably spend the whole saturday and sunday on EQ. Did a quick check this morning, no Soma, but I wasn't expecting anything else anyway, the time being way past midnight his time (damn timezones! :).



<p>As I sold off my other loots and giving the beads to the Sheriff I saw a halfling, announcing about his enchanted jewelry. He had a couple of +2 wis rings, which I thought would come in handy. I was expecting a price of about 1-2pp per ring. Turned out he sold them for 9pp - yipes, enchanted stuff is expensive!



<p>Anyway, with no Soma or money around I logged out. It didn't turn out to be a 5 hour marathon though. Didn't even log 4 hours. Oh well, I guess I can make up for that tonight :).



<p>Oh btw, speaking of roleplaying. I wrote earlier that I had trouble finding roleplayers. Well, as a god sent, the roleplaying switch came along. I now always try to start a conversation in "roleplay mode" with another purple being, and stay as much as normal to other blues. Though I have seen that even purple people forget about roleplaying when they are camping, but hey! who can blame them? :)

<p>Phew, long time no see.



<p>I finally took the time to start working on the journal again. Only one more schoolday now and I'll be free as a dwarven smith making screaming maces in Crushbone (ok, so that wasn't a good example :). Btw, good news; Hopefully, I'll be able to use Everquest on an average 30 hours per week. I'm making this journal a part of my school project which I'm supposed to finish next year. If that comes true you'll see this journal being updated constantly, well, almost :). If it doesn't go well, I'll continue working on this journal as I have done so far.



<p>Anyway, let's look at what I've done in EQ during these... 2-3 weeks? As you know I did hit level 10. Problem was though that I was leveling very slowly, and that was because my meleeing capabilities sucked badly. I could take on a kodiak by myself with only minor problems, but that often resulted in a very empty mana bar. And an empty mana bar means recovering, and that's way expensive and time consuming :). So, with the knowledge that there were some very good buffs around in the 3rd rank of druid spells I went goblin chasing for a whole weekend. During that time I did get enough money to buy Firefist and Strength of Earth. Now before that I had purchased the following spells: Shield of Thistles, Thistlecoat, Ignite and Light Healing.



<p>Light Healing was simply awesome. It took about 3/4 of the manabar and gave me a full bar of health. Thistlecoat was a bit of a disappointment, only doing 1 single point of damage. It has a great duration though. With Shield of Thistles it was worse. It took a lot of my mana bar, and the duration was only 30 seconds. Still, it was essential to cast it to be able to take down kodiaks. Ignite is awesome, doing mostly 32dmg on mobs, only taking a little less than a full bar. But, when all came around, I was sitting facedown, staring at my spellbook.



<p>With Firefist and Strength of Earth Atherion's combat abilities took a turn though. Firefist is plain awesome! With it activated I hit about 80% of the time and mostly score my maximum of 11dmg (sometimes, very rarely 12dmg) with my rusty scimitar. I haven't noticed a big change with Strength of Earth, but it does help me do that rare 12dmg blow.



<p>Having Skin Like Wood, Thistlecoat, Firefist and Strength of Earth active I rarely use any ignites when fighting blue creatures (except for the occasional nasty spider and all the kodiaks). With Shield of Thistles I become even more efficient, but if I do an ignite during combat I'll have some serious meding times. Still, it's way better this way than it was before without the buffs.



<p>I've also talked to Gual, one of my friends from the good ol' Daggerfall times. He offered me a Fine Steel Scimitar some weeks ago. Problem was though that he is a troll, and Rivervalians (should have typed halflings, I know :) don't like trolls. Even worse, he's always in Cazic Thule, and that's a million miles away from home. 



<p>He's solved all that now though, well sort of. Turned out that his wizard friend (Trey?) teleported to Soma, and now he has the sword in his bank. Just one problem, Soma is in the Oasis... oh brother *shakes head* :). Hopefully I'll be able to meet up with Soma someplace during the weekend. I can't wait to try it out. I guess it does as much as damage as the rusty one, but the FS has a much shorter delay between swings, so we'll see, and hope :).



<p>Speaking of equipment, I've bumped into Kideten once or twice. He has leveled away pretty good. Last time I saw him he was level 15 and fighting it out in Paw. He'll try getting me some snakeskin, I heard that it was a pretty good armor for us druids.



<p>What else have I've been doing? Well I have been grouped a lot. Mostly with just another person (Adrack, Dukenyrl, Fullun, Gadina and Sephy to name a few). Being grouped with Adrack and later with Fullun I became aware of the fact that 2 druids grouping up togheter are NOT better than going alone. It's the tactical equivalent of two ogres, trying to sneak up on a cat. You may get a faster kill being two, but you'll have to recover almost as much as being alone. And I'd prefer alone because of the exp. Now, being a group of one buffer/caster/healer (a.k.a druid :) and a pure tank really makes grouping worthwile and fun. When I played with tanks I'd start combat with throwing a Shield of Thistles on them, and let the mob beat on him/her. When the mob had taken some damage I would run in from behind and try hitting it too, throwing a heal on the tanker if needed. With these tactics I noticed little downtime. While I was meding up the two bubbles of mana I had lost, the tank was healing up at a steady pace. 



<p>When I grouped with Dukenyrl, a very strong, big, smelly barbarian, we even took on Mooto. He wasn't that hard. With Dukenyrl pounding him, thus interupting him I stood from afar, nuking him down with ignites. Later at that time my connection went down and I heard from Dukenyrl that he even had taken Mooto down by himself (Dukenyrl only being a level 8 Warrior).



<p>Recently, I grouped up with Sephy, a very friendly wood elf cousin. We made a great party, killing anything from spiders to kodiaks. We even took down Mooto a couple of times, with the same strategy I had with Dukenyrl. This time Mooto wielded one of his rumoured clay totems! Sephy let me have it, and we named it Herbie :). Now, I thought Herbie was supposed to give me some extra mana, but it turned out to give me a +5 hp. Not a big deal I thought, but Sephy informed me that Herbie might just save my life sometime. Turned out I saved Sephy;



<p>We lost each other in the Thicket and soon he had a huge goblin train after him. I ran around looking for him and finally I noticed him, being severely beaten by the gobs. I had just targeted him and was ready to use up my last bub of mana to heal him when I saw him go down. His meter turned purple, telling me he was unconcious. I threw a heal 40 yards away and like a miracle I saw him standing up again. The gobs had luckily changed targets and were beating on some other adventurers that had come to Sephy's rescue. Sephy had about 6hps or so after the fight - no sweat :)



<p>At this time I also hit level 11 (DRONG!!!). Only 3 more levels till I get my hands on SoW! I have to get it soon though, because I'm beginning to sound, and act, more and more like a powergamer due to all this zonemongering. If I can play 30 hours next week I am sure I'll hit lvl 14 in no time. Once I do, I'll kiss the thicket good bye, probably for good. It's probably the most boring zone in the whole world right now. I know every hill, every spawn place, every camp and so forth. I just hope I'll get the squad ring before I do hit level 14.



<p>Speaking of quests. I still haven't found all the parts for Blixtin Entopop's bug collection. I still need a scarab egg sac, a giant wasp wing and... the giant fire beetle leg. Now I heard that you could get it from the Queen klicknack, a rare spawn in the newbie section of the thicket. So with my new level I ran back to the newbie section and began wacking beetles, in order to attract the queen to spawn. Everything went fine, first came the klicknacks, after a couple of those, the princess spawned. After that... nothing happened. I'd been killing beetles for over half an hour, and every empty slot was filled with fire beetle eyes (I heard you could get 1-3gps for those in the Faydark area). I finally gave up, went back to town, sold all my loot and disconnected.



<p>And that's where I am right now. I haven't logged in since with Atherion, but I will later today.



<p>I have been playing Everquest for 2 days now though, well almost. My friend finally got his copy of Everquest (woohoo!! only been 2 months :), and I helped him through the newbie stages of life and later I took control and "escorted" him to Rivervale. Here's the full story:



<p>First it took about 2 hours to get through the patching and the billing thingies. I think the login server disconnected thrice before the billing went through ok. Then my friend created his character, Thalandin, a wood elven ranger.



<p>Aaahhhh, a tear went down my cheek as he entered the game for the very first time. I'd been in the same seat 2 months ago, and I could understand his confusement :). I couldn't help him at first, as I was also a newbie when it came to the ranger's departement. A person named Captmorgan appeared though, and taught him the basics of being a ranger. Thalandin also received a rusty battle axe, a round shield and a cloth cap from this friendly person.



<p>Then it was time for the first combat. Thalandin picked a decaying skeleton, and after some 3-4dmg blows and a lucky 12dmg, it went down. That's right, 12dmg! That's what my Atherion scores at most, being level 11, oh well :). It was pretty frustrating in the Faydark though (as always) and we both wanted Thalandin to go to Rivervale as soon as possible. So we changed seats and I pointed Thalandin to what I thought was Kaladim. Turned out I was wrong, and that my memory from the trip I made failed me, and we soon saw ourselves lost in the big ol' woods. Thalandin shouted across the zone if there was somone there, willing to fetch him. Awaiting the reply of any friendly ranger I foolishly walked Thalandin right into an Orc Centurion. It turned out we'd somehow managed to end up near the crushbone camps!



<p>Crack! Ick, those centurions really hit a lvl 1 character pretty hard :). I panickly jumped away and to my amazement, we found ourselves at the newbie ruins. The blood rushed through our brains as we were trying to help poor Thalandin from certain death. And then, when we were almost at the top of the hill, almost overlooking the lifts... Thalandin was knocked unconcious, and later the orc finished him off.



<p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...



<p>Ah, back in newbie clothes. Oh wait a minute, we started in that :). We went back to the corpse, took the shield and axe and thought of making another try, this time letting a guide do the hard work, to find the way to Butcherblock :). A ranger, named Jralm, approached and told Thalandin that he would take him all the way to the docks.



<p>This time we did better, and soon we found ourselves at the passage that led to the Butcherblock mountains. Btw, Thalandin is using a 56k modem, and zoning goes so much faster at his place. I don't know if it's because of his 56k modem or 128 RAM, or both.



<p>After we'd run through the butcherblocks we finally came to the docks. We'd seen on shout messages that the boat had just gone by, so we were forced to sit down and wait. At this time Thalandin's connection was doing loops of packet loss and soon we heard the infamous "t-click"! Turned out it had been my father calling, I guess time goes by when you're having fun :)



<p>We resumed our journey the next evening and when I came to my friend's house he'd already taken the boat. At his last zoning to Freeport his connection had gone down and once he came back the boat was LEAVING Freeport. Our brave Thalandin had no choice but to throw himself overboard and swim to shore. He succeeded and when I sat down next to him he was looking for a capable binder. We found one (forgot his name... grrr!) and we proceeded to West Freeport. We checked Thalandin's equipment, and strangely, his tome of discord was there. So we had to go to North Freeport to deposit it in the bank (no, this doesn't mean he'll be a PK, it's just better to have it in the bank than not at all, EQ is always changing). It was tedious to zone, and for safety reasons we got bound in West Freeport too, just near the western gate (forgot the binders name again... grrr!).



<p>Ok, so there it was... the plains outside Freeport. Last time I walked here I was trying to hang on to Soma's pace as he guided me to Rivervale. With Thalandin just being level 2 I quickly ran him to the borderzone, that would lead us to the East Commonlands.



<p>You have entered the East Commonlands.



<p>I quickly moved Thalandin to safety, up on the wall side. Once again I saw the stuff that Soma had shown me; The passage to Ro, the ghoul camp, and then later in the West Commonlands, the entrance to Beholder (at least I think it was that order). The East Commonlands wasn't as bad as I had thought. This time I took time on me, checking the surroundings. In TEC all I could see were giant spiders and with Thalandin's tracking (which is an awesome thing) we saw asps and other snakes.



<p>In the West Commonlands came our horror - the hillies (Hill Giants). Even though it looked like they were just 30 feet away Thalandin made it safetly to the most southwestern part of TEW. Now it became a lot harder. We had to run down in the zone to spot the passage, leading to the Kithicor Forest. Just one problem though, there was a puma standing right down there looking very hungry (and through a shout we were told that they were very very aggressive against a level 1 character :).



<p>We cramed (typo?) the western wall as much as we could, avoiding the Puma. To our luck we saw a high level paladin resting up on the wall (Amorphius something). He escorted Thalandin to the Kithicor Forest and told us that he'd get us safetly to Rivervale. I remembered from our previous treck that Soma had done a wrong turn and we had been lost in here before. And ironicly, Amorphious took a wrong turn himself :). I didn't know what he was thinking, but I told him that we should have gone right at the Freeport sign. We got split up somehow and I proceeded alone to the cavern which led to Rivervale.



<p>Wow, the Vale Patrol, what a sight!



<p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...



<p>Finally, our level 1 friend Thalandin had made it to the vale. After a total playing time of 3 hours the polka music kicked in, and what a lovely tune it is. We found a binder pretty fast and proceeded directly to the Thicket.



<p>I know it said LOW to MODERATE difficulty playing a Ranger, but I never thought it would show so much as it did when Thalandin started to do battle. It was somewhat of a struggle during the first level, but once he had doubled his amount of hps and got his offence/defense/slashing up a couple of points he could wack fire beetles and spiderlings with no problem at all. Even the mangy rat, which had scared me to the bone were no match for our Thalandin.



<p>At one point where Thalandin had gone back to Rivervale to get a container a friendly player named Teni (Half elf druid) had given him two backpacks, and almost a full suit of leather. That's right, leather! And at that time he was level 2, or was he still level 1 at that time?



<p>Anyway, all the suddenly Teni SoWs over to Freeport to get Thalandin some more stuff. I could just sit there, staring as my friend were getting all the goodies from this friendly player :).



<p>So, bedecked in leather and storing slots like no other newbie, Thalandin made it back to the Thicket. He had absolutely no problem at all now, killing fire beetles. They came grouped once though, but Thalandin was able to knock one of them down. Then when he started to pound on the other fire beetle, yet another one joined the battle. All the suddenly Thalandin's health bar went down to two bubbles and he had to run back to the guards. What was this strange beast of supreme power we wondered?



<p>It can't be true, the Queen!!?? Ugh... Here I'd been with my Atherion the previous weekend trying to find the rumoured Queen, and now it was here, pounding on Thalandin? Oh well, at least I know it exists for sure now, still I feel miserable :).



<p>The time had gone by again, and when I left my friend's house Thalandin was almost halfway through level 3. I guess we'll both go queen hunting later today. He'll get to kick the fire beetles, and I'll work on my conjuration skill, whirling winding to finish them off (and yes, skills DO increase even though you fight stuff which wont give you experience, just at a slower rate I guess).



<p>After experiencing the trip from Kelethin and Rivervale again I feel an even more urge to go exploring. I just hope I'll get out of this powergaming philosophy I'm having at the moment :).



<p>I guess that's end of this journal entry. There'll be more coming now though :)
