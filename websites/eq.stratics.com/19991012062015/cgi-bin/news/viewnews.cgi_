Brad has been posting yet again on alt.games.everquest.<p>This post was in response to someone who was upset about the planned changes to rubicite:<blockquote><font color="a00000">Ah, damned if we do, damned if we don't.  People complain about camping week after week, how horrible the KSing                    is in Cazic, and about all the problems associated with Rubicite.  They also ask for more quests.  We kill two birds                    with one stone, implementing class specific quests.                      <p>                    Ah well, you cannot please everyone all of the time.                     <p>                    The game will change.  Items will be removed and changed.  This is not a static world.  You can never count on                    some aspect of EQ to stay the same forever.                     <p>                    I'm sorry this upsets you.</font></blockquote>Then this post regarding the recent router outings:<blockquote><font color="a00000">This wasn't a planned downing.  Cerfnet is having router problems (see network status on everquest.com) and we                    needed to unexpectedly bring the servers down.                      </font></blockquote>And finally this post about their hard drive failures:<blockquote> It seems rather odd to me that Veriant has to take a server down when                     the hard drive crashes. If they were using a RAID 5 system or mass                     storage system, I would venture to say that they would have fewer Hard                     Drive problems, and when they do occur would not cause down time.                     In fact, I would bet that a single RAID 5 setup from StorageTek would                     take care of all their hard drive issues perminatly. I mean seriously,                     can they really need more than 3.8 Terrabytes of storage and a couple                     hundred meg per second? I've seen these things, a guy pulled 2 hard                     drives out while the system was running, no data loss, and very little                     proformance loss. It would mean the end of "Emergency Maintenance"                     right? Oh well, we can always hope......<p><font color="a00000">We do use RAID.  'Very little performance loss' is a myth, especially when it comes to the horsepower and disk                    access required by our servers.  So we rebuild the drives with the server program offline.  Once the new drive is                    rebuilt, we bring the server program back up.                     </font></blockquote>

From Catalyst:<blockquote>Milo D. Cooper (who seems to be gaining a reputation for being the person to ask about sexual EQ things) has updated his <a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/AskMilo">Ask Milo page</a> with a few new questions. Today Milo tackles such wonderful subjects as dealing with your own personal 'Wood Elf' and bouncing breasts... plus a few other topics. AM is our column over here at <a href="http://www.notcrazy.com">EverQuest NotCrazy</a> where you get the chance to send a question to Verants 3d Character Artist. This puppy is more addicting than re-runs of Alf, yes it's that good! =) Err, anyway here's a rip of one of todays questions:<P>Milo, I have this problem. Whenever I see one of those female wood elfs, I get incredibly turned on. I mean. I literally have to excuse myself from the computer for a few minutes to deal with my "wood elf", if you know what i mean. It never fails either, it happens every time. But im so addicted to Everquest that I cant get away from the computer. Naturally, I no longer have a girlfriend to take out my "aggrivations" on. As If playing EQ all the time wasnt bad enough for her (shes never been the computer type), she found out about my wood elf problem and left me. Real women dont even turn me on anymore, only those polygonal wood elves will 'do it' for me now. Please help me Milo! What can I do?</blockquote>Thanks!

Received this from Eldrad Stormrider:<blockquote>Well, tonights assault in the Ocean of Tears turned out to be a great  success!<p>We started out meeting at the freeport docks as planned, and sailed on to the island of the Sisterhood of Erolsi. From here we gathered outselves together and headed for the Cyclops island! <p>The clopses proved to be difficult, but against our army of 30-40 people, they fell quickly and easily! We slaughtered at least 10, before sacking the pirate camp for sport! There was one casualty here when Gornit respawned and chased a mage into another clops :( <p>When we felt Tunare's lust for the death of her enemies was satisfied, we hunted down the great dinosaur, Allizewsaur!<p>Things got messy here, as many could not find the island, some fell into the water as levitate wore off and had to swim the rest of the way, lost at sea :( Eventually all but one made it to the island, who gave up from being lost and gated home . It was very hard to find for those of us not used to using /loc to find things.<p> Once all were there that were going to be there, we heard one of us yelling "Incoming!", and the fight began! I shouted a battlecry in Tunare's name and dug my scimitar deep into his heel! (about as high as I could reach) <p> It was a long battle, and he hit harder than I"ve ever seen (even harder than Nagfen's claws, I believe), but the army was too much for him, and we were victorious and without casualties! <p>All in all it was a great event, and everyone that went had a lot of fun!
