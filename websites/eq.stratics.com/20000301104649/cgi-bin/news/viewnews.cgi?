<br>Found At: <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">Everquest Gameplay Board</a>.<p><blockquote>I haven't heard much from the everquest folk about pets and dual wield since the "quick fix" went into effect several weeks ago to allow mage pets to dual wield. I have begun to wonder if the problem ever will be addressed further. <p>I for one am not satisfied with the current state of things -- my pets can in fact dual wield, but only after a considerable time investment for each pet. Summoning a pair of daggers for my pet increases the time cost for summoning a pet by at least a factor of 2. Not only is it an annoyance from a player's standpoint, but it still is inconsistent with the game world, elementals should not need weapons -- ever -- to improve their fighting effectiveness. It also greatly reduces the effectiveness of one of my favorite soloing tactics -- the chain cast. When a pet is near dead, and I summon another to replace it, I don't have the time to hand off a pair of weapons before sending it into battle. <p>Don't get me wrong, I am glad that the good people at Verant realized their mistake with npc's and dual wielding and took quick steps to patch it. What bothers me is that what I once thought was intended as a "quick fix" now appears to be thought of as a permanent one. I want the development team to know that we mages and necromancers are not satisfied with this fix as permanent, that it is effecting our gameplay adversely, and that it is an issue that we strongly believe needs to be dealt with. <p>If I am wrong in assuming that the issue has been closed by Verant, please let me know. If not, I hope to hear that it will be reopened to set things right in the realms of Norrath. <p>Nemuneir Noldaron<br>Magician of the 35'th Circle, Cazic Thule<p><font color="a00000">Demonhands pretty much hit the nail on the head when he said: <br>"This was a code problem from day one. It resulted in Verant beefing up all the mobs to account for the fact that dual wield wasn;t working (and they couldn't figure it out for themselves). For them to fix it now would require that they either beef up all characters or otherwise reduce the power of all mobs. In either case, it's more work than they want to do." <p>Rebalancing the entire game just to fix one bug correctly would yield tons of other bugs, take a long time, and be painful for everyone. Yes, you have to hand your pet weapons should you want him to dual wield, and it is a bit at odds with the game world in general, but after much thought, it was the option that was the least suseptable to additional problems. <p>- Gordon

<blcokquote>Sent in by Phredd-<p>I was on Fennin Ro last night around 9:30pm EST, when a broadcast message came up about the Fennin Ro server split.  The plan was that, for one hour, Verant would be logging the names of characters who entered the /movelog command. The first 1200 people logged would have their accounts moved to the new server on Tuesday the 29th.<p>As you might expect, the Fennin Ro population suddenly soared to over 2700, and there was a whole new world of lag for everyone. After about fifteen minutes, more broadcast messages came. These told us all that, for whatever reason, the logging process had not been successful and was being called off.<p>They plan to try again tonight, 29th February, at around the same time. Hopefully, it will go well this time, although while it is underway the lag will probably be nasty.<p>Good luck to everyone making the move; you'll be missed!<p>- Phredd<br>Fennin Ro.</blockquote>

And thus the victory to Darkness.<p>/ooc<br>As a result of Saturday's events we are going to be trying even harder to spread the conflict across the lands to avoid overloading a single zone.  We ask commanders on both sides to work together to plan encounters across the lands.<p>Also to weed out those only interested in bloodlust we have decided to prohibit killing.  If this makes no sense to you then you're in the wrong event.  The Light vs Darkness concept is to give players a break from the boredom of camping spawns, more roleplay, the challenge of team combat against intelligent opponents and the chance to be part  of a larger and ongoing story.<p>For more information visit:<br>http://www.MNStarfire.com/everquest/roleplaying.html<p>- Balar (wright@MNStarfire.com)</blockquote>

Greetings!<BR><BR>The Stratics Message Forum has migrated to a new software platform. The UBB software you have become accustomed to are no longer to be used. They are set for READ ONLY as a courtesy so that you may review old messages. That is why youare receiving the error message that you have described. Until further notice I am bringing the UBB forums down because of this confusion.<BR><BR>The migration was completed just last night so some of the Stratics web sitesmay not have updated their links to the new script yet. I apologize for the confusion - I did have all of the web sites post a message in the News regarding this migration.<BR><BR>The new Stratics Forums can now be found here:<BR><BR><A HREF=http://boards.stratics.com>http://boards.stratics.com</a><BR><BR>Once the site you normally visit has updated it's links, you may begin using that method to access the categories and forums you prefer directly. Keep in mind, that we have migrated the user accounts from the UBB to the new software. So your old username and password will work just fine. You do not need to register again.<BR><BR>If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me anytime.<BR><BR>Regards,<BR><BR>Jhariden<BR>Head of Interactive Development
