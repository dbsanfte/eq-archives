Abashi created this <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/023524.html" target="_blank">thread</a> on the official EverQuest forums:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><blockquote>Yesterday we completed the split of the Fennin Ro server, moving a portion of the users from Fennin over to Druzzil Ro, the new server. In order to avoid moving too many people, we limited the number in order to see the splits effect on prime-time usage.<p>Tonight we will re-open registration on Fennin Ro to allow more people to move over to Druzzil. In addition, we will also be opening registration on Solusek Ro and Xegony, taking some of the players from both of those servers as well. The move itself will take place on Friday morning.<p>Very soon, we'll be posting a patch message with all of the relevant data for customers on those three servers, but I wanted to get the word out to them as soon as possible.</blockquote></font>Sounds like good news for those people who did not make it in their first attempt. Good to see the other servers are being split too!<br>In another posting in that thread he replied to some questions on the split:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2><blockquote>(player)<br>One question that comes to mind about bringing in players from Solusek Ro and Xegony to Druzzil Ro is that of duplicate character names. There will very likely be a few duplicate names found from server to server, and this may create problems when migrating accounts from servers other than Fennin Ro.<p>(Abashi)<br>Yes, we are aware of the issue of possible duplicates, and that will be addressed in the patch message that will go up soon. Basically, it's announced that people who choose to move might need a name change on their character to resolve a duplicate issue, and if this occurs, an "X" will be appended to their name. In the event they have an "X" appended to their name, they may contact a GM in-game and get the name changed to something they pick.<p>(player)<br>Also, the original Fennin split was capped at 1200 accounts. Will tonights registration use different, lower caps? (ie, 300 accounts from each?).<p>(Abashi)<br>The number of people we are moving is much smaller than it was yesterday. Ideally, yesterday 100% of the people we moved would have been represented in peak usage. As a side effect though, people who played off-peak logged on and executed the command. In addition, there are also people with multiple accounts that executed the command for each account. As a result, the amount of "peak usage" that was moved was less than we would have liked. Comparing the number moved to the amount of peak usage moved allowed us to estimate the outcome future moves and help us move the right number. <p>(player)<br>Keep adding new non-split servers (300 copies of the game sold each day -> new servers every other week just to keep up).<p>(Abashi)<br>It doesn't quite work like that. First, of the new users we attract, roughly 30% play at peak. There's also the fact that people also leave the game. <p>(player)<br>FINISH the Fennin split first.Once that split is DONE, then see if there's more room for overflow off other servers.<p>(Abashi)<br>The problem with this is that each split means that the server must be down for an extended period. This goes for the source as well as the destination server. We want to limit the number of people negatively affected by the split, hence we are doing a few at once.<p> </blockquote></font>

<p><blockquote>From the same loons that brought you "Milo is from Mars, Jewel is from Venus", "What Does God Need With A Starship?", and "What Undies Does He Wear Anyways?" Comes an all new Installment in the <a href="http://eq.notcrazy.com/AskMilo" target="EQNC">Ask Milo</a> Series, EverWars: Milo Writes Back. *Starring* Milo Cooper, with a special *Guest Appearance* by Rick Schmitz, and *Produced* by the <a href="http://eq.notcrazy.com" target="EQNC">EQ-NotCrazy</a> 2 Year Anniversary Staff. <BR><BR>This installment Features over thirty responses, dozens of Grammatical corrections, and several sordid questions probably better left undiscussed. And, following in the tradtion of other high-budget trailers, here is a clip that leaves you dying to know what the hell is going on and why it is happening in the first place! <BR><P><blockquote><font size="-1">Sorry, but the technique is a secret, passed down through many generations of my African ancestors from the great tribal chieftan himself, Momama Mojamba. Were I to reveal the secret, mighty Momama's wrathful spirit would descend upon me like a Japanese elevator on Venus. No, seriously, I just use the standard Max 1.2 UVW map modifier (I have to use 1.2 because our in-house plug-ins were written for that version of the software), the shape of which depends on the shape of the object that I'm mapping.</font></blockquote><BR>With a special introductory price of only one mouseclick, you too can see what EQ fans sometimes rave about.
