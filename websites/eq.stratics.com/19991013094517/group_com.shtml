Alrighty.  I've played EQ for a while now.  Been solo, been grouped. 
Been in groups that were really amazing, and with groups that were
anything but.  If you have done any of the following (and not learned it
was BAD), please read this document because it is designed for you. 
<p>
Bad things to do while grouping:
<ol>
<li>Play a Wizard/Mage/Necro or any other direct damage wielder and burn the mob (monster group) all of the way down because you think that's what a
   Wizard/Magician/ETC does.

<li>While playing a cleric/druid/shaman, you cast only healing, because 
   that's what you're supposed do. 

<li>As a fighter, took _all_ the hits in a fight.  Leaving you at 20% or 
   so. 

<li>Run ahead or opened doors especially in dungeons while the rest of the
   group was weakened and/or resting.

<li>Gotten the entire group killed because you were a dumbass (see #1-#4)
</ol>
[Note this list is in no way complete, and just provides a few examples 
 of common, but violently stupid grouping behaviors]
<p>
So you're either a total scrub (above) or you aren't. For example if
someone asks you why are you not using Taunt, Lay on Hands, Harm Touch, or
Backstab and your response is "What is that?" you are a _scrub_.  Check
out this text, you might learn something that will make your stay in
Norrath just a bit easier and more fun.  Also read the eqmanual and maybe
check out a few of the other documents floating around the net.  (PPI will
have guides for most classes relatively soon.)
<p>
This is Group Tactics 101.  Don't expect to see anything else.
<p>
While you are in a group, each class has a pile of skills that make a
group more efficient.  This is assuming that each character knows
something and isn't a glowing pile of scrubbiness.  We'll cover general
group issues first, and then move into specific hints for individual
classes while in groups.

<div>
1) You have many people fighting with lots of health.  Why should you 
   _ever_ let one person get mangled?  Trade hits.  Figure out how much 
   health everyone has (ask if nothing else) and then try to spread the 
   damage across the entire group.  This way you have 2-6 people 
   regenerating hitpoints (6 hps/tick) instead of one (1 hp/tick).  Easy 
   to understand.  If you get messed up, back out and let someone else 
   take the beats.  Watch out for frenzied monsters... they'll concentrate 
   on one thing until it's dead.  ALWAYS back out before you get below 40% hps 
   (2 bubbles).  Otherwise there is a good chance you won't get out.
<p>
2) You have lots of people hitting the monster.  Do it from all sides.  
   There is a bonus for attacking a monsters backside.  USE it.
<p>
3) If anybody realizes that the world is a bad place (ie: that Goblin Wizard 
   was red and no one bothered to check it), and yells RUN!,  everyone should 
   BUG OUT, but do it in a controlled fashion. Most likely the person that 
   yelled run is going to run as he calls the retreat which means that staying 
   becomes an even worse prospect for you.  People with more health stay back 
   and take hits so those with less health can get away.  After your escape, 
   confer to decide if what you ran from is worth taking another try.  
<p>
4) Know when to let people die (from #3).  Only attempt to buffer people if 
   you do this if you can do so safely.  It does no good to get the entire 
   group killed if you could have saved a few people.  Leave sacrificial lambs 
   if you can (pets, monks, or people you don't like :).

<div>
My subdivisions are really sketchy and vague, and many classes fit on
boundaries and borders between types.  Adjust for your group composition
and adapt to fill whatever roles you need to. 
<p>
(Fighter Types: Warriors, Monks, Rogues, Paladins, Rangers, Shadowknights, Bard)
<p>
Most often, if you just follow general strategies you'll be fine. 
Fighters are straightforward.  Fighters are the ones that are taking the
primary damage, and hopefully returning the favor.  It's your job to annoy
the monster as much as possible to allow the others in the party to get in
free hits.  You have a lot of responsibility.  You must keep watch on your
health and everyone else's, especially in multiple enemy combat.  Attack
anything that is attacking your spellcasters, and taunt mobs that won't
get off of more vulnerable characters.  If you're a good tank, you'll have
good armor and relatively high agility, so you'll take _much_ less damage
than would another member of your party.  However, you can't take _all_
the damage. 
<p>
Here's the part that is really hard.  You must know -when- to keep the
mobs on you, and when you can let other people take some hits.  In a good
group, no one leaves combat unscathed.  This is because it's more
efficient to have everyone healing (especially if you have a Bard in the
group) than just one.  So, tick off the monster, and then rotate the
target, saving weaker members as needed. 
<p>
Specifics:
<blockquote>
Taunt: If you have taunt, practice it.  It makes a monster think you've done more
damage to it.  Brief explaination of monster AI.  If you hurt them, they
don't like you.  If someone heals the person their fighting, they don't
like the healer, etc.  Taunt effectively makes a monster hate you as if
you'd done damage.  This allows you to keep the monster's attention so it
doesn't go beat on that spellcaster who just burned the monster for 50
damage.  This is a _good_ thing (assuming your spellcasters aren't total
nimrods and burn before you've taunted the mob).  The ideal taunt is one
that -just- keeps the monster on you, and if need be, you can let someone
else take the darned thing.  You do _not_ want to taunt a monster too
much, because then it will stick to you until you die and nothing anyone
else will do can get it off.  This is called frenzy.  It's guaranteed to
get you killed if you're not careful. 
<p>
Bows:  Every fighter than can use one (W,Ro,Ra,Sk) should have a bow.  It allows
you to back away from a monster and continue to deal damage.  This is very
useful in a dangerous fight.  Also expensive unless you have a Magician
along.  Still is worth it.  Once you are past about level 12 the expense
of the arrows is well justified.  The mobs begin to do much more damage
and also begin to give more loot per mob.  Soon spending a gold or two for
ten arrows will seem like a neglible loss for such an invaluable skill. 
<p>
Lay on Hands: The ultimate party Paladin panic button.  If you can't figure out how to
use a 'complete healing' spell... well... this guide might be too advanced
for you.  Never blow your load on this one and heal someone while the
healer of your group still has mana and is not being attacked by a mob. 
Unless the healer calls 'no mana' (or OOM for out of mana in shorthand),
then you're the last line of defense. 
<p>
Harm Touch: Amazing when trying to take out a big nasty.  Use as softening to really
'MEGATaunt' the monster.  Harm touch really annoys monsters because of the
big damage it does.  Basically hold this one until you get a mob that you
MUST get rid of fast .  An example of this would be a mob that hops on
when your party has already been severely damaged. 
<p>
Bards: Wow.  Get one of these in your party.  At L6 they become the best thing
this side of sliced bread.  Group healing is an amazing addition because
when people back out (which they should do at around 80% in a Bard powered
party) they come back at fu ll strength.  Wow.  Their other spells and
skills also make them a very well rounded type of character.  They have
nothing that defines them as a class except for their amazing range of
abilities (and the ability to use them indefinitely with no mana cost ).
<p>
Monks: While unable to use weapons, these fighers make up for it by sheer number
of attacks.  At high levels, a monk can get off 3-5 attacks a round. 
EASILY.  This makes them invaluable for tanking enemy spellcasters.  As
all of you casters know, if you're being hit constantly, you can't get a
spell off.  Monks, remember this advantage and use it to interrupt and
beat the hell out of those wizards and shaman that are about to make
crispy critters out of your party-members.  Another _invaluable_ skill is
Feign Death.  Practice this one as much as you can.  It allows you to
immediately drop out of combat, either to switch mob target, to mend, or
to wake up the clerics in the party (no cleric likes to see a party member
crumple in combat, makes their heart flutter). Feign death makes the monk
_the_ single best sacrificial lamb the party has.  Fight going bad? 
Everyone but the monk take off.  Monk, run the _other_ direction, and
before you get too low, Feign death.  You'll have given your party a good
20 second head start.  This sort of advantage cannot be underestimated
with the new bonuses to back/fleeing attacks.
<p>
Rogues: Your best place to be in combat is _behind_ a monster.  You should
_always_ be behind the monster. Backstab is the single most effective
melee combat in the game.  If you have another fighter who can taunt
effectively, you have a tremendous advan tage.  If you have a mage who can
attract attention with burn, you're equally set.  (See Mage section below
for tips).

	<tr>
		<td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><B><font color=050056>Class Specific Strategies: Burn Types</font></B>
<div>
(Burn Types: Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers, Enchanters, Shaman, Druids, Clerics)
<p>
Rule #1:  Burn is _not_ a caster's version of melee.  
<p>
Almost all of the casters (including the hybrids) have a way to deal
direct damage.  Direct damage is a good thing, but is so often misused
that I've almost broken my monitor in frustration.  Burn is for four
things: 
<ol>
<li>Attracting an enemies attention - either to start a fight, or to try to
   get if off of another party member (be careful with this one, cause
   you're next then).

<li>Finishing an enemy - Either one that is trying to escape, or it is much
   more efficient to use one last spell to knock it down rather than
   waiting a few rounds of combat for it to get killed in melee. 

<li>Panic button - If suddenly the world is a bad place, everyone better be
   lighting up the enemy in question if the party has any chance of
   survival. 

<li>Mid fight - Your warriors have been dealing a healthy amount of damage
   to the creature.  It is now time to use a _little_ burn.  Deal enough
   damage to use your burn abilities to make the combat go quicker but not
   so much that you A. draw the mob onto you or B. Burn up a ton of mana
   requiring the group to have a long downtime waiting for you to recover. 
</ol>
One more time: Burn is _not_ a caster's version of melee.  
<p>
Fire support does not mean 'always firing support'.  You don't call in an
airstrike in _every_ situation.  You save it for those instances when
standard troops (ie: fighters) are not sufficient.  Mana should be saved
whenever possible, and then used whenever necessary.  Remember that if
you have no mana, the party should stop and wait until you do, and if
you're being stupid and burning like a flame-thrower, you're just slowing
the party down.  (You'd be _out_ of my party in a big hurry.) 
<p>
At this point the question is "What _am_ I supposed to be doing?" during
the times when the fighters are damaging the creature to the point where
burn is effective.  This is the time for your weak melee.  Let the
fighters land two hits and then step in.  Your dagger or staff will never
catch up to the fighters melee but will do a little damage. Every bit
helps and it also allows you to take your share of the hits for more
efficient group healing. 
<p>
If you want to be an effective party member, you save the burn for those
occasions when it is needed, and otherwise, you attack with your puny
melee and try to avoid getting gacked.  If the monster decides it likes
you, you back out of combat and wait unt il the fighters have it's full
undivided attention.  Then you continue to prick it as much as you can. 
When the monster runs, -then- you torch it, because that's more efficient
than having your fighters chase it, possibly into more danger.  (Root also
wo rks well for this purpose, allowing the fighters to finish quickly). 
<p>
There are situations where a bit of judicious burn is necessary, but
please err on the side of not burning rather than becoming a torch. 
<p>
Specifics:
<blockquote>
Root:  Wizards, Shaman, Druids, Clerics, Enchanters.  If something is running,
DON'T LET IT.  Also can be used to stick a big ugly melee mob with no
ranged attacks in place.  Then the fighters arrow it to death while you
fill it full of flames.  (One use for a torch, but this is very
inefficient killing.)  Root is also resisted quite often.  Its mana cost
seems small at 30 but really the cost is somewhere around 45 or 50
depending on your level and ability with alteration because of these
resists.
<p>
De-buff:  Enchanters, Shaman, Necromancers.  If you can get a de-buff in at the
beginning of combat, most of the time it's like burning the whole way
through because the fighters are that much more effective.  Much more mana
efficient too.  It is one of t he most subtle of all the spell types since
its effects aren't immediately apparent but if you compare debuffed mobs
to mobs at full strength the difference is amazing.
<p>
Pets:  Check for more PPI documents on Magicians and Necromancers, but generally
consider them another fighter.  Control them as such.  If they get messed
up, back them off so they can heal.  In general pets are not as effective
in a group if you are taki ng single or dual targets.  Against multiple
targets they are invaluable.  Sicking them on an attacking creature you
can put one to be dealt with later while you concentrate on the mobs that
are actively attacking your living party members.
<p>
A much more important party skill for casters is handled under the Healer
types: buffs.

<div>
(Healer Types: Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Necromancer, Enchanter [what?! Read on])
 <p>
Sure, healers can heal, but they have one more skill that is _so_ much
more important that healing pales in comparison. 
<p>
What is this wonderful thing, you are thinking?  
<p>
Buffs.  Those magical enhancements that make you faster, better, stronger,
difficult to hit, and difficult to damage.  The PRIME function of a caster
of this type is to buff everyone in the party as much as possible.  The
secondary function is to keep tho se buffs from wearing off by keeping the
people wearing them alive.  Usually by casting healing spells to restore
health. 
<p>
Clerics and Shaman have the best combat buffs.  Enchanters have good buffs
and excellent de-buffs (see Burn Types).  Buff everyone and watch the
monsters writhe.  An example of good buff/class synergy is 'faster attack'
buffs (Bard or Enchanter) on a Monk.  Monks _already_ get 3-5 attacks a
round.  Increasing their speed, even by 50% moves that into th 4-7 attacks
per 'round' range, making it nearly impossible for an enemy caster to get
a spell off.  Buffs on any fighter type is good.  The more attacks one
has, the more effective the buffs.
<p>
Healing should only be used in dire emergencies.  Again, mana efficiency
is key.  If someone drops below 60%, it's a good time to heal them.  Also,
healing during downtime can be useful. 
<p>
Healing becomes almost unnecessary when you have good defensive buffs on
your tanks.  The difference they make is amazing.  Again just like
de-buffs it is hard to see the difference they make at first but once you
realize their power you will never let an yone go off without them.

Hopefully this document will help all of those people out there who are
group-impaired.  This new knowledge should help prevent people in your
group from: 
<ol>
<li>Leaving you to die
<li>Killing you themselves
<li>Swearing at you because you created long down times for the group by
   wasting all of your mana/health.  
<li>Kicking you out of a group because you failed to follow commands of
   your group leader (assuming he/she is competent).
</ol>
Please take some of this information and think about it.  It will help you
in your quest for adventure in EverQuest.  And, remember, I for one, have
no problems kicking people out of groups for being scrubs.  I doubt others
will either. 
<p>
Good luck.
