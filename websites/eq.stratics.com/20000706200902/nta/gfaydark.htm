                    place. You will know this lift by the large

                    lift. If you hang a left, through the large
                    patch of open land, you will come upon what
                    looks like a smaller version of Stonehenge.
                    Now, these ruins themselves have no real
                    significance, but around them, in that strip
                    of land, there is a large spawn of
                    newbie-like creatures. Giant wasps, bats,
                    widow hatchlings, black wolves, and the
                    occasional Orc Pawn can all be found here. </font></p>

                    Extending from this lift is a path, that path
                    leads to the Orc Camp. Here you can find a
                    plethora of Orcs, ranging from Pawns to
                    Centurions. The Orc fort continues through

                    server boundary with torches and banners on
                    either side. It is usually guarded by two
                    higher level Orc Centurions. The description
                    above gives a general idea on how to get
                    there. The other way to get there is, when
                    you get out of Felwithe, make a sharp right,
                    and follow the server boundary until you
                    eventually get there. Keep in mind it is a
                    ways from <strong>Felwithe</strong>, so don't

                    the best bet is to stick close to your
                    starting city, and fight the wasps and bats
                    that hang around there. The best areas to do
                    this are directly straight from <strong>Felwithe</strong>
                    and near the Ruins located near Kelethin.
                    Always remember, if something comes along
                    that you cant handle, run for the guards.
                    They are located on every lift in <strong>Kelethin</strong>
                    and at the gates of <strong>Felwithe</strong>.
                    At level 2, start killing decaying skeletons
                    and widow hatchlings which spawn in the same
                    general areas. Also, there is an abundance of
                    Black Wolves near the Ruins. (when people
                    aren't rushing to kill them all) These give
                    good experience at level 2 and they often
                    have ruined wolf pelts, which can be sold to
                    other players for 2-4 silver, or made into
                    armor with the Tailoring skill.</font></p>

                    levels 2-4 you should try to find and kill as
                    many Orc Pawns as you can. They often spawn
                    around the Ruins described earlier. Also, if
                    you see them, kill pixie tricksters. They
                    will give good experience at levels 2 and 3,
                    and also good loot. At Level 4, you can
                    usually find Orc Centurions in the Orc Camp
                    to kill, but I recommend going in a group, as
                    there are also higher level Orc Centurions
                    and Oracles there.</font></p>

                    you can do. There are Centurions there which
                    range from level 4 to level 9. You can also
                    try Fairy Maidens, Fairy Nobles, and Fairy

                    many level specific creatures. You'll often
                    find yourself killing things which are a
                    level or two below you, but if you know what
                    you're looking for, then you can do alright,
