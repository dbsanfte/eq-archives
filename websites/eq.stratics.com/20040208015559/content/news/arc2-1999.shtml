              <div> Here's John Smedley with some further information concerning 
                the upcoming downtime and patch: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Just as a reminder, we will be 
                  doing maintainence from 7am to 8am pst tomorrow morning April 
                  1st. This will not include the Client patch which we want to 
                  get 1 more full day of Testing. That will be put up on Friday 
                  April 2nd at 3am (asuuming that tomorrow's testing goes well). 
                  It's important for people to realize that we are only going 
                  to put up patches once we're convinced they are stable. Tonight 
                  we found a bug that we fixed and we want to get another 24 hours 
                  of testing. This will be a pretty big (content, not size) patch 
                  as it will include: 
                  <p> 1) Music on non-soundfont cards 
                  </font><div><font color=#a00000> 2) Frame Rate increase</font><div><font color=#a00000> 
                  3) Numerous crash and other bug fixes, 
                  <p> We have also located and fixed a bug that was causing corpses 
                    to decay to quickly. That was a server side fix so it doesn't 
                    need to wait for the client patch. 
                  <p> We are also working on numerous bugs including crashes on 
                    the client as well as many gameplay bugs. We will be coming 
                    up with a complete list of exactly what we are tracking by 
                    sometime tomorrow. 
                  <p> Also, one last item: Bertoxxulous should be up real shortly 
                    here.

              <div> The outlook for the possible retail distribution of EverQuest 
                in Australia isn't looking good. Here's more, from Zyxpac: 
                <blockquote> Well you won't be seeing EverQuest on the store shelves 
                  in Australia! According the Hilad Corporation, the company that 
                  has the SOLE distribution rights for EverQuest in OZ, it will 
                  be too expensive the sell in Australia... AUS$140 a copy! (I 
                  don't know about you, but my "bull$#!& detector" went off load 
                  and clear... AUS$140 for a US$50 game? Exchange rates are not 
                  THAT bad, and there is no import duty on software!). This means 
                  they are NOT going to distribute the game in this country. They 
                  still retain their sole distribution rights however, which means 
                  that no-one else in this country (including individual stores) 
                  is allowed to import the game. 
                  <p> So as for buying EverQuest retail in Australia, forget it! 
                    It's not going to happen in the forseeable future. 
                </blockquote>
                The outlook in most of Europe seems grim as well. Here's Elminster 
                on the subject: 
                <blockquote> There is still no EQ in sight for us poor Europeans. 
                  A few online stores have even less copies now, which are of 
                  course long sold out. Next chance they might ship EQ to Europe 
                  is in one or two weeks. </blockquote>

                  Compendium</a>, a bi-monthly newspaper dedicated to roleplaying 
                  on Fennin Ro. In future the Compendium will be released every 
                  second Wednesday, and contains role playing news from Fennin 
                  Ro, Classified Ads, Announcements, Stories, and opinion pieces. 
                  Our hope is to not only encourage role playing on Fennin, but 
                  give credit to those role plays that have been accomplished 
                  on the server, and spark creativity for future role plays. 
                  <p> We are also looking for the ads of those tradespeople on 
                    Fennin seeking to buy and sell important items, and the major 
                    announcements you would like to share with your fellow roleplayers. 
                    And perhaps you would like to report your role playing story? 
                    Look for the Copper Compendium at <a href="http://www.acheron.com/compendium">www.acheron.com/compendium</a>.

                <blockquote> All I'm asking is for the community to give them 
                  some time to work the kinks out of the game. At one point things 
                  were running fine and I've managed to rack up 25 hours of game 
                  time. Has Verant/989 really failed us yet? Personally I don't 
                  think so. Origin failed us, they took two years to fix all the 
                  kinks in Ultima Online. Yet your not even giving Verant a full 
                  two weeks. Have patience go outside and play some football go 
                  back into reality for a little bit because once EverQuest is 
                  back up and in working condition, and believe me things will 
                  work soon enough, reality will no longer exist, reality will

                  by EQ Extreme were faster character movement, quicker regeneration 
                  of health and magic, the enabling of permanent daylight and 
                  the ability to see invisible items. The concept was serious 
                  enough that John Smedley, president/CEO of Verant Interactive, 
                  the company behind EverQuest, publicly posted that players found 
                  using EQ Extreme—or any other enhancement program—would be excised 
                  from the game. 
                  <p> "Use it and you will be banned," Smedley posted to the message 
                    board at the EverQuest Vault web site, a fan page not associated 
                    with Verant. "No exceptions, no [second] chances." 
                  <p> Much to the relief of many (anti-cheat proponents and probably 
                    Verant staff) and the chagrin of others (those anxious to 
                    get an edge in the game or remove its tedious elements), EQExtreme 
                    turned out to be a hoax. The EQExtreme web site stated, "EQ 
                    Extreme is a parody. A joke. In other words, it doesn’t work. 
                    Doesn’t do anything in fact. Zero. Zilch. Nada." It continued 
                    to say that it had over 1,000 downloads in one day, which 
                    obviously shows the desire to cheat in EverQuest. It’s probably 
                    just a matter of time before someone comes out with a working 
                    cheat program.

                posted an article revealing that EverQuest has debuted as the

                this feat: 
                <blockquote> Sony's online roleplaying game, EverQuest debuted 
                  as the best selling game for the week of March 14 - 20 according 
                  to PC Data numbers released today. EverQuest successfully unseated

                patch and the Veeshan, Xegony and The Rathe servers switching

                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Well... some good news. Veeshan 
                  and Xegony were moved very smoothly this morning. We are in 
                  the process of working on the newest server Bertoxxulous and 
                  it should be up sometime soon. No exact ETA but we hope sometime 
                  today. 
                  <p> Tomorrow morning at 7am pst we will be moving The Rathe 
                    over to CERF. Downtime will be from 7am to 11am tomorrow morning. 
                    In addition, from 7am to 8am tomorrow all the servers will 
                    be down while we put up a new server patch which should fix 
                    a lot of the corpse dissapearence problems that people have 
                    seen. We also are hoping to put up the Client Patch that will 
                    turn on music for everyone in addition to fixing a bunch of 
                    bugs (we'll get a list up when we put the patch up). We are 
                    only going to be able to put the patch up if we can get some 
                    help on the test server today, so please make a character 
                    on the test server and try to play there for a while. Report 
                    any problems to our GM's in the Tech Support chat room.

                  ------------------- 
                  <p> As many of you have noticed, we have been encountering some 
                    packet loss problems on the EverQuest servers. This problem 
                    is directly attributed to the high amount of players on-line 
                    at a given time. Our solution is simple, CerfNet, one of our 
                    providing ISPs, will be hosting the Veshaan and Xegony servers 
                    within their facilities. The transportation of the servers 
                    will be taking place on March 31st at 7:00am Pacific Standard 
                    Time. 
                  <p> The approximate downtime for this move is 4 hours. Also, 
                    for future reference, ALL updates to servers will be taking 
                    place at 3:00am Pacific Standard Time, on the morning of the 
                    update.

              <div> John Smedley sent me this follow-up announcement concerning 
                servers and bugs: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Tunare is now up and operational. 
                  Tomorrow morning at 7am pst we are moving Xegony and Veeshan 
                  over to CERFnet. These servers will be down for 4 hours. At 
                  that time we should be in MUCH better shape with regards to 
                  overloading our network. After that we plan on moving 2 more 
                  servers over on Thursday (we'll announce which two tomorrow). 
                  That will make the network problems we encountered this evening 
                  go away. 
                  <p> On another note, as many of you noticed we had a big problem 
                    with the login server tonight. In the last 2 nights we have 
                    fixed 3 major problems with the login server. In each of those 
                    cases we have removed one bottleneck only to hit another one. 
                    Tonight we finally fixed the last bottleneck problem. It was 
                    preventing people from entering when we had 8,000 people all 
                    trying to log in at one time. Many of you will say "Why didn't 
                    you guys think of that before"... well, we did.. but we're 
                    simply seeing a larger load than we've ever seen before, so 
                    some problems cropped up that we hadn't ever seen before. 
                    Fixing problems in a live environment like this is not much 
                    fun. 
                  <p> One last thing: We found AND have fixed a MAJOR corpse bug 
                    that would make corpses dissapear. We plan on testing that 
                    tonight and tomorrow and applying it on Thursday. 
                  <p> Thanks for your continued support. It isn't something we 
                    are taking for granted, I can assure you of that. We've been 
                    working 24/7 to fix problems as we find them. All I can say 
                    is that we need to make sure we have EverQuest up and running 
                    24/7 before you will all be happy. We look forward to doing 
                    just that!

                players. :) This will be resolved tomorrow, however, when we move 
                to a shiny new server which will have more than enough bandwidth 
                to accommodate us. Look forward to an extremely fast Stratics

                strange link colors), do not fret--this is due to EQStratics exceeding 
                it's T-1 and a half worth of bandwidth. All of these issues should 
                be resolved tomorrow afternoon.

            <div> 
              <div> Andy gives us a warning and analysis of fraudulent programs 
                such as EQExtreme, which can be used as a Trojan to house harmful 
                processes: 
                <blockquote> Upon analysis, the EQE program turned out to be a 
                  simple VB6 program with no references to vital DLLs that a true 
                  data stream modifier would need - but it could be a password 
                  stealer Trojan. Dr. Twister also thinks its a PW stealer. So 
                  be careful with this one - it could easily be used to take your 
                  password and send it to parts unknown. And most clueless wanna 
                  bees who use cheat programs would likely be none the wiser until 
                  they find their account jacked, their characters naked and +PvP 
                  and their reputation trashed (or worse banned for language, 
                  etc). </blockquote>
                I pointed out that the EverQuest client does not save your account 
                password to local hard disk, at which point he clarified the warning: 
                <blockquote> It doesn't, but anything that launches the program 
                  has the potential to "hook" the DX keyboard access and read 
                  the key presses - and use that to capture the password (with 
                  some Win32 calls from VB, although that is the awkward way - 
                  real programmers use C++ or C). I've had some time to look at 
                  this further, and its likely not even a Trojan - just a complete 
                  hoax. 
                  <p> But a warning is in order to folks who use such things, 
                    because they are likely to (irony) be the less security and 
                    technically minded people. 
                  <p> FYI This was a trick used by some UO hackers to rip off 
                    accounts. Since I'm involved in security work from time to 
                    time (I was one of the systems people who put in data stream 
                    security for DirecTV) I've found a lot of this stuff informative: 
                    reading the UO newsgroup over the past years has been very 
                    enlightening as to how attackers go about compromising a client 
                    and data stream - and now the assault on EQ will be started.

                The main point: Be careful with what you download and install 
                on your computer. Thanks Andy!

                of EverQuest</a>, which gives EQ an overall score of 10 out of 
                10 (and an Award of Excellence to boot). Here's a sample, pink 
                spoon included: 
                <blockquote> Well, let me first start off by saying, it's been 
                  a long time since I've been this addicted to a game, and I don't 
                  think I'll be getting board with "EverQuest" for a long time 
                  to come. When I first heard about "EverQuest", I was a little 
                  wary of it, because they were claiming lag would NOT be much 
                  of a problem, as it was in "Origins" "Ultima Online". I played 
                  UO for a couple of months, but quit because of Lag issues and 
                  I was getting PK'ed three times a day. "G3DN's" Hecubus stuck 
                  with it a lot longer, and often told me how much they improved, 
                  but even he still maintains that Lag problems still persist. 
                  So when I heard about "EverQuest" last year, I followed it's 
                  development closely. I was really happy to see they were using 
                  a 3D engine to take advantage of all these fancy new 3D accelerators 
                  most new computers are sporting these days. In fact, I think 
                  that was a pretty daring of "Varent" to create a online only 
                  game, that requires a 3D accelerator. Not long ago that would 
                  have given you a very limited consumer market. Luckily, as it 
                  turns out, the game has already sold very well and has broken 
                  pre-order records across genres. </blockquote>
                Thanks to one of the article's authors, Hecubus for the news!

                  downtime because of this). This server is the first to go completely 
                  onto our 2nd ISP CERFnet. It is being hosted at a different

              <div> John Smedley sent me the following letter concerning the recent 
                downtime and future plans for the game servers: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Hello All, 
                  <p> Well... we're quickly discovering that Murphy was an optimist. 
                  <p> We had some problems with the hardware on the primary login 
                    server. To answer the parade of questions: Yes, we do have 
                    redundant hardware/mirroring. This problem occured and we 
                    had to use our backup system, but of course nothing is ever 
                    easy and bringing the other system up took quite a bit longer 
                    than it should have. Now, I think if we had that problem again 
                    we could do it in about 5-10 minutes. 
                  <p> Here's a list of some of the things we have in place to 
                    insure our future downtimes are minimal: 
                  <p> 1) We're going to more evenly distribute servers with our 
                    2nd ISP (Cerfnet) 
                  </font><div><font color=#a00000> 2) We have another pipe coming 
                  in from another major ISP it will be here soon. That will make 
                  our 3rd ISP.</font><div><font color=#a00000> 3) Our downtime 
                  schedule will be strictly adhered to. This will be posted to 
                  our website. We will also be doing a better job of communicating 
                  during the downtimes. Frankly a lot of us end up being involved 
                  when there is a problem, and it always seems like we've just 
                  about got it up. We'll do better. 
                  <p> Tomorrow we should be bringing up the first of a about 3 
                    new servers. It should't require any downtime. 
                  <p> We do apologize for the inconvienence we have caused you 
                    all,

                  turned into a major hard drive failure. We are restoring from

              <div> Brad McQuaid has confirmed what has been suspected by many 
                and suggested by John Smedley; that EQExtreme is a harmless program 
                with no function relating to EverQuest: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Apparently the program was a 
                  hoax. We took the program seriously, and due to the huge public 
                  response, John posted our policy on the matter (which is also 
                  in the terms of service information one agrees to when launching 
                  EverQuest and something I've been saying for over a year). 
                  <p> Then because we have to take all such programs seriously 
                    (the same way we take reports of exploits and duping seriously, 
                    even though most are not valid), we investigated it.

                If you have already submitted your guild for creation, remember 
                that not all guilds will be activated at the same time. If you

            <div> 
              <div> Here's an update on the current state of EverQuest, from John 
                Smedley: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Hello All, 
                  <p> Here's a list of what's going on today: 
                  <p> 1) We are working heavily on the login server. You should 
                    see a HUGE improvement in login times a little later today. 
                    The only way for us to do this is to take it up and down a 
                    few times today after we've made the modifications. We're 
                    trying to do everything in a scheduled maintainence window, 
                    but we're balancing that with our users complaining about 
                    the time to login and at this time we have opted to do it 
                    quickly. We expect for a few more hours things will be up 
                    and down, but after that it should be nice and speedy. 
                  <p> 2) Adding More servers - Very shortly you will see 1 additional 
                    server online. By the end of the week we hope to have up 18 
                    servers (19 including test). These servers are being added 
                    on the CERFnet backbone so they will have a lot of very, very 
                    fast bandwidth. 
                  <p> 3) Moving a few other servers over to the CERFnet backbone. 
                    We haven't decided exactly which servers to move, but you 
                    can expect 1 today and 2 more tomorrow to be moved over to 
                    the CERFnet backbone. We'll let you know which servers are 
                    going to be moved. There will be a downtime of around 3 hours 
                    when we make this move. This downtime is unavoidable and unfortunately 
                    we need to do it while the CERFnet techs are available (i.e. 
                    in the middle of the day). 
                  <p> 4) Patching the Servers - We've fixed some bugs on the Server 
                    side and we will be putting them up today. There will be almost 
                    no downtime for these changes. 
                  <p> 5) New Client Patch - We have a client on the Test Server 
                    that has the new music code and a bunch of other fixes. We 
                    are almost ready to post it, but we wanted to stabilize things 
                    first with the new servers... it should be another 2 days 
                    max. 
                  <p> In addition, I want to assure everyone that we are well 
                    prepared for programs like EQExtreme (which btw doesn't really 
                    seem to work anyways). We take this type of thing VERY seriously 
                    and you'll see people being banned (regardless of whether 
                    the programs work or not). When we do that it will absolutely 
                    be done in public view. We don't want people like that playing 
                    EverQuest, and we want people to know we will do a lot more 
                    than just issue tough rhetoric.

            <div> 
              <div> A new exploit-based program named EQExtreme has been released 
                to the general public. Before I go on with a description, here's 
                Verant's policy concerning users of programs such as EQExtreme: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Official Policy on EverQuest 
                  Extreme 
                  <p> It's quite a simple policy really: 
                  <p> Use it and you will be banned. No exceptions, no 2nd chances. 
                    It's quite simple for us to log the use of this program and 
                    we have begun doing so.

                  Verant Interactive, Inc </font></blockquote>
                That being said, here is a rundown of the client's purported features: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Increase Mana Regeneration Rate 
                  <li>Increase Movement Rate 
                  <li>See Invisible 
                  <li>Always Day (No Night) 
                  <li>Filter Weather (No Rain or Snow) 
                </ul>
                Thankfully, nothing extremely detrimental to the world server 
                as a whole is available from EQEXtreme. However, this program 
                obviously provides unfair advantages to its user and would be 
                extremely destructive within a PvP environment. Once again, remember 
                that players using EQExtreme will be banned, no questions asked.

              <div> Here's John Smedley with both a possible cause of strange 
                disconnects and the reason behind all game servers being located 
                in San Diego: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> 1) Server Not Responding message 
                  - do you run a virus scanner? If you are using McAfee.. try 
                  disabling it. Also try the BusThrottle=1 line in your system.ini 
                  file under the [display] section. 
                  <p> 2) Servers around the US - We have taken a different approach. 
                    We are using multiple ISP's into the same location which has 
                    a similar effect. People use TOTALLY different routes to get 
                    to the same place. Some are over UUnet and some use CERFnet. 
                    Both are Tier 1 ISP's. Our decision to go with one main location 
                    doesn't mean we don't want to have redundancy in our incoming 
                    pipes. In fact, we plan on using a total of 3 ISP's in the 
                    near future.

              <div> We've received some great information on proxy servers and 
                their compatibility with EverQuest. First, here's some information 
                on WinGate, beginning with a note from John Smedley: 
                <blockquote> <font color=#a00000>I've had a few people ask whether 
                  or not EQ will work with WinGate. I've done some work with it 
                  this evening and it doesn't appear it will work. I'm going to 
                  give it to our network engineers tomorrow, but I'm interested 
                  if anyone out there has gotten it to work with WinGate 3.0. 
                  </font></blockquote>
                More on WinGate, including a suggestion for getting it to work 
                with EQ: 
                <blockquote> I personally know that WinGate DOES work with EQ, 
                  but only if you set it up to do Socks5 support and then grab 
                  a little proggy called SocksCap at <a href="http://www.socks.nec.com">www.socks.nec.com</a>. 
                  The others that are said not to work with EQ might do okay with 
                  SocksCap as well. -Kalay </blockquote>
                In addition, here is some extensive information on additional 
                proxy solutions that have been shown to work with EverQuest, from 
                various knowledgeable readers: 
                <blockquote> <b>WinRoute</b><div> I just read your article about 
                  DirectX and Proxies. I had the problem that EverQuest wasn't 
                  working at all with my WinGate 3 proxy. I asked at a message 
                  board if anyone knows an solution. Someone answered me and wrote 
                  that I should try the WinRoute Proxy Server (<a href="http://www.winroute.com">www.winroute.com</a>). 
                  So I tried it out and it works perfectly with Everquest! It 
                  doesn't modify your Winsock and if you set up the DHCP server... 
                  you even don't have to set up the client computers. (The WinGate 
                  DHCP never worked as it should). -Patrick. 
                  <p> <b>SyGate</b><div>
                  I am currently using SyGate to allow several computers on my 
                  home network to run EQ at the same time. Its VERY easy to setup 
                  and does IP address translation so it works with everything, 
                  no question. The URL for the product is <a href="http://www.sygate.com">www.sygate.com</a>. 
                  You can get a free demo and a 3 user license is only $50. I 
                  tried several of the alternatives you listed in the past and 
                  this worked out the best for me. 
                  <p> I am using SyGate 3.0 with Win98 it works flawlessly. The 
                    only thing you have to do is run the install, choose is this 
                    computer the server or is it a client (real difficult!) and 
                    whola. DONE! Run it on the computers you are using it will 
                    auto config and it will run 4 system together for only $39.99. 
                    <a href="http://192.41.59.112/sybergen/sg30.exe">Click here 
                    to download</a>. 
                  <p> This is the *best* solution for playing EQ over a shared 
                    IP connection. It doesn't require *any* special configuration 
                    on server or client, and certainly won't modify the Winsock. 
                    We installed it the other night and bam, EQ worked on all 
                    the other machines without a hitch. Very impressive. -Makath, 
                    Shawn and Mark 
                  <p> <b>FreeBSD with NATD</b><div>
                  This is regarding the Linux/IP Masquerading part of the Proxies 
                  post. A faster and cheaper method would be using FreeBSD with 
                  NATD (network address translation daemon) running. Installation 
                  of a FreeBSD box AND NATD (it comes with FreeBSD) can easily 
                  be done in under three hours by someone with no experience in 
                  it whatsoever (I did so myself). 
                  <p> <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">www.freebsd.org</a> has 
                    incredbile documentation for anyone who needs help. The benefit 
                    of a network address translation daemon over a proxy is that 
                    a natd will automatically translate EVERYTHING, you do not 
                    have to set up specific ports or rules. It also works flawlessly 
                    with a firewall. The other major benefit for those of you 
                    who share cable modems is that the FreeBSD box can run 24 
                    hours, there's no need to turn it off. 
                  <p> The issue of an additional computer is also easy to resolve. 
                    Go to <a href="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</a> or any 
                    one of the other online auction sites and you can make a 486 
                    (more than enough to power it) for under $50 US. A 486dx33 
                    with 8 megs of ram is easily sufficient to power such a thing. 
                    All that is needed is the cpu, motherboard, ram, video card, 
                    hard drive, and a network card (or two if you do not have 
                    a network already). I currently link three computers through 
                    a 486dx4/100, and it has not went over 3% cpu usage in over 
                    two weeks. -Warthog 
                  <p> <b>Microsoft Proxy</b><div>
                  (Follow-up to "DirectX 6.1, Sound and Proxies" post, see below.) 
                  The MSP client doesn't really "modify" the existing winsock.dll 
                  and associated files. It merely places a set of its own files 
                  that act as an "interceptor/redirector" for network calls. If 
                  the MSP client determines that the requested site/information 
                  is on the local network, it simply passes the calls off to the 
                  original winsock files. If it determines that the information 
                  being requested is on a different network (ie, the internet), 
                  it redirects the request(s) to the proxy server. 
                  <p> This is probably the most expensive choice, considering 
                    the costs associated with the required hardware, NT *Server* 
                    itself (since MS Proxy won't run on anything *but* "Server"), 
                    and then Proxy server itself. -KuryAhkin 
                </blockquote>
                Finally, some rumors on a new release version of Windows 98 that 
                may solve the proxy dilemma for a lot of players: 
                <blockquote> I recently read at <a href="http://www.ars-technica.com">www.ars-technica.com</a> 
                  that Microsoft is going to (sometime in April) release Windows 
                  98 SE (SE=Second Edition). Now, I don't know if they are doing 
                  a full blown new release (I would hope not considering the short 
                  time since the release of Win98) or if it'll be an OEM version, 
                  like OSR2 was for Win 95, but the interesting thing is that 
                  it is supposed to have a new Linux-like IP Masquerading feature, 
                  built-in! 
                  <p> I read some info at another web page (betanews or something 
                    like that) confirming that Window 98 SE really is coming out 
                    soon, but I didn't see any more info on the IP Masquerading 
                    feature. -Gink the Troll

                <blockquote> Let me just tell you from the start… I was extremely 
                  hyped for this game. Although I myself never got into the beta 
                  program, I read up on many journals kept by people in the beta 
                  and checked the Everquest website and FAQ often. I had everything 
                  planned out: what race and class I would be, where I would start 
                  out, and I even knew what name I wanted. I knew almost everything 
                  there was to know about this game and seen countless screenshots, 
                  so I pretty much knew what to expect when it came out… and believe 
                  me, I was one of the first to run to my local EB to pick up 
                  a copy. This was one of the biggest mistakes I have ever purchased.

              <div> John Smedley, President and CEO of Verant Interactive, provided 
                this status report earlier this morning: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Here's what we are working on: 
                  <p> 1) Login Server - Yes, We know it's slow right now.. we're 
                    working on it and hope to have the problem resolved on Monday. 
                    It was having some problems this evening and it went down 
                    once. When it came back up so many people were trying to log 
                    in that we had to do some flow control. 
                  <p> 2) Frequent Disconnects - For some reason, a small number 
                    of people seem to be getting disconnected a lot. I think it's 
                    a combination of ISP problems on their end and perhaps some 
                    odd interactions with other programs. I've already posted 
                    regarding the BusThrottle=1 potential fix, but I should also 
                    mention that we've seen some people's problems totally go 
                    away by turning off McAfee Virus Scanner. It has some sort 
                    of an Internet Download feature that takes up a bunch of time 
                    and could be causing disconnects. 
                  <p> 3) Music - Yes.. we are going to put a patch up this week 
                    for music. We could sure use people's help on the Test Server 
                    to help us check this out. Sorry about the wait for this, 
                    but we've wanted to get things stablized before we put up 
                    the first patch. 
                  <p> 4) Other things in the patch - Glide WILL be turned back 
                    on for the Banshee. PLEASE make sure to go get the latest 
                    drivers from the 3dfx website in preparation for this. IF 
                    YOU DON'T DO THIS YOU WILL LOCK UP IF YOU HAVE A BANSHEE. 
                  </font></blockquote>
                In addition, here's what he has to say about whether we'll see 
                any new world servers in the near future: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> The answer is yes. More info 
                  on Monday. </font></blockquote>

          <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 07:30 PM PT ] - <a href="mailto:den@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Den</a></font> 
            <div> 
              <div> I've gotten a report or two that indicates that it is possible 
                to use a Sound Blaster 64 PCI and DirectX 6.1 and still enjoy 
                full sound while playing EverQuest. On the other hand, I've also 
                received multiple reports that there is indeed a problem. Here's 
                some further information from Kozy, which indicates that your 
                choice of proxy software may effect sound and music within EQ: 
                <blockquote> Whether DirectX 6.1 may or may not cause sound problems 
                  is currently an "iffy" type situation. I've gotten word from 
                  others that it can, but nothing concrete. It seems heavily related 
                  to device conflicts and drivers. 
                  <p> What I have found to be the problem in my case (I still 
                    not dare upgrade to DirectX 6.1, Im waitin on version 7.0 
                    to be released shortly), is my prior choice of proxying ability. 
                    Apparently, the software I was using (LanBridge) modifies 
                    the winsock. My guess is that EQ makes use of the DirectPlay 
                    abilities in DirectX, and upon coming to a non-compatible 
                    winsock, chokes as necessary. 
                  <p> The odd thing is .. LanBridge worked for music, but killed 
                    sound effects. I have to personally give the software a thumbs-down 
                    for making me look like an idiot ;) 
                  <p> For people running multiple machines through one connection, 
                    the following common software/configurations do/do not work: 
                  <p> WinNT/Microsoft Proxy -> Works Fully (odd - since it also 
                    modifies the client winsock I believe) This is probably the 
                    most expensive choice, but some people work easier in a full 
                    MS environment. 
                  <p> LanBridge -> Repulsive - Doesnt work with EQ This costs 
                    like $150 - Very easy to setup. Downside is that it doesnt 
                    fully work (doh!) 
                  <p> WinGate -> Repulsive - Latest versions really aren't friendly 
                    - and doesn't work with EQ. Around $40. Complicated to setup. 
                  <p> Linux/IP Masquerading -> Works Fully $0 - Gotta love a free 
                    lunch eh? - Of course, this requires an extra machine lying 
                    around - but most people running multiple machines through 
                    one connection have it. Down side here is that its difficult 
                    to setup. But - Its the most reliable, stable, and workable 
                    solution I've found to date. 
                </blockquote>
                If you do find that DirectX 6.1 is causing problems on your system, 
                here's an easy method of removing it, submitted by Eliot: 
                <blockquote> If one needs to go back to a previous version of 
                  DirectX in order for EQ to work, there is a way to do it without 
                  reinstalling Windows. All the information needed to do this 
                  is at <a href="http://www.billsworkshop.com/techtips/dx6remove.html">http://www.billsworkshop.com/techtips/dx6remove.html</a>. 
                  Trust me, it works; I had to remove DirectX 6.1 a few months 
                  ago because of compatibility issues, and this guide helped. 
                  :) </blockquote>
                Thanks guys! Hopefully the above information will help if you've 
                been experiencing sound and/or proxy problems with EverQuest.

            <div> 
              <div> Krozy sent me word of a possible compatibility problem between 
                DirectX 6.1 and certain sound cards, which would effect a computer's 
                ability to enable music, sound effects or both while playing EverQuest: 
                <blockquote> On the day EverQuest went commercial, I had sound 
                  effects coming out of my Sound Blaster 64 PCI (an unsupported, 
                  but "should work" card). I had sound all through beta as well. 
                  That evening however, I upgraded from DirectX 6.0 to DirectX 
                  6.1. Ever since... I had no sound, no possibility for music. 
                  Oddly enough however, I still had normal sounds (that didnt 
                  require DirectX). After trying to find a way to uninstall DirectX, 
                  I came across an article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base that 
                  quite simply says something to the effect of "DirectX CAN'T 
                  be uninstalled. The only way to do so would be to reformat the 
                  machine". I took their word for it, considering I had tried 
                  countless methods (Im sure there IS a way... it's just not direct, 
                  sweet and simple. I figured if I couldnt find it... there sure 
                  wouldn't be a way for your average joe to find it either). This 
                  evening I reinstalled my machine, and took care to NOT upgrade 
                  to DirectX 6.1 Well, well, what do you know... I've got all 
                  sound enabled in the game again. 
                  <p> To make a long story short... I fear that either there is 
                    a compatibility issue with DirectX 6.1 concerning sound issues 
                    in either all Sound Cards, some Sound Cards, or just my Sound 
                    Card. A friend of mine has the exact same sound card, didn't 
                    upgrade, and has had sound the entire time. This is however, 
                    one of those things that Microsoft wouldnt be likely to admit 
                    to. They'd probably blame it on the hardware vendor. The hardware 
                    vendor would probably blame it on the software driver (DirectX). 
                    In other words - we'll never absolutely know unless several 
                    people have the same situation. 
                  <p> So basically I just want to say: Be wary of upgrading to 
                    DirectX 6.1 if you're planning on it. I am personally recommending 
                    to everyone I know to wait a few months, as realistically 
                    there isn't anything out there that absolutely needs DirectX 
                    6.1 as opposed to 6.0 (ok, there may be, but it'd be pretty 
                    rare).

              <div> Malatar sent me some information that may be of interest to 
                those of you with mathematical inclinations and a good calculator: 
                <blockquote> I wrote a program for my calculator to find the heading 
                  you should take to get from your current location to one that 
                  you've written down previously. (i.e. safe entrance to city, 
                  favorite hunting grounds, bridges, etc.) I'm just going to give 
                  the method, so that people can adapt it to their own calculators. 
                  (I have an HP 48GX, and my program is in RPN, which most people 
                  don't know...) 
                  <p> x1,y1 Your current location<div>
                  x2,y2 The destination location 
                  <p> theta = ArcCos[ (x2-x1)/(Sqrt [ (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 ] 
                    ) ]<div>
                  If (y2-y1<0) then theta = 360 - theta<div> theta = theta * 128 
                  / 90 
                  <p> The first line sets up the angle to go along. The second 
                    line makes the angle an absolute one between 0 and 360 degrees. 
                    This is to correct for calculators always returning principle 
                    angles. The last two lines convert your angle into an EverQuest 
                    Heading. Just turn to that heading, and take off! (Please

                  certain modems using a 3d card SEEMS to conflict in some cases 
                  with the modem. This only happens when there's a lot of poly's 
                  on the screen (like heavy spells, etc). Give this a try and 
                  let me know if you have success/failure with it.

            <div> 
              <div> At the prompting of a reader named Bayne, I recently asked 
                Brad McQuaid, Producer of EQ, whether seemingly wearable containers 
                such as belt and wrist pouches are bugged or intended not to be 
                worn. Here's the answer: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> I really wouldn't call this a 
                  bug -- it was a design decision years ago that containers would 
                  not be wearable. </font></blockquote>
                There you have it. I hope this clears up the confusion on the 
                part of some players. Thanks Brad!

                <blockquote> First off, I want to say that this contest was in 
                  no way intended to make anyone's experience in EverQuest less 
                  fun. None of the entries I received came at the expense (intentional 
                  deaths) of others, they just happened and folks took the shot. 
                  When I see trains in EQ (even my own), well, they look hilarious. 
                  So I thought it would be great to see a gallery of the great 
                  trains. Several terrific images were sent in. A hilarious one 
                  was sent in by an unnamed character from the Rallos Zek (PvP+) 
                  of a moss snake being "trained" by five dark elves! :) 
                  <p> And the winner of the Longest Train Contest is...Deimos! 
                    Check out the gnolls that piled up on Deimos <a href="http://dark-elf-nation.crpgtavern.com/EQ/BBTRAIN7.JPG">here</a>. 
                  <p> If you wish to view more images of trains from the contest, 
                    the runners up are in issues 6 & 7 of the Neriak Marauder

                from the article: 
                <blockquote> Because of its immense size, fully exploring Norrath 
                  would literally take you days … and that's if you didn't stop 
                  to fight any creatures or talk to any NPCs. The entire world 
                  of Norrath comprises about seventy enormous sections which load 
                  into memory after you cross zonal boundaries. I would estimate 
                  that I've set foot in approximately forty of the different regions 
                  throughout the beta and into the final, I I've come nowhere 
                  close to thoroughly exploring every territory. The gameworld 
                  is extensive and there is certainly plenty to keep you busy 
                  in Norrath. </blockquote>

              <div> Thirsty for more EQ reviews? PCBlitz has published their own 
                <a href="http://www.pcblitz.com/reviews/eq/">Review of EverQuest</a>, 
                which delivers a final verdict of 94 of 100. Here's an excerpt: 
                <blockquote> There is a real sense of community within Everquest. 
                  The communication system Verant has devised allows players many 
                  different, color coded, ways to talk to each other. There are 
                  even different languages for each of the races that only that 
                  race can understand. If another race doesn't understand your 
                  native tongue all they'll see is gibberish. Of course there's 
                  the common tongue (amazingly English has even penetrated the 
                  realms of Norrath, not to mention all the many worlds found 
                  in Star Trek) which everyone can understand. Chatting is an 
                  integral part of the EQ experience, whether making new friends, 
                  dueling other players, or screaming for help as you're being 
                  chased by a hoard of Orc Centurions. </blockquote>

                  who don't know, the EverQuest Gathering is a role playing event 
                  for people to come and learn more about EverQuest and have a 
                  good time. It will be held in North Ro, on the Fennin Ro server 
                  on Saturday, March 27th at 8:00pm ET. The Gathering will have 
                  guides from every city to North Ro on both Friday and Saturday. 
                  The Arcane Adventurers Guild will be providing guides on the 
                  Friday, March 26th at 9:00pm ET, and guides will also be provided 
                  at 4:00pm ET on Saturday, March 27th. 
                  <p> The EverQuest Gathering will have games, contests, performances, 
                    storytelling, giveaways, an auction, sales, new player helpers 
                    and much more. I am anticipating at least 200 people to attend, 
                    judging from the feedback I have been getting. With only one 
                    day left until the Gathering, I hope that as many people as 
                    possible will be able to attend, since this will be a landmark 
                    event in EverQuest history!

                of EverQuest</a>, which gives EQ an overall rating of 94%. Here's 
                a snippet: 
                <blockquote> A few years ago a living, breathing, and reacting 
                  world played with thousands of players from around the globe 
                  could only be dreamt about. However, this all changed with the 
                  advent of MUDs and Ultima Online. Despite all the flames Ultima 
                  Online has received, it has been truly revolutionary and beneficial 
                  to the online RPG society. I say Ultima Online has been beneficial 
                  because it has shown developers there is a great interest in 
                  this type of game, and the fact that other developers will learn 
                  from the mistakes Origin made. As many of you recall Ultima 
                  Online received poor reviews, and one magazine even proclaimed 
                  it to be the coaster of the month. However, most of the negative 
                  comments were directed at bugs and lag, not the overall concept 
                  of the game. Many people, myself included, fell in love with 
                  Ultima Online because nothing like this had ever been created 
                  before, with the exception of Meridian 59. Some players could 
                  only take so much abuse the bugs dished out in Ultima Online, 
                  and sought an alternative. Well it is finally here in the form 
                  of EverQuest, the best online RPG ever created. </blockquote>

                <ul>
                  <li>The enemy "teleport" bug where a wounded, fleeing foe moves 
                    instantly to a far corner of the zone away from the players, 
                    only to return a short time later with full health.<div> <font color=#a00000>Haven't 
                    seen this one, but I'll look into it.</font> 
                  <li>The length of time it takes to actually play the game (licence 
                    agreement, splash screens, connect, server select, etc., should 
                    be just a click away).<div> <font color=#a00000>It's a mouse 
                    click and 3 ESC key clicks away -- I'm getting pretty fast 
                    at this :)</font> 
                  <li>The fact that aside from other PC's, there is no way to 
                    cure extremely detrimental diseases such as rabies. (When 
                    caught with rabies at 5am PST, currently the only time we 
                    can actually play, why not make a trip to town and visit the

                    in the process.</font> 
                  <li>The need for a /reply command (to /tell the last person 
                    that msg'ed you, or the last person you /tell'ed).<div> <font color=#a00000>Agreed.</font>

                    speed was never our intent. Realistically, jumping does not 
                    increase your speed, but we left that part in for better gameplay.</font> 
                  <li>The lack of a "take everything" button for looting corpses.<div> 
                    <font color=#a00000>We experimented with this, and it was 
                    very problematic. What do you do when you can't carry all 
                    of it? Leave it on the corpse? Drop it to the ground? I'm 
                    not saying the idea in general isn't good, though.</font> 
                  <li>The inability to purchase quantities of items with quantity 
                    sliders (e.g. buying 20 water flasks takes 20 clicks, instead 
                    of three with a quantity slider).<div> <font color=#a00000>I 
                    very much agree with you here.</font> 
                  <li>The command history editor (shift-up) not allowing scroll 
                    back past the leftmost part of the text editing line (e.g. 
                    preventing one from editing /tell's that have scrolled past 
                    the right side of the editing line).<div> <font color=#a00000>Yes, 
                    this could be improved.</font> 
                  <li>The characters which do not print, like "Hi :)" becoming 
                    "Hi )".<div> <font color=#a00000>This was done because the 
                    parser things : and / are commands.</font> 
                  <li>The super-powerful NPC's (e.g. Gynok Moltar at Befallen 
                    or Varsoon The Undying at BlackBurrow) preventing resting 
                    and slaughtering everyone needlessly.<div> <font color=#a00000>In 
                    general these are supposed to be there to keep people from 
                    sitting around for long lengths of times (camping). That said, 
                    they are almost always avoidable if you keep in third person 
                    view and look around. Also, before going into final we toned 
                    quite a few of these down.</font> 
                  <li>The chat window color scheme making emotes, group messages, 
                    etc., difficult to differentiate and often impossible to read.<div> 
                    <font color=#a00000>In the future I'd like to make the color 
                    the various messages are displayed in user selectable.</font>

              <div> Incitatus informed me of a rather rowdy tavern party involving 
                a Game Master, which took place late last night on Fennin Ro. 
                Here are the details: 
                <blockquote> A lot of players on the Fennin Ro server got a real 
                  treat tonight! A few of us decided to throw a party at Crow's 
                  Tavern in Qeynos by offering free beer and ale to the players 
                  (who can resist free liquor?). Soon, a GM named Aaxanos The 
                  Brave decided to drop in and join us. He was in Qeynos investigating 
                  a problem with a few bugged NPC's, but he heard all the noise 
                  and had to join us! We gave him a few beers, and soon we were 
                  all more than a bit hammered and having a great time. 
                  <p> Before Aaxanos left us, he entertained us with a great fireworks 
                    display and posed with us for some screenshots! Everyone had 
                    a terrific time, and it was nice to see a GM, with so many 
                    important things to take care of, take some time out to have 
                    a drink with the players! Included are some screenshots I 
                    took of the festivities. It was kind of cramped in their with 
                    all the bodies, but I think they turned out really well! 
                </blockquote>

                of EverQuest</a>. Here's an excerpt from the article, which concludes 
                with an overall rating of 4 stars: 
                <blockquote> Make no mistake about it, this rating is based on 
                  comparisons of EverQuest to other online role playing games. 
                  From that perspective, even with it’s flaws, it is probably 
                  the best one out there. However, at this early stage it stinks 
                  of unfulfilled potential. There are a lot of issues that need 
                  to be tackled before upcoming prospects like Asheron's Call 
                  or Infantry hit store shelves if EverQuest is to be a long term 
                  success. </blockquote>

              <div> Verant has set the ball in motion today in expanding its server 
                capacity to include a total of 6 new world servers. This can be 
                confirmed by the new DNS entries for eqworld-14.989studios.com 
                through eqworld-19.989studios.com. 
                <p> Today, the first 2 of these servers were brought online for 
                  public use: 
                <ul>
                  <li>BristleBane Server 
                  <li>Innoruuk Server 
                </ul>
                It's expected that Verant will continue to monitor server usage, 
                and keep the remaining 4 servers on stand-by as demand increases.

                    magazine known to man (or woman or bandicoot, for that matter). 
                    EverQuest, The Station's 3D immersive online gaming phenom, 
                    Premieres this week at The Station. Buy the massive role-playing 
                    game at your favorite gaming store. Load that puppy on your 
                    PC. Then, join up with other Station members and embark on 
                    EverQuest's many intriguing expeditions online. Hint: Beware 
                    of the Red Dragon - don't even think about tangling with the 
                    fire-breather until your heroes reach Level 50. You'll need 
                    a strong and seasoned hunting party to reign victorious. Either 
                    that or the Atom Bomb!

            <div> 
              <div> John Smedley sent me the following letter earlier tonight. 
                Contained within is information pertaining to a variety of important 
                subjects. 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Hello All, 
                  <p> Well... it's been a much better day ;) 
                  <p> We had around 15,100 on at our peak this evening around 
                    7:45pm PST. During that time we were checking both the UUnet 
                    AND Cerfnet pipes all the time and they came up clean. 
                  <p> Does that mean that YOUR individual packet loss will be 
                    good? for 95% of the people the answer is yes... for some 
                    of you there will be problems, but at that point it's most 
                    likely either your ISP or something else on the net. We had 
                    some reports in select areas of problems (some @home users 
                    and a few others). These seem to be limited to particular 
                    places or ISP's... that's what I call normal connectivity. 
                    Remember, we put that packet loss meter in the game for the 
                    specific reason of helping diagnose people's problems. One 
                    other comment I wanted to make is that when I've gone into 
                    the servers and broadcast asking how people's packet loss. 
                    Over 90% said it was between 0% and 5%. 
                  <p> Some people have asked whether or not the servers are causing 
                    packet loss. The answer to that is no. 
                  <p> Some additional items of note: 
                  <p> 1) Tomorrow morning at 7am PST we will be doing routine 
                    maintainence (from now on things will be scheduled and put 
                    up on the downtime section of our website at <a href="http://www.everquest.com">www.everquest.com</a> 
                  <p> 2) Occasionally when you log in you see the message "Login 
                    database temporarily unavailable". This is a known bug and 
                    we are working on correcting it. Give it a minute to recover. 
                    We expect to have this bug nailed tomorrow and will keep you 
                    informed. 
                  <p> 3) Additional Servers - Yes, we ARE adding other servers. 
                    They are going up tomorrow. One thing we want to encourage 
                    is people on some of the busier servers to start up characters 
                    on these new servers if they have low enough level characters 
                    on the old ones and don't mind. If you want to stay where 
                    you are, that's fine too. - We will be adding 2 additional 
                    Servers tomorrow. We plan on adding more in the near future 
                    as well. 
                  <p> 4) Patch - We've been so frantically working on the UUnet 
                    problems that we had decided not to patch until they were 
                    solved. If we can ask for your help in playing on our Test 
                    Server we really want to make sure the new Music stuff for 
                    the other cards is working ok. It has tested out well internally, 
                    and it's up there now for you to play with. 
                  <p> 5) Bugs, Bugs, Bugs - We are smashing a lot of bugs, and 
                    the new patch will have a lot of bug fixes. We are particularly 
                    focusing on crashes when Zoning and logging into the game. 
                  <p> That's all for now.

                extensive travel guides for adventuring players. Look forward

              <div> I've received a report that the chat and login servers will 
                be taken down for maintenance at around 8 PM PT. I assume that 
                at least the login server will be modified in order to eliminate 
                the error mentioned below... Possibly to install the new network 
                card as mentioned in one of today's earlier posts (see "Help For 
                the Login Server"). All world servers will remain up during the 
                maintenance window. It is unknown for how long the servers will 
                be offline.

            <div> 
              <div> Brad McQuaid (Aradune) was just recently on the Fennin Ro 
                server broadcasting advice to players of the over-populated world. 
                The main points made are as follows: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Newer players of Fennin Ro, which averages up to 1,700 players 
                    at once (compared to the 1,000 to 1,200 on most other servers), 
                    should consider starting over on another server. 
                  <li>Transferring characters off of Fennin Ro will not be an 
                    option. 
                  <li>The server can easily handle the high number of players; 
                    the recommendation to switch servers is based on dangers of 
                    crowding and its adverse affects on the play experience. 
                  <li>Players will not be required to abandon their Fennin Ro 
                    characters--moving is merely a recommended course of action. 
                  <li>New world servers can quickly and easily be brought up. 
                </ul>
                Here's is the complete and 100% accurate transcript of Aradune's 
                broadcasts, which occurred between 6:45 and 7:00 PM PT: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Aradune broadcasts: 
                  <p> I know this is a popular server, because many guilds and 
                    groups have chosen it. 
                  </font><div><font color=#a00000> However, the other servers 
                  have far less players on them. </font><div><font color=#a00000> 
                  I would suggest that people start characters [a]new on other 
                  servers. no you cannot move existing ones. </font><div><font color=#a00000> 
                  I really think gameplay will be better for you on other servers. 
                  Up to you though. 
                  <p> When I say gameplay may be better on the other servers, 
                    I refer to the fact that the other servers are less crowded. 
                  </font><div><font color=#a00000> People, I am not requiring 
                  that people move. You can go where you want. This is just a 
                  suggestion. 
                  <p> We decided against moving characters from one server to 
                    another during beta -- we believe it would adversely affect 
                    the economies of the servers. 
                  </font><div><font color=#a00000> So we're not going to allow 
                  it. 
                  <p> So, like I said, if you don't have too much time invested 
                    here [Fennin Ro], I'd move. Up to you. 
                  </font><div><font color=#a00000> As for total # of servers, 
                  don't worry. the others aren't full yet and we can bring new 
                  servers online very fast. 
                  <p> FYI, the servers themselves can handle more than this no 
                    problem -- it's just a matter of crowding. I imagine it bothers 
                    some people more than others, so this has all just been a 
                    suggestion. I'm just trying to help :)

                  ------------------- 
                  <p> We have just received word from UUnet that the upgraded 
                    OC-12 connection between San Diego and Los Angeles has been 
                    completed and is up and running smoothly. Now that this hardware 
                    upgrade has taken place, we will not be required to lock down 
                    the number of players that are allowed to connect to EverQuest. 
                    From this point on, players should not encounter the tremendous 
                    amounts of packet loss, which was a direct result of the substandard 
                    UUnet connection. 
                  <p> Once again, we sincerely apologize for the frustration and 
                    inconvenience that this has caused our players.

                And the recent problems do indeed seem to have been solved. From 
                all reports I've seen--including my own experiences--the EverQuest

              <div> There's a news article from GameCenter concerning the recent 
                server outages, entitled <a href="http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/0,3,0-2601,00.html">Amends 
                Offered for EverQuest Problems</a>. Here's an interesting snippet 
                about the number of servers that Verant is using and the current 
                number of registered players: 
                <blockquote> "As of last night at 6:45 p.m. PST, everything is 
                  back to normal now, and within only a couple of hours, we noticed 
                  there were 12,000 online players," he told Gamecenter. Smedley 
                  also said that there are already more than 40,000 registered 
                  players, and that 989's servers can sustain roughly 1,500 players 
                  each. In addition, he said that 989 would add more servers over 
                  the ensuing months. Each server consists of 12 high-end PCs. 
                </blockquote>

              <div> MeccaWorld has published a medium-sized <a href="http://www.meccaworld.com/gamesdb/e/everquest/">Review 
                of EverQuest</a>. Here's an excerpt: 
                <blockquote> The list of features for EverQuest is great. The 
                  world is huge and so is the character variation. You have access 
                  to twelve races (Barbarian, Dark Elf, Dwarf, Erudite, Gnome, 
                  Half Elf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Ogre, Troll, and Wood Elf). 
                  After choosing your race, you pick a class, of which there are 
                  fourteen. They are Bard, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, Magician, 
                  Monk, Necromancer, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shadowknight, Shaman, 
                  Warrior, and Wizard. Every class is quite unique, as is every 
                  race. In addition to this, the different races have access to 
                  different starting cities. When you couple this with the ability 
                  to have up to eight characters, you'll find that EverQuest offers 
                  a great deal of variety. Still, quality is always more important 
                  than quantity. </blockquote>

                  I dropped into chat to hunt down a GM/guide to find out any 
                  information I could about the problems with the log on server 
                  and what's being done to correct the bad congestion during prime 
                  time playing hours. According to GM Blade UUnet has ordered 
                  another network card for the log on server and it "should" be 
                  installed later today. </blockquote>

            <div> 
              <div> Here are two small updates concerning the recent UUNet problems, 
                from John Smedley early this morning: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Just got off the line with UUnet. 
                  Status of the OC12 is that it is completely installed, but they 
                  are resolving a problem. They expect it online sometime in the 
                  wee hours of the morning. 
                  <p> Sorry for having to limit the number of people in the game, 
                    but until they get us the clean line up we have to our the 
                    line between SD and LA will go down and drop players. 
                  <p> We're trying to update the info on www.everquest.com as 
                    often as possible, but quite frankly every single second of 
                    my time is going to working with UUnet. 
                  <p> 
                  <hr width=25% color=#a00000>
                  <p> Well.. it's pretty obvious the login queue system is pretty 
                    popular. Plain and simply right now until UUnet gets that 
                    OC12 up (later tonite) to fix the problem's we were having 
                    with our existing liners we just don't have the bandwidth 
                    to support everyone. That leaves us with two approaches: 
                  <p> 1) Let as many as want to log in, and every so often EVERYONE 
                    gets dumped. 
                  </font><div><font color=#a00000> 2) Let 10,000 people play and 
                  not get dumped, and others come in as those people exit. 
                  <p> It's not like either option is remotely good, but we had 
                    to choose the lesser of 2 evils.

                One Week Later</a>, this feature, in a departure from the earlier 
                article (see "GameSpot on EverQuest"), praises EQ and holds it 
                up as a game to be admired. Here's a snippet: 
                <blockquote> It takes a certain kind of game to slow GameSpot's 
                  productivity to a halt, and while we want to believe that such 
                  a game does not exist, the truth of the matter is we've been 
                  playing an awful lot of EverQuest in the past week. This new 
                  online RPG has suffered through some serious server-side problems 
                  in the past few days, making it impossible to log into the game 
                  more often than not. Still, we've logged long hours already, 
                  and what follows are our first impressions, including a bevy 
                  of screenshots from some of the more colorful areas of Norrath 
                  we've encountered. </blockquote>

              <div> GameSpire has published an editorial focusing on EverQuest's 
                monthly fee, entitled <a href="http://www.gamespire.com/editorials/whypay.shtml">Why 
                Pay to Play?</a> Here's a snippet: 
                <blockquote> About a year and a half ago, when Ultima Online was 
                  released, I quickly bought the game, used up my free month, 
                  and proceeded to pay $9.95 every month to continue playing the 
                  game. For some strange reason, I didn't think it was unreasonable 
                  to have to pay in addition to the original CAN$79.99 I paid 
                  for the game. 
                  <p> Now, with the recent release of EverQuest, I'm surprised 
                    to hear a lot of people either accusing 989 Studios and Verant 
                    Interactive of charging too much, or complaining about them 
                    charging any monthly fee at all. Having explained why I felt 
                    a monthly cost was justified a number of times, I finally 
                    decided it was worth an editorial here on GameSpire. 
                </blockquote>
                In addition, GameSpire's <a href="http://www.gamespire.com/mailbag.shtml">Mailbag</a>

                errors when attempting to register, from Jason: 
                <blockquote> I encountered the same registration problem this 
                  a.m. and found out that the problem was actually due to the 
                  fact that the first time I attempted to create my account it 
                  was successfully created (even though the message displayed 
                  otherwise). The solution is therefore to create your account, 
                  ignore any error messages, attempt to log on with the created 
                  account and cross your fingers. Worked for me! </blockquote>

                  Chat Handles like "Howcanthischathanldebeused" being used. The 
                  friendly fellow at 989 told me the problems are based on the 
                  Reg Server being down for repairs. Apparently this is all wrapped 
                  up in the UUNet fiasco. He told me (without promising) that 
                  the Reg Servers (et al) SHOULD be up around 3pm Pacific today... 
                  but made no promises. </blockquote>

                  to the UUNet problem. The problem now is that we have 8,000+ 
                  people trying to log in at once durning peek hours, which is 
                  extreamly lagging our login process. We are in the process of 
                  adding amother server, but for now, we have added the 'lock' 
                  message as a temperary solution. This should get better over 
                  the next few days we we complete some internal changes in our 
                  network. This is also parly why we have decided to give everyone 
                  2 free weeks instead of 1 free week added to their initial free

                  (they're moving one of our ds-3s). 
                  <p> So what's happening is people are getting logged on and 
                    off, and major congestion is occuring. This should become 
                    more stable as they finish this fix.

              <div> The <a href="http://www.everquest.com">Official EverQuest 
                Site</a> was updated with the following piece of news: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> EverQuest Launch Update</font><div><font color=#a00000> 
                  Welcome to the first installment of the EverQuest development 
                  news, which will be updated multiple times daily so that we 
                  may keep all who travel the immense lands of Norrath informed 
                  of the changes that will be occurring. Previously, when John 
                  Smedley, Brad McQuaid or other EverQuest team members made major 
                  announcements, either messages would be posted on various web 
                  sites or e-mails would be sent to the editors. While this method 
                  of information propagation proved fairly successful early on, 
                  we felt that centralizing the constant flow of up-to-date news 
                  to one main source was key. From this point on, all game-play 
                  changes, server updates, and other EverQuest-related information 
                  will be announced here at www.everquest.com. 
                  <p> As many of you may already know, our launch of EverQuest, 
                    from an Internet connectivity standpoint, has not progressed 
                    as smoothly as predicted with one of our main ISP's, UUnet, 
                    which began on the night of the EverQuest launch. After working 
                    with Uunet for several days on the problem escalating the 
                    situation to their upper management, we have been informed 
                    that this afternoon they will implement a short term solution, 
                    and sometime tomorrow or soon there after a permanent solution 
                    (this will involve activating an OC12 between San Diego and 
                    LA). We apologize for this inconvenience to our valued customers. 
                    We will keep you updated as the matter progresses and as soon 
                    as we receive word from UUnet.

                  is not my cup of tea. I have thoroughly enjoyed testing and 
                  helping with the EQSS, and it will sadden me greatly to depart.

                Part 2</a> editorial from 3DNews.net (see "EQ Editorial from 3DNews.net"), 
                has posted some retractions. Here are some of the points that 
                he made in the recent addendum to the editorial: 
                <blockquote> 1. This is an editorial not a review or an article. 
                  That means that it is my personal opinion. What would you prefer, 
                  a magazine writing a gushing review about a game that doesn't 
                  work or an honest posting of my opinions? Think about that for 
                  a minute before you start insulting my mother and my journalistic 
                  integrity. 
                  <p> 2. I admit that I jumped the gun when I said Verant was 
                    lying-- it was an irresponsible thing to post simply when 
                    my problems were not due to UUNet. Many of you are still experiencing 
                    timeouts and packetloss due to UUNet. I apologize to Verant/Sony 
                    for that part of the post. 
                  <p> 3. How can anybody defend a GM telling customers to go screw 
                    themselves? I mean, seriously. I know you're all Verant buttkissers, 
                    but gimme a break. :)

                on the EverQuest chat server earlier tonight. Here are the major 
                points made: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> -Verant is still experiencing 
                  problems with UUNet and are still in contact with them to resolve 
                  the problem. No ETA. Reimbursement for lost play time is being 
                  considered.</font><div><font color=#a00000> -The reason that 
                  UUNet's <a href="http://www.noc.uu.net/">Current Network Status</a> 
                  page has been reporting "normal" all day is due to the fact 
                  that it sometimes takes UUNet a while to acknowledge that they 
                  have a problem. </font></blockquote>
                The above assertions are corroborated by the NANOG notice that 
                we printed earlier (see "Further Latency Problems"), although 
                it is obvious that the servers were purposely taken offline for 
                an extended period of time earlier Sunday.

                excerpt: 
                <blockquote> Well, Everquest continues to be unplayable during 
                  normal hours. I haven't been able to play the game during daylight 
                  and night before midnight EST ever. They blame the problems 
                  on UUNet (their bandwidth provider), but based on traceroutes 
                  they seem to be lying. Flat out lying. Perhaps UUnet was the 
                  problem previously, but it isn't now! 
                  <p> Try it. Go to a DOS command prompt, and type "tracert chat.everquest.com". 
                    The alter.net hosts are UUNet. See if you get any lag or timeouts 
                    on them. I don't!

                    at one point degraded to the point that UUnet had routed all 
                    traffic originating in San Diego through a single DS1 while 
                    they sat and rebooted their ATM gear for a few hours.

                apparently still experiencing problems logging in. The "locked" 
                message (see below) seems to be a temporary measure used to control 
                the number of users on the EverQuest chat server, which seems 
                to be back online. Here are some more details on this, from Zook: 
                <blockquote> At around 11:00 pm (est) the chat server came up. 
                  They obviously worked on it because of the new lock message 
                  that seems to control the intake of users. If you keep trying 
                  you will get in. The servers and the PL have improved greatly,

                  hrs trying to get back in to get dumped again and again. Actually 
                  it wasn't happening to everyone but to a few it was a problem.

                a note from Justin, who's been keeping tabs on the servers throughout 
                the day: 
                <blockquote> The servers were up today this afternoon 12-1 CST 
                  approx, but then there was a broadcast over the servers from 
                  Verant that stated they were taking the servers down for work. 
                  The servers were down for a short time but the chat server has 
                  yet to come back up. It looks like Verant/989 is currently in 
                  the process of testing or working on their chat server. Brad 
                  has stated several times that when it gets hit by thousands 
                  of people it goes nuts and that they need to upgrade their link 
                  to it and possibly expand or get better hardware. Anyway, it 
                  is currently Verant keeping the Chat Server down for work. </blockquote>

            <div> 
              <div> As you know, the EverQuest game and chat servers have been 
                inaccessible for a majority of today (not to mention the past 
                few days). In the past, UUNet's network problems have clearly 
                been the cause of the downtime, but today's troubles seem to be 
                a bit different. UUNet's <a href="http://www.noc.uu.net/">Current 
                Network Status</a> page has been reporting "normal" all day and 
                I've been receiving reports that indicate that today's downtime 
                may be more server than network-oriented. Here's some info that 
                Solstice sent me, after speaking with Verant tech support: 
                <blockquote> Currently (6:00PM CST) the <b>servers are down for 
                  maintenance</b>. At least that's what Verant told me when I 
                  called their tech support line. </blockquote>
                <!--In addition, here's some speculation, along with evidence in the form of traceroutes, from Keldarr:
<blockquote>
Regarding the availability of the chat server, I wouldn't say that the
problem is
on UUNet's side.  There are multiple paths to 989's servers, and it seems
that
at least one of the paths, specificlly the one that uses the 989-gw
router, is having
problems.  That router reports back that the network for
"chat.everquest.com [208.236.12.62]" is unreachable.  That is from my home connection.  This
can be seen in this <a href="files/trace_chat1.txt">traceroute report</a>
<p>
Hop number 15 displays the message I was talking about. Now the second part to back up my findings, here is the same traceroute, but instead of coming from my home and my cable modem,  this is a trace from a network management server located on the
MCI WorldCom/UUNet backbone.  Here is the <a href="files/trace_chat2.txt">second trace report</a>.
<p>
Notice that hop number 15 shows the successful trace to the
chat.everquest.com server, but this time it routed through one of Sony's gateway routers.
<p>
That would leave a routing issue in the 989-gw gateway router, that
keeps
users from hitting the chat.everquest.com.  The issue now would be who
is responsible for the gateway router and its configuration.
<p>
This is my two cents, hopefully someone will fix or replace that
router.
</blockquote>--> Other than what Brad McQuaid and John Smedley stated earlier 
                this morning, this is about all of the information on the current 
                state of the EverQuest servers that we have for you right now. 
                For the time being, at least, all we can do is offer reasonable 
                hypotheses as to why the EQ chat and game servers are inaccessible. 
                Be sure to keep checking back at the EQSS--we'll be posting here 
                any and all information that we uncover throughout the day.

                  is a role playing event for people to come and learn more about 
                  EverQuest and have a good time. It will be held in North Ro, 
                  on the Fennin Ro server on Saturday, March 27th at 8:00pm ET. 
                  The Gathering will have guides from every city to North Ro on 
                  both Friday and Saturday. The Arcane Adventurers Guild will 
                  be providing guides on the Friday, March 26th at 9:00pm ET, 
                  and guides will also be provided at 4:00pm ET on Saturday, March 
                  27th. 
                  <p> The EverQuest Gathering will have games, contests, performances, 
                    storytelling, giveaways, an auction, sales, new player helpers 
                    and much more. I am anticipating at least 200 people to attend, 
                    judging from the feedback I have been getting. Also, if you 
                    would like to be a volunteer, or have your guild sponsor the 
                    Gathering, there is a full list of available positions at 
                    the EverQuest Gathering Page. I hope that as many people as 
                    possible will be able to attend, since this will be a landmark 
                    event in EverQuest history!

              <div> Brad McQuaid has offered some miscellaneous comments throughout 
                the day, concerning problems that have and have been rumored to 
                be affecting EverQuest: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Accounts have not disappeared 
                  -- sometimes when UUnet burps, we have to reset our login server, 
                  and what happened for a few minutes was the login server came 
                  up prior to our account server. Everything should be fine now. 
                  <p> The chat server has been rebooted a few times today, but 
                    most of the time it's been up. That doesn't, however, mean 
                    that everyone was able to connect to it. The servers actually 
                    have been up all day. In fact, they've been up for days. All 
                    of these problems have nothing to do with the EverQuest servers, 
                    but rather our major ISP, UUnet. 
                  <p> I don't blame people for being upset -- I am very upset 
                    and disappointed myself. This has been a very painful and 
                    trying time for both us (Verant) and our customers. We are 
                    very sorry this has occurred and are working with UUnet to 
                    make sure it doesn't happen again. The fact that people who 
                    have dealt with us during beta and such know our track record, 
                    and how seriously we take problems and how hard we work to 
                    fix them are posting as such hardly makes them 'pirates'.

                  getting less PL, but it's still there. We are still in contact 
                  with them and of course want the situation to further improve. 
                  Right now people are getting into the game -- we are hoping 
                  this continues. 
                  <p> We appreciate everyone's patience during this frustrating

                  VP, Verant </font></blockquote>
                And from John Smedley: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Well... it's been another fun 
                  day. 
                  <p> Here's the scoop: 
                  <p> 1) UUnet - They have finally been able to completely isolate 
                    the problem after trying all kinds of different things - The 
                    problem is the connection between their San Diego Gateway 
                    router and their core ATM router in LA. They are doing 2 things 
                    to fix it - replacing some hardware AND moving a bunch of 
                    traffic off of it. The problems we have been seeing are due 
                    to the instability that exists on that line, which would sometimes 
                    cause massive people to get disconnected. Sometime tomorrow 
                    morning (no exact ETA yet) they are going to do this work. 
                    It SHOULD be non-disruptive, but I must admit to being somewhat 
                    skeptical of that, so please be prepared. 
                  <p> 2) Chat Server - NOONE HAS BEEN ERASED FROM THE DATABASE 
                    - The problem you are occasionally seeing is due basically 
                    to the amount of times it's seen 8000 people kicked out and 
                    logging back in at the same time.. it's just a bug and we 
                    have a good line on it, and I expect it will be gone tomorrow 
                    once the programmers have nailed it down. DO NOT WORRY if 
                    you see the message come up that you aren't subscribed. The 
                    chat server will come right back up in that event. The database 
                    is totally fine. 
                  <p> I really want to bring one point home with everyone - We 
                    are working nonstop on this. We won't rest until things are 
                    stable again. We never had these kinds of problems until this 
                    UUnet thing happened... but I suppose the fact that we just 
                    went live meant we were due ;( 
                  <p> We make no excuses - Those are the facts and we're sorry 
                    about the problems. All we can promise is we will work on 
                    them until they are totally fixed. 
                  <p> John Smedley

                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> It's 2:30am here in beautiful 
                  San Diego. We've been working with UUnet for the last 10 hours 
                  or so and it appears that things are fine again. There will 
                  be one more outage at 4:00am for a short time while they do 
                  one more hardware upgrade. 
                  <p> Folks... I wish I could say something other than sorry for 
                    the downtime. It's been difficult for us as well since we 
                    weren't in control of the situation, but tomorrow should be 
                    a good day!!

                  1999, UUNET will be performing the following activity. 
                  <p> We will be upgrading a router in the following city: San 
                    Diego, CA. This upgrade will result in additional backbone 
                    capacity in order to meet expected customer demands. The upgrade 
                    is scheduled to start at 3:00 a.m. local time at the affected 
                    site. 
                  <p> Unless otherwise indicated, the operational window is scheduled 
                    from 4:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. local time at the affected sites. 
                    If you have any questions, please contact our Customer Network 
                    Support Center at 1(800) 900-0241 or at 1(703) 206-5440 and 
                    press option #2 and then option #1 for more information

                Thanks Scott! In addition, here's some advice from David concerning 
                certain error messages that some players are receiving due to 
                a recent IP change on the part of Verant: 
                <blockquote> Some people are getting an error message when clicking 
                  on Play EverQuest button on certain servers. This problem is 
                  mostly due to the fact that their ISP's DNS servers haven't 
                  gotten the change in IP addresses. 
                  <p> If this is happening to you, try to ping eqworld-09.989studios.com 
                    and see if this address begins with a 63.x.x.x, if it doesn't 
                    and it begins with 208.x.x.x it means you don't have the DNS 
                    info propigated to you yet by your ISP.

                    to our other ISP), we know that a lot of you can't. We apologize 
                    for this and are doing everything we can on our end to expedite 
                    this situation. We know it is very frustrating for you, and 
                    trust me, it's very frustrating for us as well. 
                  <p> As players who were in the various beta tests can attest, 
                    this is not the norm for EverQuest. The game itself is fine, 
                    as our our servers. UUNet and our other ISPs have been great 
                    throughout the various beta tests, and it is simply some horrible 
                    luck that things went bad right after launch. 
                  <p> In any case, I am very confident that things will be sorted 
                    out soon. I appreciate very much everyone's patience during 
                    this trying time. 
                  <p> Thanks for hanging in there.

              <div> Here's another letter from John Smedley concerning UUNet and 
                packet loss: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Well... it's been a 5 Excedrin 
                  day... the UUnet problem is literally in the process of being 
                  cleaned up. In the next hour we hope everything should be good 
                  to go, but only time will tell. Sorry for all the problems, 
                  believe me we've been on the phone all day working with UUnet 
                  engineers to fix the problem they are having. We're on it!

                I also received the following from Ulryk, whose company deals 
                with UUNet: 
                <blockquote> I just wanted to report that I contacted my company's 
                  Network Manager and got our dedicated UUNET account #, and called 
                  thier engineering support line. 
                  <p> This is exactly what the Engineer said... 
                  <p> CONFIRM a major router outage in the Los Angeles HUB. We 
                    received a repair call at 6:10 PM ET, and Project 1 or 2 hours 
                    until repair. 
                  <p> Why they only received the repair call at 6:10 PM ET I don't 
                    know. But this was the same line we use to check our services 
                    latency/upgrade issues.

              <div> John Smedley just sent me this letter concerning the packet 
                loss afflicting EQ, DNS filtering and music: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Last night around 3am we put 
                  in some very robust new hardware. This has alleviated the packet 
                  loss that WE were experiencing in our network. The problem is 
                  that currently UUnet is having a bad problem up in LA (which 
                  is the route that a lot of you take). They have their top engineers 
                  working on fixing it ASAP. 
                  <p> You can clearly see this problem if you do a Traceroute 
                    to chat.everquest.com you will see where the problem is. 
                  <p> On another front, some people are getting an error message 
                    when clicking on Play EverQuest button on certain servers. 
                    This problem is mostly due to the fact that their ISP's DNS 
                    servers haven't gotten the change in IP addresses. 
                  <p> If this is happening to you, try to ping eqworld-09.989studios.com 
                    and see if this address begins with a 63.x.x.x, if it doesn't 
                    and it begins with 208.x.x.x it means you don't have the DNS 
                    info propigated to you yet by your ISP. 
                  <p> One last item: We plan on turning music on on all cards 
                    this upcoming Monday. We would appreciate if you could take 
                    the time to log into our test server. You do this by running 
                    TestEverQuest.exe (not testeqgame.exe). Go ahead and give 
                    this a try... those of you that don't have music should have 
                    it on this server. If this weekend goes well we will put the 
                    patch up on Monday.

                  have seen packet loss is continuing to be a problem for us this 
                  evening. We know what the problem is and are at the moment working 
                  on fixing it. It will probably mean some more downtime, but 
                  it should be quite minimal. 
                  <p> Those of you that are wondering what the problem is - It's 
                    a router problem and it's being worked on nonstop at the moment. 
                  <p> Rest assured we aren't sitting on our hands on this issue... 
                    we won't stop until it's totally fixed.

                the following information concerning recent game problems: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> 1- Our internal network problems 
                  -- we think is fixed -- we replaced some hardware and reconfigure 
                  somethings and it seems OK from our end (meaning no internal 
                  packet loss). We will see how that goes as we get more people. 
                  2- External UUnet problems -- UUnet is having their own problems 
                  with that same router that went down on tuesday. We are all 
                  over them to get this fixed. This is not likely explanation 
                  for PL.</font><div><font color=#a00000> 3- People who cannot 
                  enter game after clicking play. We are trying very hard to find 
                  out what's up with this -- it may be linked to the UUnet problem 
                  but might not be. We are doing our best to solve that.</font><div><font color=#a00000>

                <blockquote> I, too, have an overclocked Celeron chip that locked 
                  up constantly in EQ. I have a fix that completely solved it 
                  for me. 
                  <p> Disable the "Turbo" option in Bios. It seems the extra 3mhz 
                    of front side bus you get can cause some problems with certain 
                    video cards. Once I made this change, all my lockup problems

                takes a look at the final release of EQ and includes first impressions. 
                Here's a snippet: 
                <blockquote> Whether or not you have chosen to be a PvP character, 
                  the cooperative elements of the game truly make it shine. Initially, 
                  around your birthing center, it is possible to play alone and 
                  achieve character development, but after a while it is imperative 
                  to group with others whose skills and abilities complement yours. 
                  Cooperation is also important in the economic model, which, 
                  as in Ultima Online and others, encourages the manufacturing 
                  and selling or trading of items, weapons and armor. Armor tailoring 
                  is a hot skill in the area in which we are playing. Black wolves' 
                  pelts and skins are premium ingredients for beginner leather 
                  armor, and even though killing the wolves does not yield much 
                  experience, we see wolf-hunters scrambling all over one another 
                  to be the one to make the kill and grab the pelt. And while 
                  the Player-killer problem in other online RPGs has been pretty 
                  much solved by 989's "choice" approach, kill-stealing is still 
                  rampant (where a player jumps into a battle uninvited, makes 
                  the kill and takes the loot). There's not much they could have 
                  done about human nature, though. </blockquote>

              <div> Here's Assistant Head GM Dave Rickey with details concerning 
                the "Invalid Station ID" problem that some players are encountering: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> We're aware of this problem and 
                  *really* going nuts over it, because we can't nail down exactly 
                  what happened. It seems to have involved crossthreaded database 
                  functions while the Registration server was severely loaded, 
                  and affected around 130 people. We're making a list of all who 
                  were affected (and I know you're on it because I put you there 
                  on Tuesday) and we'll be manually repairing them in the next 
                  day (we hope). When we do, we'll be sending email or making 
                  phone calls to those affected, letting them know their accounts 
                  are usable now. 
                  <p> I'm going to be pushing for a resolution on this ASAP, but 
                    we are *extremely* heavily tasked right now, EQ has been selling 
                    even better than we dreamed (highest first-day sales of any 
                    PC game, *ever*). Even though we take this very seriously, 
                    finding the manpower to resolve it is proving difficult.

                is supposed to be open until Midnight seven days a week, is returning 
                a "closed" message: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Sorry about this problem... people

              <div> John Smedley sent me this important notice about an hour ago: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Hello All, 
                  <p> Last night we worked on the some hardware configuration 
                    issues around 2:00am. Unfortunately we still need to do a 
                    couple more things. We *could* wait until tomorrow morning 
                    at 2am again to make these changes, but that will mean people 
                    will get higher packet loss tonight, so we've decided that 
                    a short downtime early today (in the next 2 hours) will be 
                    the lesser of 2 evils. 
                  <p> Once we've completed this you should see the packet loss 
                    being DRAMATICALLY less. 
                  <p> We apologize for this inconvienence, but quite simply some 
                    issues have arisen that are unavoidable and need to be addressed. 
                  <p> The downtime itself will be very short (under an hour) BUT 
                    since we have to do a DNS change it may take a bit for your 
                    ISP to catch up.

                <blockquote> It appears that Australia is suffering the same fate 
                  as the UK was. The official distributer here does not currently 
                  have a release date and they had only JUST heard of the product 
                  after much badgering by fans. The folks I spoke to at the local 
                  EB store said it may take up to 6 months to be released out 
                  here ..... which is exactly what happened with UO. Electronic 
                  Arts didn't release UO here for retail until around six months 
                  after the official release, so is there any wonder it was not 
                  a huge retail success in OZ (.... all the die-hard fans got 
                  it mail order instead). To put the final nail in the coffin, 
                  the restrictive "parallel import" laws here, that means that 
                  no-one else apart from the official distributers is allowed 
                  to get a look-in. 
                  <p> Looks like Australia has been left out in the cold again 
                    ... retail-wise anyway. The only way to get it into the country 
                    is to mail order from the US (which if ordering individually, 
                    I estimate at around $90 to $120AUD including frieght).

          <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 02:07 AM PT ] - <a href="mailto:den@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Den</a></font> 
            <div> 
              <div> As many of you may have noticed, packet loss has been definite 
                problem for a number of players. Early Wednesday afternoon, packet 
                loss ranged from 10 to 15% for those experiencing the problems; 
                packet loss hit a high of nearly 50% later in the night. The same 
                problem that caused the recurring packet loss yesterday is related 
                to the servers' inaccessibility on Tuesday night. Here's a note 
                from Mike that serves to partially explain both this phenomenon 
                and the hour-long downtime that is taking place as I type this: 
                <blockquote> I was in chat and heard Brad McQuaid (Aradune) say 
                  something about a new switch going in at 2am pst tonight... 
                  he said there were too many packets, I don't know all the details, 
                  but it's supposed to fix the packet loss I believe. </blockquote>
                Also, some more exact details on the packet loss, as well as some 
                possible interim advice, from Andrew: 
                <blockquote> Again this evening, once peak hours hit, approx 9pm 
                  to midnight eastern, packet loss was averaging around 40%. The 
                  good news is that there was absolutely no problem with the server, 
                  just the link. 
                  <p> I can't and won't bemoan a new revolutionary game on the 
                    second day of opening, so let me skip to 2 tips on how to 
                    deal with this phenomenon. 
                  <p> 1) Plan your adventuring time in off peak hours, if possible. 
                    Most servers seem fine for 21 hours a day, use that time. 
                  <p> 2) Don't take extra chances. If you are going to 'push the 
                    limit' on what areas you can safely manage, have a friend 
                    or two along, so that at least one of you may be active when 
                    a critical moment comes. 
                </blockquote>

              <div> Here's John Smedley on some of the recent problems that have 
                been plaguing the patch server: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Ok... we found and fixed a problem 
                  with our patch servers (we actually have 6 different patch servers 
                  that are dynamically selected to do the patching). 2 of the 
                  machines we just put up had a configuration problem. We are 
                  fixing it and it should be done within 10 minutes of this posting. 
                  <p> Top 2 registration problems and what to do: 
                  <p> 1) Invalid Account Key - You MOST likely are mistaking an 
                    O (Oh) for a Zero.. try different combinations. If not, call 
                    our tech support at 1-888-Games02. You will need to read the 
                    key to us to insure you actually purchased the product, but 
                    we can help you at that number. 
                  <p> 2) Bad Station Name or Password after registering (when 
                    you log in for the first time) - 90% of the people that call 
                    in with this problem have forgotten their password or mistyped 
                    their station name. We can help you with this - just call 
                    our tech support at 1-888-Games02. 
                  <p> One other comment - If you are having ANY sort of trouble 
                    registering for EverQuest PLEASE call our tech support number 
                    at 1-888-Games02. We are here to serve you.

              <div> There is still no set date for EverQuest to begin shipping 
                from Verant to the UK, but we've found out some details concerning 
                a British release. First off, Acclaim will be distributing EQ 
                in Great Britain, not Sony. Also, remember that there a number 
                of mail order and online services, such as <a href="http://www.gamecave.com/default.asp?sku=131PCEVX09146&source=STRA" target="_eq">GameCave</a>, 
                that will ship the game to areas outside of the US and Canada. 
                <p> Finally, here is some information from Sony technical support 
                  concerning the possibility of British players being able to 
                  switch their characters from the US to UK servers after the 
                  Great Britain release: 
                <blockquote> It is likely that your U.S. Character can be moved 
                  to a U.K. server, however there will be no foreign servers immediately, 
                  they will be following the U.S. servers in the near future though. 
                  I can't make you any commitments sir, the higher ups are still 
                  debating it, but it looks to be in your favor. 
                  <p> Good luck,<div>

            <div> 
              <div> I'd like to inform everyone of a great German EverQuest site 
                called <a href="http://eq.mystics.de/">EverQuest Mystics</a>. 
                Everything there is in German, but anyone can see that the site 
                is very well thought out and intelligently designed. On a related 
                note, here's news of a player event primarily for the German community, 
                which is being sponsored by EQ Mystics: 
                <blockquote> After a 93% vote, the german everquest-community 
                  at <a href="http://eq.mystics.de">http://eq.mystics.de</a> has 
                  decided to give advice to all german-speaking everquest players 
                  to gather at Solusek Ro server to take part in a german roleplaying 
                  project named Mystics Roleplay. It has proven to be very hard 
                  for us to roleplay in a foreign language and we took this decision 
                  to make it possible even for people with less knowledge of englisch 
                  language to take part in roleplaying projects (or play everquest 
                  at all!). Of course we don’t want to separate ourselves from 
                  the other players and are looking forward to play together with 
                  all the great everquest players from around the world. Everyone 
                  is welcome to join our - in this case of course translated - 
                  quests and events on Solusek Ro. We hope everybody appreciates 
                  our decision and that our project will be as successful as the 
                  Norrath Roleplay Project. 
                  <p> Have fun in Norrath!

              <div> Here's information concerning last night's downtime, from 
                both Brad McQuaid and John Smedley: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> We apologize for the downtime 
                  earlier -- a major router for UUnet, one of our ISPs, died up 
                  in the LA area. Fortunately, our other ISPs picked up a lot 
                  of the slack, but still, many people couldn't log on for a bit. 
                  Such occurances are beyond our control, unfortunately, and are 
                  part of what can happen on the internet. And of course, Murphy's 
                  Law being what it is, it happened on launch day. 
                  <p> In any case, thanks for being patient :) 
                  <p> -Brad 
                  </font></blockquote>
                More details, from John Smedley: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> To those of you who got the message 
                  "can't connect to chat server" between 6:30 and 7:30 PST [last 
                  night] - The chat server WAS up during that period (we had plenty 
                  of people in) those of you getting that message were unfortunately 
                  not able to connect due to a router problem at UUNET. 
                  <p> I want to clear up the misconception regarding the chat 
                    server once and for all.. the chat server is merely a gateway 
                    point that we verify you do indeed have an account, so bypassing 
                    it isn't an option. The Chat server itself didn't go down 
                    today at all... with the exception of the one time late this 
                    evening we brought it down to put in some additonal code (and 
                    then it was down for less than a minute). 
                  <p> If you get the message : Can't connect to chat server, it 
                    isn't because the chat server is actually down (it will automatically 
                    restart itself in under a minute in the unlikely event it 
                    ever does go down).. it's actually because you can't physically 
                    connect to the chat server itself.. which in any event will 
                    mean you would be unable to connect to the game servers as 
                    well. 
                  <p> We do apologize for that bad period this evening, but as 
                    has already been explained, a router went down upstream from 
                    us on ONE of the ISP's we use (we use multiple ISP's for redundancy 
                    and lower latency). We don't expect that kind of thing to 
                    happen often (except that Murphy's Law dictates it should 
                    have happened on opening night). 
                  <p> We take downtime VERY, VERY seriously here. You are our 
                    valued customers and you payed for the right to play this 
                    game, so we need to make sure you can!!!

                    and Trolls roaming the Feerott and politely suggesting (via 
                    a lot of bashing, kicking, and slashing) that intruders and 
                    sightseers return to their lands, to leave Ogres and Trolls

                    Dark Elves to leave is left to the discretion of each etiquette 
                    group). 
                  <p> We will meet at the entrance to Oggok at 7PM. From there 
                    we will break into groups and find players that need some 
                    Ogre and Troll bashing lessons. We will communicate via /shout

                <blockquote> I was in the General Chat-room at midnight PST. In 
                  the room was Aradune 2 other GMs and about 5 Guides as well 
                  as about 20 other users. It seems Aradune's goal was to have 
                  15 thousand registered users of EverQuest before midnight PST. 
                  It was down to the wire. At just 15 minutes before midnight 
                  they were still 17 people short, and to prolong the suspense 
                  just over a person registered a minute on average. With very 
                  little time on the clock left, Aradune and EverQuest made their 
                  openning night goal, 15 thousand people had registered to play 
                  EverQuest! We're in Their World Now! </blockquote>
                Thanks!

              <div> This small piece of humor is kind of late, but, due to the 
                recent server downtime, should still be just as relevant: 
                <blockquote> One day while walking down a path Quellious the Tranquil 
                  saw a man crying along side the road. The goddess asked: My 
                  son, why do you cry? And the man replied: I am blind and can 
                  no longer find my way home. So Quellious touched the man and 
                  he could see. 
                  <p> A bit further down the path, the goddess ran into a woman 
                    sobbing, and Quellious asked: Why do you cry my daughter? 
                    And the woman said: I haven't eaten in several days and fear 
                    I don't have the energy to move on. So the goddess touched 
                    the woman and her belly was full. 
                  <p> Later in the day Quellious ran into another crying man along 
                    the path and asked once more: Why do you cry my son? And the 
                    man replied: EQ Beta is over, and the Commercial Version hasn't 
                    started yet. 
                  <p> And Quellious sat down and cried with him. 
                </blockquote>
                Thanks Jaella! Also, here's some EverQuest poetry from Chronmew 
                Ya'lid, Master Bard:

              <div> Looks like EverQuest won't be released in the United Kingdom 
                anytime soon. Here are the details, from Rasputin: 
                <blockquote> I spent nearly 2 days solid on the phone to Sony 
                  UK last week (I live in London) trying to find the release date 
                  for EQ in this country. I finally (on the 26th telephone number 
                  I tried) got an admission that EQ will not be released in this 
                  country. Something to do with an Import Ban. </blockquote>
                Online game stores should still ship EQ to folks in and around 
                Britain. For an example fo this type of service, click <a href="http://www.gamecave.com/default.asp?sku=131PCEVX09146&source=STRA" target="_eq">here</a>. 
                Expect the shipping process to take at least a week for international 
                orders, however.

            <div> 
              <div> The final release version of EQ is, as expected, remarkably 
                similar to the later Phase 4 clients, with a few adjustments here 
                and there. Some classes gain skills at different levels now (this 
                fact will be accounted for in our <a href="classes_ref.shtml">Class 
                Reference</a> section soon), but overall character balance remains 
                largely unchanged. A few new ambient sounds have made their way 
                into the game, and starting items have been tweaked. Instead of 
                a PK Note, you begin life with the "Tome of Order and Discord", 
                and starting food and drink seems to be either random or race-dependent. 
                <p> All interface screens are identical to those of Phase 4, and 
                  the only difference in start-up is the new intro movie which 
                  is, although of fairly poor overall quality, pretty darn impressive 
                  (and long, too). We'll keep you posted on any major immediate 
                  differences between late beta and final versions of the game.

                  'exclusive' cloth map. its the same exact map that the game 
                  comes with, only frankly, not as nice - its blurry, hard to 
                  read, a bad print job, really. More durable then the paper one

                the tutorial is presented when you first install the game.

              <div> Jhariden Khir’Sani sent me word of a new EverQuest site devoted 
                specifically to interaction via message boards: 
                <blockquote> The <a href="http://rpgforum.com/eq/">EverQuest Gamers 
                  Forum</a> is dedicating forums to each individual server. What 
                  this allows for players to do is interact directly with other 
                  players who are playing EQ on the same server as they themselves 
                  are. This in turn creates a sense of awareness and companionship 
                  among the players. We feel that this is very important because 
                  having twelve servers (more to come surely) causes a great deal 
                  of confusion amongst the players when discussions take place 
                  about current events in the land. This is what we’ve addressed 
                  with our site. 
                  <p> Our site has already created 51 forums and many more on 
                    the way. Each of the twelve EQ servers has four forums dedicated 
                    to them already and more will follow as the requests come 
                    in. I was hoping that we might be able to exchange links and 
                    blurbs in our news areas for our respective sites. Again, 
                    our site will not be doing any EQ News, EQ Guides, or what 
                    have you. We are focusing on Message Forums and Message Forums 
                    ONLY. Thus avoiding competition. The bottom line is the EQ 
                    community as a whole – it’s for them that I’ve put this site 
                    together.

                of EverQuest</a>. Here's an excerpt: 
                <blockquote> In EverQuest there are literally hundreds of different 
                  factions. Depending on the race and class that you start as 
                  your factions will be different. For example ogres and trolls 
                  will be killed on sight by most other races. Necromancers and 
                  rogues are often not killed by their own races(or the allies 
                  of their race) but they will often not be sold or dealt with. 
                  With hard work and a lot of patience you can raise your factions 
                  with any other group by killing their enemies or doing quests 
                  for them. Keep in mind however raising your faction with one 
                  group often entails lowering it with another. </blockquote>

                Damn, that's a bummer about server emulators. Stratics has been 
                a long time proponent of any entity or organization that attempts 
                to further the community aspect of online games, and server emulators 
                do just that. Similar to Quake mods, these emu's serve to increase 
                player involvement with a game they love; not tear away at the 
                profits of mega corporations like EA or Sony. I've been around 
                the MMORPG scene long enough to witness the birth of game server 
                emulators, and I have yet to witness someone canceling their account 
                due to one. If a player loves an online game, they'll continue 
                the service, whether or not they play on an emulated server in 
                addition to the official worlds. 
                <p> Thanks for the news, Chaos.

              <div> The guys over at PCFan have published their <a href="http://www.pcfan.com/pcfan/reviews/everquest.html">Review 
                of EverQuest</a> (the first known bonafied <i>re</i>view of EQ). 
                You know how you visit the site and it says "Home of the Phatty 
                Boom Batty Blunt Award!"? Well, <a href="http://www.everquest.com">EverQuest.com</a> 
                could legitimately say the same thing, since they won it! That's 
                right: a score of 101%. Whoops, hope I didn't spoil that for anyone. 
                :) Here's a snippet: 
                <blockquote> A year ago, to think that an online RPG housing thousands 
                  of people could be played without any lag would've been preposterous. 
                  Well, after much tweaking and testing, Verant Interactive has 
                  it down to a science. Lag is virtually non-existent in EverQuest 
                  and the only thing that can really cause it to slow down in 
                  the graphics engine is either too many players/characters on 
                  your screen, or someone casting a massive spell. </blockquote>
                You can find the entire review <a href="http://www.pcfan.com/pcfan/reviews/everquest.html">here</a>. 
                Thanks for the news, Jason!

            <div> 
              <div> Elder Guide Ozymandius sent me a detailed rundown of the current 
                status of the Guide program and applications that have been sent 
                in by prospective Guides: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> If you have applied to be a Guide 
                  in EverQuest, it is highly likely that you have not been responded 
                  to. To date, we have received over 3200 requests to be a Guide, 
                  and have barely processed 1/4 of them. We spend a great deal 
                  of time perusing them, making sure that we only get those we 
                  feel will best serve the customers. 
                  <p> As of 3/9/99, there was a "hiring freeze" to lock down the 
                    Guide Accounts until after release. We have been head-down 
                    grinding on making sure all is ready for release, and consequently 
                    no Application processing has taken place. When umpteen thousand 
                    folks stampede into EQ on Tuesday, we do not expect to have 
                    any more time available, so the hiring freeze will continue 
                    until at least 3/21/99. At that point, we will resume processing 
                    the Applications and bringing in folks to the Guide Program. 
                  <p> We need a *LOT* more Guides than we have currently. With 
                    12 servers, we are only able to provide approximately 25% 
                    coverage across the board, which means we'll have gaps in 
                    the off-hours. Given that EverQuest will be a HUGE success 
                    and they will double or triple the number of servers that 
                    are online (my own personal opinion, obviously), we will probably 
                    never stop accepting applications or bringing Guides online. 
                  <p> Please be patient with us, as processing the Applications 
                    is time consuming. We are being extra careful to be as sure 
                    as we possibly can not to bring in candidates that are unsuitable 
                    and could damage both EverQuest and the credibility of the 
                    Guide Program. I'm afraid we don't have the time to send out 
                    3200 "I'm sorry, but we've not gotten to your Application 
                    yet" notices a week, so most applicants are going to be in 
                    the dark. Please accept our apologies on this and know we 
                    are working as fast as we can. 
                  <p> I hope this clears things up.

                <blockquote> Yesterday, I sat atop a mountain just beyond Blackburrow 
                  Cave where the Gnolls that have been poaching Surefall Glade's 
                  bears reside. I sat crosslegged; my sense of direction told 
                  me I faced east. As I sat, my infrared vision, a gift from my 
                  elven mother, caught sight of a gray wolf. Behind it was a skeleton, 
                  no doubt straying from the cursed ruins to the north. Suddenly 
                  the skeleton attacked the gray wolf, and even from this distance, 
                  I could almost feel its cold touch. I tried to ignore the scene; 
                  I was there for a purpose. Dawn had arrived and Kalend Streamstar 
                  always began on this hilltop, watching the sun rise from the 
                  horizon. </blockquote>

                    has not been a release date set for EverQuest in Australia, 
                    but that it is likely to be more than a month away. After 
                    it is released, however, it should be widely available at 
                    computer shops and major retail outlets.

                  the arena during the fight, you will not be allowed back in. 
                  Entrance fee is no refundable. Resting is ok, as long as you

              <div> Elder Guide Ozymandius sent us a response in regards to the 
                speculation of 18 servers possibly being up by Midnight tonight 
                (see the news post "More on Game Release Schedule - Servers Up 
                Early?" below): 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> This is untrue. As per the official 
                  word from Verant, the 12 servers, plus Test, will be open to 
                  public access Tuesday at 9am PST. They will not be open at Midnight 
                  and there should not be 18 of them online. </font></blockquote>
                Thanks! Here's another letter concerning server speculation and 
                availablity in Florida, from Bryon: 
                <blockquote> A few things regarding EverQuest, avaliblity, and 
                  servers... 
                  <p> First, I called my local EB in central florida, and they 
                    indicated that they have not gotten EverQuest in, and that 
                    it will not be in until tomarrow. 
                  <p> Second, on servers, I too have been reading reports on the 
                    message boards of people claiming to be playing on the servers 
                    already, but I have since been able to prove all of these 
                    to be false... Although the actual world computers are up, 
                    the zone computers that allow people to play are all down. 
                    I've been monitoring the EverQuest computers throughout the 
                    day, and other than a very brief period in which Test Server 
                    zones were brought up for about 30 minutes, all zones have 
                    remained down. 
                  <p> Also, in regards to the rumors about 18 servers, I would 
                    argue this to be false as well. Up to now, Vertant has been 
                    using the same name structure for all of it's would servers... 
                    eqworld-##.989studios.com, where ## is a number from 01 to 
                    13... even before the 7 new worlds were brought online near 
                    the end of the beta testing, they had existing IP's assigned 
                    to them.... currently, their are no defined IP's for eqworld-14.989studios.com, 
                    or higher. 
                </blockquote>
                In addition, I've received a couple more e-mails concerning advance 
                copies of the game being purchased from Electronics Boutique--some 
                of which were not pre-ordered. If you have not yet reserved a 
                copy, it may be worth the effort to call your local EB and see 
                if they have any extra copies of EverQuest. 
                <p> Lastly but not leastly, Cirith T'orak of the <a href="http://www.crimsonrose.com">Crimson 
                  Rose</a> sent us details on the box's packaging and final version 
                  installation, as well as some info on possible early copies 
                  in the Pacific Northwest and Canada: 
                <blockquote> Just wanted to give you an update from the Pacific 
                  NW. Local Electronics Boutique here in Seattle called me about 
                  10:30 (work nights, woke me up actually) this morning, "Hi your 
                  copy of EQ is here, you can pick it up any time." We moved this 
                  weekend and I was really beat Sunday night so my first thought 
                  was that I'd managed to sleep right through Monday and it was 
                  Tuesday already, but a quick check of the watch showed otherwise. 
                  Sped down to the store before the guy on duty went to lunch 
                  or someone else who knew better showed and told him he wasn't 
                  supposed to be selling them today, slapped my pre-paid receipt 
                  on the counter, snatched the box out of his hands and ran out 
                  of the store laughing maniacally. Still not sure if they're 
                  supposed to be selling it today or not (have a guild mate in 
                  Canada who JUST informed me he found a store selling it today 
                  also, another guildy whos store told him not until tomorrow) 
                  and I didn't ask, but heres what comes in the box: 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Game CD - Orange colored, has the halfling, dwarf and 
                      ogre on it from the big main poster 
                    <li>World Map - 3 continents, about 18 inches x 18 inches, 
                      nice paper. Color is a little washed out though 
                    <li>User Agreement - Micro sized print, dont bother trying 
                      to read it 
                    <li>Small Keyboard Reference Sheet - About 5 or 6 inches x 
                      4 inches double sided 
                    <li>Registration Card - Self explanatory 
                    <li>Manual - Not impressed here. B&W pics, gives the basics 
                      on game play. No information on races, classes, gods, or 
                      spells (ouch for spells). They do however advertise the 
                      official Strategy Guide available for $14.95 though on the 
                      back page, I assume thats where the good stuff is it. Ala 
                      OSI? Bah. But its EverQuest, we love 'em, and all can be 
                      and is forgiven. 
                  </ul>
                  Installed (455M if you install the intro movie, 370 without) 
                  and hit the patch server. Spent about 15 minutes at 49.3k downloading 
                  and then ran the patched version. The intro movie isn't as high 
                  quality as we've come to expect, but since the CD already has 
                  520M crammed on it maybe a nicer one wouldn't fit. Is still 
                  VERY cool.. :) Can't connect to the chat server yet, but it 
                  may be worth the effort to give a call to the local puter store 
                  and see which way they're running their sales. </blockquote>
                Thanks!

              <div> Calmaben called Electronics Boutique after hearing from the 
                EQSS that they were receiving EverQuest early, and the manager 
                at his local store informed him that most of their Northern market 
                stores had indeed received EQ. This being that they have a major 
                warehouse in the Georgia/South Carolina/North Carolina region. 
                For the most part though, most people would not be able to pick 
                their pre-ordered copy up till 10:30 AM EST, March 16th. 
                <p> My second report must be considered a rumor (this I strongly 
                  emphasize). Paul informed me that, due to the high numbers of 
                  early copies being bought today, that the game servers--all 
                  <b>18</b> of them--may be opened earlier than expected, namely 
                  Midnight tonight. Apparently, Verant is receiving a lot of phone 
                  calls from the 1,000-odd players who have their copies of EverQuest 
                  installed and rearing to go and may be able to have the servers 
                  prepared for an earlier-than-expected March 16th release. Again, 
                  this is totally unverified, so cross your fingers.

                now. The EQSS is currently taking up over a T-1 and a half of 
                bandwidth and getting over a million hits per day, so our bandwidth 
                provider trimmed us down to 50% of a T-1. This has caused the 
                site to become extremely slow and message boards to experience 
                difficulties. I'm looking into the situation and hope to have 
                a solution soon. Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for visiting.

              <div> Simeron just informed me that <i>four</i> Evil gods actually 
                descended upon the EQSS-sponsored <a href="war">War of Ro</a> 
                PvP event on the Fennin Ro server. The Ogre god Ka'Tavir was in 
                attendance, as was Rallos Zek, Cazic-Thull and an as yet unidentified 
                deity. Here's more, from Simeron: 
                <blockquote> This just in, survivors of the Cazic and Rallos were 
                  not the only Evil Gods at the battle of Ro. No less then FOUR 
                  decended in an attempt to sway the battle. Here are pictures 
                  gleaned from the shattered survivors. It is truely a testament 
                  to the power of the Light that such an array of evil was overcome.

              <div> Brent sent us word that the final battle between Mithaniel 
                Marr and Innoruuk ended quite differently on the alternate plane 
                of existence known as The Rathe: 
                <blockquote> On The Rathe server, the battle between Mithaniel 
                  and Innoruuk ended in a draw, with both of them dying. A great 
                  host of humans met an opposing force of Dark Elves, Ogres, and 
                  Trolls at the Nektulos bridge. With the help of his evil allies, 
                  Innoruuk slew Mithaniel first. Unfortunately, the Halfling God 
                  Fizzlethorpe, after slaying his own allies, killed Innoruuk, 
                  who was still weak from battle. I have included screenshots 
                  of the two dead Gods, and the living Fizzlethorpe, along with 
                  a picture of the Fiery Avenger that Mithaniel carried. When 
                  the battle was over, there were no paladins to take his weapon, 
                  and the rest of us could not move it, although we tried many 
                  times. A weapon that does 35 damage... </blockquote>

              <div> Whisker sent us a detailed report and screenshots of the Apocalypse 
                Brew Fest that took place on the final day of Phase 4: 
                <blockquote> Well Friday night was certainly a memorable night! 
                  We had wars, skirmishes, duels galore, celebrations; an all 
                  out good time! The event which I put together, the Apocalypse 
                  Brewfest, had a great turnout, and I would like to thank everyone 
                  who came! 
                  <p> Things were a little unorganized throughout the night, but 
                    I believe everyone managed to party, and I don't think one 
                    person left sober or lived through the night ;). We started 
                    the gathering at the Priest of Discord lift in Kelethin, were 
                    I handed out all of the booze I had bought on my travels in 
                    scant minutes. 25 plat worth of special brews, all gone within 
                    minutes! Among the average fair of mead and short ale and 
                    beer, we had some special Gypsy Wine, some Kiss of Death Ale, 
                    some nice stout Dwarven Ale, and some of Crow's Special Brew. 
                    Someone even had a limited amount of some Ogre swill! (though 
                    I forgot what it was called). Everyone did their job well 
                    though, as everyone who showed up had simply TONS of brew, 
                    there was not a shortage for the rest of the night. 
                  <p> We commenced by killing a guard or two, at which time everyone 
                    took it upon themselves to duel, duel, duel! We had some EXCELLENT 
                    duels, everyone acted honorably and a light heart was kept 
                    the entire time, thank you all! 
                  <p> As I said before, things were a little more unorganized 
                    than I had hoped, and we did not get to raid Crushbone as 
                    planned. The 'Suicide Waterfall' I had planned actually happened 
                    several times hehe. The best leap we had consisted of over 
                    fifteen people, all with spells flying, but the two screenshots 
                    I took turned out pure black!!!!!! I hope someone took some 
                    pix of the event. I did get some pix of the aftermath =) 
                  <p> The night ended with more duels, and once again I would 
                    like to thank everyone who showed up, your participation is 
                    most appreciated. My thanks also to all the websites that 
                    posted news of the event, without you guys I couldn't have 
                    pulled it off. To everyone: Fare ye well, may your path lead 
                    you to Final, good luck and thanks for all the fish...errr, 
                    memories!! 
                  <p> PS. The quote of the night goes to Lionhart: "PLease smop 
                    maKinl the tTees move - pH MY HEAD!"

            <div> 
              <div> Here's with L’vanon with a behind-the-scenes narrative, along 
                with screenshots, describing the Day of Darkness event, which 
                resulted in the Battle of Nektolus: 
                <blockquote> DAY OF DARKENING - EPILOGUE 
                  <p> You might notice, that unlike my other announcements, this 
                    one is entirely OOC. Only appropriate, since the world has 
                    come to an end and L’vanon has gone to be with his Father 
                    Innoruuk (a fate not nearly as appealing to most of us as 
                    it was to him). 
                  <p> The night started in an unexpectedly wonderful way, with 
                    Innoruuk himself descending to Neriak to lead us against the 
                    gods Bristlebane and Mithaniel Marr with their minions (turning 
                    us all PvP+ in the process). Our planned march on Felwithe 
                    had a great impact on the fate of this battle, since the Dark 
                    Army was already starting to gather, and many of the forces 
                    of good were gathering in the Faydark. The result was that 
                    a daydwelling force of under twenty met an army already nearing 
                    one hundred Teir’Dal, Trolls, Ogres, Humans, and even a Gnome. 
                    It was rather a slaughter. Our morale strengthened by the 
                    death of two enemy gods, we set out for Faydwere. 
                  <p> The passing of such an unholy army over the surface of Norrath 
                    must have had ill effects on the nature of the world. Unfortunately, 
                    those effects did nothing to speed our progress, since we 
                    crashed the whole East Commons zone three times. 
                  <p> The humans that intended to waylay us outside of Freeport 
                    had all been either misled by one of my spies, spreading false 
                    information, or had been killed in the earlier battle, and 
                    we made it into the tunnels and to the docks with ease. There 
                    was a sizable force of humans and their allies at the docks 
                    and although they were too cowardly to attack en-masse, almost 
                    constant skirmishes raged up and down the pier as we waited 
                    for the boat. 
                  <p> This is where the real trouble began. 
                  <p> Only one in ten of us made it on the boat, the others, including 
                    myself, found themselves plunging unexpectedly into the sea. 
                    We did not have to lament missing the boat for long, however, 
                    since all of our kindred who DID make it onto the ship were 
                    unceremoniously dumped into the water when it tried to zone. 
                    Confused by this, we regrouped on the pier and decided to 
                    wait for the next boat and try again. Meanwhile, the hit and 
                    run battles with the humans continued, and the water below 
                    the docks was choked with bodies. Quite a gruesome sight met 
                    anyone diving to the bottom. 
                  <p> When the next boat finally did arrive, most of our army 
                    was once again plunged into the water instead of being allowed 
                    on board. There seemed to be some sort of height problem with 
                    the boat, and I only made it on this time myself by stepping 
                    on the head of a tolerant Troll, and leaping for the deck. 
                    When the boat zoned I was disconnected. Fearing the worst, 
                    I got back into the game, and found myself on the boat in 
                    the Ocean of Tears, with less than a dozen troops. Those that 
                    did make it on board, however, were some of the finest of 
                    the lot, including Exmortis the Troll, Utaeldain, Failkin, 
                    and Eclavdra of the Teir’Dal, and Wikkee the lone Gnome (apologies 
                    to all that I did not mention). Vowing to wreck havoc in foreign 
                    lands no matter what our numbers, we waited. 
                  <p> The zone came, and with it a message. Something like: "Zone 
                    repopulation imminent." A moment later, the boat was gone 
                    and we were all standing on a small island in the middle of 
                    the ocean. "Great, if I’m going to be stranded on an island 
                    at the end of the world, there should at least be women." 
                    said someone. He shouldn’t have spoken, for about that time, 
                    the Erolli Priestesses descended on us and sent most of us 
                    back to the Motherland. L’vanon died a happy man, though. 
                    Having met his god face to face and witnessed the destruction 
                    of the world. What more could a Dark Elf want? 
                  <p> I would like to extend my sincerest personal regrets to 
                    all those good folk who waited patiently (or not so patiently) 
                    in Faydark, eager to send us back to the dark hole we crawled 
                    out of. Our army numbered well over one hundred at its height, 
                    and it would have been quite a battle. Unfortunately, the 
                    world did not seem capable of handling it. I am still very 
                    impressed by the overall stability of this game, but I am 
                    sorry it chose this night to be flaky. 
                  <p> I would also like to apologize to any of my own kindred 
                    that I may have accidentally ignored. My screen was an almost 
                    constant flood of /tells all night, and especially in the 
                    heat of battle, I was not as talkative as I would have liked. 
                  <p> I hope that Crushbone and his kin gave you daydwellers enough 
                    to do in your last hours on the world, and perhaps the forces 
                    of Innoruuk will rise once again in the future. Maybe this 
                    time we will pick a target that doesn’t require boats….like 
                    Rivervale. HAHAHA!

              <div> Eogan offers further insight into the events surrounding the 
                Battle of Nektolus: 
                <blockquote> To all the Good Guys! 
                  <p> We were all decieved by the cunning Evil Ones on the night 
                    of the Battle of Gods, between Mithaniel Marr and Innoruuk! 
                  <p> In a ploy to devert our forces from the main battle, the 
                    Evil Ones called for an attack on the beautiful Elven city 
                    of Felwithe. Many of our strongest and bravest headed for 
                    Greater Faydark on this night, myself inlcuded, to turn the 
                    tides of evil back. Our forces in Greater Faydark numbered 
                    around 200 strong, and we had another 150 people awaiting 
                    the Evil Ones in the Butcherblock mountain. Many others were 
                    scattered in the surrounding areas of Crushbone, Lesser Faydark, 
                    and in the grand city of Felwithe itself. 
                  <p> The Evil Ones knew that had they come to to Greater Faydark, 
                    they surely would have been destroyed by the forces of Good! 
                    But they instead attacked a smaller group on Antonica, and 
                    defeated them and Mithaniel Marr too. 
                  <p> We should have expected this type of treachery from the 
                    minions of Innoruuk, yet we believed their claims! On top 
                    of that, the forces of Good on the main continent, in either 
                    foolishness or too much pride, believed that their smaller 
                    force could defeat the Evil Ones. Had they contacted the huge 
                    forces in Greater Faydark, the forces of Good would have preveiled! 
                    But our forces were splintered, and even amoungst the contigent 
                    in Faydark, many battles broke out between our own forces! 
                    We were no better then the Evil Ones on this night, as many, 
                    in their restlessness, slaughtered one another! 
                  <p> The forces of Good should be ashamed of our failure on the 
                    night of the Battle of the Gods! Light will still prevail, 
                    in the next world!

              <div> Even more carnage took place in Norrath last night, when the 
                three Orcish demigods, Urkk, Slashh and Viile emerged from Crushbone 
                with the intent to kill. These gigantic brutes mauled adventurers 
                with divine passion until slain by the resilient heroes who arrived 
                to thwart the planar menace. Here are three screenshots from the

              <div> Kraddigg, god of the Gnolls and all around huge menace (both 
                figuratively and literally), led an assault on both Halas, city 
                of the Barabarians, as well as the seaside human city of Qeynos. 
                The brunt of the assault was focused on the territory of the Northmen, 
                as is described by Bodeccia, who was witness to the resultant 
                carnage. 
                <blockquote> Tonight the Lord of the Gnolls descended on the proud 
                  city of Halas. With great bravery and in defense of their homeland 
                  the warriors and shamen of Halas gathered to send the fiend 
                  back into the depths of Hell. 
                  <p> The master of all Gnolls was a behemoth that stood fully 
                    30 feet high. A small group of journeymen took the first assault 
                    but quickly fell, leaving the survivors to bear word of the 
                    attack and gather aid. Soon afterwards, around ten of the 
                    bravest warriors and shamen threw themselves into the defense 
                    of their homeland. Courage, honor and Light carried the day 
                    and the foul creature was dispatched to the Abyss. 
                  <p> Long may their names be honored. 
                  <p> Bodeccia, Shaman of the people 
                </blockquote>
                Another tale of the assault, from Nosferum: 
                <blockquote><font color=#3F5B20> 
                  <p>Nosferum decided to forego his home with the Ashen Order 
                    in Freeport to defend Halas. About three hours before the 
                    final Sundering four Gnolls pledged an attack on Halas. They 
                    called out from the northern mouth of Blackborrow with slander 
                    and vex. "BARK! BARK! All Halas will die tonight!" 
                  <p>The Clan MacLear had all decided to stay to defend their 
                    home. Ready at the battlefield that night: thirty Barbarians, 
                    two Gnomes an Erudite, a High Elf, two Half Elves and a Monk. 
                    The air was chill as Nos scouted ahead to Blackborrow... ebbing 
                    his way to the maw of the Gnolls. 
                  <p>"There... At the Three Igloos. A Gnoll named Kraddig, as 
                    big as a house!" 
                  <p>Apparently, those big ears on the beast work well, because 
                    he charged me. Fleet of foot and light of load I turned on 
                    my heel and sprinted back to Halas. Kraddig stopped short 
                    and returned ot the Three Igloos. It seems that he and the 
                    three other named Gnolls were to make camp at those igloos. 
                    The Clan MacLear and other Halasians swelled at the valley 
                    to the Three Igloos, warrily eyeing the invaders. Chief Tormod 
                    recognized the larger of the four as the Gnoll who had slain 
                    Feldor Stoutheart and his family of seven so many winters 
                    ago. Tormod's blood boiled within him, as out came a cry that 
                    rumbled the Underfoot. "Cleanse the frozen earth with their 
                    blood, bretheren! Cleve them!" Ahead of us all charged Tormod, 
                    with total abandon. Behind him, Daran, Ikar, Onain, and a 
                    fleet of twenty others. Soon came tens of passers-by, casting 
                    in their volleys and sacrificing their lives for the hearth 
                    of the Everfrost Peaks. My blows to the invaders fell with 
                    impunity as, most often, I missed. It was then that I realize 
                    Quellious was teaching me something, even as I stood. Alone, 
                    we are nothing. When allied, we are everything. 
                  <p>Onain fell soon, as did ten others. Their offensive barrage 
                    lead to their own demise as the attackers focused on the most 
                    powerful. Tormod's life came into question on occasion as 
                    the Clan's healers revived him to ensure he finished his job. 
                    Tormod stepped back and let Daran absorb the blows to allow 
                    our healers to to their bidding. It was then that Kraddig's 
                    eye turned from the fray... to Tormod in the distance. "YOU!" 
                    "Tormod, of the MacLears! You are alive?!" "I killed you! 
                    I watched your heart seep on the tundra ten winters ago. You 
                    and your wife and children... all eight of you!" 
                  <p>Moments passed as Tormod realized his folly. His eyes welled 
                    up and his back wretched to let out a great, silent cry. While 
                    none could hear him, I could see the word from his lips: "Noooooooo." 
                    Kraddig had come to Everfrost to rip Tormod from his clan 
                    so many years ago, but mistook Feldor for Tormod in that night. 
                    The MacLears had been killing Kraddig's sisters and cousins 
                    for decades, as Kraddig was a mere pup. As Kraddig grew beyond 
                    measure, it was clear that the great Gnoll intended to exact 
                    vengeance for his brood. One frozen night, in the tundra so 
                    many years ago, Kraddig crept from his grand lair to snuff 
                    the MacLear's chief and his heirs in their sleep. Tormod had 
                    asked Feldor Stoutheart of the Halas Guards to stand watch 
                    that night with his family in Tormod's stead as Tormod had 
                    a meeting with the High Council to attend. In Barbarian tradition, 
                    the night's guard to the Whooly Mammoth area would sentry 
                    with his wife and children nearby as they slept. It was their 
                    way. The frozen wastes took yet another family as Kraddig 
                    had snuck in the night and ate the hearts of the Night Watchman 
                    and his heirs. Kraddig had thought his home saved, since he 
                    beleived he had just slain the Chief of the greatest family 
                    in all of Halas... the MacLears. In truth, he had just slain 
                    a simple watchman with his devoted family. 
                  <p>Tormod had always know Kraddig as the murderer of his great 
                    friend, but he had never known WHY. With this Tormod lept 
                    forth, at half health, bearing only an iron sword in his hand 
                    and the spirits of eight Clansmen in his guff. Tormod's blade 
                    sang true as he sliced and severed poor Kraddig. The tide 
                    of the eve was clear as the Elders of the Clan, including 
                    Daran the Gnome cleft Kraddig's heart from his still-warm 
                    chest. The great Gnoll hero had fallen. Two of the other named 
                    Gnolls had already fallen and the last of the four-- in total-- 
                    was not far behind them. The Clan had, again, sent a great 
                    enemy to The Underfoot. 
                  <p>It was then that Halas raised a mug of ale in honor of all 
                    those who had died that evening. Many, many of whom were NOT 
                    MacLear, but had plead their lives for the greater of Halas. 
                    Tormod, stepped aside from the cheers and spoke quietly to 
                    himslef. While I cannot begin to suppose the man, I can only 
                    think he was askin the forgiveness of the man, Feldor, whom 
                    Tormod had just avenged. 
                  <p>Bards will sing, and Shamans will chant of this night... 
                    the night Clan MacLear took back eight souls to rest in Halas 
                    again. I still walk alone, though. No family to sing of, no 
                    home to recall. Alone I tred softly as I pray to my Lord, 
                    "May Quellious be with you, MacLears."

              <div> Verant Interactive sent us the following letter concerning 
                the final release of EverQuest. Included within this important 
                announcement is, along with the schedule for all aspects of release, 
                a list of answers to common questions that people may have regarding 
                beta, servers and billing. 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Greetings Citizens of Norrath 
                  <p> The time is finally upon us. The lands will be open at 9:00am 
                    PST on Tuesday March 16th. 
                  <p> During the first week, you can expect a very short downtime 
                    (less than an hour) during off-peak hours for network maintainence. 
                    We will be posting scheduled downtimes on our website (<a href="http://www.everquest.com">http://www.everquest.com</a>) 
                    beginning sometime on Monday March 15th. You will also be 
                    informed ahead of time on this site regarding any patches 
                    that will be upcoming. We anticipate heavily using the Test 
                    Server to do our testing and moving those patches to the Live 
                    Servers only after we feel the new version has been throurghly 
                    tested. The Test Server is used completely for testing purposes. 
                    This means the server AND different zones on the server will 
                    come up and down at our discretion. There will be no GM or 
                    Guide support on the test server. 
                  <p> In addition, sometime on March 15th, you will find that 
                    the website has changed and a much more robust Technical Support 
                    section will be added to address various issues. Please check 
                    this site out before you log in if possible so that you have 
                    the most up to date drivers for all of your hardware. If you 
                    need any assistance, don't hesitate to give us a call... you 
                    will find all of our tech support contact information on our 
                    website as well. We are here to serve you as our valued customers. 
                    Again, the best thing you can do is to check out our website 
                    and check to make sure your drivers are current. 
                  <p> Many people have asked what they should do with their Beta 
                    versions of EverQuest. You should delete this prior to installing 
                    EverQuest. There will be some older files there that you don't 
                    want. 
                  <p> Here's a couple of other bits of information in no particular 
                    order: 
                  <ul>
                    <li> Beta Testers - When you register, you can use your existing 
                      Station Account for registration purposes. 
                    <li> Pwipe? - Yes, there has been a pwipe. 
                    <li> Patching for release - When you log in, there will be 
                      a patch. It isn't very large. 
                    <li> Billing - I would urge anyone who has any questions to 
                      check out the Billing FAQ on the website (sometime March 
                      15th). 
                    <li> Are Credit Cards Needed for the game? - Currently Yes 
                      (Visa, Mastercard or American Express)- Debit Cards will 
                      work as well. Are we going to have more options? We are 
                      working on it and looking into different possibilities. 
                      Clearly it's in our best interests to make the game available 
                      to as many people as possible, so rest assured this is important 
                      to us. 
                    <li> Is Billing Secure? - We use SSL just like websites that 
                      do credit card transactions. We also dropped the requirement 
                      for Mother's Maiden Name (although people didn't realize 
                      all this really was was a "keyword" to help identify the 
                      person). 
                  </ul>
                  We are excited beyond belief at the support that EverQuest has 
                  recieved, and we intend to deliver the best gaming experience 
                  anyone has recieved. 
                  <p> We'll see you in Norrath!!! 
                  <p> The EverQuest Team

              <div> The EQSS-sponsored War of Ro PvP event on Fennin Ro was a 
                huge success! Even the gods decided to take part in the conflict; 
                both Rallos Zek and Cazic-Thule appeared in the form of avatars. 
                Here's the lowdown on the two divine players in the War of Ro: 
                <blockquote> <b>Cazic-Thule: The Faceless</b> <div> Followers 
                  of Cazic-Thule fear their Lord and believe that only by causing 
                  terror in others will they be spared his vengeful wrath. They 
                  strive to beat down and suppress all hope. Fear rules their 
                  lives and through fear they rule the lives of others. Pain, 
                  misery, violence, torture, living sacrifice; these are the tools 
                  of a Cazicite. Many Lizardman tribes are devout followers of 
                  Cazic-Thule, but his number of humanoid followers grows daily, 
                  a cold shadow slowly engulfing the bright spots of Norrath in 
                  a nightmare of horror and pain. 
                  <p> <b>Rallos Zek: The Warlord</b> <div>
                  The followers of Rallos Zek believe in survival of the strong 
                  and death to the weak. In the heat of battle is the only place 
                  where enlightenment can be gained. The universe was formed by 
                  conflict and in conflict it will end. The victors feasting upon 
                  the remains of their fallen enemy. No respect or regard is given 
                  to the dead, for if they were worthy their hearts would still 
                  pump blood through their veins and not upon the soil of Norrath. 
                  Followers of Zek are almost exclusively warriors. </blockquote>
                Now for a report on the War of Ro from Simeron, record-keeper 
                of this event: 
                <blockquote> The final battle was simply tremendous. 258 players 
                  were in the battle in the desert, another 114 players were defending 
                  Freeport and then joined in to fight as the gods of Norrath 
                  descended on us. Rallos Zek appeared as an Ogre, Cazic as a 
                  Troll. While the battle was bloody and the casualties high, 
                  the forces of Light overcame the forces of Darkness and Chaos 
                  was overtaken by Order. </blockquote>
                Expect more from Simeron soon, in the form of additional chapters 
                to the <a href="war">War of Ro</a> story. Some screenshots from

              <div> Drakkar-Noir sent us the following announcement: 
                <blockquote> For those of you who do not know what the EverQuest 
                  Gathering is, it is a player run event to help new a old players 
                  in the world of Norrath. It will be held on Saturday, March 
                  27th at 8:00pm ET (5:00pm PST), either in or just outside of 
                  the city of Freeport, on Fennin Ro. The event is currently in 
                  it's early stages of planning and I need as much feedback as 
                  possible to help in the organizing of the it. The EverQuest 
                  Gathering will have entertainment, contests, introductory and 
                  explanatory discussions and also questing. As of yet, we are 
                  still looking for more volunteers for the event. One of the 
                  positions we are in dire need of is guides/escorts from other 
                  cities of Norrath to Freeport. We will also need entertainers, 
                  such as musicians and possibly actors. A description of those 
                  and other positions available can be found at the Gathering 
                  Web Page. I have recently received a few e-mails requesting 
                  that the event be held outside of Freeport so as to accomodate 
                  "evil" race characters. Depending on the feedback that I receive 
                  on this issue, I will decide on whether to have the event in 
                  or outside of Freeport. All other pertinent information as well 
                  as a Gathering News page and map of routes to the arena can

              <div> Perhaps the grandest event of the final night of Beta was 
                the conflict between the human followers of Mithaniel Marr and 
                the dark elves of Innoruuk, with the added uncertainty resulting 
                from the participation of the wily halfling god Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane 
                thrown in for good measure. The towering gods walked among mortals 
                that evening... Here are descriptions of each of the titans and 
                their followers: 
                <blockquote> <b>Innoruuk</b> <div> Followers of Innoruuk, The 
                  Prince of Hate, include nearly the entire Dark Elven race who 
                  regard him as their "Father." They believe that Hate is a creative 
                  force, or rather "THE" creative force in the universe. Creativity 
                  born of destruction. Love and kindness are tools for those too 
                  ignorant to know what they want or too cowardly to do what is 
                  necessary to obtain it. It is only through the total disdain 
                  of your enemies that you can gain true power over them. Pity 
                  and mercy have no power when confronted with contempt and viciousness. 
                  It is the honest belief of the followers of Innoruuk that if 
                  they were to hate strong enough they could destroy all of Norrath. 
                  <p> <b>Mithaniel Marr</b> <div>
                  The Followers of Mithaniel Marr believe that valor is what separates 
                  civilized beings from beasts. His followers live by a strict 
                  moral code that prizes truth, honor, and charity. They are champions 
                  of the downtrodden and the most noble of warriors. His followers 
                  strive to rid Norrath of all things dark and evil, often sacrificing 
                  themselves in this never ending quest. They will not rest until 
                  the day when all of Norrath is cleansed in Mithaniel's light. 
                  They take themselves and their duty very seriously, and have 
                  little patience for mischief or mayhem. Many paladins are devout 
                  servants of Mithaniel Marr. 
                  <p> <b>Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane</b> <div>
                  Followers of Bristlebane believe in having fun, at the expense 
                  of nearly all else. Bards, rogues, jesters, gamblers and gypsies 
                  are all typical followers. They are almost always very charming, 
                  clever, and witty, traits which all Bristlebane followers should 
                  strive to have. Mischief in all its forms is encouraged. Practical 
                  jokes are performed as if they are the highest of rituals. Very 
                  few of Bristlebane's followers are outright wicked in their 
                  desires but it is best to keep at least one eye on your purse 
                  if they are about. And never let one deal you a hand of King's 
                  Court. </blockquote>
                And now for a recounting of the Battle of Nektolus, as told by 
                the Sage Das'Cormyn, Scribe of the Order Tribunal: 
                <blockquote> In the ultimate battle between good and evil, the 
                  silver figure of the god Mithaniel Marr led his Human followers 
                  out of Freeport to attack the Dark Elven god Innoruuk at the 
                  Tier'dal city of Neriak. The gods clashed first near the bridge 
                  of Nektolus Forest. There another god took shape--Fizzlethorpe 
                  Bristlebane of the Halfling race, taking Huppane as his avatar. 
                  The towering Thief was met with cheers from the side of Light, 
                  but those cries soon turned to screams of agony as the god turned 
                  on what were thought to be his Human allies. 
                  <p> The mutated form of Innoruuk convulsed with twisted laughter 
                    as his minions, his gigantic summoned skeleton and Fizzlethorpe 
                    thrust back at Mithaniel's invaders. The battle soon spilled 
                    over to the gates of the city Innoruuk itself, where the evil 
                    Trolls and Ogres joined in on the slaughter. For nearly an 
                    hour the conflict raged, but the hopes of the Army of Light 
                    crumbled as their god became more and more weakened, diminishing 
                    in both size and power. Soon, all but a handful of warriors 
                    stood to face the slain form of their god and the swollen 
                    Darkness before them. 
                  <p> Fizzlethorpe, seeing that the Balance had become upset, 
                    turned on the Prince of Hate and tried in vain to shift the 
                    battle back into the favor of the fallen Mithaniel. In the 
                    end, however, Innoruuk and his followers stood victorious, 
                    but the scale of the battle left the world asunder. Chaos 
                    reigned the lands of Norrath that night, and the Dark Ones 
                    found their triumph short-lived. 
                </blockquote>
                Here are a number of screenshots from the Battle, which involved 
                nearly 100 players, presented in chronological order:

              <div> Matt Yaney, of Verant Interactive, sent us the following letter

                  </font><div><font color=#a00000> As a parting gift to our beta 
                  testers, a massive Finale of dynamic quests were held on all 
                  EverQuest Beta servers. These dynamic quests previewed the style 
                  of world spanning interaction that will be frequently held in 
                  the released version of EverQuest. 
                  <p> A majority of these dynamic quests involved the return of 
                    the Evil Gods to Norrath. 
                  <p> At midnight, a final confrontation occurred on the plains 
                    of Karana. Aradune (Producer, Brad McQuaid) led the Forces 
                    of Karana against the Bandits of Donovan in an epic battle 
                    which lasted over two real hours and involved over 300 players. 
                  <p> In the end the Forces of Karana were victorious, inspired 
                    by the heroic death of their leader Aradune. 
                  <p> We greatly look forward to seeing all of you in EverQuest!

                Along with the letter came 33 screenshots of the Battle of Karana,

                  destiny stepped in and the opposing side could not come to face

                  to play EQ . Thank you all for your e-mails and help . Maybe 
                  it will come to pass in the final that a great battle shall 
                  be fought and we will all stand together again.

                    opened its doors to the public! Our main focus is to provide 
                    the EverQuest community with a one-stop site for all your 
                    travel needs. I'm going to be writing up zone analyses on 
                    every zone I visit as fast as I can. These guides will contain 
                    a number of things, including (but not limited to :-)) discussions 
                    of locales of interest, zone-specific hunting strategies, 
                    comprehensive NPC charts, and lots of screenshots to boot! 
                    I'm hoping theses guides will prepare people for when they 
                    enter a zone for the first time, so they have an idea of what 
                    to expect.</p>
                  <p>I'm also in need of another staff member to help with the 
                    site. This should be a primarily graphics-oriented person 
                    who would help create maps of the different zones. They could 
                    also perhaps help add some more zest to the site itself. If 
                    you're interested in this position, please email me at <a href="mailto:jeff9@earthlink.net">jeff9@earthlink.net</a> 
                    for further details.</p>
                  <p>Well, I hope to see some of you at the site, enjoy!</p>

              <div> Jythri sent us details of a new organization devoted specifically 
                to Bards: 
                <blockquote> Hail all! 
                  <p> I, Jythri, Bard and Wanderer, have hereby established an 
                    organization known as The Soerbaird. We are now inviting bards 
                    to join our ranks by applying to our Academy. 
                  <p> Our main goal is to establish a group of organized bards 
                    whose purpose will be chronicling the peoples and history 
                    of Norrath through the writing of ballads, the recording of 
                    history, and the telling of stories. We will expect quality 
                    work from our members, and will develop and maintain a strict 
                    code of conduct for bards. 
                  <p> Along with writing and performing, we will offer a variety 
                    of services to Norrath, including: a service as heralds and 
                    runners, the coordination of events and festivals, the mediation 
                    of disputes, and commissions to compose ballads and odes. 
                  <p> We believe the bard, the TRUE bard, above all others has 
                    the ability to invoke the culture and the history of Norrath 
                    and its legends like no other group. 
                  <p> If you consider yourself a bard, and are writing ballads, 
                    stories, or history of the land of Norrath, please visit the 
                    Annals of The Soerbaird at <a href="http://www.incabrain.com/soerbaird/">http://www.incabrain.com/soerbaird/</a> 
                    and apply to our Academy.(OOC Note: Our site looks best with 
                    IE4 for now. You can view it with Netscape, but some of the 
                    parts will look a little different than intended.) 
                  <p> Initially, we will be located on the Fennin Ro server. 
                  <p> We are the Wind of Faydark;<div>
                  We are the Breath of Antonica;<div> We are the Song of Norrath.<div> 
                  We are The Soerbaird 
                  <p> Listen and Live!

                Brew Fest taking place tonight: 
                <blockquote> Just letting you know that the brew fest will commence 
                  at 11PM PST tonight in Kelethin. I spent over 10 plat on various 
                  brews from every city except Grobb and Oggok (my enchanter is 
                  not yet able to disguise himself as trolls or ogres ;). I even 
                  gave my life to purchase the sweet Gypsy wine from a camp in 
                  the Karanas, my game of hide and seek with four griffons a losing 
                  one. But I did recover everything and made my way through Highpass 
                  and finally with a little help from a helpful Ranger named Blake 
                  and Jouquin the Cleric (thanks guys!), made it to Kelethin. 
                  <p> So come one, come all, celebrate like it was your last day 
                    to live! (cause it is ;). Remember, bring as many people and 
                    as much alcohol as you can! I will be on Fennin Ro, but I 
                    believe many servers will be doing the same, See you there!

                    for testers during final.) 
                  <li>Talking about horses, may or may not go in (no short term 
                    plans). 
                  <li>All servers in San Diego, several backbones. 
                  <li>Houses in town will be rentable. Initial cost + upkeep.

                  <p> I am Derrin Erollisian, follower of Erollisi Marr, the Queen 
                    of Love. I have been a member of many guilds, and as a member 
                    of one guild which purported to be democratic, I realized 
                    that the guild system of Norrathian Law makes structuring 
                    truly democratic guilds nearly impossible by focussing power 
                    in the hands of a single 'guild master'. 
                  <p> It is with this flaw in mind, and a dedication to the principles 
                    of Erollisi and Democracy that I have written a first draft 
                    of a <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/~erollisi/bylaws.html">Charter</A> 
                    for any guild that wants to establish a truly democratic system. 
                    The <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/~erollisi/bylaws.html">Charter</A> 
                    can be found <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/~erollisi/bylaws.html">here</A> 
                    and is in first draft form--it is hyperlinked for thy convenience 
                    and is easy to read, but there may be a few typographcial 
                    errors. I welcome any criticisms from fellow defenders of 
                    Democracy. 
                  <p> Always remember: Love Never Fails.

              <div> The wedding between Downie and Decemberius that took place 
                last night turned out to be a successful and joyous event. Here's 
                more, from family friend Jence: 
                <blockquote> After a 15 minute delay, the wedding was still on. 
                  Decemberius was having second thoughts (disconnected) but everything 
                  was ready to roll when Sardonyx, the silly priest GM, got to 
                  Halas. A fairly large crowd showed up to watch Downie and Decemberius 
                  get wed. After presenting them both with a chain armor helmet 
                  as their gift, the ceremony started. It was strictly a Barabarian 
                  audience if I remember right though. 
                  <p> After Sardonyx summoned the wedding spirit, both bride and 
                    groom said their wedding vows. The crowd was delighted to 
                    see the green spirit of the gods come out of Sardonyx to show 
                    their approval. Soon after the ceremony there was a big celebrating 
                    at McQuaids. I think everybody had one too many drinks because 
                    we were all hammered and did not speak correctly. The wedding 
                    lasted about an hour, and in the end I think everybody was 
                    pleased with the event. 
                  <p> I took some pictures of what went on at the wedding. I urge 
                    you to take a look. The pictures include: the crowd, the spirits 
                    being summoned, the couple being wed, and the party afterward. 
                </blockquote>
                You can download the wedding pictures in zip format <a href="files/wed_dd.zip">here</a> 
                (only 343 KB). Included are some great drunken pictures of the 
                after-party.

                  to ask the high level people if they would help her get muffins

                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> All of the warrior family (warrior, 
                  paladin, ranger) cap within 5% of each other, and it certainly 
                  makes sense that warriors in the end are better melee fighters 
                  than other classes in that they are pure fighters, whereas the 
                  others can cast spells. 
                  <p> The reality is that in many ways the hybrid classes are 
                    more powerful (or at least more versatile) overall (and that's 
                    levels 1-50), which is why we gave them steeper experience 
                    tables. 
                  <p> And to compensate for the fact that warriors don't have 
                    any magic, there are indeed some powerful warrior-only weapons 
                    out there.

                    for Felwithe at promptly 8:00pm PST. Again, it is NOT necessary

                    on the honor of our daydwelling cousins to insure that all 
                    who attend have plenty and fair opponents.

              this site has attained due to the loyalty and intelligence of our 
              readers. I'd like to thank you all for helping make the EQSS what

              for both those who had a chance to play and those who participated 
              as spectators. I'll see you all on March 16th! (After the big finale 
              tonight, of course ;).

                  dark elves plan to cross our land and attack our neighbors the 
                  wood elves! They think our defenses as dwarves are lacking! 
                  I Zendikk, the humble servant of Brell Serilis, cannot stand 
                  by and watch our beloved land be tread upon by the foul feet 
                  of Innoruuk! We must make a stand against the worshipers of 
                  Innoruuk! Our city is well protected by many a dwarven soldier 
                  so we fear not retaliation. We must make our stand at the pass 
                  to Faydark on the side of Kaladim in the area known as Butcher 
                  Block. This pass is easily guarded, brothers and sisters, and 
                  here we will make our stand to protect our neighbors the wood 
                  elves! Our world known as Tarew Marr must uphold the honor of 
                  our dwarven fathers! Please show at the Pass to Faydark at 7:30 
                  PST at the latest to prepare for war! Let us show the dwarven 
                  nation will not stand idly by as an army of darkness marches 
                  across our beloved lands! Stand tall fellow dwarves! Let us 
                  crush the twisted ones before they ever set foot in the lands 
                  of Faydark.

              <div> Here's an update concerning The Day of Darkening player event: 
                <blockquote> THE DAY OF DARKENING- OUR FATHER PROVIDES FOR US: 
                  <p> Many of my kindred have expressed concern that they will 
                    die too quickly in tomorrow’s battle, and not have time to 
                    bring proper honor on their name. Do not be discouraged, Innoruuk 
                    is wise, and has provided for all things! 
                  <p> The, peasant Feir’Dal have built their rickety huts in the 
                    trees of the Faydark. This was foolish, as it has left a hole 
                    in the magical protection around Felwithe. This lack of protection 
                    will allow our souls to be bound to that forest, insuring 
                    that even if we fall, we may rise again quickly from the very 
                    soil to continue the battle! 
                  <p> I therefore call, in the name of Innoruuk, to all of our 
                    own dark brethren that are capable of working the magics necessary 
                    to bind souls. Join us! Our army shall be greatly strengthened 
                    by each one of you! Remember, it is not necessary to follow 
                    the ways of the Priest of Discord, we count on the honor of 
                    our daydwelling cousins to insure that all who attend have 
                    plenty and fair opponents. 
                  <p> Innoruuk wills that you should begin gathering at the valley 
                    to Nektulos, in the Common Lands, around 7:30pm PST, this 
                    12th of March. We will depart for the Faydark promptly at 
                    8:00 so that we may arrive there between 9:00 and 10:00, depending 
                    on the boat. 
                  <p> The end of this world is nigh! Let us take the souls of 
                    our misled cousins to our Father! Praise the Will of Innoruuk!

                of the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/dev1.html">EverQuest

                than the man himself, Brad McQuaid. Here's the full entry, which, 
                among other things, hints at a special surprise being planned 
                for tomorrow night's Beta finale: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Welcome to the first installment 
                  of the EverQuest developer diary! 
                  <p> Whew, it’s been busy here! With March 16th (EverQuest’s 
                    release date) right around the corner, the entire team, heck 
                    the entire company, has been hard at work on last minute details. 
                    The programmers are squashing bugs right and left, the world 
                    builders are tuning the last zones and entering last minute 
                    quests, and the infrastructure guys are getting the billing 
                    system ironed out. Most of us just worked 7 days straight, 
                    and typically 12-15 hours a day at that. 
                  <p> But it’s well worth it, believe me. 
                  <p> Why? Well, EverQuest just had another birthday… her third 
                    to be exact. Official work on EverQuest began March 4th, 1996, 
                    when I and lead programmer Steve Clover were hired to make 
                    a massively multiplayer game for Sony Interactive Studios 
                    (now 989 Studios). So looking ahead at the next week we’re 
                    finally seeing the finish line. To work on a project this 
                    long, which as truly been a labor of love, and to be so close 
                    to seeing it in the stores… it’s awesome. 
                  <p> I’m also just as excited to think of EverQuest’s future 
                    after launch. I’ve been telling people for a while now that 
                    EverQuest is more than a product, it’s a service. There’s 
                    so many more things we can and will do with this game. Creating 
                    a dynamic, ever-changing world is what this is really all 
                    about, and I can’t wait to see Norrath evolve and expand. 
                    Especially the dynamic quests we have planned… those will 
                    truly bring the world alive. In fact, all of you in Phase 
                    4 can look forward to some amazing events we have planned 
                    the final evening of the beta. 
                  <p> Anyway, back to work for me. The game is very close to being 
                    ready for March 16th, but we’ve still a bit of work to do. 
                    I hope to see you in Norrath soon. 
                  <p> -Brad McQuaid

              <div> Issue #48 of the print magazine InQuest (on sale now) has 
                a six-page preview feature of EverQuest, which includes great 
                narrative writing and some very cool screenshots. The <a href="http://www.inquestmag.com/iq48/everquest/everquest.html">article</a> 
                is also now available online from the InQuest website. Here's 
                a snippet: 
                <blockquote> EverQuest goes well beyond rules and mechanics, plunging 
                  you into the world of Norrath, an original setting rife with 
                  the conflict and character you'd expect from a world of high 
                  fantasy. And the experience is utterly unique. Unlike the online 
                  RPG Ultima Online, which is primarily a 2D game, EverQuest is 
                  fully 3D. With a full range of motion you can scale mountains, 
                  swim underwater and even fly through the air. 
                  <p> The game also sports textured lighting, polygonal weather 
                    conditions and five views, including a first-person perspective. 
                    Whether you're chatting with a fellow adventurer as the ship 
                    you've booked passage on crosses the ocean or gritting it 
                    out as you battle a towering dragon whose claws are as large 
                    as your body, EverQuest is the most immersing roleplaying 
                    game the PC has ever seen. 
                </blockquote>

              <div> Dragons sent us this announcement: 
                <blockquote> The Syndicate is a more than three year old Online 
                  Gaming guild located at <a href="http://www.erols.com/seanst/synd/iiiguild.html">http://www.erols.com/seanst/synd/iiiguild.html</a> 
                  (click on the logo to load the pages after the movie plays). 
                  We are more than 400 members strong and very organized, unified 
                  and professional. Having been an integral part in the beta testing 
                  of most of the online games currently released or in development, 
                  we are now shifting a branch of our guild to Everquest. With 
                  several hundred members planning on playing, we aim to be the 
                  largest and most successful guild in EQ as we have in all other 
                  games we have been involved in. 
                  <p> Syndicate members have been preparing for EQ since the very 
                    beginning of the beta. Some of our members were among the 
                    very first beta testers into the world. Since that time we 
                    have built momentum in our membership and are ready to EXPLODE 
                    into the game next week when its released. 
                  <p> We will exist, together as one team, on Tarew Marr server. 
                    We have squads dedicated to each of the races offering opportunities 
                    for all members. And we are currently open for recruiting 
                    of new members. 
                  <p> We are one of the largest, oldest and most successful online 
                    gaming guilds. We pride ourselves on being mature, professional, 
                    dedicated and motivated. Despite being a large guild we are 
                    a tight knit TEAM of friends. We have a well organized heirarchy 
                    and every member is important to the guild from the oldest 
                    veteran to the newest member. 
                  <p> Our guild is run by Guildmaster Dragons who has run the 
                    guild since the beginning. 
                  <p> Besides playing in online games, we also operate related 
                    sites to support them. We have a "pagan magic" team well known 
                    in the UO world dedicated to promoting role playing, locating 
                    and getting fixed game bugs but most importantly to researching 
                    the secrets of the game making it more fun for all. We also 
                    maintain a RPG gaming news site known as The DEN (Dragon's 
                    Eye News) currently being revamped to include an specific 
                    Everquest section. 
                  <p> The Syndicate is already a major power in the EQ world and 
                    plans only to grow larger, stronger and more unified. We are 
                    dedicated, professional gamers who are looking to have FUN! 
                    We have a STRONG PvP section, a large merchant section and 
                    a fun loving monster hunting section. We watch each others 
                    backs and hold a great many in game events, parties, games 
                    and quests.

                that the developers are in right now, it may be delayed until 
                a few days after. We had a ton of great questions to ask, so expect

                to order EverQuest. Well, I've set up a small promotion with <a href="http://www.gamecave.com/default.asp?sku=131PCEVX09146&source=STRA">GameCave</a>, 
                which allows us to provide you an option for pre-ordering or ordering 
                EverQuest from the front page of the EQSS. I've placed a small 
                graphic on the right-hand side of the page that will allow you 
                to order EverQuest for $39.99. International shipping is available 
                as well, so all of you non-North Americans can get your hands 
                on the game (although all initial game servers will be located 
                in the US). 
                <p> I'll be leaving the graphic up until one or two days after

            <div> 
              <div> Sauleth sent us this reminder of the weekly Happy Hour event: 
                <blockquote> Happy Hour- Sundays and Thursdays! <div> Announcing 
                  the beginning of a new NR tradition, from the folks at Norrath 
                  Role-play: <a href="http://norrathrp@norrathrp.com/">http://norrathrp@norrathrp.com</a>. 
                  Continuing this Thursday, we're encouraging roleplayers across 
                  Norrath to visit their local in-game taverns and mix it up with 
                  the locals over an ale or two. As we all know, tavern talk is 
                  an important element in the high fantasy genre. A great way 
                  to build atmosphere, exchange juicy rumors, and get to know 
                  other roleplayers and their beloved characters. Hopefully, this 
                  will add a new dimension to gameplay and help people find good 
                  groups to adventure with. We're going to add two more times 
                  to the ones already posted, to try to involve people from Nebraska 
                  to Norway. The four times are as follows: 
                  <p> Sundays 6pm C.S.T. and Sundays 6pm GMT (noon CST) 
                  <p> Thursdays 9pm C.S.T. and Thursdays 9pm GMT (3 CST) 
                  <p> The next question is 'Where?' The answer is, wherever you 
                    want. Considerate it a quest to find the livliest tavern in 
                    town, any Thursday and Sunday. Invite some friends. Do whatever 
                    you can to bring this thing to life. 
                  <p> I encourage everyone to take notice of Happy Hour. It is 
                    loads of fun! Also, you meet and make new friends, adventuring 
                    companions. I will also be keeping a journal of Happy Hour 
                    events that Elorebaen attends on the Journal page of the Bard's 
                    Tale section. I welcome any to send me a picture and a descriptive 
                    paragraph, including those who attended and where, to <a href="mailto:sauleth@norrathrp.com">sauleth@norrathrp.com</a>, 
                    concerning a Happy Hour they attended. I will post these submissions 
                    on the Journal page I talked of above. May we meet in Norrath! 
                  <p> Stop in and have fun. It's Happy Hour. 
                  <p> P.S. This Norrath tradition will continue when Final starts. 
                    Hope to see everyone then!

                  <p> It seems the rumors are becoming more and more rampant, 
                    and that the end of the World is indeed near. The Gods have 
                    decided to cleanse the land and begin anew, and though many 
                    may be saddened by this turn of events, I, Whisker of the 
                    Gemchopper Gnomes, see it as a time of celebration! After 
                    consoling with many many inhabitants throughout almost every 
                    fine city in Norrath, I am glad to report that many feel the 
                    same. So on the day of Friday the 12th of March, on the hour 
                    of 11pm PST, I invite anyone and everyone with a light heart 
                    and strong stomach to meet at the Main Lift in Kelethin for 
                    the first, and last, Apocalypse Brew Fest. 
                  <p> This will be a gathering of peoples from all over Norrath, 
                    and a chance to sample brews and vintages from all over the 
                    world. Brewers, come display your craft! Travelers, sell all 
                    of your worldly possessions and bring us those fine brews 
                    from your homeland! Bakers, please come prepared to supply 
                    many hungry drinkers! We will drink until we can drink no 
                    more, we will celebrate until the Gods silence us! So come 
                    one, come all to the End of the World celebration, and descend 
                    into decadence as you never have, and never will again! Please 
                    contact me if you plan on coming! 
                  <p> WHERE: Kelethin, the city of the Wood Elves in Greater Faydark 
                  <p> SERVER: Fennin Ro 
                  <p> WHEN: Friday, March 12th anytime before midnight! 
                  <p> WHAT: We want to get as many people as possible to bring 
                    as much beer, wine, liquor, and ale as they can possibly bring, 
                    at which time we urge you to hand them about freely and commence 
                    the brew fest! We want to be able to have every race, every 
                    zone, and every city represented. Bring that stout Dwarven 
                    ale, that dark fish wine, that blood red Kalish! Before the 
                    world ends, and after we are sure everyone is quite intoxicated, 
                    we will commence with either a raid of Crushbone Castle or 
                    Mistmoore, at which point the survivors (if there are any) 
                    will drink some more in a victory celebration. If time permits, 
                    I want to get as many people as possible to participate in 
                    the 'Suicide Waterfall', where we will all throw ourselves 
                    off of the heights in Kelethin at once, with as many spells 
                    as we can get going off on the way down! With luck we can 
                    get a GM to give us a Zero Hour countdown ;) 
                  <p> WHO: Anyone! Everyone is invited, and I especially need 
                    any magic users capable of casting Bind Affinity as well as 
                    any Brewers out there. Remember, bring as much alcohol as 
                    you can! 
                  <p> CONTACT: <a href="mailto:bluesoul@info2000.net">bluesoul@info2000.net</a>,

                EverQuest Brad McQuaid, on his feelings about item duplication 
                bugs, and how to respond to them if you encounter such an exploit. 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> I've read a few messages here 
                  and there by people claiming that there are still dupe bugs 
                  in EQ. Now, we've had VERY few dupe bugs, and we've fixed them 
                  FAST (we take them VERY seriously). Yet here are these posts 
                  (written by people who won't even leave their email address 
                  so I can ask them for more info). 
                  <P> So here's the deal. Email me how to dupe in EQ. <a href="mailto:bmcquaid@verant.com">bmcquaid@verant.com</a> 
                  <p> If we can reproduce the dupe bug, I will PERSONALLY award 
                    you a title in-game after launch for your service towards 
                    making this a great game. 
                  <p> We are doing everything in our power to make EQ as bug-free 
                    as possible, and, like I said, we take all claims of duping 
                    very seriously. If there are really some of these bugs left, 
                    and you care enough to post on this board or another (or even 
                    if you don't), then email me. <a href="mailto:bmcquaid@verant.com">bmcquaid@verant.com</a>

                <blockquote> I have recieved certain concerns about the EQ payment 
                  plans. Some young people are not able to have thier parents 
                  issue them their credit card information on-line. That number 
                  of people is increasing I have found. 
                  <p> I e-mailed Verant and they told me that other payment possibilites 
                    will be implemented, but not initially. Which is good enough 
                    news for those that it matters to.

              <div> Gordon Wrinn, otherwise known as Senior Guide Abashi, tendered 
                his resignation earlier today. He will be missed on all fronts, 
                not only for his input on community message boards, but for his 
                involvement in-game as well (he even saved Talonmarc, as detailed 
                in the <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/journal/index_den.shtml">Seven 
                Day Journal</a>). Here's his letter of farewell, which he sent 
                me just a few minutes ago: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Greetings all, 
                  <p> That vicious demon we refer to as "Real Life" saw fit to 
                    drag me away from my comfortable abode in the warm city of 
                    Tucson and plunged me face first into the cold wretched wasteland 
                    of Chicago. For the next 4 months I'll be in a horrendously 
                    small hotel room, forced to watch my cholesterol sky-rocket 
                    due to restaurants and fast food. I've done this for the last 
                    two weeks, it's pretty bad, but the worst part of this is 
                    that I can no longer fulfill my duties within EverQuest. It 
                    was with a heavy heart that today I resigned my post as a 
                    Senior Guide in EverQuest. My last duty as one of those who 
                    handles public relations is to let the EverQuest community 
                    know of my departure. 
                  <p> Though I will not be around to enjoy the game in the first 
                    few months of release, it is my hope that all of you will 
                    give it the chance it so richly deserves. EverQuest has already 
                    proved itself to be a concept nearly beyond comprehension 
                    in diversity and depth. Here, a week before release, we are 
                    prepared to see that concept laid out in all its glory for 
                    the whole world to see. No other MMORPG, either in development, 
                    or on "the radar" offers an immersion factor and sheer level 
                    of playability as high as this game. It truly is a sight to 
                    see. Please remember that it is not EverQuest's job to take 
                    "fun" and hand it to you on a silver platter. EverQuest's 
                    job, as is the job of all other MMORPGs, is to provide you 
                    with a diverse atmosphere where you can choose from a buffet 
                    of things that are "fun" and to combine them in the proportions 
                    that YOU consider to be fun. 
                  <p> I'm not going to jerk anyone's chain and say that there 
                    won't be problems from time to time, but they will be few 
                    and far between. The Verant staff has proved to me time and 
                    time again that they care about this game to the level that 
                    a mechanic cares about their car or an artist cares about 
                    their canvas. I've spoken with many members of the development 
                    team, both on the phone, in game, and through email, and each 
                    one of them views this game as their personal measurement 
                    of worth. They will not stand idly by and let anything "ruin 
                    the game", whether it be the occasional bug or the obnoxious 
                    player. 
                  <p> The Guide Program and the Verant Customer Service Staff 
                    will continue to work in a swift, caring, and unbiased manner 
                    to provide an atmosphere as universally beneficial to all 
                    of the desired playstyles. This covers everything from answering 
                    your questions, dealing with those who would alienate the 
                    other customers, and designing and implementing serious and 
                    well-thought-out GM run quests across all the worlds simultaneously. 
                    As to the Guides, I've never seen a group of volunteers work 
                    so hard for something such as this before. Both they and I 
                    feel that we have a stake of ownership in the game. Some of 
                    you might think this is strange coming from a bunch of people 
                    who used to be just fans, but I assure you that it will go 
                    a long way towards making the game a success. 
                  <p> Remember that beyond the graphics, the gameplay, and the 
                    customer service staff, one thing, and one thing alone has 
                    the capacity to make or break the game: The players. It is 
                    the players that will see the world before them and decide 
                    whether this game will be a success. It is the players that 
                    test the resolve of the development team and customer service 
                    staff, and it is the players that ultimately decide how long 
                    the game will last. I have great confidence that the majority 
                    of players will come to see this game as the work of art that 
                    is obvious to me. Please don't disappoint me, please take 
                    everything that the development team has given you and go 
                    out and make the best of it. 
                  <p> Take care, 
                  <p> Abashi

            <div> Part Seven of the background story behind the <a href="war">War 
              of Ro</a> PvP event, entitled <a href="war#7">A Blow for the Light</a>, 
              has been published. Thanks again to Simeron for authoring the tale. 
              In addition, here's an update concerning the event being rescheduled 
              due to the recent announcement that Phase 4 will be ending on Friday: 
              <blockquote> The War of Ro will officially be held in Northern Ro, 
                Fennin Ro server at 8pm central time on the 12th of March. Members 
                who have contacted the GMs of the guilds can arrive anytime over 
                the next two days and fight skirmishes but we ask that all participants 
                make sure they are available for the last, best fight of the Beta. 
              </blockquote>
              Lastly, Simeron recently received word from Brad McQuaid regarding 
              his concerns over the earlier than expected end of P4. Here are 
              the details, as posted to the <a href="forums/hall">QuestHall</a>: 
              <blockquote> Well, last night I was ticked to say the least. Months 
                of planning seemed to have gone right out the window because we 
                were not going to have Saturday to finish the beta with and many 
                events had been scheduled for that day. I tried to talk to the 
                GMs in the chat and was ignored by them totally. Other members 
                of the chat were unconcerned about the loss of this great oppertunity 
                to give the testers one last hurrah before public and I left there 
                with even more determination to have my say then ever. I not only 
                sent Brad an angry email but called the Verdant home office and 
                left a voicemail for him. I fully expected to get nothing back 
                from him. I know how busy he must be and I was mainly venting. 
                Today, I recieved an email today from him that basically explains 
                the problems they are facing and why things have to be done in 
                certain ways. It must have got him to thinking though and despite 
                the workload they must be under, he took time to make a general 
                post to apologize for the inconvienience this has caused so many 
                loyal testers. Now, I know that don't change the fact that we 
                are rushing to adapt the events for Friday now instead of Saturday 
                but I have to say one thing.... 
                <p> I wonder how many others in Brad's Position would take the 
                  time now, right before release, to answer an angry (and now 
                  that I read it calmly, brash and slightly dumb) email from a 
                  tester and then make a post for all the others that figured 
                  it was one of those things big companies do to their testers 
                  at the end of the beta. Personally, I thought Brad and his team 
                  couldn't surprise me more...but again I am proved wrong.

              <div> Here's Brad McQuaid with some of Verant's reasoning behind 
                their decision to end Phase 4 on Friday the 12th--4 days before 
                final release--and how they've affected some player events that 
                have been scheduled for the end of Beta. 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> I know a lot of you out there 
                  were planning some ending events for the weekend, and are probably 
                  a bit disappointed at the fact that we're closing things down 
                  friday night. Please understand that this is simply due to logistics 
                  -- we have only so much time to transition internally from phase 
                  4 to launch, and we need that weekend. So I apologize if this 
                  has interfered with plans, but I do hope these events can be 
                  rescheduled. We definitely didn't do this arbitrarily, and we 
                  are keeping phase 4 alive for as long as possible. thanks for 
                  understanding,

                  <p> Hear me all who intend to take part in the attack on Faydwere! 
                    The End is nearer than we thought! We Teir'Dal had planned 
                    to make the trip to Faydwere on the 12th, and then attack 
                    the city on the 13th. The gods themselves try to stop our 
                    advance! In response, Innoruuk wills that we move our attack 
                    to Friday the 12th. 
                  <p> My mouth is the mouth of Innoruuk, this is His will: The 
                    dark army is now to gather in East Commons, near the valley 
                    to Nektulos Forest, at 8:00pm PST and we will leave promptly 
                    for secret tunnels to the docks. We will, no doubt, be forced 
                    to wait on the boat. This and the trip through the Butcherblock 
                    Mountains should put us at Faydwere between 9:00pm and 10:00pm 
                    PST. The attack on Faydwere will begin then! The end of the 
                    world will befall us all at 12:00pm PST. Let us go to the 
                    Father with blood on our hands! 
                  <p> All those who intend to stand against us at Faydwere should 
                    also adjust your timetable. We will be there Friday! 
                  <p> The end of the world is coming, and we shall insure that 
                    Faydwere is the first to feel it!

              <div> We've received some more reports concerning the horse named 
                Equestrielle, which has been spotted roaming Lesser Faydark. Here 
                are two new screenshots of Equestrielle, one a close up of its 
                previous incarnation, and the second of its newer form.

                As you can see from the screenshots, Equestrielle has evolved 
                into nothing less than a Unicorn! This further supports Brad's 
                previous assertions that there will be no ride-able horses in 
                EverQuest any time soon. At least there are Unicorns... great

                    patch. Here is a list of the bugs that were corrected as of 
                    this patch; 
                  <p> - 1)Players will now be able to rotate while rooted. 
                  </font><div><font color=#a00000> - 2)Spells would often make 
                  contact with a target, however, no notification was given to 
                  the user.</font><div><font color=#a00000> - 3)The "Eye of Zomm" 
                  would disappear when it entered the water.</font><div><font color=#a00000> 
                  - 4)Performing the /shout, /tell, or /group command, followed 
                  by 16 consecutive characters(no spaces) would result in the 
                  player receiving an extra character or box added to the message.</font><div><font color=#a00000> 
                  - 5)Foraged food was not stackable.</font><div><font color=#a00000> 
                  - 6)The "Opal Sycthe" could not be looted from NPC corpses.</font><div><font color=#a00000> 
                  - 7)When running the Diamond Viper V550, the gamma would be 
                  extremely dark at any setting.</font><div><font color=#a00000> 
                  - 8)Characters that were knocked unconscious would remain in 
                  this state indefinitely.</font><div><font color=#a00000> - 9)Players 
                  are no longer able to move while under the effects of the Minor 
                  Illusion spell.

                records. Here's a snippet: 
                <blockquote> "We have already received phenomenal feedback on 
                  the pre-launch of EverQuest from all of our retailers and are 
                  obviously very pleased by the high volume of pre-sell orders," 
                  said Jeffrey Fox, vice president, marketing, 989 Studios. "EverQuest 
                  is literally the most detailed and visually stunning role-playing 
                  game ever developed and since we are limiting the initial build 
                  of this game to ensure no server issues, consumers should take 
                  advantage of the pre-sell opportunities to make sure they can 
                  secure a copy of EverQuest before the retail launch on March 
                  16." </blockquote>

                on the recent call for new staff (see yesterday's news): 
                <blockquote> Thanks for all the responses thus far, the number 
                  of applicants is overwhelming and I am in the process of reading 
                  all the emails and responding. There seems to be a number of 
                  recurring questions and I would just like to clarify them here 
                  so that future applicants need not ask them in private email: 
                  <p> Firstly the positions are currently non paid, and do not 
                    require relocation. Games reviewers will be asked to both 
                    supply their own material AND will be given material, depending 
                    on our relationship with the particular gaming company. With 
                    time all material will be supplied by us. The positions are 
                    all LONG term and require at the very least a 6 month commitment. 
                    Finally, the positions are all at Stratics MAIN (<a href="http://stratics.com">http://stratics.com</a>), 
                    please ensure that you are aware of that before applying. 
                  <p> As a parting note, please write complete introductory emails 
                    at the very least, if you choose to include a portfolio or 
                    some sample work, all the better. From this point on emails 
                    consisting of a single sentence or merely questions will not 
                    be answered, due to the veritable deluge of other, serious 
                    applications. 
                  <p> If you have sent me an email, I WILL read it, and I will 
                    respond. Please have patience.

                records. Also included is the statement that EverQuest is PC.IGN's 
                favorite beta test. Here's a snippet: 
                <blockquote> The pre sale program, which began on February 1st 
                  has already attracted over 8,000 gamers and 989 predicts that 
                  the final pre-sale list will exceed 10,000 units. Jeffrey Fox, 
                  989's VP of Marketing seems to think that the fact that the 
                  game will have a limited initial release may have something 
                  to do with the early success. "EverQuest is literally the most 
                  detailed and visually stunning role-playing game ever developed," 
                  said Fox in the release, "and since we are limiting the initial 
                  build of this game to ensure no server issues, consumers should 
                  take advantage of the pre-sell opportunities to make sure they 
                  can secure a copy of EverQuest before the retail launch on March 
                  16th." The semi-scare tactic seems to be working, as EverQuest 
                  has become the number one pre-sold game on EBWorld. </blockquote>

                  billing system. We got most of the bugs out and have really 
                  streamlined it. Unfortunately, to do this, we had to run it 
                  in debug mode, and bring it up and down a lot. The current status 
                  is all servers are up, and the billing system is off for the 
                  night. Some final testing of the billing system should occur 
                  tomorrow and the next day, but shouldn't be nearly as extensive 
                  in terms of server availabilty.

              <div> More from Jia Ji, this time on a new event sponsored by Forever 
                Quest. 
                <blockquote> The <A HREF="http://eq.mgon.com">Forever Quest</A> 
                  project will be having an unique combination event and fundraiser 
                  in preparation for our large scale quests at the end of P4. 
                  We encourage all players to attend "The Cleansing of Neriak", 
                  the first ever EQ Player Auction Event. 
                  <p> <b>Disclaimer:</b> This is a roleplayed in game event only. 
                    The FQ project in no way condones the ancient, extinct practice 
                    of slavery in real life. Any out of character racial slurs 
                    or remarks during the event will not be tolerated. Thank you. 
                  <p> <b>Starting Time:</b> Tuesday, March 9th, 8:00 PM EST<br>
                    <b>Where:</b> Eastern Commonlands, just in front of trail 
                    to Nektulos Forest.<br>
                    <b>Who:</b> FQ Staff (dark elf slave masters), facilitators 
                    (slaves), and roleplayers (buyers)<br>
                    <b>Why:</b> To fundraise the funds needed to run the large 
                    scale quests near the end of P4 and provide rewards for these 
                    quests. This will also serve to test out our system for player 
                    run auction type events.<br>
                    <b>Background Reading:</b> The background for this event can 
                    be read here, <A HREF="http://eq.mgon.com/heartstone/quests/wedding/">A 
                    Bond in Darkness</A>. 
                  <p> <b>Quest:</b> <A HREF="http://eq.mgon.com">Forever Quest</A> 
                    will be holding a roleplayed "Slave Auction" to help raise 
                    funds for the quest rewards that will be given out during 
                    the end of P4. The staff will be playing a group of extremist 
                    dark elves who have cleared the "Foreign Quarter" of Neriak, 
                    of the "foul vermin" they consider the other races to be. 
                    These captives were taken as slaves and now will be sold via 
                    a public slave auction. The "slaves" in this event will be 
                    volunteer high level (10+) players who are willing to spend 
                    one EQ day in service to help the FQ project. The auction 
                    is similar to the "bachelor/bachelorette auctions" held in 
                    real life, but will be carried out in a roleplayed fashion. 
                    We hope for it to be just as fun, though. 
                  <p> <b>Player Involvement:</b> Players can become involved by 
                    attending the auction and bidding on slaves. The highest bidder 
                    will be able to purchase the slave. Players can also become 
                    involved by volunteering to be slaves in the auction. We encourage 
                    that players level 10 and up be slaves and that lower level 
                    players be buyers. Players can volunteer to become slaves 
                    by filling out our <A HREF="http://www.ji.nu/fquest/join/facilitator.html"
onmouseover="window.status='Facilitator Signup Form'; return
true">Facilitator Signup Form</A> and putting "Slave" in the "What services will 
                    you to able to provide to facilitate quests?" text area box. 
                    Slaves must report to the area for the auction (Eastern Commonlands) 
                    one hour prior to the event (7:00 PM EST) and contact one 
                    of the dark elf slave masters in the area. Last minute slaves 
                    will be accepted, but this is frowned upon. 
                  <p> Additional information about this event and our "Terms of 
                    Slave Service" contract can be found <A

              <div> Jia Ji sent us this, regarding the recent "Awakening" player 
                event that took place over the weekend: 
                <blockquote> The Awakening ended last night and the Forever Quest 
                  staff felt that a report of the developments during the quest 
                  would be in order. A number of exceptional roleplayers have 
                  made an impression upon the staff and will be contacted shortly. 
                  There is still a chance for latecomers to become key characters 
                  by posting their accounts of the Awakening upon our temporary

onmouseover="window.status='The Awakening Message Board'; return

                  is a brief summary of the events that took place, more information 
                  can be found on our <A HREF="http://eq.mgon.com">web site</A>. 
                  <p> The Awakening opened with a debate in Freeport. The event 
                    was quite a success! Many people argued their views, and many 
                    interesting points were made. We even received a surprise 
                    visit from a Dark Elf who nearly had the entire crowd trying 
                    to kill him! All in all a good time was had by everyone, and 
                    many interesting rumors were revealed. The tales spawned by 
                    this event developed throughout the weekend. 
                  <p> In conjunction with the <A HREF="http://www.crde.com/eq">Knights 
                    of the Crimson Spire</A>, a grand tour of Norrath was put 
                    on. The emphasis was exploration, not fighting, and the trip 
                    started in Ak'Annon and went all the way to Qeynos! You can 
                    read a more in-depth review <A
HREF="http://eq.mgon.com/heartstone/quests/tour/index.html">here</A>. 
                  <p> To close off the event and to lead into our next event, 
                    the Forever Quest staff facilitated a wedding at the Blind 
                    Fish in Neriak between Aekron and Kasaandra. A good time was 
                    had by all and a traditional dark elven wedding gift was presented, 
                    a human slave. Many interesting developments occurred soon 
                    afterwards, including a raid upon the Foreign Quarter by a 
                    band of extremist dark elves. More information can be found

              <div> Moonwalker sent us news of an upcoming player event: 
                <blockquote> WHEN: Saturday, March 13th 7:30pst*<div> SERVER: 
                  Tarew Marr<div> WHERE: The Gates of Felewithe<div> WHO: Anyone<div>

                  <p> Hail,<div>
                  I am Moonwalker a simple Ranger . Long has it been since I've 
                  seen my beloved Faydark, I have travelled many leagues in search 
                  of my fate, beckoned always by the Moon who calls me to walk 
                  in her shimmering light. Helping those who have lost their path. 
                  Recently on an expedition to High Hold I recieved a letter from 
                  my dear brother Severus who was lodging at an Inn in the East 
                  Commons. While having a bite to eat he overheard voices outside 
                  his rooms window. He stated that several persons of variable 
                  sizes were talking about the DarkElves of Neriak and of an army 
                  marching through Freeport killing humans and anything else that 
                  got in their way. Then he heard one of them speak quite clearly 
                  in our own language ( Elvish ) to another that L'vanon, Firstborn 
                  Priest of Innoruuk was leading an Army of Darkelves, Trolls 
                  and Humans to the very Gates of Felewithe, Now I am not so concerned 
                  with Felewithe but what lies in the path of this Army. Innocent 
                  men and women, young ones playing and learning the ways of their 
                  peoples not harming anyone. This I cannot allow to happen even 
                  if it means my death. Now I have returned home bringing with 
                  me this grave news that effects all that dwell in the land of 
                  Faydwer and I beckon to its peoples stand with me to vanquish 
                  this Army of Darkness. </blockquote>

                  has ZERO to do with internet lag. Frame rate loss is usually 
                  due to having a lower-end system and/or just running across 
                  a very complex scene (lots of guys on the screen, many spells 
                  going off at the same time, etc.).

              <div> Computer Games Online has published an in-depth <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/018/058/everquest_preview.html">Preview 
                of EverQuest</a>. Here's an excerpt: 
                <blockquote> 989 Studios' online RPG EverQuest, surely the most 
                  ambitious project Sony has ever undertaken for the PC, is almost 
                  ready for the masses. According to the company March 16 is the 
                  debut date, when the game will throw open its doors to the (paying) 
                  public. We've covered this title, being developed by Verant, 
                  a lot since we first wrote about it way back in the fall of 
                  1997, largely because there's been a lot of interest in it. 
                  After all, it's the first massively multiplayer role-playing 
                  game that promises state-of-the-art 3D graphics, a first-person 
                  perspective, protection from player killers, and a fully realized 
                  fantasy world. As Sony prepares to ship the game to stores, 
                  we thought it would be worthwhile to give you a glimpse of what 
                  to expect, based on the Phase IV beta. </blockquote>

            <div> 
              <div> We're looking for a number of dedicated individuals who would 
                like to become more involved with Stratics, in particular the 
                main network hub located at <a href="http://www.stratics.com">http://www.stratics.com</a>. 
                Here's more from Redemption, Senior Editor and Lead Project Coordinator 
                for Stratics Main: 
                <blockquote> The Stratics Network is looking for new help to work 
                  on the main hub. The main hub of the Network is involved with 
                  general online gaming news and aims to deliver gaming related 
                  news and in-house articles to a wide range of readers, from 
                  the Stratics regular to the casual drop in surfer. We are looking 
                  for motivated, committed and capable bodies to staff the hub 
                  and help with written assignments and polish up work. 
                  <p> The following positions are open: 
                  <p> Staff writer (2-3)<div>
                  Staff reviewer (1-2)<div> Graphics Designer (1)<div> Programmer 
                  (1) 
                  <p> The positions of staff writer and staff reviewer are the 
                    most in demand. If you have a passion for writing and for 
                    presenting your written work to a wide audience, this is the 
                    position for you. A strong grasp of the written language, 
                    as well as a flare for style, are strong assets for both the 
                    reviewer and writer. The responsibilities of the staff writer 
                    include writing fresh news stories, articles, editorials, 
                    and perhaps even regular published work (i.e. like a column). 
                    It is paramount that the staff writer be able to commit a 
                    certain amount of time, regularly, to maintain the news content 
                    (i.e. once every day, or once every other day etc.). The staff 
                    reviewer will be asked to review a variety of games ranging 
                    from RPGs to Action. An ability to look objectively and subjectively 
                    at the subject matter, as well as a well based background 
                    in gaming, are strong assets for this position. The Graphics 
                    Designer will help in making theme'd graphics for articles 
                    and for general use. The ability to make small, variously 
                    styled, unique artwork is required to fill this position. 
                    The programmer position is suited to those with experience 
                    in HTML, perl/tcl, SQL, javascript and java. The progammer's 
                    task will be to help in designing dynamic, embedded language 
                    pages for the site and for designing custom scripts. Individuals 
                    with experience using SQL and embedded perl will be especially 
                    suited for this position. 
                  <p> Anyone interested in any number of these positions should 
                    send detailed information to <a href="mailto:redemption@stratics.com">redemption@stratics.com</a>. 
                    This includes (but is not limited to) your qualifications, 
                    your experience, prior work done on web or print based media, 
                    general information on education, aims, goals, expectations, 
                    and the number of hours you can commit to this. You may also 
                    submit your resumes and a small portfolio if you wish - this 
                    is encouraged so that we have an idea of your work. Those 
                    applying for staff writer and reviewer are strongly advised 
                    to either send a sample of your previews work, or ad hoc a 
                    sample article for the purpose of this application. 
                  <p> We are looking for serious candidates who will be able to 
                    commit themselves to their positions and submit work on a 
                    regular basis, though the actual amount of time per week devoted 
                    to working can be dictated by the individual. Please only 
                    apply if you are both serious about joining the Stratics team, 
                    and if you are certain you will be able to meet the responsibilities 
                    for a while to come.

              <div> L’vanon sent us news of an epic player event, involving assaults 
                against the cities of elves. 
                <blockquote> The Days of Darkening 
                  <p> When: Friday, March 12th 8:00pst AND Saturday, March 13th 
                    8:00pst* Server: Tarew Marr, but I call upon my Kindred on 
                    ALL servers to do the same! Where: Meet in East Commons, at 
                    the valley to Nektulos Forest Who: All races of Norrath Contact: 
                    <a href="mailto:gbconsortium@geocities.com">gbconsortium@geocities.com</a> 
                  <p> I am L’vanon, Firstborn Priest of Innoruuk. Hear me, for 
                    my mouth is the mouth of Innoruuk! The Days of Darkening are 
                    upon us! You have seen how armies of our kind attack the reeking 
                    human city of Freeport, but this is just a small taste of 
                    the destruction at hand. By Innoruuk’s guidance I have seen 
                    the gates of Felwithe itself and lived to tell of it! The 
                    uninitiated of our kind think of Freeport as a wall between 
                    us and Faydwer, but a hidden path THROUGH Freeport has been 
                    paved for us by our human servants in the Church of Dismal 
                    Rage. An entire army of our dark brethren shall march unseen 
                    to the docks themselves under the very noses of the foolish 
                    day-dwellers! The Dwarven fortifications on the far side of 
                    the Ocean of Tears can be bypassed with ease, and these are 
                    the final bastion between us and shining Faydwer, home of 
                    our pitiful cousins. 
                  <p> It is the Will of Innoruuk that we gather as an army and 
                    march on the city of the High-Elves this Friday. In his wisdom, 
                    he knows that assailing the city guards gains little, and 
                    it is the citizens themselves that must be cleansed. He does 
                    not require us to embrace the way of the Priests of Discord 
                    to accomplish this. Let every one of our kinsman march to 
                    the Bright City and there seek out an enemy of similar experience, 
                    and honorably duel with him for the future of all Norrath! 
                  <p> It is therefore that I also call to our poor, misled cousins, 
                    the High Elves, and the peasant Wood Elves. Call your worm-ridden 
                    allies and meet us in your precious forest! Uphold what honor 
                    you have and let your race die with the cry of battle on its 
                    lips, not merely a whimper. I do not expect much more than 
                    fear from day-dwellers, but muster what courage you have, 
                    and gather it on the field of battle this Saturday. 
                  <p> Remember, Kindred, our will is the Will of Innoruuk. If 
                    it is his plan that you should die on foreign soil, then rejoice 
                    in your death! This is the Dark Day! Let EVERY Teir’Dal follow 
                    Him! Let every loyal Troll, Ogre, and Human follow Him! Even 
                    the very young should welcome this chance to follow His Will. 
                    None are so inexperienced that they cannot serve in this cause. 
                  <p> Remember, you might as well die doing something GRAND, it’s 
                    only 3 days from The Final Death anyway. 
                  <p> *OOC NOTE: This is a two-day event. Since the trip from 
                    Neriak to Faydwer is so long, we will be making the journey 
                    on March 12th and attacking on March 13th. I (and any others 
                    that know the secret way through Freeport) will be leading 
                    the army to Faydark on the 12th. Once there, soldiers are 
                    welcome to terrorize the countryside as long as they promise 
                    not to get killed before the battle proper! Any who know their 
                    way, and think they can make the journey alone, can just be 
                    present for the battle on the 13th, if they like. Remember, 
                    however, that the ship only runs every 45 minutes or so, so 
                    don’t miss the boat and show up late. Thank you for participating, 
                    may you bring honor on your race!

                  have decided to hold the first ever EverQuest Social Gathering, 
                  in the final release of EverQuest. This event is planned to 
                  help new players make friends, traveling companions, and enhance 
                  their role playing experience. I believe that this event will 
                  be beneficial to the future of many EverQuest gamers. The event 
                  will be held on Saturday March 27, 1999, the week after the 
                  release of the final version of EverQuest, in the city of Freeport, 
                  at a location to be announced at a later date. Any suggestions 
                  or help with planning the event would be greatly appreciated.

                  drakkar-noir2@geocities.com</a> <div>or on ICQ at: 32500344 <div> 
                  I will also need as many beta tester volunteers as possible 
                  to help with this event, in order to assist new players. If 
                  you are able to volunteer, please contact me, or try to be present 
                  at the gathering. I hope that everybody realizes the potential 
                  of this event and will help me in planning it as well as be 
                  able to attend. I will post more information about the event 
                  as I receive it. Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

              <div> This bit of news got lost in the shuffle over the weekend. 
                Here's Tarsuril Elbereth with a report on the Pub Night event 
                that took place on the Test Server on Friday. 
                <blockquote> Well, the Pub Night was pretty much squashed by the 
                  Chat Server being down for a few hours, preventing people from 
                  logging into the Test Server. The event was scheduled for 10pm 
                  MST, and the login servers were finally available at about 10pm 
                  MST! Unfortunately, I think the damage was done by then. Most 
                  people figured the event was a scratch. I received tells from 
                  players up to 2 hours after the event was supposed to start, 
                  wondering if it was still on. 
                  <p> To the dozen or so people who did manage to make it, it 
                    was nice to meet you! I got everyone who came quite impaired, 
                    since I had about 100 bottles of booze on me! The infamous 
                    Jythri was also in attendance, and played a few good tavern 
                    tunes, including East Ale. Thanks for coming Jyth! 
                  <p> I don't know if there is enough interest to reschedule it, 
                    so that everyone who wanted to come can come. I'll send further 
                    news if I decide to try this type of thing again. It's a real 
                    shame it didn't work out. 
                  <p> I'm starting to think there is a conspiracy against player 
                    events! The server always seems to go down for hours on end, 
                    right before an established player event takes place! <div>

                  and therefor temporarily disabled it until we complete testing 
                  to the changes internally. </blockquote>

              <div> Dave Rickey of Verant sent this concerning problems which 
                have resurfaced for Voodoo2 users: 
                <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Yesterday's patch seems to have 
                  re-introduced the "Black Screen" bug for some Voodoo2 card users. 
                  It you are getting an apparent lockup with a black screen after 
                  selecting a server and clicking the "Play EverQuest" button, 
                  you need to delete the "eqopt16.opt" and "eqOptions1.opt" files 
                  from your EQ directory. As a temporary workaround, if you are 
                  having this problem you need to return to 640x480 mode before 
                  logging out of EQ, otherwise you will need to delete those files 
                  again. 
                  <p> If you have this problem, please send email with information 
                    on your system configuration (especially your Video Card model) 
                    and stating you had a "Black Screen" problem to eqmail@verant.com, 
                    and please attach your dbg.txt file from your EQ directory.

              <div> The EverQuest patch server has been updated with the following 
                message: 
                <blockquote> We have found and fixed two major bugs with spell 
                  casting and the newly implemented "/corpse" command. These fixes 
                  should account for many of the crashes or disconnects that players 
                  were encountering. A number of other bugs have been fixed with 
                  this patch and are listed below; 
                  <p> 
                  <ol>
                    <li>Bows were drawing onto the user interface overlays and 
                      eventually leading to crashing. 
                    <li>The newly implemented "/corpse" command was causing players 
                      to disconnect when used. 
                    <li>The Mesmerize effect for Bards and Enchanters has been 
                      fixed, and should be working as intended. 
                    <li>Exiting from the character selection screen, selecting 
                      a server, then clicking on the "Play EverQuest" button would 
                      result in an Illegal Operation. 
                    <li>If a character died and his or her starting city was down, 
                      it would result in the user crashing. Now, instead of crashing, 
                      the user will be returned to the character selection screen 
                      until the starting city comes back on-line. 
                    <li>Range weapons that were equipped would not appear on the 
                      character model until the weapon was activated. 
                    <li>When commanding pets, text of pets coordinates would spam 
                      the user's chat bar. 
                    <li>After jumping into water with a torch equipped, then unequiping 
                      and re-equiping it, the torch would then activate while 
                      under water. 
                    <li>When using the "Eye of Zomm" spell, the eye model would 
                      only face in one direction. 
                    <li>While fishing, the player would receive a message that 
                      the pole has broken, however, the pole was not actually 
                      damaged. 
                    <li>If the player purchases multiple scrolls of the same spell, 
                      only one scroll would appear in the character's inventory. 
                    <li>Upon consenting another character loot your corpse, the 
                      consenting player would receive the message, "You are given 
                      permission to loot <character's name> corpse". 
                    <li>While riding the ships, no ocean sound could be heard. 
                    <li>Display mode settings would not be saved when exiting 
                      and re-entering the game. 
                    <li>Text overlapping would occur while the spell book was 
                      open and the options menu was up. 
                    <li>Players were able to activate the hot key functions while 
                      meditating. 
                    <li>When a player was anonymous, and the option menu was up, 
                      the character was in fact not anonymous. 
                    <li>With the Autosplit function enabled, party members would 
                      receive money when a fellow party member looted his or her 
                      corpse. 
                    <li>Various grammatical changes were made to the race and 
                      class descriptions at the character select screen. 
                    <li>Placing multiple "stackable" items in the trade screen 
                      would result in an incorrect number of items on the receivers 
                      screen.

                  burning the midnight oil making various bug fixes and additional 
                  enhancments to game play. To aid in corpse recoveries, we have 
                  implemented the "/corpse" command. This command will allow the 
                  user to summon his/her nearest corpse that is with in a 50' 
                  radius. However, the "/corpse" command will not allow players 
                  to summon corpses from lava. In addition, we have included a 
                  Friends List and a random number command, both of which may 
                  be found in the EverQuest_Manual.txt file. The various bug fixes 
                  are listed below; 
                  <p> 
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Minor Illusion spell should be working as intended, 
                      allowing the caster to be seen as the object they have been 
                      transformed into. 
                    <li>Various boat travel fixes have been made. 
                    <li>Food and Drink is now required for the character's stamina 
                      regeneration.

            <div> A few days ago, Aztor sent me a new map of the third and last 
              zone of Neriak, the Commons. I wanted to wait until I'd finished 
              the full map of Neriak that I'd been working on before publishing 
              it, but I'll be heading out of town until Monday. So we've published 
              the new Neriak Commons map under the <a href="maps_cities.shtml#ner">Maps, 
              Cities</a> section. Expect the map of all Neriak to published early 
              next week. 
              <p> That completes Neriak, and I have maps of Erudin and Qeynos 
                waiting in the wings. (Qeynos is being mapped by the ever-so-excellent 
                Gram, who was responsible for the famous Ultimate UO World Map. 
                Can we say "100% to scale"? Woohoo.) In addition, I have even 
                more in-depth additions to the maps of Freeport, Ak'Anon and Halas, 
                which will be published soon. The only cities that we're lacking 
                in our Maps section are Rivervale and Oggok. If you'd be interested 
                in mapping either or both of these two last cities, send a note 
                to <a href="mailto:den@stratics.com">den@stratics.com</a>. Thanks!

              are offered into the power of the unit that may be able to bring

              <blockquote> With a 128-bit processor that runs games three times 
                faster than the Pentium III, a graphics chip two times faster 
                than some high-end graphics powerhouses from Silicon Graphics 
                (NYSE:SGI), DVD capabilities, and most likely, online connectability, 
                the so-called PlayStation 2 could be a dream home-entertainment 
                device when it comes to market late next year. </blockquote>

            <div> Kaun of the <a href="http://www.atfirst.net/eq">Clan MacLear</a> 
              sent us news of an upcoming player event: 
              <blockquote> The Chief's Festival <div> When:Saturday, the 6th of 
                March 8pm central standard time <div> Where: Xegony Server, Meet 
                at 3 igloos in Everfrost <div> Directions:3 igloos is left from 
                the Everfrost-side of BB then stay left and follow the stream 
                of people. From Halas, take a right then take the second left 
                and the first right (or follow someone) 
                <p> The Clan MacLear has elected Tormod as it's chief. To celebrate 
                  this occasion and as a general excuse to throw a party we are 
                  hosting a festival. All are welcome to participate in the competitions, 
                  tournaments, races, alcohol abuse, and other festivities planned 
                  for the occasion. After we set Tormod up as chief, we’ll begin 
                  the festivites in the 3 igloos area. This area is large and 
                  open, so it won’t get too crowded, and will allow for multiple 
                  competitions to go on at one time. I'll also be able to address 
                  the whole crowd from atop the igloos and be seen even if I'm 
                  a gnome! Clan MacLear members and volunteers will be refereeing 
                  all events. I, Daran, will be head judge. 
                <p> Here are the catagories: (Note: participants who are drunk 
                  the entire tournament will receive high esteem and loud grunts 
                  of honor from all attending.) 
                <p> 1.) Test of Speed. Players will race from Halas to the end 
                  of the 3 igloos field. No spell modifications are allowed. This 
                  will include swimming the Halas lake and crossing the zone line, 
                  and is open to all levels. The enterence fee for this race is 
                  2 gold which will be pooled and rewarded to the fastest player. 
                <p> 2.) Test of Might. Solo fight to yield or unconscious. This 
                  will be according to levels, depending on how many of each level 
                  we have present. This is multi-class competition, so spell modification 
                  is allowed. There is an enterence fee if 1 gold for levels under 
                  4, 5 gold for level 4-8, and 8 gold for the rest. This money 
                  goes into a pool for each group, and the champion of the day 
                  will be rewarded from that pool. 
                <p> 3.) Test of Loyalty. Team Battle. Groups of 3 will fight to 
                  yield or last standing. This will be group vs. group, set up 
                  in levels 1-3, 3-6, 6-9, etc. The enterence fee per group below 
                  level 4 is 5 gold, levels 4-8 two platnum, and four platinum 
                  for groups above 8. This is going to be quite an event to win 
                  if enough people show up, and very worth it to win. 
                <p> 4.) Post tournament swill! We will all be drinking until we 
                  can no longer function properly. All are welcome to join us 
                  in blatant alcohol abuse. I know it sounds silly to get virtually 
                  smashed, but when enough players are stumbling about the tundra, 
                  it should be quite a blurred sight to see. We’re making EQ history 
                  here, so lets be original! 
                <p> As this event has already received many applications, please 
                  email <a href="mailto:l00ter@hotmail.com">l00ter@hotmail.com</a> 
                  with only the word "Tournament" in the email header. In the 
                  body of the email, include the participating character name, 
                  level and what events you wish to compete in. As there are only 
                  so many referees we have a limit to the number of participants 
                  so please register yourself early. 
              </blockquote>
              This looks to be a huge event--especially for you Celtic truebloods 
              out there. Thanks!

            <div> Tarsuril Elbereth sent us this announcement of a player event 
              taking place on the Test Server: 
              <blockquote> <b>Time:</b> Friday March 5 -- 10:00 pm MST / 9:00 
                pm PST <br>
                <b>Where:</b> Test Server, East Freeport, Velithe & Bardo's Imported 
                Goods<br>
                <b>What:</b> Hello my fellow Norrathians! My name is Tarsuril 
                Elbereth, but some of you will remember me as Tassader! In an 
                effort to have some fun and laughs, I'd like to invite everyone 
                to join me in spirits for what is sure to become a favorite social 
                event! This friday, I'll be hosting a pub night in Freeport! 
                <p> The purpose of the gathering is to meet your fellow players, 
                  and to raise a mug or two to the adventures we have had! I know 
                  many of you have only joined us for a few weeks, and now that 
                  you have had a good solid taste of the hack 'n slash, it's time 
                  to join me in some socializing! Come and have a drink or two, 
                  and tell your tall tales of battle, and your fishing stories, 
                  and share your secrets of the trade skills! If you have a song 
                  to sing, or a joke to tell, or just want to meet some people 
                  with your same level of experience, come on by! And don't forget 
                  to bring your interesting items that you'd like to trade or 
                  sell! 
                <p> The place to be is 'Velithe & Bardo's Imported Goods' located 
                  in East Freeport! It is literally around the corner from the 
                  Freeport Port, and the South Gate. It is a white and blue building 
                  located next to the 'Leather n Hide' and 'Trader's Holiday'. 
                  I've selected this as a central location. It has 2 fantastic 
                  bars, with the lovely O'Donner sisters tending bar. There is 
                  a banquet room on the second floor, and for those of you that 
                  get lucky, there are rooms you can rent on the 3rd floor! 
                <p> So come one and come all for a drink and merriment this Friday 
                  at 10:00 pm MST! If you are worried that your too poor to buy 
                  a drink, come say hello to me and I'll give you all you can 
                  handle!

            <div> Jia Ji sent us this information concerning <a href="http://eq.mgon.com/">Forever 
              Quest's</a> next event: 
              <blockquote> The <a href="http://eq.mgon.com/">Forever Quest</a> 
                project will be holding a test of our "epic" level quest system 
                through an event call the "Awakening." This epic quest is quite 
                different from the norm and we felt it necessary to provide a 
                brief explanation of the purpose, implementation, and a few guidelines 
                for involvement with this quest. 
                <p> <b>Time:</b> Thursday, March 4th, 3:00 PM CST to Sunday, March 
                  7th, 6:00 PM CST<div>
                <b>Where:</b> Fennin Ro, server wide<div> <b>Who:</b> FQ Staff, 
                FQ Facilitators, and all roleplayers<div> <b>Why:</b> To test 
                our "epic" level quest system and give Fennin Ro roleplayers the 
                opportunity to be involved in a server wide plotline 
                <p> <b>Quest:</b> Starting on Thursday, March 4th, 3:00 PM CST 
                  (NRP happy hour), the <A HREF="http://eq.mgon.com/heartstone/">Heartstone 
                  Saga</A> will officially launch into its "epic" level quest 
                  stage. During the Awakening, Forever Quest will try to provide 
                  to the best of its abilities, an immersive, server-wide, epic 
                  plot for the roleplaying enjoyment of Fennin Ro players. For 
                  four days, FQ staff and facilitators will be playing key characters, 
                  actively spreading their character beliefs, and running "task" 
                  level quests throughout the game world. 
                <p> <b>Player Involvement:</b> During this quest, player involvement 
                  will play a crucial role. All players are encourage to become 
                  actively involved by forming their own position of beliefs on 
                  Heartstone and roleplaying out that position. A "prestige" evaluation 
                  system will be used to select the most influential and active 
                  roleplayers during these four days. These players will be given 
                  the opportunity to become "key characters" in the Heartstone 
                  Saga. Examples of possible positions can be found in the <A
HREF="http://eq.mgon.com/heartstone/mythos/">Mythos</A> section of our site. Key 
                  characters are the essential driving force behind many subplots 
                  in our quests. They are considered influential people in the 
                  game world, using their powers to direct the future of Norrath. 
                  Examples of key characters include Jythri, Isara, and the numerous 
                  staff played key characters in previous quests by Forever Quest. 
                <p> <b>Additional Notes:</b> A <A
HREF="http://www.ji.nu/cgi-bin/webbbs/awakening.pl"
onmouseover="window.status='The Awakening Message Board'; return

                  All players are encouraged to use it for discussion of the quest, 
                  to ask questions, to share tales, to announce events during 
                  the quest, and to roleplay. FQ staff and facilitators will be 
                  using this board often during the quest.

                -------------------</font><div><font color=#a00000> 
                <p> Beginning tomorrow (Thursday March 4th) at around 11am PST 
                  we will begin conducting live tests of our billing system. What 
                  that will mean for you is that the next time you log in after 
                  we turn this on, you will need to enter your billing information. 
                <p> NO CHARGES WILL BE PUT ON YOUR CARDS - THIS IS A ZERO DOLLAR 
                  TEST. 
                <p> You will still see our pricing options, but ignore those dollar 
                  amounts as nothing will actually be charged to your card. We 
                  are merely doing a dry run of the system. Please select randomly 
                  from the different pricing plans. 
                <p> For those of you who do not have credit cards, you will be 
                  unable to play EverQuest for the remainder of the test. We apologize, 
                  but this is neccessary for us to test the functionality of the 
                  Billing System. 
                <p> The Credit Card you use DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THE SAME ONE YOU 
                  USED FOR THE PHASE 4 BETA. 
                <p> Also, we will be at times forcing people to resubscribe (maybe 
                  once or twice over the next week) just to shake out any problems 
                  with the billing system. 
                <p> The EverQuest Team

            <div> PSX.IGN has published a very brief blurb on the possibility 
              of EverQuest being ported to the PlayStation 2. No new information 
              is contained within, but here's the bulk of what is said: 
              <blockquote> We've recently heard rumblings that a version of EverQuest 
                is planned for the next PlayStation, which is definitely feasable 
                two-fold. Number one, 989 Studios has the rights to the game – 
                and as we all know, that company's hands are the closest to Sony's 
                cookie jar when it comes to developing and publishing games. And 
                number two, the "Next Big Thing" for console gaming is, of course, 
                online multiplayer. And what better way to extol the virtues of 
                the next system by exclusively releasing one of the biggest online 
                games in the world? </blockquote>

          EverQuest Guide Program</b></font> 
          <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 04:44 PM ET ] - <a href="mailto:den@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Den</a></font> 
            <div> Here's an in-depth overview of the EverQuest Guide Program, 
              as provided by Elder Guide Ozymandius: 
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000> <b>The EverQuest Guide Program</b></font><div><font color=#a00000> 
                For those of you that do not know, the EverQuest Guide Program 
                is a volunteer organization that is working in conjunction with 
                Verant's Customer Service group to support the players of Norrath. 
                The role of the Guides is "To support, educate, and direct the 
                customers of EverQuest to create an enjoyable and immersive Role 
                Playing experience." The Guides use their powers to resolve in-game 
                issues arising from bugs and reduce the damage done by such bugs, 
                preventing small anomalies from turning into large scale disasters. 
                This is done with as much role playing and as little focus on 
                the "mechanics" of the situation to reduce the impact to the "immersion" 
                factor of EQ. 
                <p> The Guides also provide information, but in such a way to 
                  encourage the customer to find out on their own, providing direction 
                  and education, not simply handing out facts. If the information 
                  is available in the manual or through simple exploration, the 
                  Guides will encourage such and not reveal the information directly. 
                <p> The Guides are not a shortcut, nor are they present to bypass 
                  any portion of the EverQuest gaming experience. If something 
                  can be found by walking around and looking for it, a Guide is 
                  not going to simply tell the player where it is. They do not 
                  spoil quests, nor do they fetch corpses unless these corpses 
                  were created as the DIRECT result of a bug. Having to go back 
                  into danger to retrieve your corpse is a fundamental part of 
                  the game, and one of the "penalties" for dying. The Guide Program 
                  is not here to circumvent that. 
                <p> To be a Guide requires a high level of commitment, creativity, 
                  maturity, and patience. Players rarely call us when they are 
                  happy, and they are frequently unhappy with the answers we provide, 
                  but that is not our job. We are not here to make the customers 
                  happy. We are here to make sure EverQuest runs smoothely, even 
                  the parts that the customers are not particularly fond of. The 
                  job entails a lot of abuse but is also a lot of fun. 
                <p> Guides will be required to sign a contract with Verant, making 
                  each Guide accountable for their own actions, so all Guides 
                  must be 18 years of age or older. This is a non-transferable 
                  contract, so Guardian's signatures will not be accepted. This 
                  is a requirement of Verant legal and not something that Verant 
                  or the Guide Program have a great deal of leeway on. 
                <p> Each Guide is required to commit no less than 10 hours a week 
                  to Guiding, and this Guiding is done on a server they do not 
                  have and never will have player characters on. Any time committed 
                  beyond the minimum 10 is appreciated but not required. 
                <p> If you are interested in becoming a Guide, please send an 
                  email to <a href="mailto:eqseniors@989studios.com">eqseniors@989studios.com</a> 
                  expressing that interest and we'll get a questionnaire out to 
                  you. The Questionnaire is a long list of questions and scenarios 
                  that gives the Guide Program some indication of how each candidate 
                  thinks. 
                <p> If you do not have a plethora of game knowledge, that is quite 
                  all right as the game knowledge section is not the most important 
                  part. We are looking for candidates that can express themselves 
                  clearly and intelligently using the written word, as that is 
                  the medium we use to communicate with the customer. Imagination 
                  and good judgement are also in high demand. 
                <p> Customers that run around asking for information from other 
                  players end up with their applications set aside and not reviewed. 
                  They either know the info or do not know it. Customers that 
                  constantly badger for replies on their application or re-submit 
                  their questionnaire over and over have their questionnaires 
                  put in the same place. 
                <p> There will be no reply to any questionnaire that is not accepted, 
                  and the length of time that it takes to process a questionnaire, 
                  especially with the new loads we've received, ranges from 2 
                  weeks to 2 months. Please be patient, as patience is one of 
                  the most fundamental requirements of any Guide. 
                <p> Not everyone gets to be a Guide, and far more applications 
                  are turned down than accepted, but those that make it in truly 
                  enjoy the experience.

            <div> Seven brand spankin' new game servers have made an appearance 
              today, giving us a taste of how many Verant plans on having up on 
              March 16th (a total of 12 now). Their names are, in no particular 
              order: 
              <ul>
                <font color=#a00000> 
                <li>Mithanial Marr

                <li>Karana 
                </font> 
              </ul>
              Each of the new servers only had around 7 to 11 players logged in 
              when I saw them on the server list, and I foresee some up and down 
              action throughout the day as Verant gets them situated. Thanks to 
              Tarny for pointing out the new servers to Cold Rain, who then in 
              turn informed me.

            <div> The following e-mail was just recently sent out by Verant to 
              those who applied to become a Guide for final release. 
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000> You sent in an email to us requesting 
                to be a Guide. As the Guide Program advances, the process by which 
                we bring in Guides must mature to make sure only the best candidates 
                are accepted. 
                <p> Please fill out the questionnaire below and reply to the address 
                  above. The Questionnaire will be reviewed and scored, and each 
                  candidate will be ranked. Those that score the highest will 
                  be contacted and brought in for further review. You will not 
                  be contacted unless you are being brought in, as there are simply 
                  too many applicants to individually reply to. 
                <p> Please answer the questions below as if you were the Guide 
                  in question. It is a given that you do not know all of the Guide 
                  rules, so answer as you best see fit, doing what *YOU* feel 
                  the Guide Program should do. This is a job application, so please 
                  treat it as such. 
                <p> If you are selected to be a Guide, you will be expected to 
                  commit to at least 10 hours of Guiding a week, in addition to 
                  any playtime you have with your other characters. 
                </font></blockquote>
              The letter was also accompanied by the aforementioned questionnaire. 
              You can click <a href="files/guide_q.txt">here</a> to read the questions. 
              Of course, only those who actually received the e-mail should send 
              answers back to Verant.

              <blockquote> Happy Hour- Sundays and Thursdays! <div> Announcing 
                the beginning of a new NR tradition, from the folks at <a href=http://norrathrp@norrathrp.com/>Norrath 
                Role-play</a>. Continuing this Thursday, we're encouraging roleplayers 
                across Norrath to visit their local in-game taverns and mix it 
                up with the locals over an ale or two. As we all know, tavern 
                talk is an important element in the high fantasy genre. 
                <p> A great way to build atmosphere, exchange juicy rumors, and 
                  get to know other roleplayers and their beloved characters. 
                  Hopefully, this will add a new dimension to gameplay and help 
                  people find good groups to adventure with. We're going to add 
                  two more times to the ones already posted, to try to involve 
                  people from Nebraska to Norway. The four times are as follows: 
                <p> Sundays 6pm C.S.T. and Sundays 6pm GMT (noon CST) <div>
                Thursdays 9pm C.S.T. and Thursdays 9pm GMT (3 CST) 
                <p> The next question is 'Where?' The answer is, wherever you 
                  want. Considerate it a quest to find the livliest tavern in 
                  town, any Thursday and Sunday. Invite some friends. Do whatever 
                  you can to bring this thing to life. 
                <p> I encourage everyone to take notice of Happy Hour. It is loads 
                  of fun! Also, you meet and make new friends, adventuring companions. 
                  I will also be keeping a journal of Happy Hour events that Elorebaen 
                  attends on the Journal page of the Bard's Tale section. I welcome 
                  any to send me a picture and a descriptive paragraph, including 
                  those who attended and where, to sauleth@norrathrp.com , concerning 
                  a Happy Hour they attended. I will post these submissions on 
                  the Journal page I talked of above. May we meet in Norrath! 
                <p> Stop in and have fun. It's Happy Hour. 
              </blockquote>
              Thanks Jason!

            <div> PC.IGN has published a new <a href="http://pc.ign.com/previews/2252.html">Phase 
              4 Preview of EverQuest</a>, which includes over 20 screenshots (some 
              of which are very cool) and 3 QuickTime movies. Here's a snippet: 
              <blockquote> The programmers have also finished a lot of the quests 
                that were missing in phase 3 (although, sadly, they still haven't 
                implemented any of the magical Monk headband quests past the orange 
                band). Phase 3 felt mainly like a hack-n-slash adventure as you 
                were basically delegated to the role of monster slayer extraordinaire. 
                Although the game still revolves around combat as a means to gain 
                experience (as most RPGs do), you can also gain experience by 
                completing certain tasks for NPCs. And it's much easier to actually 
                get a quest in phase 4 as the keywords to inquire about are now 
                enclosed in brackets. For example, a NPC might tell you "I need 
                the [potion of Azraguard] to continue my experiments on magical 
                weapon enhancement. Simply ask about the "potion of Azraguard" 
                and you might be given a clue as to where the concoction can be 
                located. </blockquote>

            <div> Reports of horses in EverQuest have been filtering in since 
              the middle of last week, the first of which was sent to me by Simeron. 
              Nobody knows whether or not they'll be ride-able by final release, 
              but as you can see by the following screenshot, this horse does 
              indeed have a name.

              Teleri recently sent me a second screenshot of a horse (again from 
              Faydark) as well as some speculation, which prompted me to post 
              this news update on the subject. 
              <blockquote> Now that they have released player controlled boats 
                ... I figured it wouldn't be long before we would have player 
                controlled horses. Well, what do I see tromping through Lesser 
                Faydark ... a horse. It wasn't player controlled but it was neat 
                to see that they are working on horses. 
                <p> This shot is a group of us in Lesser Faydark overlooking the 
                  Elf Bandit camp near the entrance to Steamfront. We were resting 
                  after a battle when this horse just walked through the Bandit 
                  camp.

              </ul>
              Nobody knows at this point whether or not this means we will be 
              riding horses by final release. We'll keep you informed as details 
              emerge.

            <div> A new <a href="maps_cities.shtml#fre">Map of Freeport</a> has 
              been published, which may now be found under our <a href="maps_cities.shtml">Maps, 
              Cities</a> section. The current map was created by the mapmaker 
              Keldric, and covers East Freeport. Keldric is hard at work with 
              the rest of Freeport, which should be uploaded within days. 
              <p> On a related note, I currently have many more maps in my possession 
                that I'm brushing up and verifying in order to ready them for 
                publication. We should hopefully have complete maps of all starting 
                cities up very soon.

            <div> Assistant Head GM Dave Rickey sent us this announcement, concerning 
              players impersonating GM's and Guides: 
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000> It has come to our attention that 
                some players have been claiming to be Guides and GM's, either 
                to trick people into /consenting them for a corpse recovery, or 
                to threaten disciplinary action. This is *not* acceptable behaviour. 
                *All* players are advised that a Guide or GM will have their name 
                in green in the game (assuming you have Player Names turned on). 
                Impersonating a Guide/GM will be subject to the *strictest* enforcement 
                and discipline. Also, no Guide or GM will ever ask to be /consented 
                unless they are investigating a bug that keeps you from looting 
                a corpse that is plainly visible and right in front of you.

            <div> Sauleth sent us a description of one of the first Norrathian 
              Happy Hours, which took place at the Heartwood Tavern. 
              <blockquote> A wonderful time was had by all! We shared Uuilanu's 
                mead, food, stories, rumors, and made some new friends. I learned 
                many interesting things(the mead has a way of loosening tongues) 
                and hope to see these friends as well as many others at the Happy 
                Hours in the future.
