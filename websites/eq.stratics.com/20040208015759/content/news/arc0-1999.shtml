                  <p> Letter from the Producer, Brad McQuaid: 
                  <blockquote><font color=000000> Welcome to the new EverQuest 
                    web site! 
                    <p> With commercial release of EverQuest just around the corner 
                      (March 16th), it's exciting to see everything rapidly coming 
                      together, including the new web site! As you've undoubtedly 
                      noticed, the guys who worked on it have done an incredible 
                      job, giving it an artistic quality matched only by the game 
                      itself. You've probably also noticed that the site is now 
                      hosted on Sony Online Entertainment's The Station, just 
                      as the Tanarus web site has been for some time. We look 
                      forward to working with SOE to provide you with all the 
                      EverQuest information you need. 
                    <p> As far as the game itself goes, we've just recently brought 
                      a new phase of testing online -- we like to call phase 3.5 
                      a beta of a beta. In other words, we're testing our final 
                      file formats and graphics data which will be used for phase 
                      4. Phase 3 continues, but we are allowing people to download 
                      phase 3.5 files if they so choose (and have the bandwidth 
                      and time) to help us get very ready for phase 4. This means 
                      we are currently running two servers, which also allows 
                      us some preliminary testing of the network code that handles 
                      multiple servers (which will be tested even further in phase 
                      4). 
                    <p> I've been very pleased with the beta test thus far, and 
                      look forward to seeing a lot of you in Phase 4 and even 
                      more of you in-game after release. It's taken a bit of time 
                      to get us where we're at now, but from my perspective it's 
                      definitely been worth it. The game is shaping into something 
                      far greater than I'd ever imagined - and I dream big. I'll 
                      see you in Norrath.

                  Guide Abashi on some of the rules that will govern the upcoming 
                  PvP-only server: 
                  <blockquote><font color=000000> Please don't call it a "chaos" 
                    server, as chaos implies no rules, no penalties. 
                    <p> A PvP server will simply mean that all people will be 
                      PvP+. This means the loot limits (one item), the level limits 
                      (+/- 4 levels), and benefits and penalties will still be 
                      applied. If you kill out-of-character it will indeed have 
                      serious reprocussions, though you will certainly have the 
                      *ability* to do so. 
                    <p> Also, like with PvP on any other server, there will be 
                      no experience or skill gain from PvPing.

                  was some dissent in response to Brad McQuaid's comments regarding 
                  a Roleplaying-only server (see below). Here's Brad's response, 
                  from the <a href="http://www.eqvault.net">EQ Vault's</a> message 
                  board: 
                  <blockquote><font color=000000> EverQuest is indeed an RPG, 
                    and in the context of your post, ALL the servers are RP servers. 
                    <p> EverQuest as it is now encourages role playing in many 
                      ways. A few examples would be the races and classes, the 
                      ability and advantages to grouping, the PvP switch, and 
                      the fact that dynamic quests and other special events will 
                      RP oriented. 
                    <p> Many people are concerned that their attempts to RP will 
                      be interfered with by those who choose not to RP. So they 
                      want an 'RP' server. And while I understand and even share 
                      their desires, there's really no way to enforce such an 
                      environment. 
                    <p> For example, we have neither the resources nor the desire 
                      to listen in on everyone's conversation and make sure they're 
                      speaking about in-game topics only. So we've provided an 
                      OOC channel (which you can turn off) and we encourage people 
                      to use it, and not the /say or /shout or /auction for out-of-character 
                      communcations. 
                    <p> I don't think anyone wants a 'Big Brother' totalitarian 
                      environment in which 'our' vision of RP is enforced upon 
                      the populace. (It's very likely you or someone else will 
                      strongly disagree with our strict vision).

                  <small><em><strong><font color="#804000" face="Arial"> Lately 
                  there's been a large surge in end-of-Phase3 PvP celebrations 
                  ("kill-fests" is more like it ;). Just to set your mind at ease 
                  on whether or not your Phase 3.5 character will be affected 
                  by PvP actions that take place involving your phase 3.0 character, 
                  we'd like to remind everyone that Guide Abashi has verified 
                  publicly on the <a href="arc0-1999.shtml" target="_top">QuestHall</a> 
                  that the 3.0 and 3.5 characters and servers are completely independent 
                  of one another. 
                  <blockquote><font color=000000> The mirroring was a *one-time* 
                    event that occured when the P3.5 server first came up. From 
                    that point forward, the characters will diverge based on how 
                    people play them. 
                    <p> We welcome anyone who would decide to test PvP to do so. 
                      We appreciate the effort. 
                    <p> -Abashi, Senior Guide 
                    </font> </blockquote>
                  To further dull the flames of doubt, here's a statement from 
                  Brad McQuaid that was sent to the folks over at <a href="http://www.notcrazy.com">NotCrazy</a>: 
                  <blockquote><font color=000000> No, when we split the servers 
                    we mirrored them that night. Since then, they are separate. 
                    </font></blockquote>
                  On a related note, here's an announcement of the PvP Server 
                  Petition: 
                  <blockquote> Tired of being the only one +PvP? Tired of having 
                    to sacrifice realism because of the Pk-Switch? Just wanna 
                    have fun like the good ol’ days? Well, this is your chance 
                    to voice your opinions. Today is the start of the PvP Petition, 
                    a petition to convince RedEye that a server with no Pk-Switch 
                    would be lucrative and fun for both the developers and the 
                    gamers. 
                    <p> Because of the strong stereotype that surrounds player 
                      killing, it is sometimes hard to realize what a PvP Server 
                      would actually entail. Imagine going out and killing other 
                      PCs of opposing races, then coming back to find that you 
                      are a hero in your home town. Or imagine having your favorite 
                      zone being invaded by an enemy race and having to defend 
                      yourself and your people. 
                    <p> You might be skeptical because of the abuse of mass-murdering 
                      power fiends. But because of the establishment of working 
                      factions, player will have a hard time mass-murdering. Rules 
                      will still be in affect, and a human that kills other humans, 
                      will soon find himself an outcast. 
                    <p> If you are still pessimistic, you have to realize that 
                      they ARE considering a PvP server, it is just up to us to 
                      respond. So please sign, and at least for the beta, we can 
                      play on a server that we control. <a href="http://pkeverquest.gamestats.com/petition.html">http://pkeverquest.gamestats.com/petition.html</a>

                  Finally, one more PvP event for your calander, from Simeron: 
                  <blockquote> The time of choosing approaches. When the gods 
                    will desend upon the face of Norrath and wipe it clean of 
                    all life. I speak of the great Pwipe at the end of times call 
                    P4. There will be a great battle fought in the wastes of Ro 
                    called the War of Ro. It will be fought between the evil races 
                    and the good with Ogre and Troll vs Dwarf and Wood Elf. Proud 
                    High Elves against their wicked Dark Elf kin. In the end, 
                    only one side will be left standing and thus, lay claim to 
                    the world. 
                    <p> (In short, many players will be going PvP and having the 
                      Mother of all Wars at the end of P4 as we are going to get 
                      wiped for public anyway.)

                  published last year. You can see the original graphic in full

                    The concept is very simple, everyone should take there character 
                    on the 3.0 server to the Priest of Discord and give him their 
                    PK note which they hopefully banked long ago. This is a once 
                    in a lifetime opportunity. Never again will we have an identical 
                    copy of our "real" character that we can turn PVP+ and have 
                    a lot of fun with. I know many people do not desire to "go 
                    red" with there "real" character as we know there is the possibility 
                    that you could be killed over and over again and be beaten 
                    down to an itemless shell of your former self (I fall into 
                    this category), but now we have been given the ultimate gift, 
                    a free copy of our totally decked out high level character 
                    that we can risk either destroying or making incredibly powerful 
                    with the treasures of others. Don't feel guilty for having 
                    all this fun, RedEye will finally get to see some high level 
                    PVP+ testing and receive invaluable /feedback from this event. 
                    The feedback I have received on this idea in-game has been 
                    very positive and I encourage you to help me get the message 
                    out to the masses. Warriors sharpen your swords, Wizards focus 
                    your minds, THE RED REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN! </blockquote>

                        are very understanding people... 
                      <li>Have the knowledge of html... People who know CGI and 
                        HTML will obviously be picked over the only HTML users 
                        unless I feel that, that person isn't qualified enough... 
                        *Note, if you only know HTML, don't worry, CGI isn't required. 
                        And you still have a good chance of making it. 
                      <li>Able to get information on EverQuest and will be playing 
                        either in Phase 4 or Public Release (need to be in Public.)

                  Preview</a> over at Altered Worlds. Here's a snippet from said 
                  article: 
                  <blockquote> As a few of you know who have been keeping in touch 
                    with EQ lately, Phase 3.5 of the beta has been released for 
                    download to all current Beta testers of 3.0. After downloading 
                    this fat mofo I quickly start it up and jump right in. First 
                    thing I notice is the world is a much brighter place now. 
                    Brighter in the fact that the textures have been incredibly 
                    improved upon. There is now detail and characteristics to 
                    items and the environment. You can see Dirt on the giant monolith 
                    structures outside of Felwithe was my first impression. The 
                    grass, instead of looking blurry now had more defenition. 
                    Everything looked much cleaner including Player character 
                    models. 
                    <p> Many of the bugs to this point had been fixed. I also 
                      noticed new paths throughout the Faydark areas making travel 
                      much easier so you didn't get lost quite as much. From what 
                      I hear, there were quite a few changes made to the discerning 
                      eye. Overall it was an impressive jump from one phase to 
                      the next and I greatly look forward to seeing how Phase 
                      4 looks. I can honestly say this game will put you in a 
                      whole new world. For those of you looking for the Halfling 
                      Pimp Class, i'm sorry but they haven't added that yet.

                    beta of a beta. In other words, we're testing our final file 
                    formats and graphics data which will be used for phase 4. 
                    Phase 3 continues, but we are allowing people to download 
                    phase 3.5 files if they so choose (and have the bandwidth 
                    and time) to help us get very ready for phase 4. This means 
                    we are running two servers currently, which also allows us 
                    some preliminary testing of the network code that handles 
                    multiple servers (which will be tested even further in phase 
                    4).</font> </blockquote>
                  And Jahmbo sent us this info on downloading the v3.5 client: 
                  <blockquote> The 3.5 build is posted. The latest patch sends 
                    down patch35.exe which gets the erst of the build. 300+ megs, 
                    expected to be large dowloads throughout testing. Just thought

                    on Monday, February 8th. This date was set a fair bit of time 
                    from now in order to let those who would support such a site 
                    to submit their bios, etc. prior to the Grand Opening in order 
                    to help get the site underway. With such a site, survival 
                    is not only dependant on a large number of visitors, but also 
                    on submissions. A hastily designed page has been posted to 
                    allow for submissions to commence immediately... and, of course, 
                    the more submissions the merrrier. This is not just another 
                    EQ site, nor an EQ news site (I think we all agree there is 
                    enough of them:), but hopefully will become, with help from 
                    the EQ community, not just a listing of EQ characters, but 
                    a fully informative "Who's Who of EQ" with full bios and journals 
                    (even contiuniung journals). No submission is too small, or 
                    too large (well, a War and Peace sized submission might clog 
                    my email account though:). So visit The Vellkellam Scrolls

                          as it contains thoughts and stories of Norrath, and 
                          shall continue to provide new fiction and insights as 
                          time goes on. Therein also lies a column entitled 'Ask 
                          Ardanna' in later issues. I thank thee greatly for thy 
                          time, and look forward to seeing thee in Norrath, and

                        message board, regarding the recent 989 Studios name change. 
                        Included is the full press release from the company formerly 
                        known as 989 Studios, now RedEye Interactive: 
                        <blockquote><font color=000000> The following is our official 
                          press release. If you guys have any questions at all, 
                          please don't hesitate to post -- I'll be around even 
                          more than usual to answer questions about this. Bottom 
                          line, though, is that it doesn't impact EverQuest in 
                          any perceptable way, rather it allows us as a new company 
                          to focus entirely on massively multiplayer games in 
                          the future, taking what we've learned these last couple 
                          of years and applying it to future titles. I'm very 
                          excited personally, because I want to be involved with 
                          this new emerging genre for quite some time.

                          <p> NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 18, 1999-- 
                          <p> - The Station@sony.com To Exclusively Distribute 
                            Online Games Titles To Be Available from RedEye Interactive 
                            - 
                          <p> Sony Online Entertainment Inc., a joint venture 
                            of Sony Corporation of America (NYSE:SNE) and Sony 
                            Pictures Entertainment, together with 989 Studios, 
                            a division of Sony Computer Entertainment America 
                            Inc., announced today they will make a strategic financial 
                            investment to help launch RedEye Interactive, a new 
                            independent online games development studio which 
                            recently spun off from 989 Studios. The terms of the 
                            agreement were not disclosed. 
                          <p> As part of the agreement, SOE will have exclusive 
                            online distribution rights for new titles developed 
                            by RedEye Interactive which SOE will distribute on 
                            The Station@sony.com, its leading online game network. 
                            RedEye Interactive will now focus on developing original 
                            titles for the growing online gaming market. 
                          <p> "This deal represents a major cornerstone in SOE's 
                            business plan as we'll have both a substantial stake 
                            in a cutting-edge development studio, as well as exclusive 
                            rights to distribute the studio's next-generation 
                            programming on The Station," said Lisa Simpson, President 
                            of Sony Online Entertainment (SOE). "The new titles 
                            being developed by the RedEye team will further strengthen 
                            The Station's gamer-focused SubStation and continue 
                            to make The Station the destination for game enthusiasts." 
                          <p> "SOE's investment in RedEye Interactive demonstrates 
                            our long-term commitment to The Station's growth and 
                            leadership in the gamer enthusiast arena," said Robert 
                            Gehorsam, SOE's Senior Vice President of Programming 
                            and Platform Development. "We're hopeful that RedEye's 
                            future titles will soon transform the gamer market, 
                            much as we've done with our JEOPARDY! Online properties 
                            in the casual gaming arena. The programming line-up 
                            of RedEye Interactive titles, combined with our current 
                            offerings - Tanarus, ChronX and Fantasy War - will 
                            clearly differentiate The Station and solidify its 
                            status as the premiere online game service." 
                          <p> RedEye Interactive will develop a slate of four 
                            online titles for exclusive distribution on The Station 
                            which may include role-playing and strategy games. 
                            The first title will be 989 Studios' EverQuest(TM), 
                            a massive multi-player role-playing game. The additional 
                            titles will be announced at a later date. 
                          <p> "SOE has built The Station as an impressive and 
                            reliable network able to meet the demanding needs 
                            of online games programming," said John Smedley, President 
                            and CEO of RedEye. "With SOE as development partner 
                            and publisher, we couldn't be in a better position 
                            to lead in this exciting and emerging genre." 
                          <p> "Our goal is to become the leader of massively multi-player 
                            online games," said Brad McQuaid, Vice President of 
                            RedEye, "and we feel confident that such a goal is 
                            very attainable."

                          <P>Quests, one of the most enjoyable elements of the 
                            roleplaying experience. Unfortunately, in most online 
                            game, Everquest included, players are not truly on 
                            an "everquest." Instead, quests are more like extra 
                            events tossed in. Most are automated with a few being 
                            run by GMs or players. Few of these last more than 
                            a few hours before they are over. Then players return 
                            to the daily routine of "leveling up" their characters. 
                            Does this sound like an "everquest" to you?</P>
                          <P>Introducing the Heartstone Project, an epic roleplaying 
                            experience. Here's a summary of the project.</P>
                          <P>In game:</P>
                          <P>The Heartstone Project will be gathering a sizable 
                            group of roleplayers on each game server. These groups 
                            will work together to provide a positive roleplaying 
                            experience through frequent quests. Each group will 
                            be sub-divided into different factions who will be 
                            working for different in character goals. Freelance 
                            players who are outside these factions will also be 
                            accepted. All these factions will be tied together 
                            with a common roleplaying plot that centers around 
                            the idea of Heartstone, a medium for providing an 
                            epic wide-scale quest system.</P>
                          <P>Heartstone is difficult to describe (for obvious 
                            reasons). Some factions believe it is a mythical, 
                            magical artifact with immense power. Other factions 
                            believe that it is the "heart" of Norrath, a physical 
                            representation of the lifeforce of the world. Others 
                            believe that it is a vile infection that threatens 
                            the safety of the world. And others have no idea that 
                            it exists. Some seek to control it. Some seek to protect 
                            it. Some seek to destroy it. Some have no idea what's 
                            going on.</P>
                          <P>Members of the Heartstone Project will be working 
                            with this central idea, adding their own ideas or 
                            putting a different spin on it. The idea was made 
                            to be as broad scope as possible, allowing many different 
                            roleplaying variants while still providing a central 
                            theme that connects a wide variety of players together.</P>
                          <P>Quests will be provided by the players, factions, 
                            and questmasters. In theory, there will always be 
                            multiple quests going on since interaction between 
                            the factions are considered quest themselves.</P>
                          <P>Web site:</P>
                          <P>The web site, currently found at <a
href="http://www.ji.nu/eq/">http://www.ji.nu/eq/</a> will be a central meeting 
                            place for all those involved in the Heartstone Project. 
                            It will also house the many stories, journals, song, 
                            artwork, etc. created by members. It will also provide 
                            an area for roleplayers, even those not involved with 
                            the project, to meet, discuss, and interact. Message 
                            boards, member pages, faction pages, stories, journals, 
                            chat rooms, searchable databases, artwork, fantasy 
                            fiction; you name it, we'll have it.</P>
                          <P>Now that you have a fairly good understanding of 
                            the project, you can decide for yourself if you want 
                            to help. Staff positions are now being accepted. Even 
                            if you do not decide to join the staff, all everquest 
                            players will be given the opportunity to be members

                        Liberty sent in the following, which should help clear 
                        up some of the concerns that a lot of you have been having 
                        regarding the security of Sony's application server: 
                        <blockquote> There are two issues regarding the beta sign 
                          up page security: 
                          <p> The first is that when you are on the page where 
                            you actually enter your credit card information your 
                            browser will report the page as insecure. This is 
                            because you are entering information into a SECURE 
                            FRAME inside of an INSECURE PAGE. This is a perfectly 
                            secure and acceptable way of handling this. To prove 
                            it, right click inside the form area and select open 
                            frame in a new window. You will get a new window which 
                            your browser will now inform you is secure. 
                          <p> The second issue is the warning you get about being 
                            transferred to a non-secure page after you enter the 
                            information. This is not a problem. Your information 
                            was transmitted securely, but the followup page on 
                            which you enter no information is not secure - it 
                            has no need to be.

                        We know that a lot of you are concerned with the beta

                        will be securely transmitted. We've contacted Sony and 
                        the rep that wrote back insists that their application 
                        site has a secure connection (Secure Sockets Layer--or 
                        SSL--version 3.0). Sony claims to be using RSA/RC4 encryption 
                        in order to keep your credit card account safe. 
                        <p> On the other hand, neither Netscape nor Internet Explorer 
                          reports the sign-up site as being secure, which is leading 
                          to many a tester's unease. The form itself is located 
                          on a secure web server (HTTPS), but it redirects you 
                          to a server that is reported by the browser as being 
                          unsecure. I have yet to see both NS and IE report a 
                          secure site as being unsecure. Apparently this is just 
                          one of those situations where you'll have to decide 
                          whether or not to take someone's--in this case Sony's--word 
                          for it.</p>

                        Zen Dikk informed us of this follow-up letter from 989 
                        Studios, which addresses two important issues: the exclusion 
                        of international testers and the timeframe for signing 
                        up. 
                        <blockquote><font color=000000> Dear Phase 4 Beta Applicant: 
                          <p> Several questions have been brought to our attention 
                            following yesterday's email. We felt it important 
                            to address these issues and to keep our future testers 
                            informed. 
                          <p> 1. International Customers - We value all of our 
                            customers, regardless of their location. We realize 
                            that by restricting Phase 4 of the EverQuest Beta 
                            test to US and Canadian residents, people outside 
                            this region are frustrated. Unfortunately, due to 
                            timing and cost limitations we simply were unable 
                            to accommodate you. We do apologize for this, and 
                            wanted to assure everyone that EverQuest WILL indeed 
                            be available internationally. 
                          <p> 2. Timing Issues - In order to ensure that all Phase 
                            4 CDs are sent out in sufficient time, it is necessary 
                            that you sign up by January 22nd. After that date, 
                            we will no longer be able to accept orders for the 
                            Phase 4 CD and the page will be removed. We will begin 
                            to process orders immediately and shipping of CDs 
                            should commence on January 27th. The test itself will 
                            begin February 10th and will continue until shortly 
                            before commercial release of the game on March 16th. 
                          <p> As always, we appreciate your willingness to help 
                            test EverQuest and to make it a revolutionary success. 
                            You have our commitment to keep you informed as we 
                            come closer to both Phase 4 and release.

                            choose your role, you define your destiny. But whether 
                            you make yourself a noble human knight, a vicious 
                            dark elf thief, a greedy dwarven merchant, or whatever 
                            suits your desire, remember one thing: You're in our

                        for entering Beta Phase 4 to those applicants who had 
                        been accepted. Here's a copy of the letter sent out today: 
                        <blockquote> <font color=000000>Dear EverQuest Beta 4 
                          Applicant: 
                          <p> The day has finally arrived -- it's time to sign 
                            up for the fourth phase of the EverQuest Beta Test. 
                            We appreciate your patience as we've worked hard to 
                            get the game ready for this monumental event. Phase 
                            4 will begin on February 10th,1999 and will be the 
                            final testing phase prior to commercial release. To 
                            receive your phase 4 CD in the mail, you will need 
                            to sign up for the beta at the following site: www.station.sony.com/everquest/beta 
                          <p> A valid credit card is required at sign up, and 
                            a fee of US$4.95 will be charged to your account to 
                            cover shipping and handling costs. Also, this page 
                            will ask you for a unique authorization code (appended 
                            to the bottom of this email). Unfortunately, due to 
                            timing constraints, this offer is only available to 
                            residents of the United States and Canada. 
                          <p> Please be aware that we aren't able to control exactly 
                            when you will get your CD. This could affect how long 
                            you will be playing. Also, realize this is a BETA, 
                            which means the game will have bugs and unforeseen 
                            problems (which is the whole point of conducting this 
                            test!). The purpose is to identify and fix problems 
                            before EverQuest is released. 
                          <p> Lastly, we make no guarantees that it will work 
                            with your system configuration.

                          played hours and hours of Diablo, and have been addicted 
                          to UO once upon a time. But those experiences just don't 
                          come close to this. It actually "feels" like a real

                        <blockquote> GUILD FORMATION: In order to form a guild 
                          the following process must be followed: 
                          <ol>
                            <li>The leader of the guild must email Eqguilds@sonyinteractive.com. 
                              The header of the email must contain the NAME of 
                              the guild. In this email the leader will include 
                              a short Charter that includes the guild's role in 
                              Norrath. In addition, the leader needs to list at 
                              least 9 other characters that have agreed to form 
                              this guild. 
                            <li>The leader and 9 other players need to email Eqguilds@sonyinteractive.com 
                              with the NAME of the guild as the header. The body 
                              of this email must include the name of the character 
                              that will be joining the guild and the ACCOUNT on 
                              which that character exists. 
                            <li>Once the 10 prospective members (including the 
                              leader) have completed the above steps, the charter 
                              and name of the guild will be reviewed by 989. If 
                              both are approved, the leader of the guild will 
                              be notified of approval via email and told to approach 
                              a GM for formation of the guild. If 989 has any 
                              reservations about either the name or the charter, 
                              the guild leader will receive an email listing these 
                              concerns and be offered an opportunity to modify 
                              the charter or name as required.

                          <p> Our sources at 989 Studios tells us that March 16th 
                            is the day that thousands of gamers Will lock themselves 
                            in the house for hours on end as this is the day that 
                            EVERQUEST will be shipping. EverQuest is thought to 
                            be the best upcoming game of 1999.

                        Remember that this is a tentative release date, and more 
                        than likely subject to change. </font></strong></em></small>

                        last night on one of the EQVault's message boards: 
                        <blockquote><font color=000000> We are finally able to 
                          announce some dates! Most of the announcements will 
                          go out tomorrow, but I had the chance to post them here 
                          tonight, and I know people have been waiting a long 
                          time, so here goes: 
                          <p> EverQuest will be released on March 16, 1999. 
                          <p> Phase 4 testing will begin early-mid February (I'll 
                            hopefully have a more precise date soon, but it should 
                            be some time between the 1st and 15th). 
                          <p> We will be sending out an email to all registered 
                            beta testers (yes, the one we had hoped to send out 
                            in early December) explaining how and where to sign 
                            up for Phase 4 next week. This will include pricing. 
                          <p> So there you have it. So far the beta test has been 
                            a huge success, and we appreciate both those who have 
                            participated, and patience of those who could not, 
                            who have been waiting. 
                          <p> Phase 4 is around the corner, and the release of 
                            the game around the next. It's a very exciting time 
                            for us, but at the same time there's still a lot of 
                            work to be done, and I and the team will deliver the 
                            game you all have been waiting for shortly.

                        Here's a snippet: 
                        <blockquote> Well, we've been getting lots of emails asking 
                          us what makes a good party in EverQuest, so I thought 
                          I'd focus on group adventuring in today's EverQuest 
                          update. Being 11th level now, I've had the opportunity 
                          to travel to nearly every corner of Norrath and meet 
                          several wanderers in the various lands in EverQuest. 
                          I've been in a lot of different parties and I've generally 
                          enjoyed the company of most of the beta testers I've 
                          meet online. Most are very helpful and are quite courteous 
                          to other party members. You do occasionally run across 
                          a kill-stealer or experience sapper, but this is more 
                          the exception than the norm. </blockquote>
