<p><b> Calendar / Mob lists ?</b></p>

<p>I remember when I first started EQ bout 4 years back the Berthall was a very important place.  You came here to find out what guilds were available and how to contact them; what local news was happening within our community, and to view and or schedule events for your guild on the handy calender.  Most of this is still available to us, and I thank those have made it possible all these years.  Yet I feel theres a need for Bertoxxulous to come together and play the game Everquest with a sense of Harmony that has slowly disappeared since 1999, and I believe Berthall is the key to make that work. <br />
<br />
A lot of higher level guilds are competing with each other every day on EQ.  While some of the methods used to push a guild ahead are fair and just others appear to be shady or lack any kind of consideration for an entire guild of people who are trying to enjoy the game as well.  I've noticed other servers use mob lists and calendars to organize sets of mobs and cycles between guilds so that coexistance is possible between 2 3 or even 4 guilds who are at the same level in the game.<br />
<br />
I've noticed that recently the calendar for Hate was cut, and that worries me because those were the only zones in the game that were uncontested for a period of time.  You knew; if your guild was scheduled for Hate that day that it was yours and the community recognized that and respected it.  This allowed a guild authority to have greater focus on the workings of the raid, and a guild population to focus and work as a team.  <br />
<br />
Not having to worry about guild X steamrolling you is a comfortable feeling I assure you.<br />
<br />
There are some that think mob lists/calendars aren't possible in zones outside the planes due to the nature of the spawns, but I have seen it done and there is something to be learned.  If your clearing an entire zone only to turn around and do it 2 days later so that your rival guild doesn't excel any further then your not playing on Bertoxxulous.  I have always thought this to be a server where we the player characters fight together against the NPS's.  If you want to contest yourself, your class, race or guild against others that is by definition a PVP action; PVP servers are available.  Just because you can destroy a zone doesn't mean you should.  Two or three sets of yard trash and key mobs cycled between guilds in a competitive zone would allow the respect between those guilds to grow.  At the same time a complete set of spawns without fighting or tactless actions saves enough time to equip an entire guild over.<br />
<br />
Its not a matter of possibility; I've seen it work fluidly.  Its a matter of sacrafice that each guild suffer the loss, and work together to create a mutual respect between guilds that allows all to enjoy the game. I've seen Berthall publish this theme; its clearly shown in their efforts to create this community page.  Its where we come to catch up on community news, find a guild, and maybe post new ideas on what mob lists/calendars can do to make Bertoxxulous a better place to log-in.<br />
<br />
Its up to you all <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br />
<br />

(btw: I am member to no guild that demonstrates these actions.  My family, Deadly Sins, fell on its own accord for reasons totally separate.  It is in my search for a new guild that I saw this competition, and chose no "high level" guild at all rather than line myself up for battle with guild X in zones like Ssra.)<br />
<br />
Thank you</p>

<p>The calendar was created for the community. The community has made it work for all these years. And now, the community has decided that it is time for Hate to be removed from the calendar. They did so in a manner that mature, with discussion and points of view. The only outstanding issue was when it would actually be removed, and we, as the mods and admins of Berthall, came up with a compromise that most seem willing to accept, even with their reservations.<br />
<br />
Looks to me like they did come together with a sense of harmony. It hasn't disappeared, but is right there.<br />
<br />
And Fear is still on the calendar. For the moment.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I was referring to zones like Ssra, ToV, VT, and possibly higher tier planes depending on the competition for them.  The plane of hate is not where the conlict is.  That might have been because the calender was in place, but now the zone is designed for a different purpose; I understand that.  Guilds fight for the Emp and other named spawns in different zones and it just seems like a waste of time.  Seen other servers handle it by cycling the mobs between the guilds, and it worked bottom line.  I apologize for any confusion, and the double post; just thought there might be a better way in game.<br />

I don't like monthly calendars for everything.  i don't like rotations etc.  i've tried them.  Theyre lame and prevent people from doing things for month.<br />

If you want Ssra loot.  Make sure yer guild is there on pop.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Zones that contain hotly contested spawns:<br />
<br />
Kael<br />
Temple of Veeshan<br />
Ssra Temple<br />
Vex Thal<br />
Iceclad Ocean (Lodizal)<br />
Kedge Keep (Phinny for epic stuff)<br />
<br />
Give it a few months and Im sure Plane of Fire, Water, and Air can be added to the list.<br />
<br />
I dont advocate any calendar system, but I can see someone trying to make the case to put these zones on the calendar.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

hahaha, a mob that can be killed with 3 or less players on a calender.  Do you propose guilds make reservations, or can me and a buddy or 2 make the reservation?  If so can you even imagine the waiting list?  It would easily be booked for next 3 years.  Just because it's highly contested doesn't mean it should make it on a calender.  I think a basic requirement for a calender system is the mob requires a raid force to kill.  And in any case I'm not a big fan of calenders anyway.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Bertox would never conform to a calender for any of those places, it's not feasable for a server with the types of guilds we have.  <br />
<br />
I'd like some of what your smoking though.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

Calendar or no, for many things, it's been FFA.  We arent like others that have rotations for kunark dragons even to this day, etc.<br />

A few things were reservable but, quickly outdated.  <br />
