<p><b> Heh they were talking about this on one of the radio stations I listen to this mornin</b></p>

<p>Apparently the makers of this video were arrested. The DJ's talking about it were not sure of the specific charges but the one thought it had to do with the fact they were staging illegal fights. <br />
<br />
I guess a couple of the bums in this got really messed up doing the stunts. They were talking about how there was a scene that one guy got pushed down a huge set of stairs in a shopping cart. Apparently one of the bums got a leg broken doing the stunts. <br />
<br />
The one DJ said he thought it was cool & wanted to get a copy of it because he was formerly a homeless person & he would have done something like this in a heartbeat at the time.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>If you watch some of the clips, there's one of two bums fighing and one gets a broken ankle.  The other is like "what's his problem?  I'll show him a broken ankle.." and picks up a maul axe<br />
<br />
The clip with the crackhead is funny, too<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p><b> heh</b></p>

<p>Nothing too shocking, I see this kind of thing (bums fighting) happen relatively often in downtown toronto...<br />
<br />
<br />
I noticed some of the 'swarms' in the vid trailer and just wanted to share a little perversion...<br />
<br />
When i see 1 person (bewildered, bloody face) getting swarmed by 5, 6, even more people all too happy to smash his face in even more...there's something wrong with that picture to me...I hate seeing that 'zerg' attitude irl...where once the guy is incapacitated, then it's all well and good to bring you and your family to break a few of his ribs.<br />
<br />
I'm of the mindset that stops people from doing that....nothing sweeter than wiping that disgusting 'oh man let's 9 vs one this ass!' smirk off the faces of some people...<br />
<br />
disturbing? yes<br />

<p>Talk about lame.  The whole thing.<br />
<br />
Far as the whole zergling thing goes... about a year ago, I was working a Thursday night at the bar.  It being fall time, and the college kids just getting back into town... well... it was a busy night.  That and it was a military pay week, so the usual tools from the AFB and Army Base were there.<br />
<br />
I'm serving up drinks, when I notice an inordinate amount of people staring out the window facing the alleyway.  I go out the back door to see whats going on.<br />
<br />
There, in the alley, were four AF punks beating a homeless eskimo man into the street, because they thought it was funny.  The look on their faces as my billy club cracked them each in the grill was priceless. <br />
<br />
Only thing that matched it was the incredulous look from their NCOIC who was in the bar watching them get beat down by someone who didn't appreciate their sort of entertainment.  Only thing about him was he was smart enough not to join his troops in the local ER that night.<br />
<br />
Shit like that has no place anywhere.<br />
<br />

<p>wholeheartedly jveign...<br />

I lived in malta for a while a few years ago...and an 'arab' tourist was there - there's some bad blood I believe between maltese people and 'arabs' (along with some hefty racism /sigh) but anyway...this kid, couldn't have been more than 13...a male in his early teens...Everyone on the bus watched (and some cheered...ugh) as the driver through him (literally) off the bus and started kicking him in the face on the floor...that was my first encounter with that kind of emotion heh...I didn't know what to do with it, now I do :P<br />

<p>I won't even go into the "mob mentality" in Europe/Southeast Asia...<br />
<br />
Let's just say thank God the police presence in Munich in the Studenstat(sp?) district is heavy.  If not I'd most likely have ended up in prison for killing a half dozen german youths who decided a turkish girl's head was a soccer ball.  As it was, I doubt those boys have ever laid another hand on someone else in a violent manner again.  Having someone grab the biggest guy in their little group, throwing him on the ground, and stomping his balls into mush most likely cured them of that.<br />
