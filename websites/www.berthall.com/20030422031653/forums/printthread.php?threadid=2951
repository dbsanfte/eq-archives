1.37a Version notes (PENDRAGON ONLY)</b></p>

<p>These are Pendragon only.  I'll try to test these at some point this weekend.  Remember that anything and everything about them can change before going live.<br />
<br />
<i>REALM VS. REALM FIXES AND ADDITIONS<br />
<br />
Here is a short description of Realm points, levels, and titles. There are 100 total realm levels, which are sub-divided into 11 ranks, each of which has a title and potentially a gift associated with it. When you gain your first Realm point (by engaging in RvR combat), you will be promoted to Rank 1, level 1. As you continue to fight in RvR, your next level will be Rank 1, level 2, and so forth. When you gain Rank 1, level 9, your next level gain will promote you to Rank 2, level 1. At Rank 2, you will gain a Realm Rank and a new title. You will gain these new titles and ranks at levels 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 70, 80, 90, and 100. So, you must be 10th Realm Level (Rank 2) before you will see your Realm Title change. <br />
<br />
Starting with this version, when you gain a Realm Rank, you will gain a 1 point bonus to each of your specializations per Rank. So, a player of Realm Rank 5 would have a total of +5 (i.e. one per realm rank) to all his skills. A maxed out RvR player would have a +10 to all skills. Please note that this acts just as if that player has a magic object that "buffs" skills - i.e. you will not get abilities awarded to you because of the bonuses, but for combat and other calculations, the buff will be included in the formula.<br />
<br />
In the (near) future, we plan on having a slightly more robust Realm Rank gifts, where you gain cash rewards for RvR combat, and at some point after that, additional skills and abilities. We'll give you all more information about that when the time comes.<br />

<p><b> 
part duex</b></p>

<p>- You can now select and destroy Relic Keep doors.<br />
<br />
- Siege weapons can now be repaired using the "/repair" command.<br />
<br />
- Magical effects such as stun and mesmerize now "remember" if they have been cast on a player, and if cast again, the spell will last for a shorter duration than the first instance of the spell. This will affect combat vs. monsters as well.<br />
<br />
- You will now come out of hiding when you use the "/repair" command, if you are in stealth mode.<br />
<br />
- Repairing a door now takes 20 seconds to go through the entire repair cycle. Previously, it took 5 seconds, which enabled one or two players to hold off many enemy players attacking the door.<br />
<br />
- Guild Realm Points will now be tracked properly, and won't reset randomly. You'll notice that your guild's Realm Points will be adjusted as members log into the game<br />
<br />
- Keep doors should now be properly synchronized across all people's computers. Previously, some players would see doors open, when in reality they were closed.<br />
<br />
- When low level mage characters cast mesmerization and stun spells on higher level-characters and monsters, the spells used to last as long as if a high level mage cast the spell. Now, the duration of the mez/stun will lower based on how much lower level the mage is than the target.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p><b> 
Part 3</b></p>

<p>OTHER NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br />
<br />
- All outdoor zones for all realms have new pathing data, which means that pets, monsters and NPCs should now enter and move around buildings and structures properly. This fixes problems like pets going the "wrong" way around a building when following you, refusing to enter a building with you, or moving in an erratic fashion near objects.<br />
<br />
- If you are hidden, monsters are now much less likely to target you than other group members, although they still have a chance of "finding" you.<br />
<br />
- Heal spells should no longer be castable on dead player bodies.<br />
<br />
- The "anonymous" flag no longer resets on quitting or zoning.<br />
<br />
- There's now a confirmation dialog on Emblemeers and Smiths, which ask you if you are sure you want to purchase the emblem/repair the object.<br />
<br />
- When you are missing an ingredient when making an object, the game will now list ALL the ingredients you are missing.<br />
<br />
- Most NPC dialog will now print money in terms of units of currency, not just copper. Previously, you would see "50099 copper" - now that is translated into gold, silver, copper, etc.<br />
<br />
- Condition and durability has been tweaked so that generally speaking, items now last longer (i.e. have greater durability), but need to be repaired slightly more often.<br />
<br />
- Items with qualities below 90 will no longer salvage for the same amount of raw materials as higher-quality items.<br />
<br />
- When you get a dialog box prompting you for resurrection, you now must acknowledge it within 15 seconds. If you don't, the resurrection spell must be recast.<br />
<br />
- Berserker Frenzy now grants a "to hit" bonus and can be used every 7 minutes (used to be every 10 minutes).<br />
<br />
- You can no longer "/upgrade" non-door objects. Due to a bug, you were able to upgrade all wooden objects (bows, staves, etc.), even though it was not cost-effective to do so.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p><b> 
Part 4</b></p>

<p>WORLD NOTES<br />
<br />
Midgard Quests:<br />
<br />
Quest: Zrit-Zrit's Item quest:<br />
Gautr in Gotar now correctly refers to Zrit-Zrit as a badger, not an offspring of a bear. Gautr also gives a direction and a reference point in Skona Ravine to help find Zrit-Zrit. Also, Zrit-Zrit is no longer quite so shy, so players should be seeing him more often.<br />
<br />
Quest: Krrck's Torment:<br />
The directions given out by Arnleif in Vasudheim for Krrck's location are now included in the quest journal.<br />
<br />
Quest: Tomte Jerkin quest:<br />
The quest is now available to all classes. A Tomte Tunic has been added for runemasters and spiritmasters. Runemasters and Spiritmasters who have already received a Jerkin can return to Gwaell in Audliten to exchange it for a Tomte Tunic. The tunic has the same stats at the jerkin; the only difference is the material.<br />
<br />
Albion Quests<br />
<br />
Quest: Abolishment of Sacrifice.<br />
Players who were stepped to step 7 and did not receive the sub-quest (Deserter Amono) can return to their Camelot trainer to receive this quest. Players who were stepped to step 10 and did not receive the sub-quest (Point of Reason) can return to their Camelot trainer to receive this quest.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p><b> 
Part 5</b></p>

<p>Players who were stepped to step 12 and did not receive the sub-quest (Chains of Death) can return to their Camelot trainer to receive this quest.<br />
<br />
Quest: Legend of the Lake.<br />
Players who were stepped to step 3,4,7 or 8 and did not receive the sub-quests (Barbaric tales) or (Wizard Lost) can return to Lady Nimue to receive one of these quests.<br />
<br />
Quest: Rebellion Accepted.<br />
Players who were stepped to step 5 and did not receive the sub-quest (Path of the Renegade) can return to Captain Rhodri to receive this quest<br />
.<br />
Players who were stepped to step 7 and did not receive the sub-quest (Regal Nobility) can return to Captain Rhodri to receive this quest.<br />
<br />
Quest: Scura tragedia.<br />
Players who were stepped to step 7 and did not receive the sub-quest (La morti parla) can return to Master Vismer to receive this quest. Players who were stepped to step 9 and did not receive the sub-quest (Animare il morti) can return to Master Vismer to receive this quest. Players who were stepped to step 11 and did not receive the sub-quest (Legione perso) can return to Master Vismer to receive this quest.<br />
<br />
Albion Monster Encounters:<br />
<br />
- The vigilis in the Catacombs has a slightly longer range on his bow. Additionally, it will now run after those who confront him. <br />
<br />
Hibernia Monster Encounters:<br />
<br />
- Some of the heavy-drinking cluricaun have found abandoned homes in Connacht that they now use for their wild parties. They have sent messengers out to their kin to join them and are waiting them to arrive later this week.<br />
<br />
Midgard Monster Encounters:<br />
<br />
- Forest spiders in Vanern swamp spawn in daytime as well as night. They have also received an appropriate poison attack.<br />
<br />
<br />
MAGIC SYSTEM NOTES<br />
<br />
- Tuesday's announced Paladin change (removing the ability to "twist" chants), has been revoked. Paladins will be able to continue twisting while we continue to examine its effect on gameplay.<br />
<br />
- Bladeturns can now be penetrated by attacks from higher level monsters and players. The chance of the bladeturn deflecting a higher level attack is approximately the caster's level / the attacker's level. This change actually went in a few weeks ago, and was undocumented, for which we apologize. Please be aware that everything in the game is level/chance based - nothing works 100% of the time in all cases. It was a bug that caused it to work 100% of the time - now it takes the levels of the players involved into account.<br />
<br />
- Sorcerer and Cabalist DoTs no longer stack, due to feedback from testers on Pendragon that this combination was much too powerful. We will look at ways to address this problem and make Cabalist and Sorcerer Spec line DoTs stackable in the near future.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Yeah, archers must be so f***ing pissed that they now have a chance to penetrate Bladeturn spells.  And, of course, no one hanging around ganking people from the shadows is going to like the bonuses that Realm points are starting to give.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I'm glad they are fixing that bug where a monster targeted you when you were hidden.  That was way too annoying in groups when I'd be hidden to backstab a mob and if we had an add it would run straight to me.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>The mez/stun fix is huge!<br />
<br />
Converting the coinage out of copper is also pretty big in my book too.  <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

Lots of good stuff, with more on the way I'm sure.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->
