<br />
This school had guards btw.<br />

I just say this stuff in berthall (and lace it with hidden cyber messages) then when I log on I have all this new loot; so then I just log back off feeling content and do the whole cycle again tomorrow.  I've got it down to a f*ing science at this point(pun intended!).  So please don't belittle my high-brow cyber prostitution by referring to it as cybering; it makes us both look cheap.

<p>From the report, it looks more gang related than anything else. Still sad.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Not as uncommon as you might think.  An excerpt from a research paper im writing that includes the topic:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="1">quote:</font><hr>October 1st, 1997, 16 year old Luke Woodham kills two students in Peal, MI.  Two months later on the first of December, 16 year old Michael Carneal kills 3 and wounds 8 others in his school in West Paducah.  The next year on the fourth of March, 13 year old Mitchell Johnson and 11 year old Andrew Golden kill 4 students and one teacher, wounding 15 others in Janesboro, AR.  May 21st of that year, Kip Kinkel (15) opens fire in his high-school the day following the night he kills both his parents in Springfield, OR (Merida 14).  What really grappled the public’s attention making many aware of the problem of youth violence as a possibility of being shaped by popular media was the situation that occurred at columbine high school.  April 20th 1999, 18 year old Eric Harris along with 17 year old Dylan Klebold opened fire in Columbine High School, killing 13 people with semi-automatic weapons and explosives.  Authorities say that they believe Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were aiming to kill many more than the 15 including themselves (Merida 14).<hr></blockquote><!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>No offense Plaz, but Luke Woodham was from Pearl High School, Mississippi. So it should say Pearl, MS.<br />
<br />
Just FYI <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

You sound like those people who apoligize when they they walk in the way of another person by accident.<br />

Anyone else notice how people apoligize for anything <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>In some cases I would say you're right, but people on this board are so anal retentive about you correcting them, figured I'd try and mellow it out a little just so Plaz didn't think I was trolling him. I'd hate to see him get a bad grade on his report because of incorrect information.<br />
<br />
Of course, the anal retentive trolls still came out and had to say something about me showing some common courtesy. <img src="/forums/images/smilies/chomp.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>
