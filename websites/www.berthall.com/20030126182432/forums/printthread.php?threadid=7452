<p><b> Video lag, memory workarounds, etc</b></p>

<p>/em sighes<br />
<br />
ever since PoP came out, something in its code has caused me massive video lag to build up and eventually crash me out.  once out of EQ, the lag issue goes away and if i log back in i am fine for the moment.  <br />
<br />
i posted up my problem to VI's tech support page as well as a bunch of info they wanted, and needless to say they havent responded.<br />
<br />
i have tried everything i can think of, and nothing has worked so far.  a friend suggest i do some workaround for Win98 and memory (i have 512meg ram) but i cant find any work around besides MS saying to disconnect ram over 512 megs.<br />
<br />
someone (not VI related) posted on my Tech Request post and said i needed to reformat my hard drive and reinstall Direct X because some system registry problem was causing Direct X to not run (even thou it never was a problem before PoP).  i tried installing the DirectX 8.1 and it seemed to go fine, but this guy informed me that i cant just install but have to reformat (which i am really loath to do).<br />
<br />
any suggestions and help would be greatly appreciated.  the video lag (and having to relog every hour) is beginning to take the enjoyment out of logging in to play <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
thanx in advance<br />

<p>For what it's worth, and it may be completely unrelated to the problems you're having, but rumor has it they broke serverfiltering recently, so if it's a problem that occurs more when you're around a lot of people rather than just a gradual buildup over time of lag, that may be part of it.</p>

<p><b> I get the same problem...</b></p>

<p>Not every night, not every zone, but there are some nights when what feels like video lag just seems to get worse every time I zone until I finally give up and relog. When I say video lag, I mean the unresponsive cursor, the "chunking" when I move, etc. Most often I notice it when I have to run through several zones to get to where we will be hunting, and when I get there, a normally lag-free zone is just unplayable. At this point, if I shut down EQ and restart it I can log back in and everything works just fine. I've never noticed this problem building up over time in a single zone, it seems to get worse each time I zone. <br />
<br />
I'm running XP Pro, so apparently its not O/S dependant... I am also  somewhat sceptical of the suggestion to reformat your drive, it seems like there should be a better solution than that. Perhaps we should compare hardware and drivers to see if there is a common thread there? <br />
<br />
What it acts like to me is some component, somwhere in the mix, is allocating texture space and not releasing it when its done, so either EQ is leaking memory, or Direct-X is... Now, the fact that I can close out EQ and restart it and the problem goes away makes me think that DX is cleaning up after itself just fine, which leaves only 1 culprit... You mention disabling memory over 512, so I assume you have a high-memory system, as do I (1 Gig of Ram). Can I also assume that you run full graphics, and texture cache off? I wonder what percentage of the population does this, and if they get the same problem...<br />
<br />
Think I'll try running perfmon tonight and see if I can log what's going on with memory over time... May provide some insights...</p>

<p>Guy I can tell you what it is... It happened on my freinds computer every time i played EQ<br />
Running ME<br />
<br />
Your memory management is messed up... with your RAM<br />
<br />
when you zone the new zone is suppose to be loaded up into your ram and the old zone erased ect ect each time you zone but for some reason windows doesn't want to erase your old zones so they stay loaded on there and it keeps buidling up until you Run out of RAM  eventually on my freinds it would get so bad that it would just freeze or i'd move stop for 5 mins move again stop ect ect..<br />
<br />
<br />
I figured this out when running a memory manager program and while playing EQ i went from 100ram free to 2mb free after 5 zones and i had to log for video choppyness<br />
<br />
When It happens a lot on the newer windows models after 98   currently i'm using 98 and having no problem.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't tell you how to fix it because i never figured out how too. but if you know what the problem is i guess someone else might be able to.<br />
<br />
sorry for any grammer or spelling its 3am and i didn't feel like editing</p>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>as far as what i run, i have turned off all of the new models, turned the clipping plane off.  sky details off.  basically anything i can think of to lessen the memory required to run the program.<br />
<br />
i have to agree that after messing with my comp and the software on the comp, i have come to believe that something in the PoP coding is causing the problem.  i have talked to several people that are having problems (LD and video lag are the two most common).<br />
<br />
i am going to borrow a friends old comp and see if that stops the problem.<br />

<p><b> ...</b></p>

<p>Well, I get home and get the perfmon logging going, set up the logfile, etc... Go to log in to EQ and I realize its patch day, cool... <br />
<br />
Log in my chanter and proceed to run all over creation for the next hour or so; PoK porting to various cities and checking out the surrounding zones... I even ran out to the zone most notorious for setting off my lag-tailspins: Jaggedpine Forest. Everthing worked just fine, no cumulative lag whatsoever... Finally I gave up and went to PoD for a while.<br />
<br />
Checked the perfmon log after I logged out (I forgot it was still running while I was XP-ing), and memory usage jumped around a bit as I went zone to zone, but no cumulative rise in memory usage was evident.<br />
<br />
So, for me at least, I believe (hope) the most recent patch fixed whatever was going on... Hopefully you'll get similar results, Pang...</p>

<p><b> Many Strange things since PoP</b></p>

<p>I had a similar problem with the video lag, when I turned off 32 bit and went down to 16 bit under display options, the lag never came back. However, I have also been having problems with lag spikes. Center percentages will act normal for a while, then shoot up to 50% with a broken yellow and red bar which will correct itself with a reboot. I don't know what's up with that, but I can't do anything when it happens, much less twist songs. <img src="/forums/images/smilies/chomp.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>when i first started playing tues after the patch, the lag seemed to have cleared up.  then i went with my guild and hit a little dragon and the lag returned.  by the time i got the lag under control (starting getting bad as we gathered and buffed) they had pulled him, killed him, and were awarding loot.  THEN i got the raid exp message LOL.<br />
<br />
i have given up on VI trying to fix the problem and eagerly await my buddies old comp (gotta UPS it to me).<br />
<br />
i am at 16bit color and it hasnt changed anything unfortunately. the video lag i get seems to have no relation to the %bars on top of the screen.  the EQ tech boards have quite a few people posting about similar problems so i got a feeling that somehow a piece of hardware on my comp is having problems with a piece of coding from VI.  now i just gotta figure out which one.<br />

<p>I have had that problem in the worst sort of way for a while - bugged it etc.<br />
<br />
Some info: Running Dual Athalon 1800 on an ASUS motherboard, 1 Gig DDR Ram, Geforce 3 TI500. Windows 2000.<br />
<br />
My friends run the same drivers, OS, and graphics card with NO problems.<br />
<br />
What I notice is that if I zone when particle effects are visible, I will likely have the lag problem within one or two zones. If the destination zone has the annimated trees, I will likely have the lag problem. If I turn off all particle effects, it may take me 5 or 6 zones before the problem happens. If I stay in zone with particle effects, within a couple of hours I usually have a minor version of the problem. If I have particle effects off, it may go 4 or 5 hours in zone before I have the problem. The sound has the same problem as the video (even the sound player will do the start/stop 1fps stuff.)<br />
<br />
Also - resetting back to character selection does not solve it, but resetting back to server selection does. (Which goes along with the idea that it is the zone information loading sequence.)<br />
<br />
I had assumed that the dual processor was causing some kind of multitasking problem with the drivers, but hearing other people have the problem (and this sounds like the exact same problem) makes me feel better. Hopefully they can find their memory leak.</p>

<p>that poster above me just stated what i tryed to describe as me... but did it much better...  <br />

like i said i'd check your memory management if i was you</p>

<p>there a few freedownload site.. zdnet and cnet where you can download programs that monitor how much memory you use.... you might actually have to pay a few bucks to actually get the feature included that manages it for ya.<br />
<br />
so you maybe have to many programs running inthe back ground on start up...<br />
<br />
goi to run in the start menu... and type msconfig startup tab and uncheck all the boxes you don't need. which pretty much is everyhting... but just pick and choose<br />
<br />
makes start up faster too <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>i see  im not the only person with these problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, I have the same problems in luclin and pop zones.  I hate zoningi n these expansions because i KNOW im going to need to camp to desktop to fix it (actually just server select menu).  <br />
<br />
<br />
Tech support never got back to me (What a surprise).  The problem is like the old bug upper guk had where sometimes if you zoned into it from lguk it would be extremely video laggy etc.  the lag gets progressively worse and worse...  Not a shabby pc either<br />
<br />
<br />
athlon 800, 512 ram, geforce 3 .... <br />
<br />
nothing great but its up to par...<br />
<br />
Wish i knew what caused it, its quite annoying.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Well, I finally got my lag bar issue under control. What did I do you say? Ditched Win2k for Win98. Gave up some video performance with those new Detonator drivers, but heck, least I can twist 3 songs now instead of one every 5 minutes <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""> .</p>
