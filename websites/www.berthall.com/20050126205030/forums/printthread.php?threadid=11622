<p><b> Respectable mid level guild for 40'something necro.</b></p>

<p>Sup all,<br />
<br />
Basically because of work I had to quit my Prophecy recruitment, and give up on the monk for a while.  I am working on about 1-2 hours a night of play time and lfg with a monk for 95% of the time I am on doesnt work well. <br />
<br />
A buddy had a female iksar necro that I Took over since he quit, and is level 44, my question is do you guys have any recommendation for a good mid level guild, <b>raids unimportant to me at this time</b> , but maybe just a group of people who do ldon, and hunt together.  I like what was said earlier, only have a couple hours if that a night to play and I feel lonely with out the guild spam I have grown to love. =( /hugs.<br />
<br />
Some basic things I must know before I join any guild though:<br />
<br />
#1 do you let anyone in regardless of level, gear, or reputation?  I dont mind so much the gear thing, or the level as long as its not a bunch of lvl 1-20 nuubs whining for hand outs all day long.  The reputation thing is a HUGE factor for me.<br />
<br />
#2 is your guild known as a cest pool of losers?  I do not want a top tier guild, nor the mantality that goes along with it right now, but at the same time I dont want a guild full of people who dont pay attention, or know how to play the game.<br />
<br />
#3 Do you group/ldon a lot together?  If not it defeats the purpose of what I am trying to find for my limited play time.<br />
<br />
Thanks all if you have recommendations, as I have not been around much latly and do not know who many guilds are anymore that arnt ele+.<br />

Look up some of these officers in game to talk more about it.<br />
<br />
Rhyannon<br />
Lanearas<br />
Galbrick<br />
Zuan<br />
Ayeli<br />
Pyden<br />
Jesa<br />
Tindo<br />

Great group of people we don't deal with losers or do ooc or shout recruitment. Mainly a good group of people who hang out together have fun and group. We do raid some but I will not bother yappin about that as you stated it is unimportant.<br />
<br />
The primary thing with this guild is the people. Best mix of personalities I have seen thrown together in my 5 years of EQ.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I've been in Twilight order for 2-1/2 years and we have a great mix of levels and classes. We have 50-60 folks that are 55+ and a number of mains & alts in the 25 - 55 range. We have several scheduled events for the 35 - 45 crowd each month, in addition to regular grouping opportunities for all levels.<br />
<br />
Drop by the web site and check out our charter and rules.<br />
