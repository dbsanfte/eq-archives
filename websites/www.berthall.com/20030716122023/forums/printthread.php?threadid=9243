<p><b> St00pidity in our schools</b></p>

<p>So, my 15 year old has a project--research the inventors of two different items and provide a brief biography of them. He originally wants to do his on the inventor of the condom, comes home bitching about how he can't get info on it from the web at school thanks to whatever nanny software they're using. Condom = sex, can't access any sites discussing them.<br />
<br />
At my request, my son did some more searches from school. Can't get to sites on the pill, diaphragm, spermicidal foams, or Viagra.<br />
<br />
However, a friend of his has completed his assignment using school computers. He has a nice little write up on the inventors of LSD and Ecstacy. While doing his research from the school computers, this kid was also able to get the recipe for crystal meth, some really good hydroponics tips for growing marijuana, the chemical make up of LSD, and some rather interesting facts on "Rufies", aka the date rape drug.<br />
<br />
At least I can sleep easily knowing that he'll be able to support his pregnant girlfriend via his basement lab/garden.  <img src="images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" border="0" alt=""><!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>hear about the kid who was researching for war info for a report for school, and went to ***.whitehouse.*** or something, and was a porn site, and he got kicked?<br />
<br />
*edited by moderator - Yup, it's a porn site. Please don't link to them.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I had a case in school once - I was 12 years old back then. A friend of my mothers from Japan gave us a diskette (Mac formatted) with games on it. There were some files tho, that we couldnt seem to open. Since we had macs in our school back then too, I decided to look up on what the remaining files are, my mom also told me to since she was curious.<br />
So I went to the computer lab and opened the file - a friend ofmine was sitting next to me. The file was some picture format file of a girl peeing that the guy in Japan forgot to delete off the disk. Well, I thought it was highly amusing (not arousing, I was 12 mind me) and decided to print it to show to my mom.<br />
The comp-lab supervisor came up to me with the picture, and started interrogating; confiscating the disk. He sent me away, and the case was told to my homeroom teacher, head of computer department, head of year, head of middle school AND director of school, and this was a private school.<br />
My parents had to write a letter of apology and explanation to the school. The funniest was tho, when my homeroom teacher (who hated my guts) came up to me a month after the whole thing was passé, sat down with me and started saying "Come on, we know you aren't that type of kid" etc...and I told her the whole thing was settled which she didnt believe, so I had to ask my parents AGAIN to print out ANOTHER copy of the excuse letter.</p>

<p>(To Augustin)  Even at twelve years old, I couldn't think of anyone stupid enough to print out a picture of some naked chick peeing at school.  I bet that is what your homeroom teacher was thinking when she questioned you.  Ask yourself if you really did print it to be funny.  Did you actually use your excuse so much that you began to think it true?<br />
<br />
People must understand that schools need to have strict rules when it comes to obsenity.  Sure there may be the exception (kid gets suspended for going to whitehouse.com, or son isn't allowed to look up "condom"), but those rules are generally good.  If nobody in the school cared what your kids did, how good would you feel about sending him or her there every day when you know that they could be surfing porn during library time?<br />
<br />
The benifits in this case severilty outweigh the consequences.<br />
<br />
Camaris, I grant you that I am no father.  However, like you, I was a kid once and went through the whole high-school thing.  Now at fifteen years old, your son is either a freshy or a sophmore.  Ask your son why he wanted to research the condom.  Of all the things he could have done, why the condom?  I would bet my bottom dollar he did it to be funny because he knew the subject was a bit "funny."<br />
<br />
Kids in school are encouraged to take their projects seriously.  You research something that interests you so that you may learn.  While your son may have been interested in the condom (watch him closely if so), most likely he just did it for the toilet humor aspect.  <br />
<br />
Why do I stack such odds against him?  Because I remember my Freshman and Sophmore years, and I don't think I can remember anyone who would research condoms (or viagra or the pill) and keep a straight face doing it.  Those projects are supposed to be serious.<br />
<br />
The project on LSD is just as bad and the school should have blocked that material as well.  <br />
<br />
--I am no way trying to bash either of you here.  I am just giving my [opposite] opinion of your situations.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>And I agree completely, Plaz.  <br />
<br />
And, I <b>am</b> a father.</p>

<p>Now that you say it, you prolly are right Plaz. But what happened, happened, and I learnt not to do it (which is in the end what really counts).<br />
My memory of my past is very blurred because of a few issues I had, but thats passé (I hope). Anyway, I actually do agree to you Plaz, now that I think back, I remember actually not trying to laugh and act grown-up and all mature during biology classes...well everyone was trying it...but I don't think any parent should take it seriously.<br />
I mean, c'mon...many of us didn't take school serious at times, and there should be no reason to watch a kid closely just because of that. It's normal, and it belongs to growth.<br />
But there are always 2 sides to a coin, and you can't really generalize all kids. Some might actually take it more serious when you put a close eye on them, and some might rebel and shoot the completely opposite direction - remember, puberty is partially a time of claiming independance of parents. Hell I rebelled badly too, even stormed out of the house and didn't come back a while - out of protest.<br />
I think, in the end, every parent has to get to know his/her own kid well enough during childhood (hence spend a lot of time with him/her) to learn how to treat him/her throughout puberty. And still then, the average normal kid will rebel...shit im contradicting myself...too many thoughts developing on this matter. I'll keep it at this.</p>

<br />
Heh, a friend of mine did his senior presentation on STDs and there was no way our class could keep a straight face.  Even our teacher was laughing here and there for some reason.  It wasn't funny... but it was.  You know that sort of thing.</p>
