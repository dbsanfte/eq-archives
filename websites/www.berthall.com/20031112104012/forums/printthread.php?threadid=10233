<p><b> What do you do?</b></p>

<p>Well, it is clear we have a lot of bright peeps on this board.<br />
<br />
So post what you do for a living and/or a hobby you really enjoy. Maybe another person here could use some advice or has a question you are qualified to answer.<br />
<br />
Me? 26 year vet of managing drug stores for various chains. Hobby is mainly writing short stories, poetry (placed in a couple contests) and working on a couple books. Know a bit of self defense, blade fighting, small arms and survival techniques.<br />

<p>Everyone knows my hobby.  Leather and whips, baby!  Leather and whips..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My job is awesome, though.  For a living, I have no time on my hands except to do what I want, when I want, and how I want to do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I call this lovely job unemployment.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's many times preferable to my previous job..Wal Mart associate.<br />

Going to school for something along the lines of marine biology.</p>

<p>Cool...I'd suggest being a pharmacist...fresh out of school you walk in making $93,000.00 a year. Believe me, that's the direction I'd head if I could go back 20 years and start over.<br />
<br />
Schools with a pharmacy program are few and far between. 3 in California and I think 2 in Arizona (not sure of other states) and with it being 5-7 years of school there is a distinct lack of pharmacists around with the health needs exploding in the US. My company starts scouting, wining & dining (and brown nosing) pharmacy students in their 2nd year in hopes they'll join us when they graduate.<br />
<br />
Need to be smart, have a great memory, VERY computer literate, great people skills and high professionalism.</p>

<p>Being a dairy manager must be tough what with balancing being in-stock for customers with expiring product eating away the profits. Daily deliveries or well thought out buying?</p>

<p>I recently sold my mid sized mortgage company and at this point do nothing with myself. I am looking at going back to school or starting a new venture with some friends. Nothing dramatic just something to keep me busy.<br />

Edit to add hobbies: I like to Fish and Camp in my spare time as well as read Fantasy stuff and play video games.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Right now I'm a receptionist for a dental manufacturing company.  I pretty much do anything they ask from light assembly to accounting.  As soon as possible though, probably this spring when I get laid off, I'll be going back to school to work on an AA.  I'm wanting to become a jewelist as soon as I can find the time and I have enough money to become an apprentice.  My fall back plan will be something in accounting since I'm pretty good with math.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Forgot my hobbies are playing games, watching anime, writing short stories, dabbling in architecture and landscape drawings and cooking/baking.<br />

<p>I'm a computer tech/programmer for a mid size company in Washington DC that publishes a non-partisan politics based magazine, and has several online dailies. Our site mainly deals in large contracts with political and company agencies. Some of our largest contracts include the House, Senate, and White House. I started there 7 years ago while in college, part-time. Got offered full time and took it and have been here ever since. We're looking at moving from our NW DC location to new offices inside the Watergate.<br />
<br />
Hobbies include playing bass, video games, and general drinking and partying on the weekends. I've always been into cars, mainly f-bodies, having owned 5 Camaros and 1 Firebird. Currently driving a 2002 Camaro. My next car purchase will most likely be a new Jeep Wrangler, as I loved the one Jeep I had, and being close to the mountains offers lots of weekend 4x4 opportunity.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I currently work for a major computer company doing unix server support for hardware.  I dislike working in IT as I do not like to put up with other IT people who ramble on like they know everything under the sun like someone actually cares.. hehe I do it for the money and I like working with customers.  I have a DeVry type degree from a no-name Tech school which I dont recommend to anyone (going to tech school that is, if your going to go to college stick out the extra 2 years, its worth it).  Anyway, I have been back in school for roughly 5 years,  about to enter the Pharmacy program at UK.  From there I will be forced to quit work and focus on school full time.  Hobbies include reading, action movies, rock climbing, biking, camping.  I never played video games (minus nintendo) until some friend introduced me to eq.</p>

<p>Yes and I LOVE the show. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">  I wanted to be Fay for Halloween last christmas, but after just saying half of her outfit to a friend at work while the plant manager was close he said "no".  This year I'm going as an anime school girl.  Not sure which school girl outfit I'm going to do yet.  I mean should it be the typical kind like Kagome's in Inu Yasha?  Should it be like what's her name in Pita-Ten...the little blonde girl.  So many choices and Halloween is coming up fast! <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Any who I've got a long long list of favorites ranging from action like Vampire D:Bloodlust and Hellsing to Tenchi, Fruits Basket, Cowboy Bebop and Golden Boy...gotta love it dubbed too they did a great job with finding the right voice actors.<br />
<br />
Most anime has the same type of plots with different people and slight changes so unless you realllllly like anime most people quit after a while because it becomes too predictable.  Another good anime is Hack Sign.  If you haven't seen it you should. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<br />
It can be a real pain in the ass, to be honest.  I get three main deliveries a week (M/Th/Sa), four milk deliveries (M,W,F,Sa), two egg orders a week (M,Th) and a handful of independent companies (8ish) to deal with during the week.  So I do have some flexibility with all the deliveries, but I still need to be careful under and over-estimating (guessing!).  <br />
<br />
The main problem I face is when the warehouses send me short coded products.  For instance, last week Tropicana OJ gallons were on sale.  I order a pallet (50 cases) which is usually enough to get me through til Monday, problem is the sell-by dates are all Sept 29th.  The customers see the date and are scared to buy it, knowing that their family will only drink 1 gallon in a week or two.  If I can't reduce the price and sell them before they expire, I have to send back the <i>cleaned</i> UPC's to the warehouse.  I usually deal with 2-3 items like this a week.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long story, but you asked <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->
