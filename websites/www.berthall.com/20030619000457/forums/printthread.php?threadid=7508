<p><b> DAOC patch 1.55 - Coop Server, EXP for RVR kills, RP's for Rez'n</b></p>

<p>The following are copy and pastes from the patch notes which are going life as I type this;<br />
<br />
COOPERATIVE SERVER: GAHERIS<br />
<br />
To provide the Camelot community with a way to adventure cross-realm with no worries about being killed by other players, we are unveiling our first Co-Operative Server, named Gaheris.<br />
<br />
On this type of server there is no type of player-vs-player combat at all (except for dueling) - any members of any realm can group and form guilds together, and everyone can communicate with everyone else.<br />
<br />
For players who want to concentrate on the player vs. environment experience, this server is the type for you; by having access to the dungeons and territory of all three realms, you'll find much more content that you're used to while playing on the standard server types.<br />
<br />
Guilds who have, in the past, had problems deciding which Realm to join now do not have to worry about this, since players from any Realm can join the same guild.<br />
<br />
For the next week or so, you will be able to charcopy to Gaheris and test it at any level you like. When we are confident that the<br />
<br />
Co-Op server is ready to go, we'll wipe characters and bring it up into open beta, much the same way we did with Mordred. After Gaheris goes open beta, we will not wipe characters there again (barring some extremely unfortunate event).<br />
<br />
For those players who are enabled to be Shrouded Isles testers, please note that Gaheris is SI-enabled, so if you want to charcopy to Gaheris and check out the Co-Op server, please feel free to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />

WdlPTI*&amp;p_li">HERE</a><br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
RVR CHANGES<br />
<br />
- We have made it so you can gain experience points for engaging in RvR and killing, or helping to kill, enemies. You will not lose experience when you die, but when you kill an enemy, you will now be awarded "normal" (i.e. as if the enemy was a monster, based on level) experience for the kill.<br />
<br />
Thus if the player is blue to you, you will be given normal "blue" monster experience for the kill. Please note that we are experimenting with this on Pendragon - we may or may not decide to go live with it.<br />
<br />
- Healing-type classes will now receive Realm Points for resurrecting a friendly player. Please note that you will not get Realm Points for resurrecting someone if they did not "give" Realm Points when they were killed.<br />
<br />
Also please note that the number of RPs you can get from one resurrection is capped at 2x the RPs that you yourself are worth. <br />
<br />
