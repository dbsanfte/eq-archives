  Version 1.48    <br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
RVR CHANGES<br>
<br>
We are making two changes in this version to help "slow down" the pace of RvR combat, as well as let level 35-40ish players participate more in RvR.<br>
<br>
- We've normalized high level damages between PVP and PVE. At 50th level, you would generally due about 35% more damage to a player than to a monster of equal level. So, we've reduced all PVP damages by 35% to bring them in line with PVE damages. The major reason for doing this was to make RvR combat last longer - as long as PvE combat. Please let us know how this change affects RvR.<br>
<br>
- We've reduced the level based to-hit penalties in RvR combat for lower level players attacking higher level players. Thus, lower level RvR players (35-40) will be able to hit higher level players (45-50) more often but for less damage. With this, low level players are more valuable in PVP.<br>
<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCE CHANGE<br>
<br>
In order to lessen the tedium of leveling in the 35-50 level range, we're making a change that should help players of those levels gain experience faster. Experience clamps have been raised from 1.1x a same level kill to 1.25x a same level kill. This change has two effects: it will allow lower level players in a group to gain more experience faster (15% faster), and it will also let higher level players (the 35-50s who tend to hit this clamp more often) to gain experience faster.<br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES<br>
<br>
- Chat filters have been moved to the server for filtered system messages. This should help reduce bandwidth in big battles.<br>
<br>
- Weapon Effects on mage staves should now show when the mage casts a spell. In general, weapon effects only show when a weapon is drawn and the player is in combat mode. Mages are rarely in combat mode. Thus, the staff weapon effects shows when a spell is cast and lasts until the mage moves, jumps, or strafes.<br>
<br>
- The animation speed of campfires and smoke clouds has been slowed to normal speed.<br>
<br>
- Solo experience now follows the same clamping rules as group experience. We had an issue where a group of people could disband and fight a monster individually and get more experience per player.<br>
<br>
- You can no longer use charged items when mesmerized.<br>
<br>
<br>
NEW GUILD COMMANDS<br>
<br>
We've added a few new guild commands, some of which have already slipped into the live version. These commands let you specify a guild web page and guild email address, which show up on your guild's listing on the Camelot Herald. The other new commands are for alliance messages of the day and its associated rank settings.<br>
<br>
/gc webpage [the.guildpage.com] - is an additional line set by the leader that can be display in a /gc info command, as well as on the Herald.<br>
<br>
/gc email [contact@guildpage.com] - is an additional line set by the leader that can be displayed in a /gc info command, as well as on the Herald.<br>
<br>
/gc amotd - Alliance Message Of The Day set by the alliance leader and viewable by all members of the alliance who log in. Note, that follower guild leaders can edit *their guild* amotd, but this information is not displayed. In other words, the information is stored on the guild, if this guild, in the future became an alliance leader, the amotd would display.<br>
<br>
/gc omotd - Officer Message Of The Day - set by the guild leader for the officers.<br>
<br>
/gc edit [ranknum] motd [y/n] - ability for the guild leader to allow a rank to edit the guild motd.<br>
<br>
/gc edit [ranknum] alli [y/n] - ability for the guild leader to allow a rank to enter/leave alliances (create a diplomatic officer).<br>
<br>
<br>
ART NOTES<br>
<br>
- We've added more cloth robes to the game. You may notice that your mage's outfit is different when you log into the game - as there are many more robes to go around now, we've spread the new robe graphics around. Over the next week, we'll be spreading out existing robes to hook into the new graphics. Please let us know what you think.<br>
<br>
- Friars now have their "own" robes, which are naturally colored (i.e. not a mage robe tinted brown).<br>
<br>
<br>
WORLD NOTES<br>
<br>
- We've removed the central patrols in the Battlefield, these realm guards now will guard the island area only and should not be able to be pulled to the portal keeps.<br>
<br>
Albion One-time Drops: Dai - Keltoi BattleMail (will now drop for Minstrels)<br>
Tusker - Tusker's Old Wound (will now drop for Minstrels)<br>
<br>
<br>
Albion Encounters<br>
<br>
Lyonesse: <br>
Sister Blythe has tapped into the hidden power of the Temple of Arawn. It is rumored she now has the ability to raise the dead and command them to do her will!<br>
<br>
Lyonesse / Cornwall: <br>
It seems as though the pygmy goblins in Lyonesse have been toying with new magic's of late, explosions have been heard in the area. There have been reports of more strange monster activity in Lyonesse and Cornwall.<br>
<br>
Pennine: <br>
Sir Bors has received troublesome reports from a scout in the Pennine Mountains. It appears Lord Elidyn can now wield farie magic. The scout claims Lord Elidyn's power can change frogs into Ellyll heroes!<br>
<br>
<br>
Hibernia Encounters<br>
<br>
Bri Leith: <br>
Travelers returning from the Valley of Bri Leith report strange gusts of wind in the southern regions of the valley. Rumors are that some sort of magical beast is responsible.<br>
<br>
Lough Gur: <br>
A group of adventurers returning from Lough Gur have reported that they were attacked by grasping roots when traveling through the forest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Midgard Encounters<br>
<br>
Muspelheim: <br>
A giant in Muspelheim has apparently found a new way to harness the power of lava. This giant has been throwing glowing boulders at any passers, slaying more than one unwary adventurer. <br>
<br>
<br>
Hibernia Quests<br>
<br>
Quest: Wolf Infestation:<br>
Players that follow the Way of Nature and use Caoimhe in Ardee as their trainer will now receive their level 4 trainer quest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Midgard Dungeons<br>
<br>
Spraggon Den: <br>
Spraggon Den has had a few changes. Players adventuring within the dungeon should find that a few more "safe spots" have been added to the dungeon. <br>
<br>
Vendo Caverns:<br>
Hunters have reported that some of the bears within the dungeon have migrated to safer havens away from the cramped confines of the Caverns. There have also been reports of strange occurrences within the snakepit, but the cause of this remains unseen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OBJECT NOTES<br>
<br>
We've scrubbed through the object database and fixed many small bugs that have been accumulating.<br>
<br>
<br>
Item fixes:<br>
<br>
- Stonewatch Bracer should now be set to the correct level.<br>
<br>
- Ancient witherwoode bark was changed to a more appropriate icon.<br>
<br>
- Stringed puppets, dolls, and hinges now have an icon.<br>
<br>
- Cat Hide Boots and the cloth Tomte Tunic are now dyeable by the appropriate dye.<br>
<br>
- The Runic Manslayer was returned to its previous proc'ing state.<br>
<br>
- Typos fixed in the "Webbed Shadow Jerkin", "Rogue Infiltrator Pendant", "Keltoi Infiltrators Disguise", "guide to infiltration", "Empyrean Mist Cloak", "deamhan hound tooth", "deamhan hound claw", "deamhan hound pelt", and a few others.<br>
<br>
- The Furlined Hunter's Belt can now be equipped.<br>
<br>
- The Snake Charm now has a level, and with that, it should be displaying condition, durability, etc. correctly.<br>
<br>
- The Ollipheist Eye now has a level.<br>
<br>
<br>
Several items ended up with some resist bonuses listed twice as a result of the resist consolidation a few weeks ago. The following are the ones that have been changed thus far: <br>
<br>
Ring of the Mental Fortress, Ghoulish Shackle, Shadowsteel Necklace, Belt of Spryness, Bracer of Dauntless Courage, Thunder-striders Leggings, Majestic Mantle of the Eternal, Svartalf Crafted Belt, Dread Blackscale Hauberk, Jewel Spiked Gauntlets, Restless Centurion Belt, Latticed Shadow Vest, Gossamer Seolc Sleeves, Drum of Fading Valor, Aeiry Belt<br>
<br>
<br>
Other item fixes:<br>
<br>
A few dropped weapons, and some of the player-crafted weapons were displaying delve information indicative of the item possessing a proc, although the proc wasn't named, nor did the weapon actually proc. This should be fixed for all the player-crafted weapons, and for the dropped weapons reported as bugged in this respect.<br>
<br>
The following items in Hibernia had a charisma bonus (which does not benefit any Hibernian class) changed to a more useful bonus:<br>
<br>
Dancing Silk Tunic, Charm Locket, Gem Encrusted Bracelet, Sheeries Fearsome Shroud, Griffonhead Cloak Pin, Splintered Mephit Femur, Apprentice Craftsman Pendant, Neophyte Craftsman Pendant, Journeyman Craftsman Pendant, Adept Craftsman Pendant, Master Craftsman Pendant, Mephit Wing, Kelp Bracelet, Topaz Studded Shell Flute, Mischievous Greenbriar Helm, Siabrian Crusher, Keeper's Shade, Empyreal Vest, Empyreal Helm, Ring of the Amadan, Ring of Undead Might, Goatman Mantle, Sewn Hide Leggings, Sewn Hide Helm, Aibill's Tooth, Lucent Spirit Helm, Shagreen Hero Boots, Infernal Flute, Kedger Flute, Melodic Flute, Warshade Flute, Lute of the Harpers, Cath Lute, Kedger Lute, Cliff Dweller Lute, Bard Initiate Lute, Lute of the Sea, Deathwatcher Lute, Kedger Drum, Cliff Dweller Drum, Glimmerstrike Drum, Glowing Zephyr Gem, Crystalline Band of Wind, Woeful Melody Gloves, Osier's Spectral Necklace, Twilight Vest, Ring of Song, Bard Charm<br>
<br>
<br>
Stackable Items:<br>
<br>
The object database has been overhauled! A large portion of the common loot drops is now stackable in a person's inventory, in varying numbers. This includes regular and pristine versions of many pelts and carapaces, small-sized body parts (ew!), small non-magic items (for example, rings or gems), flat items such as paper or notes, small junk loot, and medium junk loot. NOTE: The items may not automatically stack in a player's inventory when picked up. To stack an item, click on the icon in your inventory, move the cursor to the icon of a duplicate item, and click again. Once an item is stacked, it cannot be separated into single objects again, and the whole stack is sold when interacting with a vendor.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Battleground is an RvR zone with level and RP restrictions.  It's pretty neat.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Battle grounds should reallly be called Training Grounds...<br>
<br>
Pretty much you go buy a necklace from yer frontier person and port into the battlegrounds like you were porting into someones frontier..<br>
<br>
once in the battleground every realm has 1 home base type thing and there is 1 renegade fort in the middle you can take over...<br>
<br>
only level 30-35 people are allowed in and you have to be UNDER Realm Rank 2 Level 1<br>
<br>
So anyone realm rank 0-1 level 1-9 can enter<br>
<br>
I love this place at first I thought it was gunna be a bad idea but I'm level 35 nightshade and I clean up in there =) <br>
<br>
I just wish I knew what the hell everyone was saying when one of there clerics or casters just drop and I don't lose my stealth and you see a spam of soandso says in a forgein langauge <br>
<br>
AHH I LOVE THE ROGUE!!<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Nah, I kinda suck at RtCW compared to the people I play with <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
I played mostly on a server called "Noncton: OLTL"  Which at the time, was the very best One life to live server out there, but it had to be taken down due to the admin running it at his office and the boss not liking the bandwidth stuff.<br>
<br>
<br>
These are the guys that could take 3 or 4 guys back-to-back and not even be close to dying.  (Well, considering one of those 3 or 4 weren't random newbies that visited the server <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt="">)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I wasn't nearly as good as them, but I was certainly getting better. <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Alright, I'm done rambling!</p>
