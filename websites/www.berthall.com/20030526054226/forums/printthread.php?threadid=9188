<p><b> Need some technical support!</b></p>

<p>Last night as I was playing SB my comp just turns off on it own.  I pressed power to turn it back on but it wont.  I open it up and smell a faint burnt type smell coming from my power supply/fan area.<br />
<br />
I assume the problem is my power supply since the smell is in that area and well my comp won't even TURN on.  If it was my fan it would at least start up until the comp over heated then shut off.<br />
<br />
So today (tuesday) I went to the store and bought a power supply get home and install it.  The comp actually turns on WOOT WOOT!!<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
As I'm staring at my monitor it's acting like the comp isn't on.  I have that default screen (like when you turn on yer monitor and leave yer comp off).<br />
<br />
I also notice that the light on my comp which usually boots up and flickers green (orange when its thinking) is a PURE RED (NEVER GOOD).<br />
<br />
So I am out of ideas... Obviously the power supply was part of the problem since replacing it actually let me TURN the comp on.  Now I am having problems getting it to boot up to windows (hell even DOS!!!).<br />
<br />
I know it isn't the ram because it would beep 3 times if it was a ram error...<br />
<br />
Thanks ahead of time<br />

<p>When you turn your computer on, does the HD think or can you hear the Harddrive working?<br />
<br />
It could possibly your video card, if you have one lying/default on your MB.  See if it works with that.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Sounds like your addicted ass was playing during a thunderstorm again eh? Come on... Admit it!<br />
<br />
First look at your power supply and make sure you purchased a good one that meets the watage requirments of your Processor. Anything above 1.4GHZ should have atleast 300watt Power supply.<br />
<br />
Next try reseting your Bios (There should be a jumper on your motherboard to do this. RTFM to find out how.) If you cannot find the BIOS jumper, remove the battery for a few seconds then put it back in and try booting.<br />
<br />
If that fails, the worst case scenario is that you got a power surge that took out your mainboard, CPU, Memory or other devices.<br />
<br />
To diagnose the problem simply disconnect devices one at a time and try turning on your computer. If you have more than 1 stick of memory try them by themselves one at a time.<br />
<br />
If all you are left with is a video card and 1 stick of memory connected and it still wont boot, you can count on either taking this opportunity to upgrade or return the items to where you purchased them for replacement. As long as there is no physical damage, the surge should not void your warranties. Just plead ignorance if they asked what happened, and do not mention the powersupply going out.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I was talking with Lailoken and he suggested basically what you did Reapin...<br />
<br />
I tried the  ram (even though I know it isnt the ram) and its fine.  I tried the 3d card and the sound card both are ok.  <br />
<br />
I unplugged every connection I had and reconnected to make sure it wasnt just a loose wire.<br />
<br />
The power supply is the same exact type as the one that went bad, and its 300.<br />
<br />
P.S. hehe it's Texas there hasn't been a rainstorm here in a while... <br />
<br />
THank again Reapin<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>By the sounds of it, and what is left to replace, the motherboard got fried when the power supply overheated.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->
