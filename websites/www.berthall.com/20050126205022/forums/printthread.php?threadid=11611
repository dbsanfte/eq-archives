<p><b> EverQuest New Graphics Engine Is Now Live</b></p>

<p>-I feel like a human at night with my dwarf.  It does not feel like infravision is working.  Was a little tough trying to avoid the skeletons in Butcherblock Mountains at night.<br />
<br />
-The night sky is great looking with lots of stars.  I did not see the moon though.<br />
<br />
-I like the way rain looks.  It was making circular splashes all over the ground.<br />
<br />
-Finally my enchanter no longer has her neck the same tint color as her robe.  Halfling's feet really stand out now because they are not tinted.  The all blue style that most Iksar monks wear is no longer all blue since you can not tint the scales now.  You can also see more of the Vah Shir fur.<br />
<br />
-Lag in PoK seemed to be less once the graphic files are loaded as you move around.<br />
<br />
-My sister's wood elf druid was having a problem with her hair.  She could not get it back to brown.  So she settled with blond but the lighting effects make it reflect a greenish blue color too much.<br />
<br />
My dwarf rogue Dikachu was wearing the newbie quest armor and it was glowing or was a real faded white color except for the chain shirt area.<br />
<br />
-I got stuck on a few trees for some reason.<br />
<br />
-Was having a harder time targetting mobs in the distance.<br />
<br />
-The character's colors seemed more vibrant with the way the dynamic lighting landed on the model.<br />
<br />
I listed more things I saw as problems than I saw that were better.  A lot of thise problems will get tweaked in the coming years.<br />
<br />
Over all I believe this upgrade will be good for the game.<br />
<br />
I am sad about the people who can not play EQ because of it.<br />
<br />
I have been having a big problem with the computer locking up and the screen going completely black.  Tonight I did not have one of these.  I was hoping this new graphics engine would fix it.  I am optimistic it did.<br />
<br />
Those of you that have quit can take a look at this new gaphics engine with the free play time until April 15th 2004.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Yes...as a froggy roaming lower Guk i was having probs with obstacles. Like having to jump over the uneven parts of the floor and to get up on the bed in the BR...could cause some deaths for those on the run who don't know this yet. <br />
<br />
May be nothing or an intentional/un-intentional glitch but at 43 with 2200+hp and 1095 in ac I don't think light blue vampire bats should be biting me for 50-75 hp at a shot...3 light blue bats took me from 75% to 29% with me wielding Massive Dragonclaw Shard and Acrylia Inlaid Shield.<br />
<br />
Everything was very dark in the tunnels though i have several "light" sources.<br />
<br />
My frog did not look all that different but my wood elfs armor appeared more colorful (psc) and a tad more detail and color to hand and arm equipment.<br />
<br />
If I read the patch notes correctly...the sky is same everywhere until the next patch. Hope that fixes the lighting issue. Have not been outside yet : )<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>You guys did up your Gamma settings right?<br />
<br />
I logged in last night and it was very dark, went into options and noticed the Gamma had been reset to a very low number.<br />
<br />
Just jacked it back up to 26% and everything looks like it did pre-patch, but much crisper.</p>

<p>the alt enter to click u out of the windows doesn't work too.  And sometimes when you do that your windows size shrink and the screen goes black but your charactor still in the game.<br />
<br />
I found with the darkness thingy, Thaddeus help me with this, was that if you adjust your gamma, it will go back to normal again.  <br />
<br />
Everything seems to laggy but that is typical with new engine or patches...</p>

<p>Glitches I've personally had, with details:<br />
<br />
1) targeting anything with the mouse is a total nightmare now, especially if one pixel of anything else is covering any part of the object you are trying to click.<br />
<br />
2) Lag spikes are unreal now. I'm used to lag spikes, but these weren't the normal ones I'm used to. Ping was going insane last night. Solo'ing in an empty zone, I would go through periods where the ping meter was rapidly jumping between 100 percent and like 3 percent. And in terms of rapid, it was like it would jump between those green and red apx 6 times per second, for apx 10 seconds at a time. A few times, the screen would go totally black, like you have been blinded, but I know that wasn't the case, since I was medding, and when the screen came back I was still sitting.<br />
<br />
3) Gamma is way off. I have to keep gamma on 70 something just to see ten feet in front of me, and on a dark elf, that isn't right. Pre patch my gamma was in the low 40's, and everything looked perfect. Now due to the gamma, it all looks milky which totally sucks, but only way I can see anything.<br />
<br />
4) Mob cons are seriously screwy. Messing around on my level 17 beastlord twink in hollowsahde, I could solo mulitple owlbear fleshrenders at one time, which all conned red, but two light blue rockhoppers would put much more of a smack down on me. Both were done while fully self buffed, full hps, and full mana, and the owlbears were easier. One red owlbear would get me alone down to around 75 hps, and 80m, where as one light blue rockhopper would get me and my pet down to around 40 hps, and near oom. This wasn't Dirtchomp, these were just regular hoppers. This should definetly not be the case, but the xp last night was great =)<br />
<br />
5) The auto duck thing is severly annoying, the second I would run into any object, like walls, trees, rocks, etc, insatant duck mode.<br />
<br />
6) The sky is glitchy on the highest setting. I also have full clip plane on, and when the sky would change from day to night, and vice versa, the buildings' graphics would get stuck in the sky. Setting the sky to the lowest level and zoning did fix that though.<br />
<br />
System info, I have a G4 card 128 ddr ram, dirX 9.0b, and updated my video card drivers last night. The problems were present before and after the driver installion, and dirX has been installed for almost 2 months now. For those of you also having problems, what type of video card, etc are you using?<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>ATI performance in EQ is finally fixed!<br />
<br />
I couldn't believe the performance I was seeing in POK and POT.  I was able to crank every setting to max (6xAA, 16xAF, high quality, dynamic lights & full Luclin models) and it was STILL smoother than last week.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Zone walls are goofy.<br />
<br />
I got stuck going uphill on a horse (tranq)<br />
got stuck going laterally on a hill on a horse (tranq)<br />
<br />
with lev & shrunk in PoFire<br />
I got stuck multiple times running along the zone wall.<br />
<br />
in PoWater, shrunk, <br />
I fell thru the wall 3 times.<br />
Others reported this as well, if they weren't sharp, they were booted to the Zone In.<br />
<br />
I'm not happy with the bugs created with the zoen walls.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I have noticed that my AA horse is slower (or at least appears to be) and it gets stuck on almost all hills/trees.  I have had to banish it and go around, and then summun it in order to get around.  I hope they fix this issue ASAP, because I use my horse to get past ugly zones quickly.<br />
<br />
The colors are better, I need to try out the new colors...so you say that it does not change the neck appearance?  Sweet...I will try out new colors now.<br />
<br />
Spells visual effects are beautiful as well as rain.  The skys and lighting still need work.  It is almost like a real graphics game now.<br />
<br />
The zonning LAG is unreal.  It is taking more time to zone then ever before.<br />
<br />
I have a AMD 2600+ / GForce4 Ultra 4600ti / 1 Ghz DDR RAM / ADSL Internet connection.<br />
<br />
Overall I will give the new patch a "C" for the effort, but I see allot fo downtime to tweak it.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->
