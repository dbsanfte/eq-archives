<p><b> Enter the Matrix</b></p>

<p>I am thinking about buying the Enter the Matrix game.  I saw the preview video, and I know that it does have some footage that supposively runs parallel to the film, however I do not buy a game just because it has a movie title attached to its name.<br />
<br />
I usually avoid titles like this, but I hear this one might be a little different.  However, I haven't really heard much hype about it and am wondering if anyone has played it?<br />
<br />
Is it any good?  <br />
Can it stand up to Max Payne?<br />
Is it fun?<br />
Is the story of quality?<br />
Is the acting any good, or just shitty Command and Conquer type acting?<br />
Is it multiplayer?<br />
Do most cars in Europe have manual transmission?  Is it a fad or just a budget thing?<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p><b> Re: Enter the Matrix</b></p>

<p>Is it any good? <br />
Its somewhat good. The fighting is fun and especially when using bullet time. The driving\car levels suck big time. And you have an arrow guiding you through the entire game. If you do end up buying it, buy it for xbox or ps2 not for PC.<br />
<br />
Can it stand up to Max Payne?<br />
No. Max Payne with that matrix mod for PC >>> ETM.<br />
<br />
Is it fun?<br />
Fighting is fun thats all.<br />
<br />
Is the story of quality?<br />
Yes. <br />
<br />
Is the acting any good, or just shitty Command and Conquer type acting?<br />
Well i havent played C&C, but yes the acting is good.<br />
<br />
Is it multiplayer?<br />
I heard there is a cheat for multiplayer, dont know if its true though.<br />
<br />
Do most cars in Europe have manual transmission?<br />

<p>rented it and beat it in 2 days beat max payne in 4 but i had help on ETM<br />
<br />
.. game kicks ass... not a lot of replay ablility... the hackorz option you can do... that is built into the game is pretty cool... can come back as neo ect ect. The graphcis are pretty kick ass.  glitchy here and there.. but i've seen worse.<br />
<br />
I say rent it first and then decide if you want it..<br />
<br />
IF you liked max payne you will like this game<br />
<br />
Yes you can do muti player.. but it blows balls just a crappy 1 on 1 stuff.. and you can't even jump... its just gimp. BTW naomi is so much better to play then ghost i went back and played it with him.. his aim sucks and he is just crappy<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p><b> no..</b></p>

<p>you can't comeback as Neo in the cheating option, tks for spreading the worseless rumor =\<br />
<br />
Plaz i beat it in 3 hours, it was a waste of time, the cut scenes were the only good thing about it.. i do not recommend it.<br />
<br />
i do recommend though!<br />
<br />
Xenosaga<br />
Suikoden III<br />
Dynasty Warriors 4<br />
Devil May Cry 1<br />
Timesplitteres 2<br />
<br />
ETM is crap, nothing is well defined in it, and it failed horribly trying to live up to the HyPe~<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Suikoden III looked insanely boring to me.  Shitty graphics, even shittier animation, no speech, and monotonous classic console rpg gameplay.  Boring.<br />
<br />
Xenosaga is pretty much the same to me.  Running around trying to get in fights to power up yet saving enough for the boss for a 50 hour game is boring to me.</p>
