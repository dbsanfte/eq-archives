<p><b> Funny UN Joke with EQ twist</b></p>

<p>I got this from EQ cleric:<br />
<br />
Funny.... <br />
One of the paladins in my guild posted this on our website. I had to share... <br />
<br />
Warning, I copied this off of a Paladins of Norrath message board. I post it only for its satire value, and in no way do I mean to offend anyone. So here you go <br />
<br />
US: Ok, putting together a group for an Iraq raid...who's in? <br />
<br />
UK: Of course I'm in. <br />
<br />
Turkey: Only if someone makes me new armor. Last Iraq raid I lost money on. <br />
<br />
US: *sigh* Ok, I can't make your cultural armor, but I'll help pay for it. How much you need? <br />
<br />
Turkey: 100k plat. <br />
<br />
US: ***?! Are you smithing the armor out of platinum, ya tard? No frikking way. 30k plat, and that's all I'm offering. <br />
<br />
Turkey: Sweet. Ok, I'm in. <br />
<br />
Spain: I frikking hate Iraq. They were spawn campin us for frikking EVER, man -- long time ago, but we're still pissed off about it. Meet you at Turkish zone line. <br />
<br />
US: Cool, thx. <br />
<br />
Italy: Me 2. <br />
<br />
Chile: I'm in. <br />
<br />
US: Ok, so far, got US, UK, Turks, Spain, Italy, Chile. <br />
<br />
Bulgaria: Umm, got room for some lowbies? Thought maybe we could leech some raid xp ... <br />
<br />
US: Yeah, sure. Why not. Just don't attack anything. Make sure to set up a /assist US hotkey, ok? <br />
<br />
France: Hey all, what's up? <br />
<br />
US: Putting together a raid, hitting Iraq. <br />
<br />
France: No frikking way, dood. Look, I'm part of Alliance leadership, and I say no way do we go in there. I'm using Alliance veto. <br />
<br />
US: ***? Alliance Veto? <br />
<br />
France: Yeah, it's in the guild charter. Me, Germany, US, Russia, and China can all cancel any guild raid event. <br />
<br />
Bulgaria: Hey, me and the other Eastern Europeans wanna go ... <br />
<br />
France: ****, n00b. Your guild got no say in this. <br />
<br />
Bulgaria: ,,!,, <br />
<br />
Germany: I don't really want to go either. <br />
<br />
US: ... <br />
<br />
France: Yeah, we veto. No guildies go to Iraq. <br />
<br />
US: What about you, Russia. <br />
<br />
Russia: Well, if everyone else goes, it's ok, but if France and Germany say no, then that's cool. <br />
<br />
US: Jeebus. Dood, show some balls. You used to love going on raids. <br />
<br />
Russia: Yeah, but that Afghanistan raid a while back was a disaster. Total group wipe-out. <br />
<br />
US: Yeah, but you were in different alliance, man. This is different. Besides, we pwn3d last time we went on Iraq raid. <br />
<br />
France: Doesn't matter. I say no. <br />
<br />
Spain: .tell US doesn't matter if France doesn't go anyway, he just feigns death anytime he sees combat. He's a bu77munch. Lives next door to me. <br />
<br />
Spain: Oops. MT. <br />
<br />
France: Oh yeah? Well you skipped that WWII raid completely. <br />
<br />
Spain: Only cuz I'd just come back from dueling,was too tired to raid. Besides, you died in first wave, spent the rest of the raid licking dirt and whining. <br />
<br />
France: ..!.. <br />
<br />
US: Guys, c'mon. I'm trying to put this thing together, here... look, I don't care what France says. I'm going, and anyone who wants to come with me can. China, you in? <br />
<br />
China: *shrug* Don't feel like it. <br />
<br />
US: Ok... <br />
<br />
North Korea has challenged you to a duel Type /duel accept to accept or /duel decline t decline the challenge. <br />
<br />
US: /duel decline <br />
<br />
North Korea tells you: "Dood u r teh suq. I will r0xxorz u" <br />
<br />
You tell North Korea: No thanks, guy. Trying to get a raid going. <br />
<br />
North Korea tells you: "Ur just scaerd of teh pwnage" <br />
<br />
You tell North Korea: Riiiigh. ****, okay? I'm busy. <br />
<br />
North Korea taunts you. <br />
<br />
/ignore North Korea. <br />
<br />
US: How come you're not coming, Germany? <br />
<br />
Germany: I'm just not into the violence anymore. <br />
<br />
You tell Germany: Bulls#$t, you're just waiting for us to go into Iraq so you can gank France again. <br />
<br />
Germany tells you: Ooops. *blush* busted!! <br />
<br />
You tell Germany: Dude, why bother? He's green to you. <br />
<br />
Germany tells you: It's just satisfying, I guess. It shuts him up for a while, anyway. <br />
<br />
France: I'm telling you, if anyone goes, then it'll break the Alliance. <br />
<br />
Spain tells you: Whoop-de-s**t, this Alliance sucks. Let's go anyways. <br />
<br />
US: France, *** is ur problem? <br />
<br />
France: I want to send scouts in first. Let them see if any named are up. <br />
<br />
US: Ok, how long it gonna take them? <br />
<br />
France: Couple weeks, maybe. Months, possibly. <br />
<br />
US: MONTHS? ***???! Dude, I don't want to waitthat  ng. I'll give your scouts a week, at most. We'll reschedule then. <br />
<br />
France: I may veto anyway. <br />
<br />
US: Yeah, whatever. <br />
<br />
/tell Spain Yeah, may have to. He's a dips**t. <br />
<br />
Bulgaria tells you: If you go, let me know. Me and my lowbie buddies are in. <br />
<br />
You tell Bulgaria: Cool, thx. Are you someone's alt? <br />
<br />
Bulgaria tells you: Some of us were Russia's buff toons, but we're soloing now. <br />
<br />
US: Ok, meet again next week. We'll take things from there.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->
