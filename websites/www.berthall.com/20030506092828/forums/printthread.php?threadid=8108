<p><b> New EQ record, and upcoming server splits?</b></p>

<p>EQ BREAKS 110K ONLINE USERS, JANUARY 29, 2003 <br />
Source: EQ Live Website.<br />
<br />
Just a quick thank you to all our players for helping with our brand new record of over 110,000 simultaneous EverQuest users and a new record high number of subscribers too! Welcome to all of the new Adventurers in Norrath! <br />
To help accommodate our growth in players we will be announcing some server news in the upcoming weeks. <br />
<br />
Thanks again! <br />

So apparently EQ has become even stronger despite the competition from  DAoC and AC2. You know a large number of people are two-boxing, but there are still far more people playing now than a couple years ago. It should be interesting to see what happens in the next 4-5 months when more competition is released. Plus it really begs the question, how can they release eq2 if eq1 is doing record sales and subscriptions?<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Anyone know the old record EQ held?  Just curious if this is a big jump or not.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think they would go ahead and release EQ2 as soon as it's ready.  Most people will have a hard time letting go of EQ toons they worked on for years.  Maybe have a price break if you subscribe to 2 or more Sony MMOG's (SWG, EQ or EQ2).  <br />
<br />
Not to mention you want folks to have a time commitment to the game before all the other next gen MMOG's come out, specifically WOW.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>Verant/Sony might leak this news out to tell their shareholders how strong their product is after all these years... so wait till we release EQ2 and invest in them.<br />
<br />
It is probably a marketing tool to counter the countless news of bad customer services it has recieved over the net... and still they have that many users.<br />
<br />
Also this increase of new user could be because they are also giving away their games for free... over their website (free download trial for a month) and current player offer a free accounts for a month to let their friends try it out.<br />
<br />
And Goadan is right... lots of people playing with 2 or more accounts now too... as well as what Aj said in one of the other thread... people who quit will always come back.<br />
<br />
All this could have added with the increase to the 110K online users at once.</p>

<p>Anyone  think  they will add  a new server or 2? cause ya know bertox is pretty crammed up.   so many high end guilds here.  On patch day by the end of the night you will not find a  decent named  mob up :P</p>

<p><b> They might</b></p>

<p>Might they mentioned they are going to announce some new server news. Not just we're adding servers. <br />
<br />
I think they probably had a European influx when they made a 'Euro' oriented server. Let's face it many non-Americans don't like playing with a majority of Americans, mind you not all, but some definitely do. <br />
<br />
I predict that a split server will come out of the recent Euro one they built possibly. I don't really see them slapping on more then one generic additional server, if that. With games coming out all signs point to the probability that there will be a drastic drop in populations, at least temporarily.<br />
<br />
I'm just surprised they haven't remerged the PK servers. It seems like the populations are way low on those. I was expecting them to kill either Tallon or Vallon & let the players have the option of going to the remainder server, Sullon or Rallos.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Usually most people don't complain about low population servers... just the high population one with overcrowded login(after the patch), lag, no mob to kill, two or more uber guilds, lack of customer supports, etc...</p>

<p><b> Regarding EQ2</b></p>

<p>Regarding EQ2:<br />
<br />
EQ2 is NOT meant to exterminate EQ.  It is there to catch potential customers who might not be impressed by EQ.  It is there to catch people leaving EQ because they have lost interest or gotten irritated at the way the game is set up.  It is there in case EQ ever does die off as a sort of insurance.  It is a bit of an experiment on the part of Verant as well.  It's their chance to start over and do EQ they way that they think maybe it should have been done from the start in hindsight.  However, if they simply made all those changes to EQ as it is, they'd lose half their customers and they don't want to risk that.<br />
<br />
If, 50 years from now, EQ is still getting this many customers, Verant will still keep it going, even if all the other games are played in virtual worlds like that of "The Matrix" while EQ is played on 5 inch black and white monitors with pong-quality graphics.  If it makes money, they will keep it alive.</p>
