<p>Sorry this is a late <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
SPELLCRAFT AND ALCHEMY<br />
<br />
Spellcraft and Alchemy make their debut in Dark Age of Camelot with this update, which are the two crafting skills that allow player crafters to imbue weapons and armor with magical properties.<br />
<br />
This is an extensive system that has many options and associated skills. For full documentation of the Spellcraft and Alchemy, go to the Camelot Herald at <a href="http://www.camelotherald.com/documentation/spellcraft/." target="_blank">http://www.camelotherald.com/documentation/spellcraft/.</a> You'll find all the information you need to get started there.<br />
<br />
General Overview of Spellcraft/Alchemy<br />
<br />
Spellcraft and Alchemy work exactly like the other tradeskills as far as their recipes, and the objects they create go. Once you have the object, you "combine" them, via the trade window to an object.<br />
<br />
For example, Player A takes their Sword they want to have strength added to it to a Spellcrafter. They place it in a trade window with the Spellcrafter.<br />
<br />
The Spellcrafter places a strength Gem in the sword's gem socket and clicks the "combine" button. Satisfied (both players will get text information on the combine, how many points it took, etc), Player A places some money in the trade window and hits Trade.<br />
<br />
The Spellcrafter then hits trade, the combine happens. Viola! Player A has a sword with a strength bonus, and the Spellcrafter has the satisfaction of making another magic item.<br />
<br />
The "forge" object for Spellcraft and Alchemy is the new Alchemy table that you will see placed in various parts of the home cities. You will find the merchants needed for these two crafts close by.<br />
<br />
The tools that you will need for various recipes are the Spellcraft Kit, Alchemy Kit, and Mortar and Pestle. The kits are always needed for their specific trade, the Mortar and Pestle is needed for making any of the poisons.<br />
<br />
You may need to scroll sideways in the Spellcraft/Alchemy Merchants to find the items that you need (using the new multiple store indexes per merchant feature).<br />
<br />
<br />
Names of Guild Masters:<br />
<br />
Albion<br />
<br />
Spellcraft Guild Master: Clayton Gage<br />
Alchemy Guild Master: Adelaide Dinsmore<br />
<br />
Midgard<br />

Spellcraft Guild Master: Hradi Thorleif<br />
Alchemy Guild Master: Armod Dag<br />
<br />
Hibernia<br />
<br />
Spellcraft Guild Master: Shannen<br />
Alchemy Guild Master: Aslander<br />
<br />
<br />
Trade Skill Reset<br />
<br />
In order to "wipe" your trade skills so that your character can learn Spellcraft/Alchemy if they already belong to another trade Order, we've put in a special quest in each Realm that will guide your character through the process.<br />
<br />
Please note that you can only go on this quest ONCE, and you can only do it to switch from whatever tradeskill you currently know to Spellcraft or Alchemy - NOT to any other tradeskill.<br />
<br />
We've placed an NPC in each of the capital cities of each realm in the general vicinity of the name registrar. Each of these NPC’s will instruct you as to the process of changing your order.<br />
<br />
Please note that once you have established yourself within the new order, you cannot change back. All of these changes are final!<br />
<br />
Change Trade Order NPCs:<br />
<br />
Albion - Edie Wharton<br />
Hibernia - Fabrice<br />
Midgard - Gudmund<br />

They've ONLY gotten to Spellcrafting and Alchemy??  I'm glad I cancelled my account when I did.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>They all say that, Hideo.  <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

I'm guessing I was not missed, considering no one talks in DAoC.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Either it's your negative attitude towards the game or maybe you just didn't try hard enough.  But I found more than enough talking.<br />
<br />
<br />
I may not play the game or even like it much anymore (Although I've been wanting to try it again lately) but Arich has done nothing but whine about it since day one.</p>

<p>Probably because he played a stealther.  Most stealthers have the tendency to just run off on their own and try to solo everything to 50.  It can get lonely soloing 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
Me, I log on and instantly get tells from 4-5 friends telling me to come to some spot, or asking where I am so they can group.  Or the guild has something going on or we're going to RVR.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Actually, Aj, if you check the past messages, I praised DAoC for a while.<br />
<br />
That was, until they totally re-vamped classes ala EQ when they said they definately would NOT out of beta.<br />
<br />
The times to make major changes is in beta.  Current MMORPGs need to learn that, mostly EQ and DAoC.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I'm sorry, Arich.  But you whined because you no longer could solo in RVR and that you were lucky if you could kill a single person.  Sorry, but RVR does not equal PVP.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And while I don't remember them ever saying they would never change the classes, (Or believe you, find a quote of them saying it for me, please.) but even if they DID say that, you were insane to think they would have it perfectly balanced the first time around.</p>

<p>Nobody soloes in RVR unless they're 50th with all their RA's and they'll be stealthers.  Even then, they manage to kill one person only to get zerged by their 10 friends.<br />
<br />
As with EQ, ranger type classes gotta be the biggest wanking whiners ever.<br />
<br />
Anytime I've ran out into the frontier and died to a stealther I immediatly get like 10 or more tells "Where?"  Then a small force arrives hunting for the stealther.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>hate to agree with AJ here but Arich as I recall you were complaining about your ranger for the longest time because they added line of sight.<br />
<br />
And you couldnt shoot through a hill and kill someone anymore, or level via this technique.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Just as in EQ.  It says I couldn't shoot someone standing almost directly in front of me, yet I could shoot right through a solid wall.<br />
<br />
Line of sight is good... when properly programmed.  Otherwise, it shouldn't be bothered with.<br />
<br />
And about the hill thing, couldn't you just use the English longbow idea and arc the arrow over the hill??  <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>That works great when you're shooting blindly into an army.. not at a 5 foot tall single MOB. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->
