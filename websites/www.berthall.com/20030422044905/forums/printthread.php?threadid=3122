<p><b> 
Pendragon 1.39</b></p>

<p>Version 1.39     <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
CAMELOT HERALD<br />
<br />
- Please note that a new website was launched two weeks ago dedicated to disseminating information from us to you, the Camelot community. You can find it at <a href="http://www.camelotherald.com." target="_blank">www.camelotherald.com.</a><br />
<br />
<br />
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES<br />
<br />
- The last patch had a change to Hibernian Piercing combat styles - Sidewinder was changed to require an opening style that itself had a block opening. This had the large unintended consequence that many classes (who didn't use shields) could no longer use these styles. So, we're changing it back to the way it was before. Sidwinder now requires as its opening Black Widow. We apologize for the confusion.<br />
<br />
- We think we've finally nailed down the last bug that was preventing high level characters from getting combat styles. You should now see all your styles when you log in.<br />
<br />
<br />
- You'll now see arrows fly through the air when an archer fires at a target. When the arrow hits the target, the arrow sticks in the target for a couple of seconds letting the target know the rough direction from which the arrow was fired.<br />
<br />
- Players can now climb ladders. To climb a ladder run up to it and continue holding down the move forward key. You'll climb up the ladder. To climb down the ladder, use the move backward key. If you are on a wall and which to climb a ladder, move backwards and fall off of the wall onto the ladder - you'll stick to it and can climb up and down.<br />
<br />
- Monsters now respect doors so that if a door is closed (but not locked) the monster will open the door before going through. If a door is locked (i.e. at a frontier or relic keep), the monster will not come through at all.<br />
<br />
- You now get a dialog box for confirmation when you give weapon or armor to a guard.<br />
<br />
- If you have no chance to repair an item, you now get a message telling you that - previously you would just get a message telling you that you failed.<br />
<br />
- Previously, you could not be interrupted while shooting a bow after you draw the bow but are just "waiting to fire". Now you have a chance of getting interrupted while waiting to fire as well as when you are drawing the bow.<br />
<br />
- Typing "/bind" in a location not "bindable" will no longer print your current bind point. This command never worked properly, and has now been removed.<br />
<br />
- If you are mesmerized in the middle of the cast, you no longer complete your spell when the mez wears off. You now have to recast your spell.<br />
<br />
- You can now simply type "/who 30 40" to find players of certain levels. Previously you had to type "/who level 30 40" to find the same information.<br />
<br />
- You can no longer inadvertently downgrade an object by using the "upgrade" command and specifying a lower level than the object's current level.<br />
<br />
- You can no longer salvage an item for 0 money.<br />
<br />
- The position of the tradeskill timer should save now when you exit the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
WORLD NOTES<br />
<br />
RVR Frontier Keeps:<br />
<br />
- A Forge and Lathe have been added to the following frontier keeps:<br />
- Albion : Caer Benowyc in Hadrian's Wall<br />
- Midgard: Bledmeer Faste in Odin's Gate<br />
- Hibernia: Dun Crauchon in Emain Macha<br />
<br />
- Merchants have ventured into the frontier with the various armies and have set up shop selling certain wares related to war. Arrows, throwing axes, and poisons can now be purchased in certain keeps throughout the frontiers, depending on which army holds the fortress.<br />
<br />
<br />
Monster Encounters<br />
<br />
Hibernia<br />
- Rangers have reported an increase in Siabra activity near the center of the Bog of Cullen. The power of that area also seems to be growing, not just with the Siabra, but with all the creatures found there. The guardians seem harder, more disciplined; the archmagi seem stronger; and the raven wraiths and cronicorns seem even nastier than they already were. The one good side of this is that the banshees seem to shriek a little less often than they once did. <br />
<br />
- A nightshade who snuck into the Coruscating mines reports an increase of the number of sentries. He also mentioned other guards, slightly larger than the sentries who patrolled the lode room.<br />
<br />
- Princess Brigit of Tir na Nog has dispatched Sentinel Champions and their Noble Steeds to help protect Innis Carthaig. They should be able to protect the city from any Siabra invasions.<br />
<br />
Albion<br />
<br />
- A wandering minstrel sings of his ventures in to Cornwall. He tells a story of how the Cornish frogs and brown bears, both young and old, have changed, and how more boogies haunt the area. The spirits of Romans long dead now line the road up to and around their villa. The minstrel sings of the muryans, the shape-shifting small people of Cornwall who grow smaller with each change of their form until at last the smallest form is reached and they remain as ants until the end of their days. At the end of his song, the minstrel began to weep for the loss of his lute, which saved his life by deflecting the blow of a Cornish giant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hibernia Quests / NPCs<br />
<br />
- The Level 40 Hibernian epics are in. See the trainers in Tir na Nog for details. <br />
<br />
- A level nine quest for Hibernia is in. See your local filidh for more information. <br />
<br />
<br />
Albion Quests / NPCs<br />
<br />
- All level 40 epics have been added to Albion. See your trainer for information.<br />
<br />
- A merchant selling crossbow bolts has taken up shop in Fortress Sauvage, hoping to capitalize on the war.<br />
<br />
<br />
Midgard Quests / NPCs<br />
<br />
- All level 40 epics have been added to Midgard. See your trainer for information.<br />
<br />
Quest Big Paw:<br />
Players on the Big Paw quest will now receive the item when they kill Big Paw in Skona Ravine.<br />
<br />
Quest Monstrous Beast:<br />
Players who accidentally close their dialog box can now resume talking with Vik in the Vale of Mularn.<br />
<br />
Quest Viking Trainers:<br />
Players who accidentally close their dialog box can now resume talking with Saeunn in Vasudheim.<br />
<br />
Quest Copious Striders:<br />
The class restrictions have been removed so anyone may do the quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
SPELL SYSTEM UPDATES<br />
<br />
- Minstrels and Bards can now view information about their songs, just like other spellcasters can do with their spells (the "i" key).<br />
<br />
- All pulsing spells now print to everyone in the group. A chat channel has been added in the system chat channel picker to turn off all pulsing prints.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I really hate to sound like a whiner, but this patch kind of smells crappy to archer classes.<br />
<br />
Arrows sticking out of people and visible in the air?  errrr, ok, our stealth ability in RvR gets a nice little nerf again for that.  Will people start sprouting gouts of flame from their asses in the general direction a wizard throws a bolt spell at them now?  What is /face for again?  <br />
<br />
The bow shot getting interrupted after you've drawn is a total kick in the nuts to the solo archer player.  We will probably go from being able to score 3 or 4 hits on a mob with the bow, to 2 or 3.  Then have to melee it out.  I really feel sorry for the higher level archers that haven't spent any points in their melee skills.<br />
<br />
I'm really not trying to get pissed about this stuff, because it's still on test, but I'm pretty sure no one is going to protest against any type of archer class nerf, except archers.  And they are just viewed as a pack of whiners and d00ds.<br />
<br />
/sigh  <br />
<br />
I just want to play a guy with a bow.  When are they going to finish my class already?  I'm tired of adjusting.....<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I was testing /face last night and it seems to have a dam short range .. a lot shorter than the range of a normal DD, never mind the extra distance a Bow can pull.<br />
<br />
Arrow sticking out of the body ... ok this is a little over the top.. if reality had any hand in the game .. if an arrow 'actually' sticks in you .. i can say with hand on heart you aint gonna be in the same possition 5 sec latter.<br />
<br />
Arrow flying .. urmmm well .. we can see bolts already so seeing the arrow is not that much different .. i hope it is less obvious.<br />
<br />
As i have put forward on other threads IMO<br />
.. Scouts are Archers and trackers (dont get onto EQ) and not some old world Long range Assissins..<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Until assassins can see an equal-level equal-spec stealthed archer at a reasonable range ("Detect Hidden" doesn't, currently), archers remain the ones in greatest control of the frontiers.  I can't wait for the day when archers fear assassins as they should.</p>

<p>I couldn't care less about being an assasin.  I just want to be a "scout".<br />
<br />
Let's see, I can't remain stealthed and have anything close to a normal walk speed much less a normal run speed.  <br />
<br />
I am reduced to wearing only studded armor, but only run as fast unstealthed as an armsman in full plate.  <br />
<br />
I have no track.  <br />
<br />
I have no speed enhancements whatsoever.  <br />
<br />
I have NO safe fall ability to compensate for my knowledge of the terrain I am scouting.<br />
<br />
How exactly am I supposed to scout anything?<br />
<br />
So, yeah, we've been reduced to assasins at range.  Not our fault.  Some of us REALLY want to be scouts.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<br />
Honestly, I've never really had a big problem with archers, they've never really bugged me that much.  But seriously, do you think seeing where you're getting shot from is really that bad?  Face isn't all that great, atleast in my experiences.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm personally looking forward to running down the road and seeing 4 - 5+ arrows come flying out of the trees from different directions.</p>

I never said I hate the scout class.<br />
<br />
I just hate some of the changes that are being considered.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the advise about not playing a class I don't enjoy.  I never would have figured that one out on my own.  <img src="images/smilies/eek.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Seriously though.  I still like the scout class more than I liked the merc class.  I like to be able to have a look around a bit more in the frontier instead of just relying on reports of the stealth classes.<br />
<br />
Who knows?  I'll probably change classes more than a couple more times in the future.  I've never been one to stick to one class for long.  <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>The arrow sticking part has been in the works for months, actually.  If I remember correctly, /face was sort of an interim solution at the end of beta.  I think that it's staying in but this will assist on attacks from longer range.  The interrupt thing also has minimal impact from what I'm seeing.  It's a matter of trying to give some consistancy to how the interrupts are handled.<br />
<br />
As far as other scout type abilities, I'm sure that they will be added but I wouldn't be surprised if it takes a while.  Primary importance is balancing out the combat aspects of classes, as far as I know, from a class point of view.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>But at least I'm tempering all my whines with, "it's only on test, I haven't seen how it impacts me yet".<br />

It could very well be not as bad as I think it will be, and affect me very little.<br />

I was just trying to blow off a little steam, but obviously, one can't do that on a public message board and not sound like a whiner to anyone other than people who agree with you.<br />

knowledge of terrain is something you can pick up in general, without having a skill to show it, but saying that I think a removal of the fist level of damage would be a good idea .. if, however, you fall 30ft then Scouts should take the same damage as everyone else.<br />

Scouts are not forced to be ranged assassins, its merely an option that some feel is not right.<br />

If you feel there is a problem with people complaining about assassin shots and you agree .. then why argue ?? .. instead .. try and get some things put into the class instead .. like small safe fall .. faster stealth movement for all classes with stealth (though I believe you get faster with more points).. basic tracking.<br />
