            <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="1">Version 1.47 is now live on all servers. It has two major new features: the ability for guilds to claim keeps (and get bonuses from them), as well as a special RvR battleground for level 30-35 characters. We will observe the popularity of the new battleground, and will add others with different level ranges if necessary. Version 1.47 also has many bug fixes and other updates - read the patch notes carefully for complete information. <br />
<br />
====================================== <br />
<br />
Dark Age of Camelot <br />
<br />
Version 1.47 Release Notes <br />
<br />
====================================== <br />
<br />
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br />
- Resurrecting classes are now added to a monster's "hate" list if they resurrect a player while the monster that kills that player is still in combat. All resurrecting classes should be careful about rezzing someone who was killed by a monster if that monster is still alive and is still in combat. Please note if the monster is no longer in combat, then no aggro is accrued, and resurrection can be performed with no danger. <br />
<br />
- Some root and snare spells (across all Realms) were incorrectly set to "recast", so they could be chain-cast on players. This has been fixed. <br />
<br />
- A monster AI bug was causing "trained" monsters in dungeons to aggress on players not involved with that combat. This has been fixed - monsters will now return properly to their home after being trained. <br />
<br />
- The RESISTS button on the character sheet has been changed to BONUSES. This gives insight not only into your resistances, but to the various realm and outpost bonuses. Now you can clearly see the effect that Relics have on your character and your Realm. <br />
<br />
- Guilds can now conquer and "claim" frontier keeps. See the section on that below. <br />
<br />
- A lower-level RvR battleground is now available for 30-35th level players. See the section on the battleground below. <br />
<br />
- All player attacks now do less damage against doors and siege equipment. This is to slow down the massive groups of people that group up and take doors down too quickly. <br />
<br />
- If you train a specialization to level 50, it will now correctly award you 50th level spells (if there is a 50th level spell on that specialization). Previously, you didn't always get your 50th level spell awarded. <br />
<br />
- Experience points now print with commas, so when you kill a monster, especially at high levels, you can more easily see how much you were awarded. <br />
<br />
- Strength buffs/debuffs will now immediately affect your movement rate. <br />
<br />
- We fixed several bugs that caused players to become buried in walls or "warp" through walls. <br />
<br />
- In your character's specialization window, spec bonuses now print differently. Previously, the spec list had your "base" number of trains in the list with any bonuses already added in. Now you see the "base" number of trains you have in that spec and next to it is the total number of object/realm point bonuses that affect that specialization. <br />
<br />
- A bug was causing all 2H weapon users to parry half as much as they should have. This has been fixed - all 2H users should see their characters parrying much more often. <br />
<br />
- Another bug in Alliance Chat has been fixed. Now when your guild leaves an Alliance, you will no longer see chat from that Alliance. <br />
<br />
- Berserkers will now do (on average) more critical damage while they are in Frenzy mode - Only in RvR combat. <br />
<br />
- Paladins now have increased hit points. <br />
<br />
- Champions have had their hit points and melee damages increased. <br />
<br />
- Blademasters now get Evade III at 25th level. <br />
<br />
- We've split the /REALM command into two separate commands: /REALM and /RELIC. The /REALM command gives keep information and the /RELIC command gives relic information. <br />
<br />
- Fixed the level 45 Cabalist class title for females from Sorceress to Master Imbuer <br />
<br />
- Spell damage is now properly attenuated against keep doors - you'll notice that you do much less damage with spells while "attacking" doors now than you used to. Melee damage has always been properly attenuated; now spell damage is as well. <br />
<br />
LOWER LEVEL RVR BATTLEGROUND <br />
<br />
Character levels 30-35 now have the option of going to a special RvR battleground that is limited to characters of those levels. This is being set up as a place to go to hone your RvR skills without needed to worry about being killed by much higher level characters. You do not have to go to this Battleground - if you wish you may still participate in the standard RvR raids and defenses. <br />
<br />
To get to the battlefield, go to your standard Medallion merchant and purchase the medallion that goes to the battlefield. Please note that only people who are 30th - 35th level can teleport, and only those who are realm level 0 to 9 can teleport (realm rank 0 or 1). <br />
<br />
Players who are between 30th-35th level and realm level 0-9 can quit and reenter the battlegrounds normally. If you exceed this range, when you quit and reenter, you'll return to your bindpoint. <br />
<br />
The battleground has one "home" keep for each Realm, and one keep in the middle that can be taken over. Please note that initially this keep is held by renegade NPC guards, and will have to be conquered before it can be claimed by the first Realm to take it over. <br />
<br />
SPELL SYSTEM NOTES <br />
<br />
We've uncovered some pretty large imbalances that greatly reduce the damage that Bolt spells do in the game. So, we've made the following changes Bolt spells: <br />
<br />
- We (greatly) increased the damage that Bolt spells do to monsters, starting at around 40th level. This change should not effect RvR. <br />
<br />
- Remember, it is difficult to cast a bolt on a target that is engaged in melee combat. <br />
<br />
- We've kept the chance for a shield to block a bolt. <br />
<br />
General Spell Changes <br />
<br />
- You'll notice that Epic monsters now resist damage spells more than they did before. <br />
<br />
- All non-area of effect single stat debuffs, double stat debuffs, and resistance debuffs have had their casting times reduced to 2 seconds. <br />
<br />
- We changed confusion spells back to the way they were initially implemented - confused monsters now have a chance of aggressing on other monsters as well as players once again. However, now they will not agress on a monster more than one "color" higher than they (i.e. they will attack oranges, but not reds). <br />
<br />
- The Twinkling Visions line (Mentalist Light spec) has had its range upped to 1500 like all other spec DD spell lines. <br />
<br />
- Sorcerer, Minstrel and Mentalist charms now charm additional monster types at higher levels. The first spell in each line charms humanoids only. The second adds animal type monsters, the third adds insect type monsters, and the fourth adds magical type monsters. This should alleviate some issues with finding pets at different level ranges. <br />
<br />
- Damage add chants (Paladin, Skald, Warden) now stack with base damage add buffs, but only add half damage when stacked. Pet-only damage adds and shields also stack the same way. <br />
<br />
- The Warden has had the higher levels of endurance regen chant changed similar to the Friar; higher levels now give a percent reduction to fatigue costs. <br />
<br />
- Champion stat debuffs have been (much) increased in effectiveness in negating buffs <br />
<br />
- Added group resistance chants for the Paladin, Skald, and Bard: <br />

New Sorcerer/Cabalist Spells <br />
<br />
A new dexterity debuff spell line has been added to the Matter list (base list for Sorcerers and Cabalists): <br />
<br />
8 Mystic Web <br />
12 Mystic Trap <br />
17 Mystic Net <br />
23 Magical Web <br />
29 Magical Trap <br />
36 Magical Net <br />
46 Sorcerous Web <br />
<br />
The Sorcerer's Minor Mesh of Force line in Telekinesis has been converted to a double debuff (Dex/Qui) and had values raised accordingly. All spec debuffs are supposed to be double debuffs, and there was no single dex debuff in a base line, which the other realms have. This and the previous change fixes that. <br />
<br />
Two new spell lines have been added to the Cabalist's Spirit Animation list: <br />
<br />
5 Mend Simulacrum Pet heal <br />
9 Patch Simulacrum <br />
13 Repair Simulacrum <br />
19 Restore Simulacrum <br />
28 Reconstruct Simulacrum <br />
35 Reanimate Simulacrum <br />
44 Rebuild Simulacrum <br />
<br />
4 Improve Dexterity Pet dex buff <br />
8 Develop Dexterity <br />
14 Increase Dexterity <br />
21 Enhance Dexterity <br />
33 Amplify Dexterity <br />
38 Augment Dexterity <br />
48 Magnify Dexterity <br />
<br />
Two new spell lines have been added to the Cabalist's Vivification spell list: <br />
<br />
11 Strengthen Golem Str/Con buff <br />
18 Invigorate Golem <br />
29 Foritify Golem <br />
39 Empower Golem <br />
50 Vivify Golem <br />
<br />
12 Hurry Golem Dex/Qui buff <br />
19 Animate Golem <br />
31 Quicken Golem <br />
41 Accelerate Golem <br />
<br />
These spell lines should significantly enhance pet survivability at higher levels, primarily due to the extra defense from the Quickness and Constitution bonuses. <br />
<br />
- The higher levels of the Cabalist's Convert Spirit line have been removed, as they were essentially identical in functionality. <br />
<br />
GUILD BONUSES AND KEEP CLAIMING <br />
<br />
Guild Bounty Points <br />
<br />
Guilds now have a pool of Guild Bounty Points (GBP's) that it can spend on the claiming and upgrading of claimed keeps. Guilds will earn one GBP per Bounty Point each player in the guild earns. <br />
<br />
GUILDS CLAIMING Frontier Keeps <br />
<br />
Player guilds can now claim a frontier keep for their guild. <br />
<br />
How to Claim Keep: <br />
<br />
1) you must be of a guild rank that has claim permissions. <br />
2) you must be in a full group with 7 other members of your guild. <br />
3) your guild must have at least 500 Guild Bounty Points. (see below) <br />
4) You must be standing next to the Keep Lord of the keep you wish to claim. <br />
5) no other friendly guild can currently be owning it. <br />
6) your guild must not currently own another keep. <br />
7) after all these conditions are met, type /GC CLAIM <br />
<br />
A message is printed to the realm that currently controls an outpost when it is claimed or released. Only realm members of realm level 10 or higher see these messages, or those that belong to the guild. <br />
<br />
To retain control of your keep your guild will be charged 50 Guild Bounty Points per hour for every upgrade level of the keep. The upgrade level is 1 by default when the keep is claimed. When your guild runs out of bounty points, your claim on the keep is released. <br />
<br />
A guild can "step up" the number of GBP's they spend per hour to upgrade the various NPC's of their Keep. The guildmaster (or anyone of a realm rank that has Upgrade permissions) can use the /GC UPGRADE command to upgrade the keep's level. Each Keep will have an "upgrade" level from 1 to 10. Depending on the Keep's upgrade level, the guards, archers, patrollers and keep lord have their combat strength upgraded. An upgraded keep costs additional GBP's to support - 50 per level of upgrade. Thus, the guild will spend from 50 to 500 GBP's per hour. <br />
<br />
To release a claim on a keep, a guild member who is of a rank that has Release privileges can use the /GC RELEASE command (from anywhere in the game). This will stop the hourly charge on your Guild Bounty Points, as well as allow you to claim a new keep. <br />
<br />
Benefits of Owning a Keep: <br />
<br />
- When a guild has claimed a Keep - all members of that guild and all allied guilds will gain certain bonuses when in PVP combat.(see section on Keep Bonuses, below) <br />
<br />
- Each Keep has a 'difficulty' rating from 1 to 5. Those keeps in the guild's home frontier close to the home zones are the lowest difficulty (1). Those keeps deep within enemy territory are the highest difficulty (5). The low difficulty keeps will give very few bonuses. The high difficulty keeps will give the most bonuses. <br />
<br />
- The guild earns (1000 * Keep Difficulty) GRP's per hour that they hold the keep <br />
<br />
- When a guild owns a keep - all guards who spawn in that keep will spawn with the guild's emblem on their cloaks and the tagged with the guild's name. <br />
<br />
- A banner will be placed on the keep with the guild's emblem. <br />
<br />
Keep Bonuses: <br />
<br />
We've added bonuses to PvP combat directly relating to the ownership of the various Frontier Keeps. All of these bonuses, as well as bonuses for the Relics, can be viewed by clicking the Bonuses button on your character sheet (this used to be the Resists page). <br />
<br />
These bonuses only affect PVP melee damage, PVP spell damage, realm point accrual and bounty point accrual. They are: <br />
<br />
- +1% per enemy Keep conquered by your realm in an enemy realm <br />
<br />
- +2%xDIFF if your guild is currently holding a keep (DIFF is the outpost difficulty level 1 to 5) <br />
<br />
- +3%xDIFF if you are defending a keep that your guild alliance is holding <br />
For example, if your realm has conquered 5 outposts in other realms, you'll always receive a +5% bonus no matter where you are. If in addition you are in a guild holding a difficulty 3 keep just across the border, you'll get an additional +6% (total of +11%) bonus no matter where you are. If in addition you are fighting in the name region of your held keep you'll get an additional +9% (total of +20%). <br />
<br />
Listing of Keep Difficulty Levels: <br />
<br />
Note that each keep's difficulty is relative to each Realm. Here is a listing of the keeps and their difficulties. <br />
<br />
Albion Keeps: <br />
Caer Hurbury: Albion=1, Midgard=5, Hibernia=5 <br />
Caer Renaris: Albion=1, Midgard=5, Hibernia=5 <br />

Caer Sursbrooke: Albion=1, Midgard=3, Hibernia=3 <br />

<br />
RELIC BONUSES <br />
<br />
We've increased the bonuses for holding each relic to +10% per relic. Your own Realm's Relics are not longer countted when figuring the bonuses. Thus, if you have both your Relics, and all four enemy Realm Relics, you will have a 20% bonus for both PVE and PVP damages for melee and spells. Note that you are still incented to hold your own relic since you can't claim another relic unless you have your own. For instance if you have your own strength relic and one other strength relic, you'll get +10% to all melee damages. In the worst case, if all your relics are taken, you'll receive no bonuses (and no penalties). Please note that you can now view this bonus information using the new "bonuses" button on your character sheet. <br />
<br />
REALM BONUS FEEDBACK <br />
<br />
We've buffed out the feedback given to players for RvR events: <br />
<br />
- The "resists" button on the character sheet has been changed to "bonuses". The Bonuses window now shows all your resistances and will also show all of the above relic and outpost bonuses when you click on it. <br />
<br />
- When your guild claims a keep, all members of the guild will get a message. <br />
<br />
- When your guild loses a claimed keep, all members of the guild will get a message. <br />
<br />
- When your realm conquers a keep, all members of the realm with at least one realm rank will get a message. <br />
<br />
- When your realm loses or gains a relic, all members of the realm will get a message telling them of the change. <br />
<br />
WORLD NOTES <br />
<br />
The weapon rewards given out for the level 40 guild track quests in Hibernia were overvalued, making them incredibly expensive to repair. Players may now exchange these weapons for the same weapon with the correct value one time only. Players should speak with the following based on their path: <br />
<br />
Morna – Path of Focus: Hero, Ranger, Warden, Eldritch <br />
Odhran – Path of Essence: Champion, Bard, Enchanter, Nightshade <br />
Nairna – Path of Harmony: Blademaster, Druid, Mentalist <br />
<br />
All three can be found in the courtyard at the entrance to the palace in Tir na Nog. <br />
<br />
Midgard Quests: <br />
<br />
Quest – Klippa’s Claw: The journal entry for step 2 is now correct. Players should kill Klippa on step two, not Riv. <br />
<br />
Albion Quests: <br />
<br />
Quest: Save the Spirits: Players who received the item "reward" can now return to Aserod, hand him this item and receive the proper reward. <br />
<br />
Quest: Abolishment of Sacrifice: Lady Nimue has been move slightly towards the shore. She should no longer be swimming in the water and out of sight. <br />
<br />
Hibernia Quests: <br />
<br />
Quest: Seek the Moonstone: The level 15 and 20 encounters have been tweaked slightly to make them a bit more balanced for the target level. <br />
<br />
Albion Encounter:Lyonesse <br />
Power from a pagan god has been bestowed upon Cailleach Uragaig. She now commands the Torch of Light and will use it to protect her sisterhood. Be warned! This Torch of Light is rumored to rain fire from the heavens! <br />
<br />
Midgard Dungeon: Nisse's Lair <br />
Some slight changes have been made to Nisse's Lair. Adventurers should find it less deadly to travel deeper into the dungeon with the addition of clear spots, relatively free of monsters, and the reduction of BAF in some areas. <br />
<br />
Monster Encounters <br />
<br />
Hibernia: Sheeroe Hills: It is rumored that Maldahar has manifested new dark powers. War parties returning from the Sheeroe Hills claim to have heard Maldahar's voice in their head saying that he will steal their life. <br />
<br />
Midgard: Malmohus: It appears that a strange variety of tree spider that was nesting near Yar's home have grown. The spiders appear to only get agitated when adventurers get close to Yar himself. <br />
<br />
Albion: Dartmoor: Moran's guards have been spotted climbing the hill to his east. The guards have been making markings in the cliff wall where Moran has managed to heave boulders. Apparently Moran has been boasting that he could throw a human over the hill there. <br />
<br />

Paladin's get their hp buffed.<br />

Paladins already own armsman in PvE, but yet, paladins STILL whine about being weak in PvP.  So..you want to be god tanks in PvE and just as good in PvP?  Uh..no.<br />
<br />
<br />
Armsman have a little more damage from not having to spec in chants, and now just a little bit more hp.<br />
<br />
Paladins have res, insta-AE taunt heal chants, AF chants, AE Terra chants that stack with Wizard terra buffs, self-AF buffs.<br />

            <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="1">Armsmen are better in combat just for being Armsmen.  This was tested during beta.  Paladins who don't spec in chants but keep their combat skills at Armsman level instead are noticably worse than armsmen.  The Armsman combat tables are just better than the Paladin ones.<br />
<br />
The hitpoint increase (wow, we're not on the exact same hitpoint table as Clerics anymore) was minor so I'd check your facts before declaring that you've only got a small hitpoint advantage over Paladins.<br />
<br />
And don't discount your ranged attack.  I've seen armsmen use it pretty damn effectively and it's got to be nice to be able to pull without standing on top of a mob.</font></p>

Who all still plays DAOC? and what servers?<br />
<br />
Just curious if maybe anyone plays on Kay as I do...<br />
<br />
I found that hibernia early on is much harder to level IMO then midgaard or alb but thats just because of sheer numbers theres tons more people playing in those other 2 realms...<br />
<br />
But (at least on my server) even though we are at a numbers disadvantage we have AWESOME leaders for the guilds and alliance so we own Albs and midgaard's only tatic against us is get 150 people and try to storm us which fails many times...<br />

I stopped playing awhile back (well, when my home computer died) and haven't started back up again.  My husband has though, although he said that Albion was the pits when he tried to play my theurgist...  He's playing on Nimue instead.  I may go back to playing, not sure though.  I think I'm a bit burned out on video games right now... That battleground area does sound neat though.</font></p>

<br />
On my server it's kinda hard to tell whose winning and whose losing...<br />
<br />
Hibernia (me) has the Alb power relic <br />
Midgaard has the Alb Strength Relic<br />
Alb has no relics<br />
<br />
Now you may so well DUH albs are losing but see albs really aren't them and middies both stomp our ass DAILY...<br />
<br />
They start taking our forts every day and we have to wait around to mass people because our numbers aren't equal to albs and mids...<br />
<br />
For every like 1 person we have albs have 3 more and mids have 4 more...<br />
<br />
REally makes winning for us hard (which I like a challenge)<br />
<br />
The reason we have a relic and are doing so well is our Alliance commanders are obviously better then the Zerg rushing commanders from the other 2 realms...<br />
<br />
They may take over some forts (due to their sheer numbers over us) but once we get 30 people to fight there 60+ we almost ALWAYS win.<br />
<br />
Right now we are working assault tatics on midgaard to take their Power relic so then we will have all 3 power...<br />
<br />
if we accomplish that our realm will be extremely more powerful<br />
<br />
P.S. I love druids in this game =)</font></p>
