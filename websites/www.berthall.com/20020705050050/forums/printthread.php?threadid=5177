Project Entropia Open Beta!</b></p>

<p>PROJECT ENTROPIA LAUNCHES INTO COMMERCIAL OPEN TRIAL<br>
<br>
Gothenburg, Sweden . May 20th, 2002 . Hundreds of thousands of gamers have been  asking for months to test Project Entropia. Their calls have been answered.  The Commercial Open Trial enables them to download the software worldwide.<br>
<br>
"The virtual universe of Project Entropia is ever-evolving, so features will  constantly be added and enhanced" says MindArk Managing Director  Jan Welter Timkrans. "But now is the time to let the public in to experience an  amazing product that has been over three years in the making".<br>
<br>
Project Entropia is the largest virtual universe ever devised, where millions  of computer users will be able to interact with each other at the same time.  It takes the term .Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. to a whole  new level. This ever-evolving universe offers a world of opportunity for gamers  and non-gamers alike.<br>
<br>
If adventure is the name of the game, set out and explore the vast wilderness of  planet Calypso. Encounter the native wildlife, mutants and robots or embark on  an expedition in this lost paradise. If untamed nature has no appeal, the cities  offer immense virtual playgrounds that mimic real life. There are opportunities  to socialize with friends, fall in love, own and decorate a home, become an  entrepreneur, even turn a profit. A profit in real money. Project Entropia  incorporates a unique economic system, which allows users to exchange real life  money into PED (Project Entropia Dollars) for use inside the virtual world and  then back into real currency again. It is much like the process of traveling in  the real world. This sets Project Entropia apart from the competition, as it is  completely free of charge and purchase. There are no monthly costs aside from  the fees charged for local access to the Internet. The software will be  downloadable through the Internet. The start-up costs will be next to nil for  most people. It is really that easy. <br>
<br>
MindArk Supervisory Board Chairman Benny Iggland says, "Project Entropia is unlike  any other MMORPG on the market, People have the opportunity to make real money and  become financially successful in a virtual world".<br>
<br>
The world of Project Entropia is set to take you on an epic journey far into the  future where you can help shape the creation of an entire civilization, the next  foundation in the mankind quest of prosperity. Take the journey. Experience the  future today.

<p>I wonder if that game will survive or not.  That's a pretty daring concept they have.  (Pay real cash for items and real cash for repairing items.)<br>
<br>
<br>
But other than that, there are no monthly fees.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On top of that, I wonder if it is possible to play the game without ever spending any money..</p>

<p>Well, did you at least get a good look at it?  I keep forgetting to check the website, so I don't even know what the graphics look like.<br>
<br>
You should have expected to have to wait some.  Everyone seems to have the idea that being one of the people logged in on opening day makes them a better person.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Well, it took me a couple days to get in, and I couldn't leave my room.  logged out..<br>
<br>
A couple days later, tried again, got out of the room.  and started running around the city, looked ok, but was very sporatic/choppy.  Didn't have a clue on how to fight so I logged out again.  Haven't been back since.<br>
<br>
They need to fix that lag problem, I seen maybe 3 different people running around as well.  I'd hate to see it with 1000+ people on.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p><b> 
well</b></p>

<p>i didnt hear of this game before and i downloaded it which took forever and then tried to play it.  Graphics arent great.  The few minutes i was in the city it  looked like Anarchy Online with worse graphics.  And i dont care about getting in the first day, just tried.  Besides you would think they would have something to ensure taht pretty much everyone can.  Seeing as this is not the first MMORPG.  Oh well they never seem to work right away.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->
