<p><b> [Tholuxe Paells] Eternal Sovereign is recruiting</b></p>

<p>Let me take a second to introduce myself I am Sage Linkagge Kablooey of Eternal Sovereign from the Tholuxe Paells Server.  Eternal Sovereign is one of the oldest guilds on Tholuxe, we have arguably one of the best reputations on the server and are pushing full steam ahead to get into the Plane of Time. Right now Most classes are open for recruiting, and we would like to extend that invitation to you. Please visit our website<br />
<br />
 <a href="http://www.eternalsovereign.org" target="_blank">http://www.eternalsovereign.org</a> <br />
<br />
You would also need to do the proper procedure to move your character by reading the terms on which you may move servers and fill out the application to get the process started.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions please ;tell tholuxe.linkagge or ;tell tholuxe.tudana <br />
<br />
Basically we want loyal people who can raid in EST prime time and want to enjoy the game. The Guild is currently raiding PoP Elemental Planes with some runs into GoD. We have been sucessful in killing Xegony and Fennin with Rathe and Corinav in our sights which will flag the majority of the guild Plane of Time. Applicants should have or be working towards getting EP Flags. Questions concerning admissions may be directed to the recruitment contacts in game. Tudana or Linkagge Status (Mar 22, 2004): <br />
<br />
Applications are currently Open for the following Classes : <br />
<br />
Cleric, Paladin, Rogue, Monk, Enchanter, Shaman, Wizard, Bard ,Berserker, Magician <br />
<br />
We are looking for players that are willing to give time for the continued progression of Eternal Sovereign. This means we want newer members that will be logging in 4 times a week or more from 7pm to 12am EST. <br />
<br />
Applications from other classes may be considered, but gaining membership while in a closed class is much more difficult. If you want to talk in game /join esrecruit:sexy Recruitment Contacts: Tudana, Linkagge <br />
<br />
A few restrictions: <br />
<br />
Single Applications Only - While we appreciate interest from groups of friends, each person will be individually considered. <br />
<br />
Recruited Class - You are being recruited based on the guild`s need for a particular class. You are expected to play that class as your main character, so apply with the character you intend/want to play. <br />
<br />
Applications with Other Guilds - While we understand you may be looking for the guild that best fits you and your playstyle, we will not consider your application to Eternal Sovereign if you have an open application with another guild. <br />
<br />
Minimum Flag Requirements - None at the moment. However, the suggested minimum flags are: POJ Trial,BOT, Grummus, AD, TT and MB. The closer you are to meeting this, the less stressful your first few months in the guild will be. <br />
<br />
Additional Remarks Meeting the level and class restrictions are not the only requirements for admission. You will be evaluated by the membership based on your performance and demeanor during raids. During voting, members are asked to give greater weight to how you would fit into the group dynamic, far more so than class, level or benefit to the guild. ES is one of the oldest guilds on the server. The majority of members have been friends for a long time and the friendships come first. How you will affect the stability and atmosphere within the guild is a primary concern. <br />
<br />
ES is not a power gamers` guild. Raids are not mandatory and we try to maintain a casual atmosphere. Our primary goal is guild advancement, that is we are trying to progress as far into the endgame as possible without losing the friendly atmosphere that has defined ES over the last two years. Unfortunately, there are some considerations that have to be made to continue guild advancement in the endgame. So, if you choose to be a strictly casual player, these considerations will have an impact on you. <br />
<br />
We qualify loot based on attendance. If you want to loot items that have significant impact on your character and guild ability, you will be expected to participate in raids and other activities. Very nice items will still be available for the casual player. But, the higher the investment into a player, the higher the return the guild expects to receive. Please ask an officer for an explanation of our loot system if you have questions about this. If you are interested in joining, there are a few things you need to know. Raids are dependent on who is available on any given night. If we don`t have the people to kill mob X, we may look for another target or just decide to let everyone go experience. <br />
<br />
Generally we try to maintain as little pressure to raid as possible. That`s not to say we don`t raid. Most weeks will see at least five nights of raiding,<br />
<br />
We really look forward to seeing you on Tholuxe and seeing you application. <br />
<br />
What are you waiting for do it TODAY</p>

<p>Is it just me, or is every off server guild trying to recruit from Bertoxx?  Seriously, this is the 3rd time someone has asked this in something like a month.<br />
