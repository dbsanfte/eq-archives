Version 1.37 Release Notes</b></p>

<p>(This was stolen from elsewhere hehe)<br>
<br>
============================================= <br>
Dark Age of Camelot <br>
Version 1.37 Release Notes (Parody) <br>
November 26, 2001 <br>
============================================= <br>
<br>
ANNOUNCEMENTS <br>
============= <br>
<br>
- When we implied that Hibernia is the "Magical Realm", it was just a compliment on how much it looks like Disney World. Please submit all complaints to <a href="mailto:trashbin@mythicentertainment.com">trashbin@mythicentertainment.com</a> <br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br>
======================== <br>
- Increased "wander" range of Viking Jarls and Knight Commanders. Their running speed was also slightly increased, as there were reports of the combination of speed song + sprint + praying could escape insta-death. <br>
<br>
- Bows were removed from the skill list of Scouts/Rangers/Hunters. A new skill, hand-to-hand, has been implemented for balancing. The timer for hand-to-hand is 10 seconds. Critical Hand Strike has not yet been implemented. <br>
<br>
- Icons for weapon skills have been changed to have a "happier" look. Including smiley faces, gumdrops, and pink bunnies. <br>
<br>
- Fort keep doors will now regenerate on their own. A lvl 5 rogue class NPC vendor will spawn with an unlimited stack of wood, at signs of an invader. <br>
<br>
- Fort guards can now accept directions to attack invaders. Target the guard, type "/attack <Invader's name>", and the guard you're hiding behind employs a seek-and-destroy routine. <br>
<br>
- Area effect mezzes and stuns have been given to all Midgard and Albion melee classes. Hibernia mezzes will break if the original caster moves. <br>
<br>
- Consignment tasks now stop at 100 to curtail the profit making from tradeskills. <br>
<br>
- We actually have an employee at Mythic who plays in Hibernia, we promise! Oops, we fired him. Now accepting applications for janitor's apprentice. <br>
<br>
- Stealth detection radius has been decreased. You will now have to be within kissing range to spot an enemy stealther. <br>
<br>
- An exploit to hack the zone walls has been found, as well as an exploit to camp near the border forts to be invulnerable as you pass through the gates. Instead of punishing the offenders, we gave them lollipops. <br>
<br>
- /APPEAL should now function correctly. Your appeal will be deleted on submission, and any attempts to submit more will result in a name change within 7 to 14 days. <br>
<br>
- The group window refreshes correctly now. <br>
<br>
<br>
OBJECT NOTES <br>
============ <br>
- Shields have all been reset to be created using bronze metals. Thank the new janitor's apprentice for his attention to detail! <br>
<br>
- Itemized remaining Midgard dungeons. More Midgard dungeons are being planned for the future. <br>
<br>
<br>
WORLD NOTES <br>
=========== <br>
Midgard: <br>
<br>
- New dungeon, Uberize, has been added inside West Svealand and itemized with 90af - 210 af armor, and weapons with 30dps/2.1spd. Level ranges approximately 5 to 30. <br>
<br>
- New horse routes, and vendor, have been added from your Emain Macha fort that lead directly to Hibernian strongholds in Emain Macha, Briefine, Mt. Collory, and Cruachan Gorge. The Hibernian frontier is just way too treacherous for travel. <br>
<br>
Albion: <br>
<br>
- New horse routes, and vendor, have been added from your Emain Macha fort that lead directly to Hibernian strongholds in Emain Macha, Briefine, Mt. Collory, and Cruachan Gorge. The Hibernian frontier is just way too treacherous for travel. <br>
<br>
Hibernia: <br>
<br>
- Added spraggonoogs, spraggonugs, spraggonips to the Silvermine Mountains region. <br>
<br>
- Guards at the Druim Ligen border fort have been replaced with grey spectres. <br>
<br>
- A new vendor, Mouse O'Mickey, can be found in Tir na Nog. Mouse will sometimes do vanishing acts, and lead you to such notorious NPC's such as Mavelle, Blaighseach, "that tradeskills guy", and the shield merchant. <br>
<br>
<br>
SPELL CHANGES <br>
============= <br>
- Debuffs now debuff the original caster, instead of the target. <br>
<br>
- Pets will now help invaders eat their owner. <br>
<br>
- Void damage output has been slightly decreased.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

__________________<br>
<b>I Am A:</b> Neutral Good Elf Ranger Paladin<br>
<br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Neutral Good</b> characters believe in the power of good above all else. They will work to make the world a better place, and will do whatever is necessary to bring that about, whether it goes for or against whatever is considered 'normal'.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Elves</b> are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.<br>
<br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Rangers</b> are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.<br>
<br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Paladins</b> are the Holy Warriors. They have been chosen by a God/dess to be their representative on Earth, and must follow the code of that deity, or risk severe penalties. They tend towards being righteous, but not generally to excess.</smalfont>

__________________<br>
<b>I Am A:</b> True Neutral Halfling Fighter<br>
<br><br><b>True Neutral</b> characters are very rare. They believe that balance is the most important thing, and will not side with any other force. They will do whatever is necessary to preserve that balance, even if it means switching allegiances suddenly.<br>
<br><br><b>Halflings</b> are short and fat, like minuature people. (Think 'Hobbits') They enjoy the easy life, but aren't averse to the idea of an adventure from time to time. They get along with all races, and are known for their senses of humor. Halflings also tend to be light of foot, and can move quietly when necessary.<br>
<br><br><b>Fighters</b> are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.<br>
