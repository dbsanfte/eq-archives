<p><b> Rules for executioner trial in PoJ</b></p>

<p>After seeing a group of 6 show up for trial and all 6 get on the list and all 6 go in 6 times, I was inspired to come up with some rules for the trials.<br />
<br />
How about the same person can't go in twice in a row.  <br />
<br />
Also, how about if a group isn't ready they get moved to the end of the list, not next on the list.<br />
<br />
So frustrating having one rude group waste literally hours of others time.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have thoughts?  Oh,  and as to how to enforce these rules, same as with any other player based rules. If the majority agree that they are fair then peer pressure is used to enforce them.<br />

<p>the list goes, once you fail, you go back of the list again. that's how it works. if you dont like it, do another trial. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>So, a group can zone in and add it self 6 times and you think this is just fine and dandy?  Who came up with that system?  No one, it's just how it began and no one ever got around to making anything better.  Time to come up with something better because people have started abusing it.<br />

<p>People started abusing it right when they found out what it was for.  Solution?  put your 6 group members on the list, and deal with it.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

Win the freakin trial the first time you do it like I was lucky enough to do. I know people who have lost it over 20 times.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>One problem that was slowing this down when I got my flag, and thats people waiting until its their turn before starting to buff.  Then everyone is foced to wait for them to med.  Course.. the group that is behind them isnt ready either as they have just started buffing too.<br />
 Come on folks.. you know where you are in the list, at least start buffing so that you are ready when its your turn.   Yea, the ones in front could win, but with the failure rate being about 1 success to 10 or more failures (pure guess on what Ive seen) you got damn good odds of making sure you are ready.<br />

<p>I think one of the reason why you see same players in different group(s) is because they are either there to help out other group(s) that does not have a complete group. Or, they are there to mix and match to find the best DPS group they could form. <br />
<br />
The bottom line is, majority of those people are there to help other people.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for me, I have great friends who helped me out during the off peak hour.<br />
<br />
I do agree with what Tomiam said though. People on the list should start buffing earlier to save everyone time and frustration.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough (/cough) to run the list for about 14 hours. It is a pain in the ass, and some folks don't like it no matter how you do it. <br />
<br />
<br />
There are people who put every person in their group on the list, and those that, at lvl53, put themselves on the list without a group and just kind of hope they get lucky. There is a lot of group jumping and helping others to give everyone a decent shot at succeeding.<br />
<br />
The solution I threatened to implement (but never did) when too many started bitching about my rules (you know, like actually being there) was that I would do it all in the raid setup. And if you did not have a full group present, as such in the raid, and were not stealing folks from other groups to complete yours, you were not on the list.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the zerg comment….huh?<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Um, duh. People tend to die more to the trials than they suceed. They go in and wipe, over and over. Perhaps lemming fest would be a more appropriate term?</p>

<p>I'd been wondering about the zerg comment too...perhaps we need to define the term.<br />
<br />
To zerg something is to simply rush it with a much larger force than would be necessary if you used strategy and skill.  By zerging a mob, you're hoping that there are enough people present that 2/3 or more of your raid force can end up dead yet you still get the kill.<br />
<br />
For instance, a six man group of level 30 characters could assault a sand giant in the Oasis and have a reasonable chance at success.  However, 30 level 20's would swarm the giant, hoping to do enough damage to kill it before the last man falls.<br />
<br />
See the difference?<br />
<br />
Now, the trials are not a zerg fest.  They're not even a lemming event, because in my experience, although you may fail many times, you usually don't die a lot unless it hits the fan.  Most groups tend to fail during the 4 waves by not killing the mobs fast enough--getting killed during this part should be pretty rare.  It's only in the (making this number up) 10% or so that make it to the final mob that you're going to encounter lots of deaths...<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>People obviously have a misconception that zerging requires large numbers.</p>
