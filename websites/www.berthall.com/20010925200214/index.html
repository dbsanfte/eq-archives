PATCH MESSAGE, SEPTEMBER 25, 2001 <br>
Spell Changes<br>
<br>
We have removed the changes to bard song stacking that were made with the recent emergency patch. We will be reviewing those changes for possible update in a future patch. <br>
Item Changes<br>
<br>
The Shaman Epic effect has been returned to its previous effect (and it should conflict with fewer Damage over Time spells, as was the intention for the change made last patch). <br>
Quest Changes<br>
<br>
Ivory Sky Diamond is now dropping as it should. <br>
Fixed an error in a Stonebrunt quest where an NPC was handing out the wrong reward. <br>
Miscellaneous<br>
<br>
Added some code that might fix a bug with female hair and Erudite hoods that caused them to fail to appear sometimes when a helmet was removed. This would cause some characters to look as though the back of their head was missing at times. <br>
Mouselook will now work a little differently when in the first two third-person camera modes (overhead and chase). They will work similarly to first-person mouselook (i.e. your character's heading will change when you move the mouse left or right, the left and right movement keys will cause your player to strafe, and the camera angle will pitch up or down when you move the mouse forward or back). These changes should make those first two third-person camera modes more useful. <br>

<i><b>got this in my email and wanted to share it.</i></b><br>
<br>
**********************************<br>
Hello, my name is Mike Giles and I am a resident of Atlanta, GA.  Like many of you, I have donated to the Red Cross online via Amazon.  I have given blood.  I still feel helpless in what has happened and what I can do to help.  I hope that this act will be symbol of how we as a nation can stand together and bring light to the darkness.<br>
<br>
This is a time of darkness.  Darkness from terrorism, darkness from fear, and darkness from anger.  In the wake of the unspeakable act, that was commited on the US on September 11th, a light has shown brightly throughout the nation in the hearts of it's people.  The United States has been blessed with a collection of people who have proven that, in the face of disaster, pety problems can be put aside. Our nation has come together to donate money, blood, and sweat without hesitation.<br>
<br>
My plea goes out to others that wish to continue to push the darkness  back.<br>
<br>
Many people have come to our country seeking the light.  The light of hope, the light of dreams, and <br>
the light of freedom.  Let us now come together and create a light across America showing that we <br>
can not and will not allow the darkness to surround us.<br>
<br>
Let us stretch out an extension of the light that the Statue of Liberty has provided as a beacon of <br>
freedom for those shrouded in the darkness.<br>
<br>
One week from the tragedy, on Sept 18th, at 11:00pm EST, point your floodlights, flashlights, and <br>
candles into the sky above and show that this darkness will not stop the light of freedom from shining in our home.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
<br>
Date:  Sept 18th, 2001<br>
Time:  11:00 pm EST (8:00 pm PST, just after sunset)<br>
Where: Outside<br>
What:  Shine your lights to the sky!<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Please forward this to as many people as you can.  If you run a web site, please post this letter <br>
on your site.  If you know any news sources, please forward this letter to them also.  Please, just <br>
get the word out!<br>
<br>
**************************************<br>
<br>
<b><i>i recieved this in email today, which is related to the above.</i></b><br>
<br>
10:30 EASTERN TIME.... 9:30 Central, 8:30 Mountain, 7:30 Pacific<br>
 <br>
 I  just heard on the radio that the U.S. has asked that everyone step out on their lawns tonight at 10:30 and light a candle.  They will be taking a satellite picture of the U.S. and posting it on the news tomorrow morning. <br>
<br>
Please pass this on to as many people as possible.<br>

The staff here at Berthall would like to let our users know our thoughts are with those effected by the events of the past 24 hours. Of course everyone was effected, but there are members of the Bertoxx community who live in the areas hit, and possibly even work in the WTC buildings or Pentagon, or might have been on one of those planes. Our thoughts and hearts go out to you in this time. Berthall is a community, with members, friends and loved ones spread out all over the world. I think almost everyone is shaken by the horror we have seen. To those who have lost friends or loved ones, or still do not know, our deepest sympathies are with you. The events from the past day will burn in our memories for the rest of our lives. I would like everyone to take a moment of silence, or perhaps say a prayer to whatever higher power you believe in for those effected by these events. <br>

Be Safe, <br>

Spell Changes<br>
<br>
-Changed all enchanter mesmerization spells so that they overwrite Screaming Terror <br>
-Changed Shaman epic effect (Curse of the Spirits) so that it would not conflict with certain Damage over Time spells. <br>
-The Emissary of Thule Necromancer pet is now immune to fear <br>
-Beneficial buffs that don't have an ability drain component on them can now be clicked off. <br>
<br>
<br>
Miscellaneous Updates<br>
<br>
-The server selection screen now only gives information on whether or not a server is up instead of providing player counts. In addition, the "count" option on the /who command has been restricted to internal personnel. Servers on the server selection screen are still ordered from least-populated to most populated in order to assist players in choosing the least populated server. <br>
-Harla Dar has been repaired (this happened sometime earlier than today, but we wanted you to know). <br>
-Reactivated broken zone line between Qeynos to the Sewers. A dead halfling was stuck in the drainpipe and has been removed. <br>
-Fixed a long-standing bug that was causing Feign Death to fail when several characters were on the NPC's hate list along with the character using Feign Death. We'd like to extend much thanks to the monk community who helped us track this one down. Also fixed a problem with the monk's 'Block' skill which inadvertantly was recapped at a lower than normal skill level in recent months. Kudos to "Faned" of the "Monkly Business" bulletin board who brow-beat Gordon with the facts until he gave in and looked at the code :) <br>
-As announced earlier this week, the Belt of the Cenobite was made useable by some inappropriate classes/races in the last patch. This has been corrected. <br>
-Several quest components in zones with the Trivial Loot Code will now be lootable regardless of level. <br>

Norrathian News<br>
<br>
Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers. Citizens rush to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and community news for their hometowns.<br>
<br>
<br>
Announcing Test of Tactics III<br>
<br>
Yes you heard right, Test of Tactics will be making its return to the lands of Norrath in October and November. This event will present teams of 18 members in a battle to the death.

<br>
So, they only listen to the already overpowered who don't NEED anything at all to boost them up further into that realm.  Guess they forgot about Ranger's defense, Knight offense skills, and Bard's hit points remember to increase them Verant!<br>
<br>
Hey ya know I thought Feign Death was given to Monks because of their lower AC?  Hmm, seems to me they have more AC than Warriors, putting them up with the most in the game.  Why do they need an evade death skill again?  Why do they need a "parry" of 230 when mobs miss them more than they miss Warriors?<br>
<br>
Thanks for being to helpful and biased, Verant.  You're just getting me closer and closer to going to DAoC and deleting everything I worked hard for over two years.  I've almost had enough of your @#$%ing game.<br>
<br>
Unless they do something at Luclin... See ya.</td>

While we do not require people stay in charactor (We all have lives, feelings, etc that sometimes show through) we encourage roleplay, and we are a guild dedicated to playing "the genre" - i.e. fantasy and not Quake.   Its a very family feel - people help each other without making demands for help upon others.   We are a small guild, so will be reliant upon the good graces of other guilds for any Raids.  However, if you want to join a good clean guild - come look us up.   Oh did i mention we have been around since the begining of the server? Original members still with us since April of 1999 :)   <br>

Greetings all.<br>
<br>
I really dont know how to start this post, and to express it in English doesnt make it easier either. However, this is definately the sadest news I was ever asked to give out.<br>
<br>
Rabenherz' wife called me this early morning. Usually I have always been very happy to hear their voices, but when I realized that she was trying to hold back the tears I knew what happened.<br>
<br>
Our friend and favourite troubadour Rabenherz left us yesterday evening at 8 pm CET.<br>
<br>
Some of us knew that Rabenherz was struggling with the cancer for over 2 years now. I never heard him complaining in any way. He always held up the hope and was willing to beat the cancer. I always believed that he would make it and prayed for his sanity. <br>
Though we cant always understand the way things happen or why they happen, we have to keep up the hope and faith. Let`s keep Rabenherz in our minds and within our hearts for the friend he has been and will always be.<br>
<br>
I know that Everquest, Phantom Raiders and all the friends he found in game meant a lot to Rabenherz and helped him to bear with the situation as far as it was possible.<br>
<br>
"Always look on the bright side of life", *whistle whistle*<br>
<br>
Im sure that Rabenherz would have reminded us of his favourite words at this point.<br>
<br>
Farewell dear Rabbi and may God always watch your travels.<br>
<br>

On Friday August 24th, 2001 Defenders of Aleria lost a valued friend and family member.  Daniel Harb succumbed to a heart condition on that day and has made his journey to a better place.<br>
<br>
Worlaor was known as "The AFK Warrior" as he always seemed to be AFK.  Though his physical heart may have been weak, in the spiritual sense Daniel had the heart of a thousand bears and he showed it by being a kind and generous friend to all that had the priveledge of encountering him.  Our sympathies and our prayers go out to the friends and family of Daniel.  We have grown to love Daniel and we share the pain of your loss with you.<br>
<br>
This is a piece of artwork dedicated to Daniel and his memory.<br>

As Clan Ta'Varen was in HoT and heard about the  "emergency patch" that was up and comming later in the night, we rushed to kill several main targets so that we would have a respawn after the patch. <br>
<br>
 In an amazing amount of stamina CTV took down Lendi the Keeper , Doz, King Tormax and the Vindi. The duel weilding statue proved to be too much of a challange as people had to log and tend to the PL past time of sleeping and going to work!<br>
<br>
 We can expect that today the same targets will be shot down as well as we home the Statue. Huge Congrats to all of the loot winners!<br>

August 22nd, 3:00 am <br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
** Crashing Bug Fixes **<br>
<br>
- Fixed the problem that was causing zones to crash in some instances.<br>
- Corrected a bug that would cause some people to hang up while waiting for a sound event between the splash and character-select screens.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Item Change **<br>
<br>
- The Green Flower should be working again.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Spell Change **<br>
<br>
- Fixed a stacking bug that allowed multiple Levitation buffs to stack.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Sullon Zek Changes **<br>
<br>
- The Resist code changes we made with the last patch should be working properly now. Here is the text about that change:<br>
<br>
"Changed the way resists are calculated when a Player Character casts a spell on another Player Character on Sullon Zek. Resist modifiers based on level will now be more smoothly distributed and will allow lower level characters a slightly better chance to land spells on higher level characters. At the same time giving lower level characters a slightly better chance to resist spells cast on them by higher level characters."<br>
<br>
- Cancel Magic spells should now work across teams.<br>
- Characters should no longer disappear when Mesmerized or stunned.</td>
