<p>Drug addicts and smokers are the people I respect the least on this planet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think if the world ever starts allowing the testing of deadly viruses on people, such as Smallpox or Ebola, all druggies, smokers, and convicts should be the first to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've met too many idiots that smoke weed to ever even show a tiny bit of respect to one.  <br />
<br />
<br />
And before you say there's a lot of normal people out there who smoke (Maybe even intellegent), the vast majority of those people are complete burn outs who have IQs of less than 90.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can post a decent arguement that isn't "because it's fun/feels good" I'll give and vote legalize it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or you can save yourself the effort and just not post because it won't ever happen.</p>

<p>First, gotta say that I hope no one would be so lame as to vote twice if they have two accounts here <img src="/forums/images/smilies/chomp.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br />
<br />
Second, when you get into legal matters, free will only goes so far.  It is ridiculous to have consensual crimes (which is what smoking pot is), but there are laws which fly in the face of free will that make sense in the grander scheme.<br />
<br />
I do believe that marijuana should be legalized, for several reasons.<br />
<br />
1) As Reapin stated, do what you want with your body, I don't care.  Your choice.<br />
<br />
2) Marijuana isn't illegal because it's a drug...well, it is, but there's more to it than that.  Lumber companies played a big part via lobbying to get marijuana illegalized (hehe, is that a word?) in the first place; lumber companies and cotton farmers still lobby to keep it illegal.  Why?  Because 1 acre of hemp can produce as much paper as four acres of trees--imagine what hemp paper would do to the profits of lumber companies!  Because hemp clothing is more durable and cheaper to make than cotton--again, imagine what that would do to cotton farmers!<br />
<br />
3) Marijuana is far less destructive than alcohol, which is legal.  I've never known anyone who beat up their wife and kids, shot someone, got in a bar fight, etc after smoking a couple joints.<br />
<br />
4) The fact that drugs are illegal is what causes most of the problems with them.  You think people would be killing each other if drugs were legal?  No, because they wouldn't be the big money business that they are.  Many kids take drugs because it is illegal--it's a great way to rebel, and it's fun at the same time!  If drugs weren't illegal, more people would be likely to seek help for their addictions--as it is, the social stigma associated with drug users keeps some from getting help they need.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p><b> </b></p>

<p><---- Votes yes.... laughs as he sees the poll at an even 50/50 afterwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why?... Well I'm going to approach this from a purely monatery standpoint.<br />
<br />
The war on drugs must cost... I don't know, an assload of money... 'Small time' drug busts (And by small time, I mean 'light' drugs... 50 pounds of pot, to me, isn't as bad as 2 pounds of heroin) make up a LOT of these busts.<br />
<br />
I quite often flip through the tv at late hours, catch cops on court TV, and see some older southern black man pulled over... The cop searches him and pulls out a marijuana pipe...<br />
<br />
'Is this all you got? Where's your crack? You only smoke weed in this? I don't believe you, where're you keeping it stashed? I'm trying to help you man, but you've got to help me out, where's the dope? Where're you hiding it?'<br />
<br />
After about half an hour of this... <br />
<br />
'Well... Couldn't find anything else on him, but I can clearly see there's some resin in his pipe, so i'm gonna bring him in for possession of that..'<br />
<br />
The cop then strikes a 'badass' pose (You know, sunglasses on, facing the wind, hands on hips in a superguy fashion) and goes 'Yup, score another one for the good guys' Then they go to commercial.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, stick with me here.... Think of how much money it takes to haul that poor guy in, treat him like sh...crap until he gets his day in court, to have a judge throw the book at him since he might've been a petty thief in the past and stolen some beer, then send him to prison.<br />
<br />
How much money? <b> A FRIGGIN LOT </b>... And the deficit goes up and up and UPUPUPUPUPUPUP with the war now.<br />
<br />
I'm using imaginary figures here since i'm not too too saavy on the subject, but say it costs 150 dollars to get enough pot to roll 20 joints or so.... It couldn't cost more then 20 dollars or so to GROW that same ammount.<br />
<br />
<br />
So the government grows the stuff, (Quality controlled no less... no people spraying raid on it or adding chemicals and stuff to get people higher so they'll want it more... and all the while doing SERIOUS harm to them), packages it like cigarettes... I can see it now.. '20 class A marijuana cigarettes', and here's the big thing... <b> TAXES THE LIVING HELL OUT OF IT </b>.. But at the same time, it costs far less then it would from a dealer nowadays.<br />
<br />
So the consumer pays maybe... I'll just use half... 75 dollars for that pack of joints...<br />
<br />
And instead of using so much governmental money to persecute the poor old guy smoking his pot and drinking his beer, they start RAKING IN money from it hand over fist, and everyone is(should be) happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess growing it could be controlled too, since you can buy and drink beer, but you can't brew it in your own home legally I don't think(or sans permit).... I still think all the hippies would be happy if the government made it legal to have, to smoke, but NOT to grow (so they can get the money, afterall)...<br />
<br />
<br />
And just think... after that... no more 'You got the money?' 'You got the stuff?' '<b> DO </b> you have the money?' 'Yeah yeah, it's right here, where's the stuff?' *<b> BLAM! BLAM! </b>* *tires screeching* deaths..... well, over pot anyway.<br />
<br />

<br />
you are a tool, you can sit in an air tight compact car.. say a neon for example, this neon could be completly air tight, you could have 4 people in this car (dont think you can fit anymore in a neon) driver sparks a joint, passenger sparks a joint, kid sittin back left or right sparks up a bowl. everybody finishes. damn cant see a dang thing. ask the kid that didnt participate, hey man are you high, nope.<br />
<br />
its known that when you smoke marijuana, THC (ya know the stuff that gets you high, tard) is much heavier than the smoke itself, and it instantly drops to the ground, or to your lungs, wherever the smoke is going origionally. this kid would not get high unless you physically took a big ass hit, held it in your mouth, and blew it all into his mouth for him to inhale.<br />
<br />
Trazier made a lot of good points, as did Reapin. Our country is free, but only a little. there are countries out there that have more freedom than us, of course sure were nearly the biggest, were the toughest, were the richest, i wonder how that came to be, not because we provided little freedom, because our United States background is made from Great Hero's, Scandalous businessmen, and slavery. We made ourselves the best by being an Imperialist country, jumping in every trade route, and war we could.<br />
<br />
Now the fact people get arrested for smoking, possessing or selling marijuana is ridiculous. Selling marijuana i can 100% agree it can get dangerous with the wrong crowd of people. Jails are very sadly over-crowded, by legalizing marijuana tax payers wouldnt be paying the assload of money they do to keep these people fed, clean, and alive in jail. legalizing cannibus would clear the jail problem, of course i think there should be some regulations such as, how much you smoke a day, quality, age, and so on. the only way for it to work would be like that, everybody knows so.<br />
 <br />
should it be legalized? sure, government should make 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% THC marijuana (as we all know cannibus doesnt contain but 20-30% thc, danks go up to the 40-50% range) offer to sell them in packs either like what we buy now, joint, dime, 20, quad, half, oz, qp, and so on.. or like Trazier said, like ciggaretts.<br />
<br />
But the thing that should be said is that no matter the consequences, weather it is legalized or not, people will still smoke weed, they will still sell it, weather the government would like to tax, and sell it to make hella cash. lay down some restrictions and make for a more or less happier country, then so be it.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I don't smoke, don't drink, and don't do drugs. Never have never will. Smoking anything is the most disgusting thing you could possibly do to yourself and personally I don't like the taste of alcohol. Anyways, I voted yes because "the forbidden fruit is always the sweetest." If it's not legal, kids will feel like they have to do it to be rebellious like teens should be. Marijuana use might increase for a while when kids realize omfg! let's permabake ourself we r elite stonerz!!! But after that affect wears off and they think nah, we don't gotta smoke today we can smoke any day we want now... they won't feel as great a desire to smoke.<br />

<p>The problem with America is that the Christians here try to enforce their morality. Kind of funny really (or pathetic depending how you look at it) since part of their religion is about free will and dealing with the consequences with their God.. <br />
<br />
 Yet they take it apon themselves to destroy people because they imbibe a plant that their god supposedly made for us to enjoy. Correct me if I am wrong but no where in the bible does it mention smoking herb is against God or bad in anyway. Besides humans have been smoking it for Tens of thousands of years, its a natural thing to do and part of the human heritage.<br />
<br />
And smoking pot is just  one example of some of the basic freedoms denied people here in america because of the christian right.<br />
<br />
Euthanasia, Abortion, Drinking Alcohol, sexual preference, freedom from religion and prostitution. All of the laws that that make these things illeagal are forced on the rest of society mainly by the christian faction here in the west. They would rather people suffer or have their religion shoved down peoples throats rather than acting humanely. <br />
<br />
So yes, I agree that there are countries in the world more free than america. Being able to say what you like is great! But I feel being able to do what you want with your body is a greater freedom and no one has a right to tell you otherwise.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

I agree 100%.  <br />

That's why weed should remain outlawed -- It'd be different if it didn't affect the people around you, but it does.<br />

<p>Well to begin with, I'd vote yes for legalization.  Same for prostitution by the way.<br />
<br />
I have to say I find it so funny that people who seem to barely be able to scrape up enough brain cells to remember to breathe, suddenly become Bio-Chemists when talking about pot.  They cant tell you who the current Vice President is, but they'll give a disertation on Hydroponics, THC, absorption into the bloodstream and produce current statistics on the effects of marijuana when you ask them why it should be legal <img src="images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br />
<br />
I've seen the arguments on both sides and I happen to think people are doing it anyway... so might as well have it government regulated.  <br />
I'm not a pot smoker, I've experimented maybe 5 times? total.  Personally I never saw what was so great about it.  Yes I inhaled =P  <br />
<br />
Then again I dont drink much either.<br />
<br />
Marijuana is no worse than drinking alcohol IMO, other than the fact that drug cartels are getting rich of the stuff.  <br />
<br />
