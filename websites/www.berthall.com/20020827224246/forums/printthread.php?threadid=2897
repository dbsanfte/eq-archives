Patch Test Version 1.37</b></p>

<p>======================================= <br />
<br />
Dark Age of Camelot <br />
Test Version 1.37 <br />
<br />
======================================= <br />
<br />
This new version of Camelot introduces a lot of quest and world updates and enhancements, as well as some major additions and fixes to the spell system. <br />
<br />
<br />
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br />
<br />
- The "Appeal" interface has been modified and streamlined so players who wish to contact Customer Support should have an easier time expressing their problem. <br />
<br />
- Eight new monster skins have been added. Expect to see some new-looking monsters wandering about Pendragon later in the week. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ART NOTES <br />
<br />
- Briton, Hibernian, and Midgard guards have gotten an armor appearance upgrade. You should start seeing this later in the week. <br />
<br />
- Albion plate armor has been upgraded in appearance. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WORLD NOTES <br />
<br />
Albion Quests / NPCs: <br />
<br />
Quest: Legione perso. Players attacking Lunaris were having difficulty in moving to the next step of this quest. This problem has now been resolved. <br />
<br />
Quest: Fortune of Few. Armsmen were receiving a Embossed Crossbow reward for this level 11 quest. For those Armsmen who wish to receive a usable item for their level, please return to Master Graent. You can hand him the Embossed Crossbow and you will receive a Belt of Battle in exchange. <br />
<br />
Quest: Heart of Sephucoth. Players who were also on the Ripper quest were not able to receive the bone they required for the Heart of Sephucoth quest. This issue has now been resolved and shortly after receiving the bone for the Ripper quest, you should receive the bone required to complete the Heart of Sephucoth quest. <br />
<br />
Quest: Captured Courier. Player attempting to complete the Dunston section of this quest in groups were having trouble. Dunston would run away shortly after the first of the group performed the proper steps. This has now been resolved. Dunston will wait for up to 1 minute while all members of the group perform the required steps. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hibernia Quests / NPCs: <br />
<br />
Quest: Secret of Nuada's Silver. Players on step three of the Secret of Nuada's Silver quest that don't have the ore to hand in to Chief Proinnsias will fail the quest and get chastised for being careless. They'll be able to get the quest again. This is so the customer service people don't have to continually reset quests for people who get the ore and then destroy it or drop it. <br />
<br />
Quest: Seek the Moonstone. An earlier fix to the Seek the Moonstone epic allowed players who lost the enchanted collar to speak to the hounds. This has confused players who never lost the collar, so an alteration has been implemented that should hopefully help alleviate player confusion. Players who have lost the collar only need to say [the moonstone] as indicated in their journal. Players who haven't lost their collar can now give the collar to the hound to initiate hound-speak. <br />
<br />
Siabra reorganization. The different clans of siabra have been differentiated. The new names are now reflected in the quests and talk indexes. <br />
<br />
New Quest: Freeing Osier. A new level 19 Hibernian quest: Freeing Osier... a Connla merchant believes her beloved, lost many years ago, is now a spectral wickerman. (Osier is no longer a one-time drop) <br />
<br />
New Shopkeeper. Cleit, in Tir na Nog, sells shields. He's located just past the first pub in Tir na Nog, entering from the Lough Derg entrance. <br />
<br />
New Shopkeeper. Cragen, in Tir na Nog, now sells tacuil armor. <br />
<br />
<br />
Midgard Quests / NPCs: <br />
<br />
Quest: Red Daggers. Midgard Warriors who've completed the Red Dagger quest, or who are currently on the quest, and received the Stormrider's Hauberk, the level 25 Thane reward, can turn in the hauberk for the correct warrior reward, a set of War Ravager Gauntlets. Players should turn the Thane item in to the Gythja of Bragi, in Jordheim <br />
<br />
Quest: Sveawolf Guardian. The Sveawolf Guardian quest now has better directions in the quest journal. The Elder sveawolf now gives more specific directions for dealing with the other creatures involved. Also, the Barkeeps will now tell you which town they are referring to in their rumors about this quest. <br />
<br />
Quest: Krrrck's Torment. Krrrck in Krrrck's Torment should be easier to find in Skona Ravine. The directions in the quest and in the journal have been given more detail, and Krrrck will spawn more. <br />
<br />
Quest: Furf's Reward <br />
Quest: Zrit-Zrit <br />
Quest: Sulphine's Demise <br />
The directions to and Zrit-zrit in Skona and Sulphine have been made a little clearer. Furf will also spawn more frequently in Skona. <br />
<br />
Quest: Simple Misgivings. In Simple Misgivings, Hilde in Haggerfel now asks for forge plans instead of blueprints to match the object you receive from the monster. <br />
<br />
Quest: Tomte Jerkin. The Tomte Jerkin quest will now be offered at the appropriate level and only classes able to use the Jerkin will be given the quest. An item for casters will be added soon. <br />
<br />
Quest: Price of Excellence. Players on the Price of Excellence quest should now see their talisman 'glow' when they are near the correct monster. They should also now be able to complete the quest by killing Ulfgar. <br />
<br />
Quest: Wisdom of Time. Players working on the Wisdom of Time epic (shaman, healer) who did not receive a subquest (The Rod and the Scholars, Visions of Darkness, Decoding the Map, Gashir) should return to Inaksha in Haggerfel to receive the quest they need. <br />
<br />
Quest: Silent Death. Players who chose an axe as their reward for Silent Death but were not able to receive the axe should return to Eindridi the smith in Fort Atla. Right-click on him to receive your reward. <br />
<br />
Quest: Widower's Hunt. Widower's Hunt - Players who were killed by the Widower and are on step 7 should return to Yver in Haggerfel to be able to fight Widower again. <br />
<br />
<br />
Monster Encounter Updates: <br />
<br />
Over the next few weeks we'll be making a concerted effort to improve and diversify many of the monster encounters throughout the realms. The goal of this is to make the adventuring areas feel as though they have more impact in the world, and that there are more distinct areas with a variety of behavior, treasure, and monster types. Included in this version are the first steps in this direction. As you can see our first pass is in some of the Hibernian zones, but all realms will receive attention. This set of improvements represents just the beginning of how we plan to implement your feedback.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p><b> 
</b></p>

<p>Hibernia Monster Encounters: <br />
<br />
- The druid grove of Howth has done extensive investigation of the group of dark magical beings known as the Siabra. Disturbingly, they discovered that the Siabra reach and influence was quite extensive. While they all hail to one great queen and are seen as one group of beings, the closer investigation has revealed that there are regionalized differences between the Siabra people. One of the biggest differences is in their choice of colors to wear. The Siabra of the Lough Derg region, for example, have been known to wear red with highlights of violet. Regardless of the region though, violet seems to be a recurrent theme. The druids concluded their research by giving names to each of these siabra region-groups. Those in the Lough Derg area are the dergan siabra, those in Brileith and Mt. Collory are the siog, in the Cliffs of Moher they are moheran, in Silvermine are the sheevra, in the Shannon Estuary are the eriu, and in Lough Gur are the gurite. Those who reside near their faerie queen, Cliodna, in the Bog of Cullen are still referred to by their original siabra name. <br />
<br />
- Siabra Fury, Enchanter, and Skirmishers in Lough Derg are now known as dergan fury, dergan enchanter, and dergan tussler, respectively. <br />
<br />
- Dergan enchanter now correctly uses a thrust attack. It was previously using a crushing attack. <br />
<br />
- Rock and stone sheeries have evolved slightly, and as a result, look a little different than they did before. They have also shed the cloth tunics they once wore. <br />
<br />
- Whistlers, magical creatures that take on the form of black horses, have recently asserted some influence over the dergan near Macnol's tower in Lough Derg. <br />
<br />
- Moss sheeries have migrated towards Lough Derg and may now be found behind the dergan grove <br />
<br />
- Druids have classified a new type of sheerie, the clubmoss sheerie. It is slightly bigger and more magical than the smaller moss sheeries. The clubmoss sheerie is only found in Lough Derg. <br />
<br />
- Rock sheeries have claimed a lonely stone circle on the east side of Lough Derg. Rounders, a more magical type of rock sheerie has also been sighted in that location. <br />
<br />
- More curmudgeons have migrated into the Lough Derg area and some have taken on new roles. Investigating wardens have noted crab-catchers, campkeepers, and even a singing curmudgeon. <br />
<br />
- A rare species of arachnid known as the dampwood mite has found a home in the Lough Gur area. At least four colonies of these creatures have been discovered. <br />
<br />
- Reports have come in of ghoulies moving closer to Innis Carthig <br />
<br />
- Survey groups claim to have seen gurite (Lough Gur Siabra) tempriars on the road between Lough Gur and the Bog of Cullen. Caution is advised for those traveling southeast. <br />
<br />
- Stone sheeries have made their way as far south as the stone circles in Lough Gur. Yet another type of sheerie, called the chipstone, has been seen with these groups. <br />
<br />
- Many Lurikeen have reported that a small herd of faerie horses has emerged to take up resident on the island in Lough Gur <br />
<br />
- Wayward reports have trickled in of escorted envoys of the Unseelie Court heading from Lough Gur towards Cliodna's tower. Many have been sent to investigate these reports, but as of yet, no one has returned with confirmation. <br />
<br />
- Magical black cats called scanradh (fright) have been seen with the gurites in their southwestern camp of Lough Gur. Like the whistlers of Lough Derg, these seem to have some power of authority over the gurites. <br />
<br />
- A ragged messanger out of Alainn Bin inform has informed Connla authorities that cronicorns have been sighted in the Bog of Cullen. A sole surviving witness said the creature, leading a group of siabra, smited down his entire party with a mere wave of its horn. The village of Alainn Bin slips further and further from our grasp. <br />
<br />
- Times of war can be seen by the increased number of disturbed spirits that roam the frontier lands, fallen invaders and defenders alike have risen from their unpleasant deaths to lash out at any who cross their paths. <br />
<br />
- Additional camps of luricadunes have been spotted in the valleys of Silvermine to the west of Howth. <br />
<br />
- The gray spectres have spread their influence from the solitary camp in the south. <br />
<br />
- The sheevra have occupied additional areas on the shoreline and hills of Silvermine. Our guardian scouts report that these new camps are more dangerous and aggressive than the siabra of before. <br />
<br />
- Tangua, Slothi and Natyl have been spotted more frequently at their camp in Bri Leith <br />
<br />
<br />
Albion Monster Encounters <br />
<br />
- The Arawnites in Llyn Barfog have established a more permanent presence. <br />
<br />
- The boggart and Gwalchmai factions in the Pennine Mountains should now be giving a correct faction message. <br />
<br />
<br />
Midgard Monster Encounters <br />
<br />
- The hagbui appear to have been disturbed by adventurers in the swamp and now roam their lairs even in the daylight hours. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OBJECT NOTES <br />
<br />
- Stonehenge Barrows is itemized, equipment levels are 36-50. <br />
<br />
- The Bracer of the Paranoid from the Muire tomb now has the correct bonuses. All bracers will auto-update. <br />
<br />
- The Bogeyman Crystallized Eye can now be equipped. <br />
<br />
- Arachnid silk can now be picked up / carried. <br />
<br />
- The Ceremonial Cloak in the Muire Tomb should now take dyes. <br />
<br />
- Hrodrek's chain should now take dyes. <br />
<br />
- The Blackorm Coif should now drop with the proper Armor Factor. <br />
<br />
- The Runic Rigid Orm spine should now equip in the 2hd slot. <br />
<br />
- The Wispy Rigid Orm spine should now equip in the 2hd slot. <br />
<br />
- The Roman Body Shield was renamed to Ancient Body Shield and now more monsters other than Roman Undead drops it. <br />
<br />
- The Roman Battle Bracer was renamed as Ancient Battle Bracer for the same reason. <br />
<br />
- Loot tables in the Vale of Mularn and East Svaeland were tweaked. Some rare objects were added and drop rates were modified. <br />
<br />
- The Orm Skullcap Shield now has the proper icon and uses the shield skill. <br />
<br />
- The Bear-bracer should now raise Sword skill instead of slash. <br />
<br />
- The Spine Splitter stats were changed to modify Large Weaponry and Strength. The previously stat bonuses did not help any characters that could use the weapon. <br />
<br />
- The Crystal Shard now raises the piercing skill instead of thrusting. <br />
<br />
- The Twilight Blade-stopper should now "consider" correctly. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
MAGIC SYSTEM NOTES <br />
<br />
- Made spec DoTs for the Sorcerer and Cabalist stackable, similar to the Mentalist in Hibernia. <br />
<br />
- Added an AE attack speed debuff to the Enchanter's Bedazzling list (Field of Scintillation), to add to Hibernia's area-effect repertoire. <br />
<br />
- Added a power regen line to Holism for Mentalist (Empowering Unity), and an AE DoT to Holism line for Mentalist (Shroud of Madness). This is one step towards evening out Hibernian area effect spells, and adds some extra benefit for speccing in Mana. <br />
<br />
- Added "nearsight" line to Runemaster Runes of Suppression list (Suppress Sight), Matter Manipulation (Cab matter spec, Encrust Eyes) list, and Eldritch Shadow Control list (changed old dex debuff line to Negate Coordination, and Negate Sight line is the nearsight spell). Nearsight reduces the range at which spells can be cast and arrows fired by a percentage. This is a "harrying" type spell that should give casters a <br />
non-damaging counter to archers. <br />
<br />
- Added AE DoT (Spore Cloud) to Shaman Cave spec. to flesh out the line, and add an area effect spell that Midgard did not have. <br />
<br />
- Upped range on Healer, Druid, and Cleric insta-heals from 1200 to 1350 to match normal heal range. <br />
<br />
- Added self bladeturn to L19 of Spiritmaster Summoning list (Protecting Spirit), Wizard Path of Fire (Aura of Incineration), and Mage Matter base list (for Sorcerer and Cabalist, Barrier of Warding). This should improve viability of casters in both RvR and PvE. <br />
<br />
- Put all Paladin chants on the same timer so they can't be twisted. We never intended Paladins to be able to twist their songs simultaneously. Previously, they could "cast" each of their chants every eight seconds. Now, they can cast one of their chants every eight seconds. <br />
<br />
- Normalized the following buff lines (from all realms) to last 10 minutes: Shield of Magma, Minor Earthen Power, Bolstering Gust, Detect Flaw, Encourage Aggression, Aura of Protection, Hammer of Faith, Shield of Faith, Rune of Discomfort, Minor Force of the Deep, Thunder's Bash, Thor's Vigor, Nails of the Wild. Maintaining some of these buffs detracted from their benefit, and weren't an appreciable balancing factor in their use. <br />
<br />
<br />
TRADESKILL SYSTEM NOTES <br />
<br />
- Changed recipes to match what is in the ingredients lists. Several tailoring, fletching, and weaponcrafting recipes should now use the proper ingredients. <br />
<br />

<p>The Paladin change isn't going in until tomorrow.  I'll put in a pre-emptive bitchslap right here that it is, in fact, a fix for Paladins.  We've known that the way that chants were working was bugged since Beta.  I wish that it had gone in sooner but after this patch (this is, btw, a Pendragon patch) I'll test it out and the Chants should be working as the designers intended.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>My girlfriend plays a pally, and I told her I wouldn't group with her if she twisted chants.<br />
<br />
It was so obviously broken, and I didn't want her to get in the habit of using it.  She never did, and won't be affected by this FIX whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I know Bris is pissed about it though.  I saw his post over on the VN Whineboards about it.  <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>As far as I know, Bris knew that Mythic considered it a bug.  He just happens to disagree with that assessment.  I can see his point, in that it's balanced by draining endurance when you change chants - this limits the combat styles you can do and your ability to flee battle.  It also makes a chant-heavy pally more useful than they would be otherwise, able to only do one of 3 (?) chants as they are.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Coming from a merc that has no real defining role in the game, I really have no sympathy for the rezzing, plate wearing, self healing pallies out there.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it ruled to be a pally when you could twist, now it's just a little more balanced.<br />
<br />
Mercs and Pallies can now both solo yellows, it's just that pallies won't end up at full life and mercs at half life any more.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is all coming from a low level gimp.  I'm sure there are other high level concerns that I can't possibly comprehend.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I fail to see how Chants are severely impacted by having the ability to only use one at a time.  I've seen one Paladin go so far as to say that they are now "useless".  I've been playing without double refreshing (incidental twisting was impossible to avoid most of the time due to timing issues while changing chants and I did actually test the effectiveness of twisting at one point) from the beginning.  The chants still grow in power every level (blank chants levels excepted) and still add to the power of every member of the group.  When I was doing my quality testing last week I was soloing yellow cons using nothing but Refreshment and Aura of Defense with absolutely no danger to myself and when I group they definately help out.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p><br />
Speaking only as someone who's grouped with a paladin a lot, and not as one myself, I personally assumed much of the use of chants was to gain and hold aggro in a PvE situation.  Haven't the faintest idea what effect they have on soloing.  (As a grouping-oriented friar with a heavy emphasis on Staff, yellows tend to make me hurt very badly when I have to solo them. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> )</p>

<p>I think most of the REALLY pissed off pallies will be soloers.<br />
<br />
More group oriented pallies probably won't be as upset.  Mind you, it will still be seen as a nerf, but they won't be a drastically affected as they may think.<br />
<br />
I have yet to fight a mob that my girlfriend using the refresh chant couldn't hold agro on.  So I don't think that part will be affected by this patch.<br />
<br />
But again, this is all coming from a level 24.  Your mileage may vary.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I'm not pissed, i'm disappointed the company is putting priority on wimping classes over fixing major parts of the game that are out right broken. <br />
<br />
Pallys using refresh and twisting chants weren't over powered solo, the only time they were really overpowered is in multiple pally groups, if they were all twisting heal chants.<br />
<br />
I can think of exactly 3 mobs that i could solo when they were 1 level orange, using twisting chants. I can think of even con yellows that would kill me no matter how much I twisted. That sounds like it fits into the general assessment of class balance. Now, most yellows will likely kill me, although i can probably do most lower ones.<br />
<br />
I think it took a fun, balanced class, and powered it down a significant amount. I could think of a half dozen other classes (three that solo reds) that could have used a bit of tuning first, and I could think of a few classes that could have used some unnerfing to actually be useful.<br />
<br />
I think Mythic needs to hire a few more people to work on important stuff, so it doesn't look like they are just trying to piss classes off.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>On another note ... increasing the duration of my buff spells is GREAT!  3 minutes for haste and 5 minutes for Earthen Burst was really too low.  I would go OOM buffing three tanks (plus myself for sync)and do nothing but med so I can rebuff unless there was a Minstrel in the group.  Forget about using bladeturn since it halves my regen rate and I couldn't regain manna fast enough to rebuff the party.</p>

<p>While there is nothing but positives for my realm in this patch....<br />
<br />
I must say the timing is horrendous on nerfing any class at this time.  Unless it’s a really unbalancing bug they would be best served in waiting till they can test it and enhance the class if needed.  Do they somehow not realize SoL is on the way soon? The honeymoon is over Mythic.<br />
<br />
Not sure if I’ve bitched about it on this board… but my class has been totally butchered in nerfs and not a word on enhancing Champions:<br />
<br />
1 week before release, Champions had a STR/CON and DEX/QUI debuff.  That was reduced to STR and DEX only.  Then the effectiveness was cut about 50%.  Then it was made resistible.  THEN it was recently found the DEX debuff was vastly overpowered and THAT was cut drastically (rightly so).  Not to mention the attack speed debuff does virtually nothing.   Oh by the way we dont have more spells than our hybrid bretheren despite being the magical realm, fortunately they remembered to make our melee prowess weak =)<br />
<br />
Did I also mention we are the only melee class without CON as a main stat?  And have Rogue HP?  <br />

<p>Change on Test:<b><br />
<br />
Thank you for the feedback. The team reconsidered the choice based on your comments about endurance loss being a major factor, and paladins will be able to keep "twisting" their songs if they choose that play style as opposed to combat styles. <br />
<br />
Please keep in mind, however, that "stacking" two different heals IS a bug and will be corrected eventually. Those two songs are not supposed to stack, and it does cause some imbalance. <br />
<br />
This is why we have a test server, guys. Not everything on test will make it to the live servers! Thanks again for the input - I especially want to thank a few people who sent email. They were very calm and non-confrontational, and I was able to take it all to the producer. </b><!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>For the love of Christ, stop calling it a nerf!  The stuff with Chants was a known and documented bug during Beta!  It needed to be fixed and fixed soon.  You know why?  Because I remember a number of times that Verant pulled BS where long after (sometimes a year or two) release announced that something commonly believed to be a tactic was actually a bug.  I personally would rather see this bug fixed sooner than later as I was already seeing a disturbing number of Paladins who believed that it was a feature.  I've lived through the stigma of being a Ranger when their whining was at their (previous) worst; I don't want to have to go through the same with Paladins because somehow everything should take a higher priority than fixing this bug and it gets viewed as a nerf a year later.<br />
<br />
Now, that said, are there other classes that need attention?  Of course there are.  Are they being ignored?  No, but instant gratification isn't always the way of the world.  Were infiltrators blown off so that Paladin chants could be changed?  No, their issues are handled by different folks.  Jim the spell guy works on (surprise) spells.<br />
<br />
All issues will be dealt with but just because a bug gets fixed in one class doesn't mean that the issues of another class are being ignored.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->
