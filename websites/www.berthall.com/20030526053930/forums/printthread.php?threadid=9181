<p><b> Mother Teresa, Saint or Cruel Biatch?</b></p>

<p>"Defending Mother Teresa"<br />
by Judith Hayes<br />
<br />
<br />
They say that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. But when it comes to writing anything controversial, your success can probably be judged by the caliber of your critics. So I'm flattered.<br />
<br />
On January 17, 1998, Clark Morphew, syndicated columnist for Knight-Ridder, took aim at the winter issue of Free Inquiry because of two articles it contained that were highly critical of the late Mother Teresa. One was written by Susan Shields, a former Missionaries of Charity sister who worked with Teresa. Shields revealed that part of her job was to help keep track of the millions of dollars donated to Teresa's "charity" work. Unfortunately, most of that money sat unused in various bank accounts while the sisters had to beg for food from local merchants. If the locals couldn't help out, the soup kitchens did without. This is "charity?" <br />
<br />
The other article was written by me. I compared the late Carl Sagan's genuine, almost immeasurable contributions to humanity with Teresa's contributions. Hers consisted of little more than telling people that suffering was good for them, and prattling on inanely about how God will provide, as starving children dropped like flies all around her. I also pointed to the brazen hypocrisy of Teresa's denying her "patients" the most rudimentary care, including simple comforts and pain killers, while she herself checked into posh hospitals to have a pacemaker implanted and blood vessels cleared. Her own health and comfort were apparently quite important to her. <br />
<br />
Morphew was obviously upset with the articles, but his defense of Teresa was surprisingly halfhearted and ambivalent. In his opening paragraph Morphew predicts that criticism of Teresa will continue until "some serious reform comes about." But if Teresa's generously financed clinics were running smoothly, honestly and compassionately, why would any reform be needed at all? Likewise, after describing Shields' knowledgeable charges about the idle millions of dollars that helped no one, Morphew suggested that since Sister Nirmala has taken the reigns, "grand changes could happen." Again, why should they, unless something was wrong to begin with?<br />
<br />
Seeming to want it both ways, Morphew presents Teresa as "one of the most obvious candidates for sainthood," but then concedes that among Teresa's beliefs were the ideas that suffering is good and that despite staggering overpopulation, birth control is always wrong. He also noted that wiping out poverty and illiteracy was not Teresa's focus. If all of that is true, it places Teresa somewhere between sadistic and stupid. (Which, interestingly, is where "saint" appears in the dictionary.) I have never heard of a compassionate person who thought that human suffering was ever a good thing, and I think compassion would be the bare minimum to expect in anyone being considered for "sainthood." <br />
<br />
Morphew also pointed out that Teresa "never pretended to be a doctor who could wipe out or even soften the pain of death." This I challenge fervently. So too would the Columbia University Press Encyclopedia (1995) in which they say about Teresa: "In 1948 she left the convent and founded the Missionaries of Charity, which now operates schools, hospitals, orphanages, and food centers in more than 25 countries." How would Morphew define "hospital?" There is no ambiguity whatsoever about the activities Teresa presented to the world as hers. The problem is that what she said she was doing was not what she was doing. <br />
<br />
If Teresa was offering spiritual comfort only, and not trying to "soften the pain of death," (and why on earth not?!) there should have been no drugs dispensed and no drug paraphernalia of any kind on hand at her "clinics." But there were. Her employees and volunteers used and reused un-sterilized syringes to administer ineffective drugs and mild antibiotics to terminally ill people, who suffered the resulting agonies. This is called practicing medicine, and why such malpractice was allowed to go on so long, with no legal challenges, highlights the power, and abuse of power, that is vouchsafed to organized religions. Especially the big ones with a lot of money. <br />
<br />
But if, as Morphew asserts, Mother Teresa never intended to offer medical care to the ill, feed the poor, or educate the illiterate, but rather planned only to offer spiritual solace to dying people, then at the very least she was a fraud. Those millions of dollars were donated by caring people to offer medical care to the ill, feed the poor, and educate the illiterate -- not to sit in bank accounts earning interest for the Roman Catholic Church, which has been a multi-billion dollar enterprise for decades now. And there are laws about raising charitable contributions for one thing and then using the money for another -- as Teresa did. Apparently her goal was to hoard the money, like Midas and his gold. To what end, though, is anybody's guess. <br />
<br />
There is a disquieting possibility, however, that presents itself in hindsight. She collected her millions "in the name of God." (And then promptly hid them away like a squirrel readying for winter.) She also converted souls "in the name of God," many just before they expired. I wonder, did she keep a rough tally of those souls? What I'm getting at is I wonder if in her simplistic view of things, anything she did for God would earn her big-time Brownie Points in the afterlife. For her, perhaps, this world had no meaning whatsoever, and was just some sort of challenging religious maze, designed by God to determine who gets the best bits of Paradise. If so, it might explain, since nothing else can, how she could be so callous as to sit on her millions while children, in her own part of India, were dying of starvation. This defies rational explanation, and I challenge anyone, from Morphew to the Pope himself, to explain it.<br />
<br />
I am also very surprised that no one came forward sooner to talk about Teresa's questionable practices -- but then that's what everyone said about priests raping little boys, isn't it? The Roman Catholic Church's power is unbelievably intimidating. <br />
<br />
Whatever the motives of the woman from Calcutta, I have seen enough human suffering in loved ones to recoil in horror at the thought of terminal, tormented people being told that their suffering is a good thing. Suffering is never a good thing -- except to sadists. Especially today, when we have the capability to alleviate so much pain, the mental image of those unfortunates who ended up in a Teresa "clinic" makes me cringe with nausea. <br />
<br />
I know I am whistling in the wind to ask this, but when, oh when, will we stop inflicting pain on each other in the name of some God?</p>

<p>hmm interesting article... <br />
<br />
This shows you how man (woman too) are not perfect.   Even Mother Teresa, or priest who are suppose to do things for God, sometimes make the wrong choices and it will affect how others for the worst.<br />
<br />
I think in the occupation stand point... after Lawyers, Priest and Nuns get the most bad rep from the public because they are view as good and if one of them does something bad... it spread like wild fire.</p>

<br />
And to be honest, in my experience Atheists tend to be more rabid in their denial of anything they don't believe in than many Christians are in defense of their faith.  I think a lot of it is backlash against their religious upbringing, because the people I know who were raised by Atheists or Agnostics are a lot more flexible in their acceptance of other's beliefs.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Though it wasn't intentional, I can see how it would be considered trolling.  My apologies.<br />
<br />
Stereotypical?  Well, yeah...anytime you make any kind of broad generalization about a group of people, it's stereotyping.  Not much you can do to avoid that, except not to make observations about groups.  No one I know does that (broad generalization, stereotypical comment here).<br />
<br />
Hypocritical?  You're going to have to explain your thought process to me on that one.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I was raised a Catholic, but I am now an athiest. But it has always been my belief that people should believe in what they want or need to believe in.<br />
<br />
I recently had a person come to my door. She wanted to sell me some religious books. I declined. She pressed me some more, and I informed her that I was an athiest, and as such did not need said books. She then launched into a speach on how I needed to be saved because I was condemning myself to hell, and how my children would end up there due to my ignorance. She had completely forgotten about her books, and had become unable to allow me to remain as I was.<br />
<br />
Yes, she got a facefull of door.<br />
<br />
Now, I could say that all religious people are intolerant of differing or opposing beliefs. Certainly the Muslim fanatics in the Middle East could reinforce my arguement. But I certainly don't believe that's true for all religious people.<br />

<p>See, it's stuff like Moiraine stated that I think a lot of the Religious hatred comes from.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I was buying some stuff from Wal Mart the other day (Where I used to work) and some people I used to work with (Also *extremely* religious) jokingly said "I heard Nick has been going to Church lately!"<br />
<br />
I told them No, as I really don't appreciate jokes like that -- it's just an attempt to start something.  "Oh, that's right, you don't believe in that."<br />
<br />
I told them I didn't come here to talk about religion.<br />
<br />
"You know you're going to go to hell for that, right?"<br />
<br />
Whatever you want to believe, I don't believe any of that.<br />
<br />
"Just because you don't believe it doesn't mean it's not true."  Yeah...Ok.  How about you flip it around a little bit?<br />
<br />
The other person who was there goes so far to tell customers who are interested in Harry Potter stuff that he's the devil.<br />
<br />
Then people have the balls to tell me I hate religion just because I was forced to go when I was younger.  That may have been a small part of it, but the vast majority of my extreme hatred towards it has absolutely nothing to do with it and everything to do with the usual stupidity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talk about church and all that all you want, just don't try to convince me of anything.  And definently don't try to get me going.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I also thought Reapin's joke was hilarious.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Never said Reapin's joke wasn't funny.  If it had been told by anyone else, I would have laughed my ass off...as it is, I groaned seeing more of his anti-religion trolling.<br />
<br />
And I'd like to point out that I never said you or Moraine disliked religion because of your backgrounds.  I said that Atheists TEND to be more rabid in their defense of their disbelief than Christians are of their belief.  Then I commented that I THINK it's in response to their religous upbringings.  If you took offense at my comments, I apologize, I was making personal observations and not trying to be offensive.<br />
<br />
Granted, you're going to find Christians that want to shove their beliefs in your face.  Conversely, you find Atheists that want to shove their disbelief in your face.  Both sides think they're right, both dislike the other side, both think the others are fools.  I don't think you can deny that (and yes, broad generalizations again...I know Atheists who quietly hold to their disbelief and take a "live and let live" attitude toward religous people and vice versa).<br />
<br />
And I'd still really like to know how you came to the conclusion that my comments were hypocritical.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Point of fact:<br />
<br />
I am religious, yet you have not seen me shoving my viewpoint down your throat or criticizing you for being atheist or telling jokes about atheist.  I have seen zero anti-atheist posts here but every day is a new anti-religion post.<br />
<br />
<br />
You as atheist continually tell jokes about religion.  You point out every religious person who makes a mistake and stereotype based on that.  If we took every person (inclluding mass murders) who were atheist and said "there that is what atheist are like" would that be fair?   <br />
<br />
I do believe the atheist are probably more rabid here.  I can tell you if any racial group, nationality or one of the sexes were continually made fun of here the mods would do something about it.    I guess there are still some groups out there who you can safely discriminate against.   This is discrimination based on religion pure and simple.  Moiraine would you allow people to continually tell jokes based on color, sexual preference, sex or nationality?   Even if they are funny?<br />
<br />
Heck I dislike the people who force religion on someone as much as you.   It is not in my nature to preach.  If someone chooses to have a relationship with God it should be private.  If you tell someone no it should mean no.   But I dislike people who make fun of religion just as much.   As much as you want people to stop pestering you about religion, I would appreciate it if you would quit making fun of it.  Let everyone make their own choice.<br />
<br />
Just as you guys would not want to see a daily preach session here telling you that you are all going to hell, we dont appreciate the daily anti-religion posts here.   Like I said anti anything else (ie race, sex, nationality) would not be permitted.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->
