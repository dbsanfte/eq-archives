<p>Ask away.<br />

As long as it doesn't involve enthalpy.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>I was asked why CuSO4:5H20 crystals turn blue when rehydrated after being heated.  Is it because of light refraction?</p>

<p>Light refraction?  <br />
<br />
Since CuSo4:5H20 is naturally blue, and because I see a 5water in the formula, my guess is that when you burn it, it loses some of its mass due to the water evaporation - which is why it turns white (loses the pentahydrate?).  When dissolved or hydrated back in water, it would just get the 5water back and revert to the original color...<br />
<br />
That's my guess after looking at some old chem notes, take it as you will.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Cupric Sulfate Pentahydrate is what it would be called.  I've worked with this stuff a bit in lab.<br />
<br />
Plaz is correct.  When you heat the substance, the water breaks away of the CuSO4 and you get the base substance.  The water evaporates and you just have the pure CuSO4.  Not sure if it's a white powder, but you can put water back into the molecular structure and it will react to turn blue again.<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->

<p>Yes it does turn blue (its orginal color) after being heated which turns it white/gray.  However, I am posed with the question why does it turn blue again after being rehydrated.  My best guess<br />
<br />
If blue CuSO45H2O is heated strongly, the hydration water is driven off, and what is left is a white powdery CuSO4 (anhydrous copper(II) sulfate). The blue will reappear if the copper sulfate is exposed to even small amounts of moisture.<br />
<br />
The water-copper ion complex absorbs photons of yellow or red light. This absorption of a photon promotes an electron from the water to the copper(II) ion. Since only yellow or red light is absorbed, blue light is transmitted, and the crystals appear blue.</p>

<p>cool beans, looks like you answered your own question then.<br />
<br />
I'm a chemic-neanderthall.  I can only explain what I see.  In the case of the copper sulfate, I see blue.  Then I see white.  OMG blue again!<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_signature -->
