    So, I'm even closing the just re-opened site. Yeah, it sucks I know.<br><br>
    I will keeping up with the blog/journal aspect as I move on in school and some professional projects, at <a href="http://lowkey.arcanist.com">http://lowkey.arcanist.com</a>. It's sort of depressing, and sort of good, all at the same time. C'ya in future games folks, Arcanist's Hall is closed, probably forever.<br><br>
I'm keeping the forums from here around as my personal ones, if you signed up on the forums under the impression it was an EQ/wizard site, please <a href="mailto:lowkey@arcanist.com">let me know</a> so that I can remove you from the database. Unless you just want to stick around for kicks and chat. If so, coo.<br><br>
