          <font face="verdana" size="1">As many of you know, the wizard site "The Arcanist's Hall" is closing its doors 
          and merging with Graffe's Wizard Compilation. The merger is a means of bringing the best of both sites together,
          and hopefully will do just that. We here at The Hall wish the Graffe moderators and community well, and the best of luck.
          <br><br>
          The Arcanist website however, will be taking a new direction. There is a new project in the works, though not directly related 
          to Everquest.  Please check back with us in the coming months for further updates.<br><br></td>
