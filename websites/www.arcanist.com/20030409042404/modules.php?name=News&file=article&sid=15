- Chunk of Unidentifyable Bile is now Chunk of Unidentifiable Bile. <br>

<br><br>
** Alternate Advancement ** 
<br><br>
- Purify Soul now removes a larger number of poison, disease and curse counters. <br>
- Changed Frenzy of Spirit to stack better with haste spells. 
<br><br>

** Quests ** 
<br><br>
- Performed surgery on Ragefire to remove his extraneous heart. <br>
- Verina and Drozlin will also only be dropping one set of items. <br>
- Omat Vastsea will now summon Jhassad Oceanson if hailed by a character in possession of the Orb of Vapor. He will summon the Avatar of Water if the character has the Orb of the Triumvirate. But he will not summon either if one of them is already around. <br>

To set the key that activates this feature, just open your options window and select the Keyboard Tab. If you select all categories, the entry will be the last one on the list, called Toggle last two targets. This was actually added with our last patch. 


<br><br>** NPCs ** <br><br>

- Undead will begin to spawn again at night in Kithicor. <br>
- Shin Master Grubbus in Gukta will now be more selective about who he allows to do tasks for him, and he'll be speaking directly to folks (using /tell).

- Porra, one of the Enchanter spell vendors in Felwithe, will no longer spawn inside of a wall. This was hurting her business. <br>
- Hutyn L`Lozz will now appear in his place of business and be less likely to leave to go sightseeing in Neriak. <br>
- Cleet Miller Jr. will now emote "Grumbles and looks up at you" instead of saying it. <br>
- The Goblins in Solusek's Eye are no longer wearing cloth armor. <br>
- Junth McMannus will now be properly affected by movement reducing spells. <br>
- You should only see one Rodrick Tardock, his clones have been dealt with. <br>
- Duplicate Brenzl McMannus's (McManni?) have also been removed. <br>
- Waltor Felligan of Halas will now cast the spells he says he will cast. <br>
- Xlixinar Arcut and Drixiv Arcut will now respond properly to their quest texts. <br>
- Corrected some text errors for Jortreva and Grendish the Crusaders as well as Sage Xelrin, Sulgar, Warlord Gligoth, Bryce McFadden, Serna Tasknon, Welno Tanlonikan, Lorekeeper_Einar and Master of Elements. <br>
- These NPCs will now be asking for the correct items for their quests: Gazoon Noihzog, Liteema Agner and Bolli Hillfoot. <br>
- Kodiaks in the Rathe Mountains should be friendlier to Druids and Rangers. <br>
- Undead Frogloks and Skeletons in Sebilis no longer have an extreme dislike for each other. <br>
- Groflah Steadirt's corpse will no longer disappear when he is killed. However, he is also no longer a merchant. <br>
- Moved the Planar Projection for Rallos Zek so it can't be interfered with by the zone exit. <br>
- Corrected the spawn times for the Minotaur Hero. <br>
- Half elven female bandits will now give experience, leave corpses and be aided by other bandits. <br>
- A Coerced Iiksar will now be known as A Coerced Iksar. <br>

- Equestrielle the Corrupted will no longer be able to sense and get angry with people all the way on the other side of the zone. <br>
- Niola Impholder now teaches Brewing, Begging and Alcohol Tolerance. <br>
- Jusean will now give the proper quest reward when given the proper item(s). 
- Plaguebone Thieves no longer flee. 
<br><br>

** Zones ** 
<br><br>
- Fixed some broken doors in West Freeport that were opening incorrectly. <br>
- Fixed a door that was opening into a wall in Highkeep. <br>
- Fixed some doors in Kaesora that were opening the wrong way. <br>
- Fixed a door that would not open in Solusek's Eye. 
<br>- Removed the ability for characters to consume more than one key given for access to the lower parts of the Crypt of Decay. <br>
- Added new sounds to Shadowhaven. <br>
- Removed safe spots in Katta, Solusek's Eye, High Keep, Echo Caverns, Paludal Caverns, Crystal Caverns, Siren's Grotto, Plane of Valor, Plane of Torment and Plane of Water. <br>
- Fixed a pathing problem in Gunthak that was causing Shaman pets (and perhaps others) to disappear. <br>
- Entrance to Bertoxxulous's lair is now restricted to those that have the proper flag. <br>
- The pylons on the end of the pier in Timorous deep no longer rotate like doors when you left click them. <br>
- Placed rocks over a spot in Western Wastes that characters could get stuck in. <br>
- Updated some of the pathing in Torgiran Mines to reduce the chances that NPCs will "poof" in that zone. <br>
- Removed a box out in the middle of Skyfire that turned when clicked but had no real purpose. <br>
- Fixed a place in Burning Woods and the Plane of Knowledge where NPCs would get stuck while wandering around. <br>
- Also fixed a place in Erud's Crossing where sharks were getting stuck. <br>
- The Veeshan's Peak zone in from Skyfire can no longer be triggered from above. <br>
- Moved the Koada'Dal Forge so that it does not extend into the hallway on the second floor of the building. <br>
- The teleporter from the Great Divide to the Plane of Knowledge will now work during Coldain Ring War. <br>
- The exit from the Plane of Justice to the Plane of Tranquility has been moved to place characters next to the Plane of Justice entrance. <br>
- A black ravenger should no longer be spawning right next to the Cabilis entrance in the Swamp of No Hope. <br>
- Trying to enter the Qeynos sewers will no longer take you to Ak'Anon. We hope the citizens of Ak'Anon can forgive the mess... <br>
- Fixed a problem in the Warrens that was causing the Kobolds to gather under the water near the river source. 
<br><br>

** Miscellaneous ** 

<br><br>
- Corrected a spelling error ("hass" instead of "has") in the text given for adding the Ring of Marr to the keyring.
