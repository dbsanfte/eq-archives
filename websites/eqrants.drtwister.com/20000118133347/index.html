      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><small>In case you hadn't
      noticed, I have exactly been updating the site very frequently lately.
      There is a reason for that. I wanted to give myself a week to take a break
      and come up with some new stuff to write about. The problem is that over
      the week I realized that I really have no business running an EQ based web
      site anymore. I don't play anymore and I have actually canceled my account
      and removed the game from my hard drive. I don't think it is fair to you
      guys to have me comment on the game when I can't do it from a players
      perspective. This site started as a place for me to bitch about things
      that I felt were wrong within the game. In the end I found that camping
      for hours on end just to get one damn item wasn't fun. Fighting to get a
      kill in an overcrowded zone wasn't fun. A lot of things about this game
      stopped being fun. So this is it, the final post on EQ rants. I will leave
      the site here for as long as Dr. TwisTer let's it stay. Feel free to use
      the message board still. I will stop by every now and again and see what
      you have to say. I hope to move on to some bigger and better things. I
      have some ideas for other sites that I want to start, possibly right here
      on the Dr. TwisTer Network, possibly on my own completely. Just keep an
      eye open, I am sure you will see me resurface somewhere. Until
      then.....enjoy!</small></font></p>

      update this late at night, but I didn't get a chance to today because
      every one of the network printers where I work went out. Talk about some
      pissed off people! But that is a rant all unto itself. Today I want to
      talk about a game. It is a game that shouldn't have been released when it
      was. It is a game that I played through to the finish somehow, fighting
      off horrible </small><small>game play</small><small> bugs with a flaming
      sword. It was a game that was supposed to bring a satisfying end to an
      era, but instead disappointed fans all over. In case you haven't guessed
      by now, that game is Ultima 9: </small><small>Ascension</small><small>.
      I'll probably give some spoilers in my little mini-review so if you don't
      want to know much about the game, I would suggest careful reading.</small></font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><small>The Good:&nbsp;</small></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="left"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><small>Ultima 9 probably
        has the best graphics of any RPG ever, the cities are all unique and
        have their own certain flair. The city of Yew is completely up in trees
        and the Buc's Dens docks are pretty cool. Also the world is pretty much
        all interactive. You can pick up almost anything you see and move
        it or manipulate it somehow. You can definitely tell there was a lot of
        work put in to making the world as lifelike and unique as possible.
        There is a ton of voice acting in the game also, which I always dig. It
        wasn't done too horribly either! The Avatar did talk a bit like
        Sylvester Stallone and looked a bit like Woody Harrelson, but they are
        both pretty cool so I didn't mind. There are also some return visits
        from some old Ultima friends, and some are not exactly the way you would
        remember them!</small></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><small>The Bad:</small></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="left"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><small>The good part
        wasn't all that long and didn't cover too much. That is because I pretty
        much covered all the good points that the game has. On with the bad. The
        pretty graphics come at an unbelievable price. </small><small>Game play</small><small>
        is so slow that sometimes Ultima 9 feels unplayable. Walking into a
        dungeon results in some decent </small><small>frame rates</small><small>,
        if you have a good computer. But when you walk out of a dungeon you feel
        as though you are walking straight into a 486 with 8 megs of ram. The
        game slows to a crawl and the hard drive starts thrashing like a drunk
        white guy at a heavy metal concert (Metallica Rocks!!!). Turning the
        graphics options down didn't seem to improve performance much at all.
        There are ways to adjust things in the .ini file so that you get a more
        playable game, but the damn game should have been playable right out of
        the box! There is just no excuse on Origin's part to have released a
        game that felt so un-</small><small>optimized</small><small>.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
        <p ALIGN="left"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><small>Bugs? We got yer
        bugs right here. Do you like bugs that cause games to not realize what
        you had already accomplished and won't let you progress any further?
        You know, showstopper bugs? Then U9 is for you! Do you like bugs that
        cause you to constantly crash to the desktop at the most inopportune
        times? Then, once again, U9 is for you! The bugs in this game are too
        numerous to mention. At one point I neared the end of the game and
        accomplished a fairly large goal. Well after that Raven (the Avatars
        love interest) is supposed to offer to take you to the Isle of the
        Avatar. Well for some reason she didn't and you are left to sail there
        yourself. Not a big deal I suppose, I am the Avatar </small><small>after all</small><small>!
        I can sail the mighty seas!. Well once you get there the Isle has a
        barrier around it to prevent you from going there too early. Because the
        game failed to realize that I had accomplished the needed goal to make
        it to the island, it wouldn't let me on the island (after scanning many
        message boards looking for a solution, I found that a lot of other
        people had the very same problem...it's just sad). Rather then wait for
        another bug filled patch from Origin I had to use a 'Fly' cheat (think
        of the noclip option in the Quake games) to get on the island. There are
        various other bugs that are a lot like that one too. I have also fallen
        through the world on many occasions. It is actually rather humorous</small><small>
        to find yourself floating through a black void...until you realize that
        you haven't saved the game recently and have to do a bunch of stuff
        over.</small></font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="left"><font size="3"><font color="#FFFFFF">The ugly is just
        the game in general. There are so few redeeming qualities about it that
        writing about the good actually requires digging for almost anything.
        The ending left me feeling unfulfilled to say the least. Rather then let
        us feel&nbsp; like the Avatar ascends to something bigger they just (</font><font color="#FFFF00">BIG
        SPOILER HERE</font><font color="#FFFFFF">) kill him off and leave the
        player to imagine that he went on to something greater. It was hardly a
