Relaxing prior to our raid upon the Umbral planes, our Beloved cleric 
Micherick was enjoying a calm swim in the frigid waters of the Cobalt Scar
when she noticed an ominous shadow in the water.<br><br>
Terrified of the stories of the Sea-Serpent Kelorek`Dar she called in
some backup.  After what seemed like a rather easy dragon pull, we 
charged the beast with everything we had.<br><br>
Wounded and terrified, Kelorek`Dar reared his ugly head and 
<a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/pictures/Event Pix/eaten.jpg');">Ate Gaeean</a>!<br><br>
Shortly after his meal, he fell to the Shadows.<br><br>
<a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/pictures/Event Pix/mourn.jpg');">Poor Gaeaen</a>!<br>
<br><br>
Fueled by the voracious tones of Arch Enemy, I made my way across the 
Maiden’s Eye, somehow avoiding the hordes of worms, and pink apes of 
doom.  Arriving in good time, at least, good-ish time, I stood by, got 
grouped up with everyone, joined the raid, buffed, got insulted for not 
being evil enough, and eventually, got going towards Radir Fireshower’s 
cave.  
<p></p>
After a good, speedy clearance, the superior intellect and tactics of 
Gaeaen and Shizuko lead us into Radir’s lair, ready to deliver some 
express death to the unfortunate space....thing.  And that we did, ripping
<a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/pictures/Event Pix/radir.JPG');">Radir</a> a new one.<p></p>
However, not at all happy with how fast the shadows had smacked him, 
Radir came back in <a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/pictures/Event Pix/soradir.JPG');">Ethereal Form</a> to cause some havoc!<br>
<br>Better luck next time, mate.<br>

Tuluvena took his <a href="javascript:openWindow('http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8962');">Bracelet of Might</a><br><br>
High-tailing it out of there, our very own Shizuko noticed that.. omg! 
there was a named mob up, and we weren’t killing it! Disgusted at 
this outrage, Shizuko called out the elite snaring team (that’s me) , and 
told me to watch for him pulling it past, and snare it.  He pulled it 
past once, I couldn’t see it.  He then pulled it past again... single.  
*mumbles something about monks, and splitting*  He was in fact pulling 
this friendly

Did you really need to ask?<br><br>
We rebuffed, and headed to slay <a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/pictures/Event Pix/tawro.JPG');">Tawro Icequake</a>.<br>

        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On a spur 
          of the moment call to arms from Elenrak, a number of Shadows appeared 
          in the God forsaken Swamp of No Hope to clean up a mess by the name 
          of Kaggry Krup. This slimy beast carries a portion of the Shaman Cudgel 
          quest and was washed down, then washed up by our Elite team.<br>
          <br>
          After that we decided to go to City of Mist to attempt yet again for 
          the ULTRA RARE (for Hutterr anyway) drop of a Jade Reaver. After respawns 
          and deaths, we killed approximately 22 Black reavers and the 21st finally 
          dropped the Jade Reaver. <br>
          <br>
          After the reavers were taken care of, we decided to make a run at Neh' 
          Ashir. He/She (there is still controversy) is a chanter with the unique 
          ability to CH, but after a long fight went down in like fasion to Krup 
          and the reavers.<br>
          <br>
          Grats to all who attended, and thank you as well. It was great fun and 
          puts a couple of us that much closer to epic status.</font></p>

          VERY close but failed attempt at Mater Yael in the Hole, Geaen called 
          for reinforcements. His call was answered with numbers to double the 
          force and after a short run down to the Death Touching bastard he was 
          obliterated in time to only kill the puller (Hutterr) and one couragous 
          wizard (Ommien) who nuked for all he was worth from the get go.<br>
          <br>
          From there we moved in to kill High Scale Kirn. Jedana, having forsight 
          to bring the various gear she needed to upset him for her epic turned 
          in her items and was SHUNNED by Kirn. It seems that a game bug prevented 
          her from immediately obtaining her next epic piece, but Kirn was handled 
          in quick fashion by a far superior force.<br>
          <br>
          We hope that some CS reps will see things our way and grant Jedana her 
          epic piece, but if not, we will have to return to the god forsaken hole

        we noticed that Talendor was up in Skyfire, and having bested only one 
        other Kunark dragon, we decided to go for it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">With Shizuko 
        pulling, and Anornae as main tank, Hutterr set up a CH rotation with the 
        resident clerics so that Annie could draw pleeeeenty of aggro. Turned 
        out the CH rotation worked. Our main tank didn't even die. Anaskesia bit 
        the dust pretty hard after attempting to slow, but ended up getting Pox 
        of Bertox and Talisman of the Serpent anyway. Tyle bit the dust too, after 
        a successful Tash. All in all, it was a good night, and a quick fight. 
        One of the most efficient boss take downs I've seen. Great work, Gamers!</font></p>

        any other EQ News, I figured I'd post <a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-898385189');">this</a> 
        anyways. Probably the biggest change to hit EQ since Luclin came out. 
        Monks, Mages, Manaburn, & CH all planning to be nerfed next patch. Bakkin 
        also pointed out that aggro has been changed slightly, you can now have 
        an infinate number of mobs hitting you rather than just 4. <br>

        <b>On Saturday</b> - (10/5)<br>
        GAMERS headed to Plane of Hate. Although I couldn't be there, I was informed 
        that the raid went off with a rather sucessful start. After some unfortunate 
        connection problems however, the raid was cut short.<br>
        Some decided to stay in Hate and continue on.<br>
        <br>
        <b>On Sunday evening</b> - (10/6)<br>
        The Shadows ventured into the hole in search of an epic piece for Bigorn, 
        unfortunatly after a few hours of camping for it we left empty handed. 
        Hopefully next time we'll get it for ya Big.</font></p>

        Anaskesia for spotting the Guardian Wurms up in Skyfire. Quick to act 
        on the chance for spell drops, Elenrak and Gaeaen mustered the forces 
        and showed up to kick some dragon ass. And that is exactly what we did. 
        It's definatly noticable that we are getting more powerful everyday, these 
        level 60 dragons were a cake-walk for 2 of our groups.<br>

        Just a little FYI - this spell warps your vision a little. So dont be

        unfortunate departure from the FS crew, this website hasn't seen a single

        <br>
        Anyways, In September we've achieved a whole lot. More level 60's and 
        a more getting close, Firrub got her <a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=152');">epic</a>

        Many thanks to everyone who participated in the 9/14 Fear raid! This raid 
        went about as smoothly as we could possibly ask for, we took out everything 
        except for a few mobs at the temple, and Cazic-Thule himself. All-in-all 
        a really easy raid. Other than attaining epic pieces, we're definatly 
        ready for bigger and better things.<br>

        out Faydedar for Hayes in Timorous Deep. As a result of that and all of 
        Hayes' hard work, he achieved his epic today. Yay! </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We then moved 
        to the Swamp of No Hope and quickly took out Ulump for Summersnow. Looks 
        like Faydedar will get another spanking soon. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We took a 
        short break, and realized that Gorenaire was up. Hoping to obtain a portion 
        of the book of scale, we got our alliance forces together, and with the 
        help of other great friends including members of Noble Blade, New Outriders, 
        Evolutia Draconis and others, took Gorenaire down for the very first time. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After that 
        we moved to Steamfont and took out Renux for Rumiko. We'll have fun soon 
        in Kithicor forest helping Rumiko to obtain the last portion of her epic.
