          breached and a forward camp was immediately secured for the remainder 
          of the force to utilize.<br>
          <br>
          After the initial breaking, the guild gathered steam and proceeded to 
          slaughter everything in sight (including a variety of named targets)!<br>

          During this raid, Fallen Shadows gave new meaning to the term "ae group" 
          by pulling a death-touching golem, an evil dragon, and a number of their 
          friends all at the same time -- and killed them all with virtually no

          him, his friends, his familiy, and even his dog. When asked to explain

          LEADERSHIP CHANGES<br>
          <br>
          During the course of the last several months, our guild has grown by 
          leaps and bounds! With that in mind, the existing guild leadership has 
          elected to promote several guild members to officer status. The purpose 
          of these promotions is not only to assist with the management and direction 
          of the guild, but also to provide additional moral and technical support 
          to avoid excessive burdening of single individual. In the near future, 
          you will see the results of these promotions in the form of new policies, 
          procedures, and active development teams.<br>
          <br>
          Micherick has accepted the a new role as guild co-leader (with Hutterr) 
          -- congratulations!<br>
          <br>
          Remmington, Aladiana, Hiashi, and Anaskesia have accepted new roles 
          as guild officers -- congratulations!<br>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Fallen 
          Shadows has been VERY busy over the last month.&nbsp; Lots of new mobs, 
          crazy new loot.&nbsp; It's been a blast.<br>
          <br>
          It started with a trek out to Western Waste.&nbsp; We were going to 
          scout out some mobs when we noticed Sontalak was up.&nbsp; With some 
          of us being KoS to dragons now, we decided we had to clear him for safety 
          reasons.&nbsp; A quick call to arms and with in moments we had thirty 
          people in the zone.&nbsp;&nbsp; We prepared, then charged.&nbsp; It 
          was a tense moment at first, as we lost a couple people quickly at the 
          beginning of the fight, but slowly the tide turned and we emerged victorious!&nbsp; 
          One tier four mob down !</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Next, we 
          set our sights on our first God, Cazic Thule.&nbsp; Noticing he was 
          up, but no one was in fear, we took the opportunity to get some revenge 
          and have some fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a quick clearing we set up camp 
          outside his temple.&nbsp; Then prepped and brought him in for some old 
          school fun.&nbsp; It was great fun, only losing a couple people.&nbsp; 
          In the end , the battle gecko of Petoonia got the final shot and the 
          giant god came tumbling down.&nbsp; That's two tier four mobs!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Our next 
          big target was The Itraer Vius.&nbsp; Last time we visited him, he gave 
          us some hard times and we had to leave, well this time we kicked his 
          ass royally.&nbsp;&nbsp; A super fast run to his lair and an incredibly 
          fun fight, we slowly worked his health down to nothing.&nbsp; Score 
          another tier four mob!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">That's 
          three tier four mobs. Not bad in a month!&nbsp; But that's not all we 
          have been doing.&nbsp; We have killed Vindi a couple times.&nbsp; More 
          of the plane of innovation dragon Xanomech.&nbsp; Killed Sontalak again, 
          done Doomshade/Rumblecrush.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We also 
          had a number of new recruits (more then 10)&nbsp; in the last month 
          that have been a great addition to the guild.&nbsp; People have been 
          leveling like mad and gaining a ton of AA points.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Coming 
          up, some more tier 4 mobs!&nbsp; King tormax, Greig Venificus, maybe 
          even into Ssra temple for some mobs.&nbsp; Also we are just waiting 
          for our turn to get into North Temple Of Veeshan which I have no doubt 
          we can do easily!</font></p>

          Shadows, you have made the leadership proud, it was only this year Jan 
          31, 2003 that we got on our own first rotation with Severilous. In seven

              anyways. Probably the biggest change to hit EQ since Luclin came 
              out. Monks, Mages, Manaburn, & CH all planning to be nerfed next 
              patch. Bakkin also pointed out that aggro has been changed slightly, 
              you can now have an infinate number of mobs hitting you rather than 
              just 4. <br>

Relaxing prior to our raid upon the Umbral planes, our Beloved cleric Micherick
was enjoying a calm swim in the frigid waters of the Cobalt Scar when she
noticed an ominous shadow in the water.<br><br>
Terrified of the stories of the Sea-Serpent Kelorek`Dar she called in some
backup. After what seemed like a rather easy dragon pull, we charged the beast
with everything we had.<br><br>
Wounded and terrified, Kelorek`Dar reared his ugly head and 
<a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/pictures/Event Pix/eaten.jpg');">Ate Gaeean</a>!<br><br>
Shortly after his meal, he fell to the Shadows.<br><br>
<a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/pictures/Event Pix/mourn.jpg');">Poor Gaeaen</a>!<br>
<br><br>
Fueled by the voracious tones of Arch Enemy, I made my way across the Maidens
Eye, somehow avoiding the hordes of worms, and pink apes of doom. Arriving in
good time, at least, good-ish time, I stood by, got grouped up with everyone,
joined the raid, buffed, got insulted for not being evil enough, and eventually,
got going towards Radir Fireshowers cave.  
<p></p>
      After a good, speedy clearance, the superior intellect and tactics of
      Gaeaen and Shizuko lead us into Radirs lair, ready to deliver some
      express death to the unfortunate space....thing. And that we did, ripping
<a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/pictures/Event Pix/radir.JPG');">Radir</a> 
      a new one.<p></p>
      However, not at all happy with how fast the shadows had smacked him, Radir
      came back in <a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/pictures/Event Pix/soradir.JPG');">Ethereal Form</a> 
      to cause some havoc!<br>

      High-tailing it out of there, our very own Shizuko noticed that.. omg!
      there was a named mob up, and we werent killing it! Disgusted at this
      outrage, Shizuko called out the elite snaring team (thats me) , and
      told me to watch for him pulling it past, and snare it. He pulled it past
      once, I couldnt see it. He then pulled it past again... single.

        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On a spur 
          of the moment call to arms from Elenrak, a number of Shadows appeared 
          in the God forsaken Swamp of No Hope to clean up a mess by the name 
          of Kaggry Krup. This slimy beast carries a portion of the Shaman Cudgel 
          quest and was washed down, then washed up by our Elite team.<br>
          <br>
          After that we decided to go to City of Mist to attempt yet again for 
          the ULTRA RARE (for Hutterr anyway) drop of a Jade Reaver. After respawns 
          and deaths, we killed approximately 22 Black reavers and the 21st finally 
          dropped the Jade Reaver. <br>
          <br>
          After the reavers were taken care of, we decided to make a run at Neh' 
          Ashir. He/She (there is still controversy) is a chanter with the unique 
          ability to CH, but after a long fight went down in like fasion to Krup 
          and the reavers.<br>
          <br>
          Grats to all who attended, and thank you as well. It was great fun and 
          puts a couple of us that much closer to epic status.</font></p>

          for reinforcements. His call was answered with numbers to double the 
          force and after a short run down to the Death Touching bastard he was 
          obliterated in time to only kill the puller (Hutterr) and one couragous 
          wizard (Ommien) who nuked for all he was worth from the get go.<br>
          <br>
          From there we moved in to kill High Scale Kirn. Jedana, having forsight 
          to bring the various gear she needed to upset him for her epic turned 
          in her items and was SHUNNED by Kirn. It seems that a game bug prevented 
          her from immediately obtaining her next epic piece, but Kirn was handled 
          in quick fashion by a far superior force.<br>
          <br>
          We hope that some CS reps will see things our way and grant Jedana her 
          epic piece, but if not, we will have to return to the god forsaken hole 
          and wipe him again. Grats to all on a great raid and lots of fun!!!<br>

        of Bertox and Talisman of the Serpent anyway. Tyle bit the dust too, after 
        a successful Tash. All in all, it was a good night, and a quick fight. 
        One of the most efficient boss take downs I've seen. Great work, Gamers!</font></p>

        anyways. Probably the biggest change to hit EQ since Luclin came out. 
        Monks, Mages, Manaburn, & CH all planning to be nerfed next patch. Bakkin 
        also pointed out that aggro has been changed slightly, you can now have 
        an infinate number of mobs hitting you rather than just 4. <br>

        <b>On Saturday</b> - (10/5)<br>
        GAMERS headed to Plane of Hate. Although I couldn't be there, I was informed 
        that the raid went off with a rather sucessful start. After some unfortunate 
        connection problems however, the raid was cut short.<br>
        Some decided to stay in Hate and continue on.<br>
        <br>
        <b>On Sunday evening</b> - (10/6)<br>
        The Shadows ventured into the hole in search of an epic piece for Bigorn, 
        unfortunatly after a few hours of camping for it we left empty handed. 
        Hopefully next time we'll get it for ya Big.</font></p>

        Many thanks to everyone who participated in the 9/14 Fear raid! This raid 
        went about as smoothly as we could possibly ask for, we took out everything 
        except for a few mobs at the temple, and Cazic-Thule himself. All-in-all 
        a really easy raid. Other than attaining epic pieces, we're definatly

        Evolutia Draconis and others, took Gorenaire down for the very first time.
