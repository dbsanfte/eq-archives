  <ul>

    <li><font color="#FFFF00"><b> General Rules </b> </font> 

      <ul>

        <li><em><font color="#80FF80">Y</font><font color="#80FF80">ou are a representative 
          of this guild AT ALL TIMES</font></em>. Harassing others, using foul 
          language on public channels as well as public flaming will NOT be tolerated. 
          If you want to flame someone, flame Collinn. </li>

        <li>Upon entering the game, you must greet the entire guild, EVERY time 

          you log on. </li>

        <li>It is not required, however, when a guildmate asks for help, you ARE 

          obligated to come to his or her assistance <u>IF</u> possible and convenient. 

        </li>

        <li><strong><font color="#80FF80">Begging in any form is not tolerated</font></strong>. 

          Begging consists of constantly asking someone for items, money, and/or 

          assistance. Begging inside guild chat or outside is not only a bad reflection 

          of your character, but of the Fallen Shadows as well. Repeated begging 

          <b>ESPECIALLY</b> at banks and high traffic areas (i.e. East Commons) 

          is grounds for removal from the guild.</li>

        <li><s>All females must bow down to Kluz and worship his enormous... </s><br>

        </li>

        <li>At this point, we are a guild of free thinkers. Innapropriate behavior 

          will not be tolerated, however, this does not include foul language, 

          or dirty jokes, 'cause... Hey...C'mon....we're only human. </li>

      </ul>

    </li>

    <li><font color="#FFFF00"><b>New Recruits </b></font> 

      <ul>

        <li>Recruitment of friends (ingame and out) is encouraged. Exceptions 

          will be made for characters who have shown inititive, respect, a degree 

          of control, and a unique personality. This however is not an open casting 

          call. </li>

        <li>New recruits are under constant supervision, and ARE on a trial basis. 

          After the trial period the officers will discuss performance and then 

          decide on status. Immediatly following will be a huge Keg party in which 

          hopefully Anornae will dance on a table to 70's classic &quot;Boogie 

          Shoes&quot;. <br>

        </li>

        <li>Points (so to speak) for guild newbies are earned by showing initiative, 

          knowledge, generosity, and an overall willingness to joke around in 

          guild chat and/or help others when needed. Points are taken away for 

          such things as referring to Kluz as &quot;Motherfucker&quot; or NOT 

          referring to Hutterr as &quot;homo&quot;.</li>

        <li>When recruiting, you MUST inform Kluz or Hutterr that you have inducted 

          a new recruit. There will be no more embaressment of &quot;Hello, I 

          didnt know you were in the guild. I'm your Leader, Kluz.&quot;. Also 

          instruct the new recruit to fill out an application on this website 

          immediatly.<b><br>

          </b></li>

      </ul>

    </li>

    <li><font color="#FFFF00"><b>Officers </b></font> 

      <ul>

        <li>Officerhips has both rights and responsiblities. By becoming an officer 

          you swear to put your brothers and sisters ahead of yourself at all 

          times. Keep in mind that your leaders and fellow officers have YOU on 

          top priority as well. <br>

        </li>

        <li>If you beleive you are interested in becoming an officer, you may 

          contact Hutterr or Kluz in game. One of us will then give you an Officership 

          Quest. You will need to complete the quest in the time allotted. The 

          final decision will be based on the quality of how you finished it, 

          the details and depth of the tale that you MUST tell us on your journey, 

          and of course, IF it is completed. <br>

        </li>

        <li>Abusing Officer power is IMMEDIATE grounds for loss of Officership 

          plain and simple.<b><br>

          </b></li>

      </ul>

    </li>

    <li><b><font color="#FFFF00">Events </font></b> 

      <ul>

        <li>Guild raid suggestions are encouraged. Please submit the idea to Kluz 

          or Hutterr with the appropriate information such as level restrictions, 

          loot, and any other pertinate information.<br>

        </li>

        <li>There will be designated a raidmaster/eventmaster. For the time the 

          raid is going one, this person IS leader. Officers are instructed to 

          listen to what this person says, preferably withOUT complaints. <br>

        </li>

        <li>Anyone who has ever been on a raid will know that they are extremely 

          complicated and frustrating. We ask that you PLEASE refrain from complaining 

          about not getting loot, not getting exp. not having fun, etc. Please 

          try to be patient and remember that when an entire guild is after something 

          together, it takes a LOT of work. <br>

        </li>

        <li>If an event is going on and you are within the designated level range 

          of the event and you are ONLINE, you MUST attend the event. MUST, no 

          exceptions. <br>
