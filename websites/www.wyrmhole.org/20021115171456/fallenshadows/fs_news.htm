        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On a spur 
          of the moment call to arms from Elenrak, a number of Shadows appeared 
          in the God forsaken Swamp of No Hope to clean up a mess by the name 
          of Kaggry Krup. This slimy beast carries a portion of the Shaman Cudgel 
          quest and was washed down, then washed up by our Elite team.<br>
          <br>
          After that we decided to go to City of Mist to attempt yet again for 
          the ULTRA RARE (for Hutterr anyway) drop of a Jade Reaver. After respawns 
          and deaths, we killed approximately 22 Black reavers and the 21st finally 
          dropped the Jade Reaver. <br>
          <br>
          After the reavers were taken care of, we decided to make a run at Neh' 
          Ashir. He/She (there is still controversy) is a chanter with the unique 
          ability to CH, but after a long fight went down in like fasion to Krup 
          and the reavers.<br>
          <br>
          Grats to all who attended, and thank you as well. It was great fun and 
          puts a couple of us that much closer to epic status.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">After a 
          VERY close but failed attempt at Mater Yael in the Hole, Geaen called 
          for reinforcements. His call was answered with numbers to double the 
          force and after a short run down to the Death Touching bastard he was 
          obliterated in time to only kill the puller (Hutterr) and one couragous 
          wizard (Ommien) who nuked for all he was worth from the get go.<br>
          <br>
          From there we moved in to kill High Scale Kirn. Jedana, having forsight 
          to bring the various gear she needed to upset him for her epic turned 
          in her items and was SHUNNED by Kirn. It seems that a game bug prevented 
          her from immediately obtaining her next epic piece, but Kirn was handled 
          in quick fashion by a far superior force.<br>
          <br>
          We hope that some CS reps will see things our way and grant Jedana her 
          epic piece, but if not, we will have to return to the god forsaken hole 
          and wipe him again. Grats to all on a great raid and lots of fun!!!<br>

        pulling, and Anornae as main tank, Hutterr set up a CH rotation with the 
        resident clerics so that Annie could draw pleeeeenty of aggro. Turned 
        out the CH rotation worked. Our main tank didn't even die. Anaskesia bit 
        the dust pretty hard after attempting to slow, but ended up getting Pox 
        of Bertox and Talisman of the Serpent anyway. Tyle bit the dust too, after 
        a successful Tash. All in all, it was a good night, and a quick fight. 
        One of the most efficient boss take downs I've seen. Great work, Gamers!</font></p>
