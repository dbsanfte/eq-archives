          for our next ToV run, we found it hoarded with a mass of other clans, 
          eager for blood. Not being interested in waiting, as we had our forces 
          online, we searched for a target. With our recent accomplishments, we 
          decided that it was time to take on Derakor.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="1"> 
          We mobilized, setup, dictated the plan, and Derakor fell to us on our 
          first attempt. Shizuko, as always, performed flawlessly in bringing 
          him to us. Having been somewhat bloodthirsty, Revax immediately ran 
          up to the slain Derakor and Chopped off his head! (Grats on Gloves of 
          the Earthcrafter Revax!). I also stole his tunic. It's a bit big on 
          me, maybe I'll grow into it ;)<br>

          working our way down to Juggs. Shizuko started pulling the juggs near 
          Tolapumj, and Trakanon decided he didn't like that. Shiz FD'd, Trakanon 
          ghosted to our camp, ghosted again, ghosted again! No Wait, It's really

          gates, summons some of us, runs back to camp again! and creams the remaining

          Luckily for us, a group of VoLS were camping reets/juggs for the Froglok 
          reet crown ( which they later did get, woot!), and they most graciously 
          took a few deaths and much of their time dragging and rezzing us. Many

          takes off. Fatalfists takes over and begins to clear Juggs to prep for 
          tola. Uh, Trak pops on him, kills him, and begins warping all over the 
          place. We say, screw it, we've had enough, he's goin down, rush into 
          the hallway, where trakanon decided to wander into, and took him out 
          quickly - no gate for you.<br>
