          for our next ToV run, we found it hoarded with a mass of other clans, 
          eager for blood. Not being interested in waiting, as we had our forces 
          online, we searched for a target. With our recent accomlishments, we 
          decided that it was time to take on Derakor.<br>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="1"> 
          We mobilized, setup, dictated the plan, and Derakor fell to us on our 
          first attempt. Shizuko, as always, performed flawlessly in bringing 
          him to us. Having been somewhat bloodthirsty, Revax immediately ran 
          up to the slain Derakor and Chopped off his head! (Grats on Gloves of 
          the Earthcrafter Revax!). I also stole his tunic. It's a bit big on

          to get on this rotation, we asked Leauge of Levity for a shot at this 
          guy, and they graciously allowed us a chance. We mobilized and started 
          working our way down to Juggs. Shizuko started pulling the juggs near 
          Tolapumj, and Trakanon decided he didn't like that. Shiz FD'd, Trakanon 
          ghosted to our camp, ghosted again, ghosted again! No Wait, It's really 
          him! Shit! Kill him damnit! </font></font></p>

          tries to camp out. We get him to 10 percent before mich logs out, Trak 
          gates, summons some of us, runs back to camp again! and creams the remaining 
          few people there. Mich logs back in to start rezzing, and repops on 
          the juggs get him dead.</font></font></p>

          Luckily for us, a group of VoLS were camping reets/juggs for the Froglok 
          reet crown ( which they later did get, woot!), and they most graciously 
          took a few deaths and much of their time dragging and rezzing us. Many

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We get 
          buffed, yes, this time with poison buffs ;p, and head back down to Tolapumj 
          pull area. Shizuko, having to deal with horrible girlfriend faction, 
          takes off. Fatalfists takes over and begins to clear Juggs to prep for 
          tola. Uh, Trak pops on him, kills him, and begins warping all over the 
          place. We say, screw it, we've had enough, he's goin down, rush into 
          the hallway, where trakanon decided to wander into, and took him out 
          quickly - no gate for you.<br>
