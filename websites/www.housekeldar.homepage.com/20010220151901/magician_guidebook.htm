<p>Magicians are conjurers. They make stuff up, as it were, from thin air. This
stuff can be anything from light, to daggers, to beasts of elemental substance.
This has advantages and disadvantages. First, all the stuff you make is free (if
you don't count the time you spend meditating when you could be stomping monster
butt for loot). Second, all the stuff vanishes when you leave Norrath in one
fashion or another. So, you can't make huge profits selling your goods on the
market (unless you're selling to trolls! *grin*). Magicians also have some of
the skills of the Wizard, in powerful offensive spells.</p>
<p>Magicians (Mages), I feel, are the most complex class in EverQuest. They are
a caster, so that immediately adds difficulties. Not subtle like the Enchanter
or overt like the Wizard, they fall into the middle. They are one of the two
'pet' classes, the other being Necromancer. While most of the other casters have
a way to get a pet, they do not usually rely on this ability for survival. Mages
do not have the same sheer damage potential as the Necromancer, so they must
rely more upon their pets for effective soloing. Furthermore, a good majority of
a Mages spells do nothing but create items. Add all of these together, and most
new players (and some older ones) are going to be at a loss as to how to use the
Magician as a Magician, and not as a bad Wizard.</p>
</font><font SIZE="2">
<p></font><b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" color="#0000FF"><a name="controversy: Magician"></a>Controversy:
Magician</font></b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2"></p>
<p>While many classes are easy to understand, the Magician has been the bed of
some serious controversy throughout the Beta. Most of the controversy has been
born out of some misunderstandings regarding the Magician (and pets in general)
and their relative power level. I'm going to briefly address a few of these
issues and attempt to resolve them.</p>
<p>1) Magicians get less experience because of their Elementals:</p>
<p>Magicians, with pet, do receive less experience than any other (non-pet)
class for 'soloing' a given kill. That is a statement that cannot be refuted.
However, we feel that this is balanced by one important fact.</p>
<p>With a pet, Magicians should have a slightly easier time killing a given
enemy.</p>
<p>Many people don't grasp the second order concept here. The Magician can kill
the monster and subsequently require a shorter recovery time (for health and
mana) than a Warrior. Having an expendable tank also makes combat a lot safer.
This allows the Mage to kill another enemy more quickly than the Warrior could
(especially when fighting easier enemies [blue]). Thus, experience over time is
balanced. A Mage should not level any faster than a Warrior of equivalent skill
with their respective class.</p>
<p>2) Magicians are not useful to a group at low to medium-low levels (5-11).</p>
<p>At low levels, we feel that Magicians (as most characters) can, and should be
soloed for maximum potential. It is only after level 5 that grouping begins to
become more important. Many people have commented that at these levels, the
Magician does not seem to offer enough to a group to be worth taking along.</p>
<p>The prime reason for this is the same for all offensive casters. High level
(5+ levels above you) enemies are VERY likely to resist your spells. Thus, if a
group insists on fighting higher level enemies, the casters cannot add very much
in the form of direct damage. However, this does _not_ mean that low level
casters are useless. Both Wizards and Magicians receive low (~L4-8) level damage
shields. These are an amazing addition to a group and should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Additionally, it should be noted that 'blue' groups are as effective at
leveling as most 'red' groups. The color indicates the desired targets for the
group. Many groups (at all levels) feel that the best utilization of a larger
group is to hunt 'Big Game'. While this is very possible to do, more efficient
groups realize that hunting large amounts of smaller game (blue, white,
occasionally yellow) is faster and less dangerous. Admittedly, this may not be
as interesting as hunting those guards that have annoyed you for so long, but at
the same time, this game is about social interaction, and you get a lot more of
that when you're not running for your life from a huge red nasty. Or even worse,
retrieving your corpse from the pile.</p>
<p>3) Elementals should be the same level as the caster.</p>
<p>At present, elementals summon at a level approximately equal to that of the
level of the Summon spell. Thus, the L8 Summon Elementaling spell summons an
elemental that is approximately L8 (plus or minus a level or two).</p>
<p>This poses some problems for the Magician when soloing (see Solo Combat
Section for more on this). Whenever the Magician is at a new level, the
elemental is a powerhouse of damage output. However, as the Magician advances
towards the next rank of spells, the elemental become progressively 'weaker' as
more difficult enemies are required to continue to gain experience.</p>
<p>This apparent weakness has a counter. There is a corresponding increase in
the reliability and power of the Magician's spells that offsets the weaker
elemental. Additionally, the Magician can adjust his elemental choice to further
compensate (see Elemental section for more details) for these differences in
power. A good order is: Fire, Water, Earth, with Air whenever needed for safety.</p>
<p>4) Pets are not helpful at high levels.</p>
<p>It has been the contention of many high level Mages on the test server that
Elementals just don't help enough at high level. We feel that this opinion if
primarily derived from these players noticing a 'decrease' in Magician power
over the course of the Beta. Early in the Beta, a Magician and an elemental were
as good as (or better than) a Wizard and a Warrior. This was unbalanced and was
fixed appropriately.</p>
<p>Most often their gripes are: elementals fail to keep the enemy off of the
caster, or they do not do enough damage to finish the enemy because of the
massive punishment that enemies dole out at higher levels. When pressed further,
most of these Magicians admit that they use their offensive magics quite a bit
during combat. While necessary to do so, it is imperative that you know when and
where to use the burn (we'll cover this in detail later).</p>
<p>Elementals actually do quite a bit of damage, but they need time to do so,
just like most other tanks. It's difficult to stand by and watch an enemy rip
large holes in an elemental without doing anything, but that is what is required
most of the time for a soloing Mage.</p>
<p>Please be aware, that at high level (25-30+), you really should be in a group
to be efficient. Enemies do tremendous amounts of damage at those levels and it
can take a very long time to recover from an extended battle with an enemy. At
this point, it can be very frustrating for Magicians because of the long
downtime (as compared to earlier levels). Expect this.</p>

<p></font><b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" color="#0000FF"><a name="Magician Theory"></a>Magician
Theory</font></b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2"></p>
<p>Magicians are different from most other casters. They have some offense, and
a little defense, and then quite a few odd utility spells. They do not have the
'standard' suite of utility by any means. Here are some ideas to think about
when considering playing a Magician, and while playing one.</p>
<b>
<p>Theory 1: Intelligence? Who needs it!</p>
</b>
<p>Magicians are efficiency experts. Both in damage/mana or utility/mana,
Magicians are at least second best, if not the best. A Human Magician (lowest
intelligence possible [85]) is just as dangerous as a Erudite Magician (highest
possible intelligence [140]). Why? Because almost all of a Magician's casting
should be done before combat. Sure, it's nice to have a bit of burn to finish
things off, but if you're doing things right, you should rarely need that extra
oomph, and if you do, you should only be using _one_ burn spell. Thus,
intelligence isn't as important for Magicians as it is for other casters.
(Admittedly, if the whole zone descends upon you you'd like to have enough mana
to burn them all down, but you're going to run out of health a lot faster than
you will mana.)</p>
<b>
<p>Theory 2: Mana storage</p>
</b>
<p>Magicians store mana on a semi-permanent basis in all of their summonings.
The ability to store mana in things like throwing daggers, spears, swords,
knives, food, and (most importantly) pets is what gives a Magician their power.</p>
<p>Mana storage allows the Magician to have 2-3 times the effectiveness of any
other type of caster when fully prepared, because the Magician can move mana
from the mana bar, into the world, allowing _more_ mana to be stored and
channeled (effectively). A Magician with an elemental, a pile of summoned
weapons, and a full mana bar is incredibly dangerous. The prepared Magician has
approximately double the mana of any other caster at the same level, simply by
the fact that there a large amount of mana invested in the Elemental, and about
another bar in weapons (daggers, etc). Thus, the Magician attacks with his
Elemental and, if need be, throws a full two bars (one of daggers, one of
spells) of additional direct damage at the mob in question.</p>
<p>However, because the damage dealt by Magicians usually occurs in smaller
quantities (compared to their cousins, the Wizards), the process of killing a
monster takes time. Nicely enough, the elemental gives you that time because it
tanks like a warrior! If you have a smart mob, which will happen occasionally
(*sigh*), you may still have some problems.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Magician has the most efficient buffs known. All of the
Summoned items are semi-permanent, some allowing the wielder to hit invulnerable
monsters (and normal monsters better), some provide enhanced vision, and still
others allow flight! And because these are items that provide these effects, the
Magician only has to cast the 'buff' once! Other casters must re-buff their
party-members or friends whenever the buff wears off. With Magician buffs, as
long as the player with the 'buff-item' is online, the 'buff' is permanent. Talk
about mana-efficient.</p>
<b>
<p>Theory 3: A well equipped party is an efficient party.</p>
</b>
<p>Magicians are extraordinarily useful to a party because they act as a
storehouse for items that are usually just too much trouble to be worth using.
Aside from the obvious 'food and water':</p>
<p>Bandages. At 6s5c these are a serious investment for any other character
class. Worth it, but wouldn't you rather be buying armor and weapons? With a
Magician in the party, bandages are just standard equipment for all members,
allowing fast (with skill) healing that can be Cleric independent for those
times you need fast recovery while the Cleric meditates after a extraordinarily
bad fight.</p>
<p>Missile weapons of all kinds. Without a friendly Magician, arrows, daggers,
and spears can become extremely expensive. With a Magician, missile-capable
characters (All have some, but Warriors, Rogues, and the like are the most
effective) with little life can still do _significant_ damage to attacking mobs
by staying out of melee and peppering the enemy with sharp bits of pointy death.
Don't underestimate the power of ranged weapons.</p>
<p>Front-line Melee weapons. While not as amazing as a Combine Two-Handed Sword,
a Magician's summoned weapons (Dagger, Sword, Spear, and more) are considered
magic items for the purposes of hitting magical monsters and that alone can make
them worth using. Everyone in the party should have a magic weapon as long as
the Magician isn't offline. That makes some monsters that are usually
untouchable at low levels a breeze. Everyone who's reading this, remember, all
Magician summoned weapons are 'Piercing' skill, so at least have a modicum of
skill in Piercing if at all possible. At L1-5 it isn't that much of an
investment to work with a pointy thing for awhile, and it helps out at higher
levels. Flexibility is a good skill for any character to possess.</p>

<p></font><b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" color="#0000FF"><a name="Character Generation"></a>Character
Generation</font></b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2"></p>
<p>Like everything in EverQuest, character generation is detailed and very
important. However, there are quite a few misconceptions regarding the
importance of certain statistics over others. As mentioned above, the Magician
does not require as much Intelligence as some other casters. I can (and will
again) make the argument that Intelligence, while vital for casters, should NOT
be the only concern. Survival in combat is more key than having endless burn
(though I've met many EQ Wizards _who die a lot_, but still swear by the 'all
Intelligence means I can BURN anything down!' motto. Can you spot the problem
here? Hint, it's underlined.)</p>
<p>With that in mind, I make the following points:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">1) At low level, Agility helps a lot.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">2) At low level, Strength helps a
lot.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">3) At low level, Dexterity helps a
lot.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">4) At ALL level, Intelligence helps a
lot.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">5) At ALL levels, Stamina helps a
lot.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">6) At ALL levels, Wisdom helps a lot.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">7) At ALL levels, Charisma will give
you more money.</p>
<b>
<p>Stamina vs. Agility:</p>
</b>
<p>Magicians have Stamina as one of their 'prime' statistics. Many people feel
that Agility is more useful for ALL classes. I feel this may be a mistake and
could decrease the combat survivability of casters at high levels.</p>
<p>Agility is believed to be useful because it influences the number of attacks
that will strike the character. It does this. However, the game mechanics behind
this may not have been analyzed completely.</p>
<p>It seems that this affect is accomplished in concert with armor, and not
separate from it. We've noticed that high Agility characters receive an AC bonus
to each piece of armor. The magnitude of this bonus seems correlated to the
amount of Agility above the average value of 75. Additionally, there is an
observed level-based bonus to AC which seems partially Agility based. This
effect is not apparent at low levels because the difference between armor in low
level characters (Patchwork/Leather vs. Cloth) is not as significant as the
difference at high levels (Chain/Plate vs. Cloth).</p>
<p>If these observed phenomena are real, the following statement is a direct
correlate:</p>
<p>High Agility has the most effect on high level characters with strong armor.</p>
<p>Pure casters do NOT get strong armor. That's a fact. They can get to high
level, so high Agility will continue to improve the characters AC. At high
level, enemy attacks are significantly more damaging and more 'accurate'. These
attacks are scaled to match the increases in AC afforded an equal level FIGHTER
with strong armor. Thus, the attacks become more 'accurate' than a caster of
equal level can avoid with the same Agility as the Fighter with armor bonuses.</p>
<p>Ok, so a lot of rigmarole shows that Fighters are better suited to Melee
combat than Mages. You knew that. However, this analysis points out that at high
levels, if the Mage has to tank for some reason, high Agility isn't going to
make that much difference in avoiding attacks. It will make _some_ difference,
but that difference is no where near enough to devote significant points to
Agility as opposed to another statistic, such as stamina, which ALSO protects
against magical attacks.</p>
<p>At high level, the biggest danger for a Magician (or any support caster) is
going to be enemy BURN. As the fighters bash one another protecting the weaker
group memeber, the casters are battling as well, but with direct damage that
physical abilities fail to protect against. The only thing that will keep you
alive in these circumstances is your intrinsic magic resistance, any buffs you
have, and your health. Agility plays no part in high level magical combat,
except to help you avoid melee attacks while casting. If you're avoiding melee
attacks while casting, you're likely outnumbered (elemental should handle at
least one) and in trouble anyways.</p>
<p>If you're going to get hit (either with spells or with melee attacks), you
need to have the health to take those hits. At high levels, you will have a bit
of health, but with high stamina you have a substantial amount more. I'd
estimate that 15 points of extra Stamina will add 10-15% health compared to
average health for your class/race combination. I feel this is sufficient to
warrant consideration when creating your character.</p>
<p><b>Race:</b></p>
<p>You have five choices: Dark Elf, Erudite, Gnome, High Elf, or Human. All have
their advantages and disadvantages, but I feel they all form the basis for equal
but slightly different Magicians. Because Magicians are able to compensate for
weaknesses in ANY statistic, PLEASE play what you find interesting or what you
think fits your character concept.</p>
<p>From base statistics, not bonus points:</p>
<p>Erudites are not as combat oriented, thus they are more elemental dependent,
but function as better (at least longer lasting) 'Burn' in a group.</p>
<p>Dark and High Elves are more combat 'avoidance' oriented, with higher
agility, but still must rely upon spells (and elementals) primarily because of
obscenely low strength. (Remember the additional disadvantages to being 'evil'
for Dark Elves).</p>
<p>Gnomes have less health, but still have the avoidance and a very high
Intelligence for more mana.</p>
<p>Humans are good 'combat' Mages because of higher Strength and the highest
initial Stamina.</p>
<p><b>Suggestions:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest splitting your bonus points between Intelligence, Stamina,
and perhaps Wisdom. But please remember, with these bonus points (and by playing
well), you can compensate for any 'lacks' your starting statistics and race may
have. You can turn a High Elf into a combat Magician by splitting bonus points
between Stamina and Intelligence. Turn a Erudite into a disturbing burn creature
with lots of Intelligence, and a bit of Stamina. Or create a 'tank' caster with
lots of Agility and Stamina and only a little Intelligence... oh... nevermind,
wrong game.</p>
<p>Play around, and play what you like. They're all equipotential. However,
don't disregard Verant's advice. That's what the prime statistcs are.</p>

<b>
<p><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" color="#0000FF"><a name="Skills"></a>Skills</font></b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2"></p>
<p>Pure casters don't have many skills, instead relying upon their huge spell
library. Aside from Trade skills (Fishing, Smithing, etc) you have only spell
casting skills and a tiny helping of Combat skills.</p>
<p>One quick note on Trade skills. Unless you plan on making your character a
'tradesmen' it is MUCH more efficient to adventure for cash than to use a boring
trade skill (like Fishing for instance). While adventuring, you gain experience
and money. While Fishing you gain money and a LOT of boredom. You make the
choice. Not saying that Trade skills are worthless, but they aren't as much fun
as beating some vile undead thing back into the netherworld. At least in my
humble opinion, your mileage may vary.</p>
<b>
<p>Spell-casting skills:</b></p>
<b>
<p>L1:</p>
</b>
<p>All of these go with spells of the appropriate type. Unless you have
extremely low Intelligence (not going to happen with a pure caster), you will
keep these skills up easily through use. There are two exceptions for the
Magician. Alteration and Divination. Because you lack useful low level spells of
these types, you will not get as much practice as you should.</p>
<p>Abjuration - All of your buffs and shields use this. You'll keep it up just
casting hundreds of shields on your elementals or party members.</p>
<p>Alteration - You get your first Alteration spell at L4, Gate, and your second
at L12, Bind Affinity. I'd suggest throwing a few trains into Alteration at L4,
just to give you a chance of Gating. And then a few more at L12 so you can Bind
with some efficiency.</p>
<p>Conjuration - Most of your spells use this. It'll be fine.</p>
<p>Divination - Another pain... I'd practice sense magic whenever you have a
wait (boat, etc.). It will keep Divination up, which can be useful at L8 when
you get Invisibility.</p>
<p>Evocation - Most of your burn uses this. It'll be fine.</p>
<p>Channeling - Makes spells go faster. This is a Good Thing (TM). Faster
casting leads to fewer interruptions, which leads to less deaths.</p>
<b>
<p>L4:</p>
</b>
<p>Meditate - The Holy Grail of casters. The ability to get mana back quickly
makes them vaguely useful. Note that at high levels, casters with high
intelligence (or wisdom) will have more mana than Meditate can keep up with, so
regeneration will still take a while.</p>
<b>
<p>L16:</p>
</b>
<p>Research - An interesting skill. Theoretically, it allows you to create your
own spell scrolls rather than purchasing them. Difficult to use, it still
provides an interesting 'scholarly' diversion for casters.</p>
<b>
<p>L20:</p>
</b>
<p>Specialization - Specialization in one of the basic spell-casting skills
(Conjuration, Evocation, etc) makes you more proficient in that skill. It
increases your effective skill and makes fizzles and resistances less likely.
Also rumored to directly affect casting time, similar to Channeling, though this
is unproven as of yet.</p>
<b>
<p>Combat:</b></p>
<b>
<p>L1:</p>
</b>
<p>Bind Wound - The use of Bandages. Amazing when you have free bandages. Heals
about 1-20 damage (dependent on skill) in about 2 combat rounds. Basically, you
make one person regenerate FASTER than a troll at high skill. However, it only
works up until 50% health. So it's really only useful for patch jobs after
REALLY bad fights.</p>
<p>Piercing - Pointy things. You can use all of your summoned weapons but the
Spear.</p>
<p>2 Hand Blunt - Decent. Covers staves and the like.</p>
<p>Throwing - Depends. I expect some people to be Throwing crazy. I'm not. I
like taking the beats up close. Some people might disagree.</p>
<b>
<p>L22:</p>
</b>
<p>Dodge - Avoiding being hit is key for a spell-caster. 1) You take less damage
2) You don't get interrupted, which means your spells go off. You like this
skill. Only need one point in it because it'll auto increase.</p>

<p>Intro:</b></p>
<p>The most important of a Mage's summoned things is the elemental, in one of
its many flavors. Elementals are the Magician's lightning bolt, sword, and
healing spell rolled up into one stupid AI controlled blob. If used properly,
they can be amazing additions to a Magician, if used poorly, they can get you
killed faster than you can say, &quot;NO!!! NOT THE GUARD!!!&quot;. (Not funny,
it happens.)</p>
<p>Elementals (pets of all sorts actually) are the single most effective mana/damage
spell of any caster in Norrath. Unless you suck at using them. I can (usually)
keep an elemental alive until I must to leave the zone to sell... and if there
is a shopkeeper in zone, I almost never lose an elemental. Only time I lose
elementals is when they're taking the beats while I zone (especially useful when
you know you're outmatched).</p>
<p>Elementals are continuos burn. Rolling beats (they look like they're on
castors, you'll see). A damage over time spell that can destroy one target and
move on to another. However, they do have on serious drawback. Elementals have
this nasty tendency to try to find a 'good path' to follow you, and in the
cramped dungeons you'll be frequenting (or sometimes in the middle of a field),
you'll encounter what I call &quot;Elemental Train Syndrome&quot; or ETS. This
occurs when your elemental 'paths' and wanders off in a random direction near
some enemies that don't like it. The enemies attack it, and the elemental
proceeds to beat on them. Usually it will find 2-3 really large and ugly enemies
just to make your life interesting. When the elemental dies, you suddenly have
2-3 pissed off mobs heading for you, and you have no idea they are coming. Thus,
you should get in the habit of periodically issuing pets redundant commands when
running or if you suddenly don't see your pet. Keep typing '/pet follow'. If you
_ever_ see the message, 'You do not have a pet to command!&quot; and you don't
think you killed off your elemental recently... RUN!!! Zone as fast as possible.
Do not stop to look back, do not check to see if anyone is near. Just tell your
party &quot;ETS&quot; and zone. If they have worked with a 'pet' class before,
they'll know.</p>
<p>There are four types of Elementals corresponding to the Primary Elements:
Fire, Water, Earth, Air. Other elementals have been viewed in the wild, for
example Mist Elementals (a combination between Air and Water). There are rumors
of other 'hybrid' elementals like Slime (Water and Earth), or Dust (Earth and
Air), but it is unknown whether a Magician will ever be able to summon these
types (perhaps high level, or quest spells).</p>
<b>
<p>Detailed examination of Elementals:</b></p>
<p>Elementals are strong warriors and recover equal to, or faster than Trolls.
Often they're healing will beat your meditation of mana, so usually you will be
waiting for you, and not the elemental.</p>
<p>I recommend 'considering' your elementals (/con) when you first summon them.
Occasionally you summon the equivalent of a 'scrub' elemental. You need to know
if your elemental is weak before you sick it on an enemy, or you're dead.
Additionally, if you can spare the money for the material components...
re-summon elementals until you get a large one. The difference is worth it.</p>
<p>Once you know what approximate level your elemental is, you can judge its
capabilities. All elementals have high damage output for their level (about
equal to a warrior of the same level with reasonable weapons). Max damage and
combat abilities for each elemental are as follows. Please note that elementals
receive all of the special abilities of the levels below them as well as any
listed.</p>
<p>L4-L7: 8 damage, quick regeneration (~10hps a tick)</p>
<p>L8-L11: 12 damage, parry</p>
<p>L12-16: 16 damage, double attack</p>
<p>L17-L19: 20 damage, riposte</p>
<p>L19-L20: 22 damage, ??</p>
<p>Elementals at L10 and above (usually resulting from the L12 Summon Elemental
spell) have all of their attacks considered magical for the purposes of striking
creatures.</p>
<p>The above information can be a good way to 'figure out' what level your
elemental is for your own personal knowledge. Once you become familiar with
elementals you'll be able to get a feel for them right off.</p>
<p>Fire:</p>
<p>HPS: Poor</p>
<p>Beats: Highest damage, moderate delay.&lt;DIV Comments:</p>
<p>An amazing beast. Should be your main choice when fighting weak creatures
(low levels) or many creatures (dungeons), merely by virtue of the intrinsic
fire shield. When using a Fire elemental, be prepared to sacrifice your body (ie:
health) to keep it alive to do damage. Step into combat whenever the elemental
is at risk as it is much more efficient at dealing damage than you will ever be
at melee range.</p>
<p>Also an excellent grouping elemental because it's damage output is the
highest over time. Add the intrinsic damage shield, and you have a downright
potent weapon for a group. The lower health doesn't make much difference, as the
enemies will likely be concentrating on multiple members of your group.</p>
<p>This elemental tends to be slightly higher in level than average (at or
sometimes above the level of the Summon spell). This means it will take slightly
less damage than other elementals when fighting the same creature, but it has
less health, so be careful.</p>
<p>Air:</p>
<p>HPS: Average</p>
<p>Beats: Average damage, short delay.</p>
<p>Special: Casts invisibility periodically.</p>
<p>Air Elementals are not as useful in combat, but darn nice to have around
(also can surprise PKers, for those of you who are into that sort of thing). It
becomes visible during combat as if invisibility were cast normally. This
ability is a necessity for stealth ops into a heavy aggressive area.</p>
<p>Currently, there is this little feature where when you go invisible, your
elemental suicides... so you and your elemental can't go in invisible.</p>
<p>Due to their low delay, these are perfect for tanking spell-casters. High
number of attacks usually equals interruptions. Interruption of enemy
spell-casting is good by definition. However, they really don't have the health
to tank for long, so be burning, or expect to lose the elemental to the caster.</p>
<p>This elemental tends to be about the same level as the Summon spell.</p>
<p>Water:</p>
<p>HPS: Average</p>
<p>Beats: Average damage, average delay</p>
<p>Special: Excellent armor class</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>The 'average' elemental. This should be your choice when you have no specific
need for large amounts of health or the flaming hot stuff. While using it, you
still need to support it with health, but additionally, you should be doing some
damage with spells. Excellent when fighting slightly harder monsters because of
the enhanced AC. When fighting _really_ hard stuff, I'm more comfortable with
the health buffer that is Earth.</p>
<p>This elemental tends to be at the same level as the Summon spell.</p>
<p>Earth:</p>
<p>HPS: Excellent health (approximately 50-75% more than Water)</p>
<p>Beats: Average damage, average delay</p>
<p>Special: High health, maybe a better Taunt.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>The perfect elemental for fighting _hard_ stuff. Because it has seemingly
endless health, it can tank things that would kill you rather quickly long
enough for you to burn or beat them down. Also seems to have an extremely
effective taunt. Not sure if this is merely a mistake in sampling (I use a lot
of Earth Elementals) or if Earth truly does have an advantage in this area.</p>
<p>This elemental tends to be _below_ the level of the summon spell (or equal to
it). Be warned that this means it will take _more_ damage from enemies at your
level, but that's why it has the health.</p>

<b>
<p>Taking the Beats:</b></p>
<p>You are a Mage. The elemental is a summoned creature that you control
utterly. Which one do you think should take the most damage in combat? Right.
Elementals should be the primary tanks in combat, but remember this important
detail. You have to wait for the elemental to heal before you can continue your
quest (like one of those dumb-ass warriors who insists on being 'big and
strong'). Thus, it is in your best interest to _trade_ hits with an elemental.
If you let the elemental die, you have to spend 40-200+ mana to re-summon one,
lose a material component, _and_ meditate back up a bit. Losing an elemental can
be dangerous and very inefficient.</p>
<p>If your elemental gets down about a third of its health, and you're not in
any immediate danger, step in!!! Take some beats. You'll have less health
overall, so you'll heal before your elemental will (and you can BANDAGE yourself
if you get truly mangled). You'll notice a great increase in the recovery rate
from combat, and a corresponding increase in efficiency.</p>
<b>
<p>Spell Efficacy:</b></p>
<p>Initially, your spells are very unreliable at a new level. You will notice
many fizzles and a much greater chance of resistance (decreased or no damage)
than for a Wizard of equal rank. I feel that this reflects a recognizable
difference between Magicians and Wizards. Wizards have _only_ their spells to
rely on. Magicians have more options. Thus, at each new level, the Magician must
rely upon the new elemental at that level to be effective.</p>
<b>
<p>Elemental Strength:</b></p>
<p>Elementals are strong, but no where near as strong as they were in the early
Beta. Combat now requires a bit more finesse on the part of the Magician. As
mentioned above in the 'Controversy' section, elementals become relatively
'weaker' as you move towards your next spell rank. This is most noticeable
directly before the new rank (L7, L11, L15, L19, etc). However, with the
multiple types of elementals a smart Mage can compensate for these differences.</p>
<b>
<p>Maintaining Constant Power:</b></p>
<p>OK, your elementals are getting weaker, and your spells are getting more
effective. Logically, you BURN more as you approach a new level. However, you
must be _very_ careful not to overdo it and move into the realm of 'dumbass'
Mage. If you burn too early, or too frequently, you will get axed as the enemy
will fixate on you, and beat you bloody. Try some of the following tactics.</p>
<p>Always drop a damage shield on your elemental prior to attacking an enemy.
The added damage may not seem significant, but it is. Additionally, the damage
provided by the shield acts as a 'taunt' and locks the enemy more firmly onto
the elemental. This is a _good_ thing when you start to burn.</p>
<p>The best solution (after L8) that I've found is to hook up an Earth Elemental
with a Fire Shield, then sick it on the target. Wait until the target is at
half, then start roasting. The increased health of the Earth Elemental (combined
with elementals fast regeneration rate) makes this an efficient tactic.</p>

<p><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2" color="#0000FF"><a name="Group Combat"></a>Group
Combat</font></b><font FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2"></p>
<p>Magicians have an odd role in groups corresponding to their 'dual existence'.
They act primarily as a Wizard, but have the added bonus of increasing the
'health' of a group similar to a warrior.</p>
<p>Magicians add that 'little' extra to a group that can make a good group into
an amazing one. My groups often cheer loudly whenever I enter the area yelling,
'BURN and BEATS have arrived!' That's because these two things I provide a group
are that important and noticeable.</p>
<p>A Mage's main purpose in the group is providing extra damage. This is damage
in the form of burn to stop runners, fire shields and elementals to take
creatures down faster, and the elementals again to occupy extra chafe creatures
often pile onto fights against multiple opponents.</p>
<p>In my opinion they do burn better than a wizard, but less quickly. They may
not do the amazing piles of damage that a wizard is capable of but generally big
piles of damage lead to a frenzied enemy on your wizard much more often than a
dead enemy. The damage the Magician does comes more slowly, but is a heck of a
lot more steady. No 200 point lumps, but doing 400 damage over the course of a
fight (EASY to do with under a bubble of mana if you're wise) is substantial.</p>
<p>The main reason that Mages are better than Wizards in a group is because a
large majority of their damage can be 'third person' hyper-efficient damage.
Damage shields are a minimal mana investment and can be extremely profitable for
a group. Elementals are a one time investment and provide hundreds, if not
thousands of points of damage over the course of a groups progress through a
zone. Both of these are EFFICIENT uses of mana, which means less time spent
meditating, and thus less group downtime. Most often, mana used during a fight
will be restored before that fight is over. Compare this to a Wizard, who often
is stuck meditating for 3-5 minutes after a tough fight.</p>
<p>The elemental and the damage shield are a Mage's bread and butter in a group.</p>
<p>Use them often.</p>

  Burn:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Wizards primarily are BURN. They fix problems that need to be fixed _now_ by
    reducing them to itty-bitty pieces of smoldering remains.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Magicians can do the same (but not quite as abruptly). However, most
    Magicians (and Wizards) do not understand that proper use of burn in a
    group. This was touched on in Grouping 101 and Grouping 201.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Burn should be used in three situations:
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    1) On enemies that _will_ kill the group unless reduced to dead quickly.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Usually enemies like this are higher in level than the group. For Burn in
    this case to be effective, the enemy must still be within about 5 levels of
    the caster (or be affected by a 'weakening' spell like Malaise or Tashan).
    If an enemy fits these requirements, you burn it to the group as fast as you
    can, CALLing out the fact that you're nuking. Be aware that you're likely
    going to draw the creature onto you, so have another caster laying burn on
    simultaneously, or expect to get eaten.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    2) On enemies that are running.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Runners are bad. They bring more enemies, or they come back to haunt you
    when you least need it. Burn enemies who are low on health into the dead
    state. You'll be much happier, and so will your group. Recovery begins that
    much faster.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    3) To accelerate a fight when you have excess (what's that) mana. If you
    have full mana, you can use a bit of burn in the midst of a moderate fight
    to accelerate the combat. PLEASE be careful to wait until a member of your
    party has done equal or greater than the amount of damage your spell will
    do, or expect to get jumped. The reason for this type of burn is simple. The
    mana regeneration rate is fixed. If you have max mana, you're not
    regenerating mana, and thus are being inefficient. However, do not do this
    sort of burn below about 75% mana. If you do so, you're asking for a
    situation in which you'd need that mana to survive.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Shields:
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Like burn, but BETTER. I've actually decided that Magicians are primarily
    one thing. Shield providers. Though this may seem like an
    oversimplification, but Magician shields are VERY efficient and very
    powerful in a group. They can make a given warrior 40-50% more efficient,
    and combined with healing, can be an unstoppable force that allows groups to
    take out enemies that would normally be impossible for another group without
    a Magician.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Any time you feel that the group might have even a slightly difficult fight,
    drop a damage shield or two, and watch the opposition melt away. Don't
    forget to shield your elemental if it doesn't have one of it's own.
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p>Warrior role:</b></p>
<blockquote>
  This is where the additional complexity of the Magician class comes calling.
  During a given combat encounter, you are worrying about the 'Burn' half and
  additionally you have to control and intelligently apply the 'Beats' half to
  some hapless enemy. Don't waste your other half guarding you if you're not in
  danger.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Warriors fill a few roles in a group, but most often they function as tanks.
  They absorb damage while something is dealt with. There are different 'types'
  of tanking: Isolation tanking, and support tanking.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Isolation tanking involves basically soloing a given enemy until the rest of
  your group can come and finish it with you. Most often seen when multiple
  enemies attack the group and you need to split up the damage so one person
  doesn't get axed. Earth is the optimal for this type of operation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Support tanking involves taking the beats and dealing damage while the rest of
  your group pounds down the enemy. This includes using Taunt and sheer number
  of attacks to keep the enemy focused on you preferentially. Fire is the
  optimal for this type of operation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Different elementals can fit a different role in the group, depending on what
  the current combat situation is. Please note that these roles are not fixed
  for a given elemental. All of the elementals can perform these tasks in a
  group, and should. The examples given are just the 'optimal' for the given
  task. If a group has a preference for a given type of combat, then you can
  choose your elemental appropriately.

<p>Some people claim that armor isn't necessary for Magicians and other casters.
They are _wrong_. Find, buy, or steal the best armor you can possibly have and
equip it. Your combat longevity will be greatly increased at ALL levels. As a
rule, I'd suggest having full cloth by the time you hit L5.</p>
<p>Armor is the most important equipment for ALL classes. Since all damage takes
time to deliver, it's best that you are alive when it's your turn to deliver
damage. Armor has two facets to it. The AC, which modifies how often you get
hit, and the damage reduction (not represented in a statistic), which decreases
the amount of damage from each blow. It is absolutely essential to improve your
armor as much as you can. Once you have outfitted yourself in full cloth armor
try taking it all off for a fight and see how much more damage you receive
during combat. You will never doubt armor again.</p>

<p>Magicians have some of the best offensive spells second only to the Wizard.
They are _NOT_ as good as Wizards in sheer offensive power because their spells
are less reliable and do slightly less damage. Magician spells are also slower
than Wizards and thus easier to interrupt.</p>
<p>Magicians are a partial hybrid between Wizards and a utility caster.
Offensive spells all start around 1:1 (damage to mana ratio and as you increase
in levels, your spells become more efficient. At much higher levels you begin to
get 2:1 damage to mana ratios... very nice indeed. The damage to mana ratio is
the 'Eff' value which is merely damage divided by mana cost. Anything above 100%
is better than 1:1 efficient, and higher numbers are more efficient (though they
may not be that 'effective', remember the reliability factor for new spells).</p>
<p>Where the Magician really shines is in the Summon X spells. Magicians get
more Summon spells than any other caster. These are the bread and butter for a
Magician and the main reason that any smart group of adventurers would give up
their cleric for... Or maybe not. :)</p>

  Again, this should replace Burn as your main spell at L8. It's the first of

  This does a bit more than Shock of Blades, and it can be used as a slightly
  more effective finisher when needed. However, it has a huge drawback in being
  a 'bolt' spell. These have a tendency to miss their target because of a
  minimum range and some tracking issues. Always stand a bit back from your
  target, and have a clear LOS to the intended target. Never good to impact a
  Flame Bolt on the back of a group member. They don't like that.

  it remains better than 1:1 efficient and with each additional enemy within the
  AEO a bonus. Be aware that this spell has a _tiny_ AEO. The enemies almost
  have to be stacked on the same space for them to get hit by it. Best usage of
  this spell can be to target a friendly character who is being attacked by more

  The first of the 'rain' type spells. These are similar to damage over time,
  but different. They are an area affect spell with two stages. Hitting a
  monster with both stages is optimal, but rather difficult as the monsters
  usually move out of the way of the successive waves. Also _really_ hacks off

  purpose of hitting creatures that can only be hit by magical weapons. Probably
  should be your first purchase if possible, as it increases your combat
  efficiency tremendously.</p>

  Decreases the healing rate of your elemental, while increasing its damage

  when in a group, as regeneration is very useful for soloing Mage and

  to tell whether this spell could be a solo spell (ie: it wears off after

  <p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0">Phantom Leather<br>
  ????<br>
  At present, this spell blows. It overwrites your Shieldings (Lesser, Minor,
  and Shielding at least, probably all of them) while providing less AC, no HP
  bonus, and no MR bonus. However, it does provide the equivalent of Leather
  Armor for the purposes of damage absorption. Unless the overwriting is fixed,
  I don't feel that this is worth it for mere Leather. The upper level versions
  (Chain and Plate) _might_ be worth it, because the damage absorption on Chain
  and Plate is rather large, however, at that level it's likely you'll required
  the health and magic resistance more than decreasing the damage of a few blows
  by 10 or so. (Out of 100, well... it's just not going to make that much
  difference.)

  Supposed to tell you if an item is magical. Beta was 'interesting' because all

  5<br>
  Creates a ball of light than moves out from your position at your current Z

  in the world. Also could be used as a signal flare to tell someone to start
  something (a fetch for instance) if they are not in your group and you can't
  'tell' them directly.

  40<br>
  Returns you immediately to your home site. Damn useful for escaping a pinch
  (if your elemental is going down and you're no where near zone). Also can be
  used to shorten travel times. Because Magicians (as far as I know) cannot use
  the 'Gates' of the world (Tox, North, Fay), I have a tendency to 'Bind' myself
  about halfway between where I'm going and where I've been, thus travel times
  are shortened without sacrificing flexibility.

  Bleargh. Can be useful to find an errant elemental. Also useful if you are

  similar to the Sense Magic spell.

  <p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0">Invisibility<br>
  30<br>
  Standard invisibility. Good for getting by the baddies who killed you to loot
  your corpse. Be warned. ANYTHING you do will dispel the effect. This includes:
  spell-casting, combat, looting your corpse.<br>
  Be warned. This does NOT protect you from Undead. You have to have
  Invisibility to Undead to avoid their foul gaze. Aside from that, useful, but
  not to be relied upon.

  <p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0">Eye of Zomm<br>
  35<br>
  Dear God. This spell is truly an amazing thing to behold. If you have EVER had
  problems in your life when you had to run into danger to 'fetch' some bad
  things to have a ruckus with... well, you're in need of your own Eye of Zomm.<br>
  The spell creates a little 'self' which acts as a mobile targeting recticle.
  You can target things, and if within range can cast spells through the eye. It
  moves very quickly, but is of relatively short duration (around 30 seconds).
  Additionally, it has few hit points, so can be easily destroyed if an enemy is
  so inclined (they usually are). Even worse (for you) is that a destroyed eye
  will cause an enemy NPC to rumble towards you at a rather fast clip.<br>
  Common usage of the Eye is for scouting an unknown area safely (mostly), and
  for luring enemies to you with a bit of well placed burn.

  <p style="line-height: 100%; margin: 0">Cancel Magic<br>
  30<br>
  Breaks the first 'buff' or 'de-buff' on a given character. Not the best way to
  get rid of an offending magic, but will do the job. Note, that buffs are
  basically a 'stack' that functions FIFO. First on, first off with respect to

  give you any idea which things are invisible, because they merely look normal.
