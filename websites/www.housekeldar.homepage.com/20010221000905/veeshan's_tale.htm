<p><i>Greetings all. This night I was lucky to be part of a GM event. I had died
and on my way through Steamfont I found a female bard, with a drake that seemed
to be quite affectionate for her. She bade us to sit down so that she could tell
us a tale.</i></p>
<p><i>After a few moments around ten-twelve of us sat down, and she began her
tale. While she went on, she played her lute..and all our eyes were glued upon
this new and enchanting stranger. Below is a copy of the tale that she was
gracious enough to tell us. I enjoyed it immensly as it was not the same as most
(just kill all the gm run monsters). I look forward to the future of this story.
I am somewhat unsure. Possibly this is the introduction of the new expansion and
the Iksar race. If this story continues and I am not there to hear the tale,
please get screen shots and record what there is, as I am interested.
Continuances of this story can be sent to the <a href="mailto:celestria@home.com">webmisstress</a>
for further publication.<br>

<p>Sainy says, Friends pay heed, for the song I have to sing is of the greatest
importance....</p>
<p>The song is called The tale of Veeshan's veil</p>
<p>From the world's core, the rock children rose<br>
Shielded from wurms eyes by dirt and stone<br>
With gnarled hands and broken bones<br>
They carved their place into Veeshan's home<br>
</p>
<p>Soon after, the deserts and woodlands and swamps<br>
All nurtured life planted, by interloping Gods<br>
Veeshan left her children, in peaks carved by her claws<br>
Turned her back on Norrath, and her fellow Gods laws<br>
</p>
<p>The Crystalline Dragon, content in her lair<br>
Sealed off the Sky, and still slumbers there<br>
Some dragons went mad, apart from their Queen<br>
Others took charge and formed a wurm Ring<br>
</p>
<p>The rebels were hunted and sent from the peaks<br>
To dwell in the lands inhabited by the weak<br>
One of these rebels, a lady white as snow<br>
Swept up a shard of nature unknown<br>
</p>
<p>As years dragged on, one by one the wurms fell<br>
Into a deep slumber, from what no one could tell<br>
Their magic had faded, because of the shard?<br>
***A drake circles Sainy protectively***<br>
Or perhaps from the magic they call Veeshan's Veil<br>
</p>
<p>Now a new verse to this legend I'll share<br>
In regards to the Sky, and what is happening there..<br>
Veeshan still slumbers, the veil has worn thin<br>
The Wurm Queen's neglect wakes her children again.<br>
***Sainy pauses for a moment***<br>
***A drake wraps it's tail around Sainy's leg***<br>
***A drake nibbles on Sainy's hair then floats out of reach***<br>
</p>
<p>My song is done, but I will warn you to heed the words of my verse for they
speak the truth!<br>
</p>
<p>Mortals now visit where Veeshan slumbers, and only dragons once dwelled....<br>
But the door to the Sky is not a one way portal.<br>
There is much to learn from the great Wurms.....and much to fear<br>
***A drake whistles***<br>
</p>
<p>Come my friend...it is time that we move on.<br>
There are many more to hear this tale<br>
***A drake screeches***<br>
Thank you my friends<br>
</p>
<i>
<p>And from there our new friends departed, with not a sword or spell lifted in
a murderous intent towards this wondrous couple.</p>
