I was born in the middle of a great storm that lasted for almost a week. I was named
Tempestade, which means Storm in the language of a distant land. My father, a guard of
Neriak, never had to chance to see his only child. He died protecting the city against an invasion of dervishes. My mother died a few months later.
I was raised by clerics, worshipers of Innoruuk. I learned to love Him and His city of
Neriak, and swore to protect their honor against the beasts of the land. It was not too long before I learned about other races in our world. During my trip to the city of Freeport, in search of more books for spells, I could feel the hate and despise regardless of my curiosity about them. On my way out, I saw heads turning and someone shouted "Kill the dark soul!". I ran to the gates, followed by a furious crowd. I was almost out when I felt powerful hands pulling me to the side, forcing me to hide behind a shop. 
It was another of my race, a Dark Elf with the most intense and beautiful green eyes I'd ever seen. I felt in love with him immediately, and his shy smile swept me off my feet. He saved my life, that strange knight called
Colubridae. He took me back to the safety of Neriak, killing beasts and undead monsters that attacked us on the way. 
I didn't see him again for a long time, but it didn't matter. He was out, learning the arts of war, and I knew in my heart we were destined to belong to each other. So I waited.
As soon as I learned my first spells, the clerics of Neriak told me it was time I left their secret temple and dedicated my life to the citizens of our beloved city. And so I was alone again, but my healing talents soon started to be known around the land.
I met a young man named Wyndwalker during a big fight against fire beetles. We became good friends, and when I had the idea of creating a guild, I knew Wyndwalker would be the man to lead the group if something happened to me. 
It was a happy time, because when I became High Priestess and Leader of House
Kel'Dar, Wyndwlaker being my second in command, Colubridae came back to town. My love became also my Commander, and together with
Wyndwalker, we built our family.<br>

There's not a lot to tell you about my past. I don't remember most of it, probably because it wouldn't do me any good to remember. My first memories come from a time not so long ago, when I worked night and day making arrows and bows for a hateful race in a horrible city. I was a slave, and the goblins that kept me prisoner referred to me as "the dark scum". I had blinding hate growing in my heart, and knew I wouldn't be there for long. My hands, strong after who knows how many years working for those monsters, broke their necks one by one. I finally escaped, and wandered around for a long time, sleeping in the open, killing for food, drinking the water of the rivers. I didn't have a name. 
When I first saw the Nektulos Forest, I was in awe. Darkness was familiar, and I finally met my people again. They called me
Zandru, the one that escaped hell.
Fletching kept me but not for long. When I bought my first sword, I knew what my destiny would be. Exhaustive training turned me into a warrior, fearless and hateful. I will wipe out the monsters, I will destroy races and cities, and I will guard the lives of my people.
House Kel'Dar took me in when I was nothing but an apprentice in the art of killing. Now I am their guardian, in eternal and voluntary service.

My parents are druids, brothers and sisters are druids or rangers, and I could conceive no life other than the childhood spent in
Qeynos, treating and loving the animals around me. At the age of fifteen, with the spells I had learnt, I became one of the main vets in my beautiful city. 
<br>Jhadin and I grew up together. His love for adventure matched my love for animals, and we had been friends since before we could walk. It was natural for us to fall in love, to be married, to expect a happy life. And so it happened.
<br>Not long after we got married, in a simple ceremony at the druid temple in Surefall Glade, his call for adventure reached its peak, and he wanted to travel. None of us had ever been far from
Qeynos, but we had faith in each other, and decided to leave. We left behind our families and friends, carrying little more than food and water for a few days. 
<br>Out in the open, our hearts were filled with joy. Mountains, rivers and caves became our home. And before we realized how far we had gone, the mountains became plains, there was a road ahead, and the busy city of Freeport was before us. Different races wandered around, as I watched, fascinated. We bought food and water, and walked away, still a little confused by the crowd.
<br>Near Freeport, in an area known as East Commonlands, we met a strange woman. She was extremely beautiful, gracious, with weird dark skin and white hair. Jhadin whispered in my ear: be careful, precious, she is a dark elf, they are evil!. How he knew those things, I cant imagine.
<br>For some reason I did not fear her. Stepping closer, I realized she was hurt, and a dead snake was at her feet. I followed my instinct and casted a cure poison spell, followed by healing. Her grateful eyes told me she was no evil soul. 
<br>I am Zandru, Guardian of House KelDar, she explained slowly. I was suprised she even spoke our language.
<br>I am Tyarash, Vet of Qeynos, and this is my husband Jhadin, I said, not without a touch of jealousy. She was so beautiful!
<br>Zandru gave me a scimitar, and said she was forever in debt, for I had saved her life. Before I could answer, others approached, some dark elves, some other races I did not know. They were all part of her family, or so I understood.
<br>Tolerance is in my nature. They were different from us, but not evil. What is evil? They may have different beliefs, but we are all children of the land. Their Gods and ours could never get along, but I am not a goddess. I am half human, half elf, and those were my new friends. They kill the animals I adore, but only in self-defense. I turn my eyes away from them in those moments, and ask in my heart that they will be forgiven. I am one of them now, a member of House
Kel'Dar. Their lives are my priority, and I am no longer Tyarash, Vet of Qeynos. I am now known as
Tyarash, the Keeper of House KelDar.
