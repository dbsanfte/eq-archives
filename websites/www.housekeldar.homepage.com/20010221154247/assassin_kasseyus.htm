<p align="left"><b><font color="blue" size="2">The Beginning</font></b>
<p><font size="2">I am Kasseyus.  How Did I come to be here you ask.. Well.. I shall Tell you.  My Story begins in the grand city of
Neriak.  My earliest memmorys start from the age of 16, being but a scrawny elf, running errands for the Neriak Ogres who dewlled there..If was from them I learned to Hate.  My life also revolved around the Trolls that lived there too... It was from these disgusting beasts I learn to Loath...and from My Own people... the Dark
Elfs.. It was from them I learned of passion.  Not the passion of another soul.. but the passion of Death... the reapers touch.. the cold embrace of eternal sleep.
<br> 
At 21, I was discovered by a faceless shadow.  A non-entity.... a person who did not exist.  Master of shadows..  He was known only to me as Master.. and I was nothing.  I spent my the next 30 years of my life in the grand Halls of the Ebon Mask, cleaning the floors and polishing the weapons.  Observing with my young eyes, seeking out a better life in the hopes that if I saw it, I could grab onto it and take it as my own.  These years of servitude taught me Patience, the skill that lies in waiting. One day, after all that time.. I saw my chance...  My Master lay asleep in his bed as I entered to light the candles of the morning chant and beside him...  beside him lied his trusty weapon, the Fanged Skull Stiletto.  Never had I saw it out of his hands and here it was... and here he was totally
defencless.  What an oppertunity I had and knowing I might never get such again, I took it.  Within seconds my hands grasped this mytical weapon and I felt an overwhelming sence of power; grinning insanly I threw myself at my recumberant master hissing violently with bloodlust in control.  As the dagger passed into the sheets, i heard his gasp for a second....then he turnbed to face me...  the faceless one's visage was as ghastly as i had always thought... his eyes bore into me with utter hatred that one such as he could be slain by a mere serving slave.  As his breath raspped out of bloodied lungs he spat an ancient curse it me and clawed at my tattered tunic in the hopes of somehow saving himself.. but it was to late as the magical weapon drank the lifeforce away and stored it within itself.  The dagger clattered to the flor as I backed away... what had I done?  I had slain the master that had taken me in...  clothed me..fed me..  as the realisation of what I had done sunk in, the last of my emotional constraints flittered away and I stood...  those ghastly eyes still boring into me, filled with hatred.  hatred towards me for what I had done.  I felt the burning desire to leave.. to run from this scene but somthing rooted me in place.  Maybee some long forgotten twang of
concience, although slight held me in its thrall... No.. I would wait here and accept my fate.  
 <br>
It is strange now I think back on it....  the masters accepted it as the normal.. as it rightly was the approved way for a master to select a successor.  Assasination is the only real way for a Rogue to die, anything else would be
dishonourable.  All that my master owned became mine, with the exception of the Armour he wore and the blade that he
weilded.  All his worldy good belonged to me.. just as they will belong to he who I select to assasinate me.  And he who I select, I will hate and he will take over my role as I sleep eternally.  BUT.. that is many years from now.. I am still but a Young Elf at the tender age of 52, the most venerable of my race living to be over 1000 years old.  THat is the story of how I came to be.. and Now. the Story of how I came.. to Live.
 <br>
Freeport.  Land of the Vile Humans, and all to often frequented by out most hated surface cousins.  I sat on the rooftops and watched a scene unfold.  A female Dark Elf was walking through the streets alone and
unarmoured, young she was.. far to young to know her dangers...  by then I was almost 70 years old.  I watched with keen intrest although I felt nothing.  The many faces I have watched die by my own hand have crushed and buried whatever twang of concience that held me so many years ago.  Still I looked onwards.  Just then, an Elf of the Woods suddenly cried out, "Kill the Dark Soul!".  The Young lass sprinted away with the grace of a unicorn but as the mob grew, her chances of survival grew ever less.  I lamented the fall of such a graceful creature as I saw great potential in her....  but then I saw what looked to be a Shadowknight of Innoruuk creep around to a building near the gates...  "This should be
interestin&quot; I said to myself.  As the Female figure ran, she stumbled as exaustion gripped her limbs... then the Shadowknight reached out and pulled her to saftly away from the cries of the mob, and away from my prying eyes.  With a grin, I leaped from the rooftops, into the darkness.  Is I trained in my arts withing the safty of Neltukos forest when I heard an approach of an umfamiliar figure, I quickly leaped into the treetops to observe this situation...  A figure emerged into the light and climbed atop the fallen tree I was using as my base.  She had the look about her as a Cleric of
Innoruuk.. but that was not it.. somthing.. familiar.... FREEPORT!  I knew i recongined the face.  But, I was stil uneasy...  My Rogues sences still warned danger as those among my order are seldom welcomed warmly by anyone.  A chittenous wail cried forth from the north as the Cleric leapt to her feet, a young elf ran towards her, bleeding from several wounds.  He had the look about him of a wizard, but Dark Elfs are soldom known for their skill in arcane destruction rather than the forbiddon art of Necromancy.  The Young fighter leapt to the injured mans aid and together they fought hard and the persuing fire beetles were slain.  They started to talk but I was not overly interested to hear, I crept away, without ever being detected.
 <br>
And That.. Is my life..as so far as I care to inform.. But HOW did I become the Royal Assasin to THe Grand House of
Kel'Dar?  Well.... I may tell you this.... in time.<br>
<b><font color="blue">The Entry into House Kel'Dar</font></b><br>
Silence filled the night air as I crept silently through the undergrowth. My skills as a Rogue do not allow me many friends, but I had grown accustomed to hunting in small raiding parties and I particularly enjoyed hunting with other rogues. Ahead in the distance, I saw a flickering light...I crept forward making almost no sound, using the gnarled tree roots to cover my footfalls, then I saw my target; a lone aqua goblin. Scrawny and weak but blessed by its foul god with a scream that could put a banshee to shame. If it even thought for a second it was in danger, it would panic and rouse the entire goblin camp and so it was my job to teach him a lesson in silence. Closer and closer I came, silent as a shadow...so close... I could hears it's breathing as it stood absent-mindedly starring out to sea. I raised my dagger on high and... I hesitated. I saw something more important to me than the kill and it was hanging from its belt; there must have been about 5gold coins and my instincts led the way. With swift fingers I plucked the pouch from the goblin and leapt up into the trees. It gasped at the rush of air and span round with its spear at the ready, shaking with the fear of whatever horrors filled its mind. I looked down upon it and realized the importance of my mission. With the grace only a Teir'Dal could possess, I allowed myself to fall on the helpless goblin, foot angled leading the way brought it a crack upon its head. <br>

It whimpered and backed away bringing its spear up defensively; that lone action served only to delay its demise. I began to glower at it menacingly, daring it to yell out. I noticed its expanding chest and knew what was coming, I flung out with a soft soled boot and brought it a crack between its legs. Hey.. Who said Rogues fight fair. As it clutched itself and fell to the floor, I swiftly knelt down and slit its throat. As it gurgled and spat, locked in the throes of death I stood up and spoke in the thieves cant(which is a complicated system of gestures and signals that make no sound, known only to Rogues and
smart-arse adventurers)that the deed was done and sped off into the night, looking for the other sentry. <br>

Xeren, a rogue I had met in the halls of the ebon mask translated my message to the third member of our group who nodded. As i approached my next target, the inner guard, I allowed my mind to wander about the spoils of the night this so simple operation would bring. These goblins were said to be the guardians of the famous Sapphire of Souls which was a very special items indeed. Some Necromancer lord in Neriak was said to be searching for it and was willing to pay a high price and who was I to pass up such an opportunity. I silently approached the other sentry and even without thinking I ducked into a crouch as he spun around. Something had alerted it to some danger, it probably smelled the blood of its fallen companion of the ground.. Damn my carelessness I should have disposed of the body instead of thinking of the money. Such mistakes a Mask cannot afford to make but it was now aware of something and I had to act quickly...but how. Then my problem was answered as my brother of shadows descended upon the goblin like a shadow, its muffled cries soon ended and my companion picked up the limp goblin and hurled him out to sea. Even to this day it amazed me how strong he could be and still keep his stealth but what I lacked in strength I more than made up for in my natural skill and agility. But those things put to the side, there was work to be done; we silently approached the main camp with the 3rd member of our party following behind us making no sound at all. <br>

When we reached the outskirts of the goblin encampment, Xeren and I spread out to cover both flanks of the camp... as soon as we were in position we counted our foes... 3 Goblin Warriors and a cloaked figure. No Problem I thought and signaled to the 3rd it was time to begin. With a low murmur he began to speak in a low, croaking voice and then raised his arms above his head and cried out a mystic chant. All of the goblins in the camp bolted upright but the cloaked figure remained seated, weapons in hand the goblins began to rush at the figure but their spirited charge was soon brought to a crashing close when all 3 were propelled backwards against a cliff wall and slumped into unconsciousness. The cloaked figure stood up slowly and looked towards the wizard. This was no gangling weak goblin we saw... but a hulking, muscular monstrosity the likes of which I had never before seen. It shrugged the robe off and drew its weapon; my eyes gleamed as i beheld the jewel encrusted mace which as well as being an effective weapon in combat, would provide a kings ransom to the right merchant. The thing advanced on the wizard as he frantically tried to recall a spell that would work on the behemoth. <br>

Closer and closer it got and I thought that if I let the thing kill the wizard, then the loot would only be a 2 way split but that was not to happen as my Rogue brother with his deadly bow in hand had 3 arrows in the monsters back before it even managed to turn around; it did though and Iwould be damned if I would stand and watch my Rogue Brother take the glory for this kill. I put my own deadly bow to work and between the 2 of us arrows thudded into the beast almost constantly but it seemed able to simply shrug off the attacks and chose one of us to advance upon. It chose me. I dropped my bow and drew my twin daggers. The Fabled Stiletto of the Bloodclaw and a Dragoon Dirk. It closed and I pierced it once, twice, three times in the chest but it seemed only to phase it a little and the barrage of arrows from Xeren clanked into its back, Its mighty mace swung at me but I was able to avoid it's deadly reach...that was until, it charged at me in utter frustration; as its mammoth bulk hit me I felt the wind being knocked out of me but it did not stop there, it kept charging until it ran directly into the cliff, needless to say I took most of the damage. It backed off and I slumped to the ground, bleeding from several cuts and gashes the sharp mountain offered; the beast turned upon Xeren with the same fury, mace sporadically swinging at the swift Rogue as his twin daggers scored hit after hit on its monstrous bulk. <br>

When it looked like Xeren was beginning to tire, the Wizard, after much meditation raised his arms and spoke 3 simple words,
&quot;Clato, Verate, Nicto&quot;. The beasts skin began to heat up and it backed away, clawing at itself then it combusted and flames burst out of every orifice, it wailed and screamed and clawed itself, running into the rockface desperately trying to put out the flames. By then I had managed to get up and saw the beast in peril. What a pity I thought, he might have made a fine pair of boots. I leapt up and began my relentless assault on the pitiful beast and
Xeren, began also. Then the beast decided it had had enough and turned around to try and flee...bad mistake. "Only a fool turns his back on a Rogue!", echoed Xeren and I together and I leapt at the beast, seeing my opportunity and buried my dagger in its back. it wailed and fell to the ground struggling to regain its balance then...as if to seal its fate, the wizard gave it another blast and it fell over, engulfed in flames and bleeding from a thousand cuts. We decided to camp there that night being sorely battered from the fight and out wizard friend looking totally drained but then...when do wizards not look drained. <br>
&quot;Yer name, Mighty Wizard I did not catch by the way...", I said as the campfire blazed. <br>
"My name be Delray of the House Kel'Dar, should you need to know."<br>
"You fought well, Delray of the House Kel'Dar. Should your Guild be as skilled as thee, I may just pay them a visit"<br>
Later that night, we counted out booty; much to the pity, the Sapphire of Souls was not there, rather we found a note stating it was lost deep in the ancient dungeon if
Najena, stolen by some foul common thief so there and then I decided to look for it.. one day. As for the mace, I lost the coin toss and it was handed with no small amount of jealousy to Xeren who took it with a grin. I vowed to get that back too. All in all, the money was not bad, the monster thing had over 6 platinum coins in its purse and over 20 gold pieces so i was not complaining for to long, but one thing lingered on my mind, this House Kel'Dar the wizard had spoken of... it sounded like one of the Houses of Neriak as the Wizard Delray was indeed a Teir'Dal of what looked like a Noble family. Yes... I decided to investigate this as soon as
possable. Noble Houses of Neriak were always rich. 
<br>
As I arrived at the Third gate of Neriak I headed off to the Halls of the Ebon Mask to store my hard earned loot in the place known only to me and my former master, but then i remembered about the House of Kel'Dar and I thought to myself, where would that be...my search led me to the commons which was by far, the most populated part of my beloved home and sure enough, after a little searching and steel persuasion of passing unfortunate citizens I had at last arrived at the gates to the House
Kel'Dar. It would only be correct to enter the front gates I thought to myself so I stood, without hesitation and grappled into the walls and disappeared along the roof looking for a way in; after all, who keeps their riches on the ground level?<br>
After a little work, I entered the House through a small window and crept silently along the corridors looking for something worth my attention...the only thing that seemed worth anything was the voices coming from a large set of double doors, voices often spoke things and words can often be invaluable.<br>
"And The Last of our gold was stolen this morning...we need more security!", said a mans voice.<br>
"How do we pay for more security, and how do we pay for the security we have now after our gold has been stolen? They may not be doing a good job, but they wont do it for nothing.", said a female voice. <br>
"If they did it properly, we would not need to...How do common guards fight of thieves, this looks like the work of the Mask", said another male voice, something about it was familiar.<br>
"You know what they say, Get a thief to catch a thief.", said the first male voice.<br>
"I Knew someone, I met him recently, He said he was a Mask and he expressed an interest when I mentioned I was from a House
Kel'Dar. Maybe he can help us.", said the second male voice. It sounded very familiar.<br>
"Damn it, Now is not the time for talk, now is the time for action!!! I will not stand around and let our House be killed by common thieves!", said a rather angry male voice, "I go now, to find a solution."<br>
The Double doors burst open and a figure decked in full bronze armor strode down the corridor, had it not been for my skilled reflexes, the doors would surely have crushed my body as the Cliff wall did so many nights ago. From my perch atop the doors I could see into the room quite clearly. There was a long table with 12 chairs and 12 placements, One chair at the head of the table was larger than the others and was occupied by a female figure, but the doorframe obscured my view of her face but the other seated figure was very visible and very clear. It was the Wizard Delray to whom I aided my venture to sack the Goblin camp and he was talking. I decided that I would make an appearance, and if things turned ugly, I still had my escape route. With the stealth only a Teir'Dal could possess,  I crept silently into the room and to the large table without being seen, then in a rush of motion I spun a chair around and was sat on it with both feet on the table, apparently relaxing before the others could stand up in surprise.<br>
"Please be seated...Allow me to introduce myself. I am Kasseyus, Lone Soldier of the Ebon Mask. Greetings to you, Delray. and to you, whom I assume to be....", I stopped, my flow stolen. The Seated female figure who I assumed to be the head of the house, was in fact the young Dark Elf I saw in Freeport all that time ago, and later in Nektulos forest. I was amazed that one person is such a short time could rise to lead a House of
Neriak. From the shadows a door opened and entered a male wizard and a female warrior who seeing me, a Rogue and not one welcomed in society,  instantly assumed the worst and took a ready stance. I bolted upright balancing on the table and turned to the double doors and there stood the figure who had walked swiftly past me in the corridor just a few minutes before. <br>
"The ShadowKnight of Innoruuk&quot;, I whispered aloud, remembering back in Freeport, the one who saved the girl from the mob. "Well, Now that I have your attention...allow me... to.....
Ahh... Allow me to offer my services to your noble House Kel'Dar, I hear you are having some security problems no? Well who better to solve your little mystery than I? Master of Shadows".
"How do we know your intent is Noble, Rogue?", asked the female warrior.
"You don't", I replied, "But I came here to seek gold and if that involves stealing it, or catching a common thief, then so be it. If you don't need me here, then I shall be off, escaping your clutches will be no easy feat, but I have been in worse situations -trust me. I make a far better friend than I do an enemy. I will give you my word that I will not deceive you."<br>
After a lengthy pause, Delray arose and said, "I think we should trust him". We have nothing to loose as our gold is stolen already and I would so dearly love to have a Mask on our side for a change. And I heard that there is an Honor among Rogues about giving their word, not like common thieves."
"Such is a dangerous thing to do", spoke the ShadowKnight from the Doorway, Sword in hand, its black blade, gleaming in the torchlight.<br>
"But Delray is correct. We do have nothing to loose and I feel there is something Noble about this man. Kasseyus your name is. We will sit and discuss this matter. You will remain under guard until we return. <br>
Needless to say, when they left I incapacitated the guards and left that place with due haste, but I left a note, that if they did accept my offer, I could be found on the Nektulos Phirana Bridge the following night at midnight. The female figure came with all who was in the room. Tempestade her name was. Leader of the House
Kel'Dar. My Raiding partner, Delray and his partner, the female Warrior who was known as
Starlyli. The other wizard introduced himself as Wyndwalker and second in command of the House Kel'Dar and the ShadowKnight who rescued the younger Tempestade from the hands of a vicious mob was
Colubridae, One of Innoruuks most devout followers and I later discovered that the two were Married under the watchful gaze of
Innoruuk. I was accepted into House Kel'Dar for this job which I did, I might add to perfection. Apprehending the common thief and by a remarkable stroke of luck, the fortune of Kel'Dar that he slowly pilfered was kept in the same place as the loot from other Houses he stole from which made Kel'Dar suddenly very rich and very powerful. After the job was over, I was approached and asked to remain, to be part of the family that this House strived for and worked so hard to build and protect. As a Rogue, I was used to solitude and I liked it, but after much soul searching I had decided to stay and adopt them as my own. I moved out to the House and established myself in there, I took the name as my own and wore it with pride. And even though, to this day I am a Solitary figure, preferring the thoughts in my head and the daggers on my belt for company, it is good to know that when I come home, there are people to come home to. <br>
I am Kasseyus Kel'Dar. <br>
Assassin of the House Kel'Dar. <br>
Slayer of the Foul Behemoth and Looter of the Nine Hells of Norrath.
