Thought you might enjoy this, I know I didn't going through it. Not sure it's an idiot file, just more a funny journal (so my friends that didn't have to go through it say).  Well, this all happened over a 2 month period, but I refer to each time I tried as a day. Several people tried to help me along the way, thanks to all of them.<br>
Day one: Hear about magnificent quest given by female warrior in Halas. Talk to female warrior in
Halas, get told to hunt rats. Continue to bug NPC for 2 hours before going and killing rats.
<br>
Day two: Find out who really gives quest for Langseax. Talk to said person. Said person sends me to Barb village in W
Karana. Residents in W Karana give me the finger. One NPC is nice enough to laugh at me and sends me back to
Halas. Bring the smack dab down on gnoll commander while passing through BB. NPC in Halas tell me to get sweaty shirt for some mutt back in W Karana to help me track the murderer. NPC says Dok has shirt. Talk to
Dok, who tells me to find Tundra Jack, as he sold the shirt to this Jack. 
<br>
Day three: Finally find Tundra Jack. Find out that my "a" key is still mapped to attack and that I had not in fact hit the "/" key first. Wave to Halas guards as I jog back to get my corpse. Wander around blind in the dark in
Everfrost, find corpse. Find Iceberg but no Jack.
<br>
Day four: Find jack again, remap "a" key, then ask for the shirt. Jack tells me to not quit my day job. Mentions his bear has it and I need to distract the bear with "Lion's Delight". Con Iceberg, smile and walk away. Head to W
Karana. Ask everyone and their brother about Lion's delight. Get the finger again. Go back to
Halas. Ask an NPC vendor about Lion's delight.
<br>
Day five: At the advice of the vendor, head back to W Karana. No finger this time, they are getting to know me. Talk to vendor, get shipment, take shipment to Halas,get Lion's delight!!!!!! Go to
Everfrost, get message that I am out of food. Hmm. Find Iceberg, find out that I ate Lion's delight.
<br>
Day six: Back to W Karana, they have lemonade waiting for me this time. Get shipment and head back to Halas to get the Lion's delight. Head to find Iceberg. Give bear treat, bear gives me a shirt!!!! Take shirt back to W
Karana, put smack on gnoll elite guard on the way. Give shirt to Frostbite the dog. Dog pees on my leg, takes off. I follow dog. Dog stops to fight everything and anything. Dog continues, dog stops and barks. Dornin sees Basil!!!!! Basil cons blue, Dornin drools, and attacks. **SERVER HAS STOPPED RESPONDING** Log back on, NPC is gone, but I am still alive - and lost.
<br>
Day seven: Find fishing village, get delivery, head to Halas, get Lion Delight, find Iceberg, get shirt, head back to W Karana (they wave now), give shirt to dog, follow dog, see group of people attacking Basil in the distance, see them kill steal him from me and log off.
<br>
Day eight: do the whole run from one place to another thing, give shirt to dog, follow dog.
OMG!!!! It's PAGLAN!!!!! The rare spawn!!! I am gonna get the two hander!!! Cons yellow. /who all
t'or. Hmm, only 8 people on, all in Cazic, none that could gate or teleport. Hmm, no healers in the zone, weird. What the heck, gotta try, got buffs. Loading, please wait.
<br>
Day nine: get corpse, start over, forget about food, eat Lion's delight, start over. Very frustrated, log off in W Karana in the home of one of the locals.
<br>
Day ten: Give shirt to dog, dog runs off, stops, runs back to pen. Apparently someone was waiting on the NPC to spawn and killed him.
<br>
Day eleven: do everything, see Basil, fight Basil, Povar and login server crashes. Get back on in 3 hours, run from Halas to get corpse.
<br>
Day twelve: kick dog, give dog shirt, dog runs to Basil. Attack Basil, kill Basil, Basil has nothing on him. Petition, Verant laughs, log off, spend rest of day cussing, give up on quest.

<br>Lythe says, 'Perchance we should smite the forsaken walking dead in a mansion I have heard tell of. The gods would certainly be thankful and bards would sing our praises.'

<br>Endaar shakes his head, as apparently he holds information of some import.

<br>Endaar says, 'Nay, that land does not want of our company. It is inhabitated by many an unvirtuous and self-serving knave. By my hand, I would send them all on their way to the deepest crevasse of Hell itself.'

<br>Tashiara says, 'We are indebted to you, Endaar. Shielding us from the perils of such common rogues is revealing of your kind heart.'

<br>Lythe says, 'Endaar, this is bogus, your spells do too much damage.'

<br>Kylarie says, 'Yeah my strike doesn't do near as much as your dd spells'

<br>Tashiara says, 'you're all going up levels too fast, damn this is unbalanced'

<br>Lythe nods

<br>Kylarie says, 'and I'm a cleric and can't use swords! WHY?

<br>Lythe says, 'it's probably pointless, but do you want to try Unrest?'

<br>Endaar sighs.

<br>Endaar says, 'Everyone was camping with their broken characters last time, and quite frankly, until Verant gets off their behinds and fixes all my spells I don't have a chance in there. When will wizards be able to tank like everyone else?'

<br>Tashiara says, 'At least you're not a rogue, they completely and utterly and totally and undeniably SUCK! None of their skills work and they can't  use spells and they can't tank. Verant doesn't give a darn about them.'

<br>Kylarie says, 'oh look a broken monster'

<br>Kylarie says, 'it's one of those aqua goblins that are too strong and don't give enough rare items'

<br>Lythe says, 'what the hell, it doesn't matter. I'm going to remake anyways.'

<br>Endaar says, 'you can't solo him Lythe. Your character is underpowered'

<br>Lythe says, 'this is so retarded.. I'm going to die because Verant won't fix the bugs in my race and class 

<br>(Lythe dies at the hands of said broken monster)

<br>Tashiara says, 'just goes to show that we should all have WAY more hit points and mana than we get now'

<br>Kylarie sighs over Lythe's corpse.</font>
