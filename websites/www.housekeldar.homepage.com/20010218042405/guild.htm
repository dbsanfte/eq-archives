        <br>
        After the party, we all moved to Oasis for the traditional beast
        slaying. This time our targets were Sand Giants. We killed quite a few
        of them, plus a poor specter that probably didn't even see it coming :o)
        Congratulations to Group 1 (Marinands, Zleek, Dahak, Zavion and Quadrin)
        for your good work and thanks to group 2 (Kodi, Trynn, Colubridae and
        Saeraan) for pulling and beating the shit out of those giants</font>

When the giants disappeared (gee, wonder why) Sae decided to make "THE" train, and pulled every orc in the zone. I swear it was the biggest conga line I've ever seen. Took him 10 minutes to collect them, 10 seconds for us to kill them. WTG guys :o) It was fun!</div>

</a>By High Priestess Tempestade</font><!--mstheme--></font></h4><font size="2"><a name="temp1">Ahhhh... what a lovely day was yesterday!<br>
It started with me dieing 3 times in the morning... then Col
checked his faction and wooo hooo we could walk through HighHold,
so we said let's travel!!! <br>
We bound in HH and walked happily to East Karana, where a hill
giant quickly ended our journey. Back in HH. <br>
Let's try again, shall we? We weer luckier this time. No hill
giants, and we got to Gorge ok. Fought a couple minoutaurs, wow
this is great! and grouped with a very nice guy. Then something
big and round... what's that, honey? EVIL EYE, ZON.. too late...
our partner is dead, Col and I are charmed and fell down thru the
world to a very scary place. Couldn't move, couldn't cast spells.
Will ANYONE be able to recover our bodies from there? Well, charm
wears off, I gate back to HH alive and kicking. Col somehow gets
out in one piece too. <br>
Still shaking, I make my way back to the Gorge, where our party
is back together. Let's try again. <br>
Couple of minotaurs later, there's the evil eye again. Straight
to us. We back against the wall, too late. I got hit a few times,
Col is charmed... I run. Some kind soul casts SOW on me.
Unfortunately, she casted SOW on Col too and I realize with
horror COL IS HITTING ME!!!!! He is charmed so I think of a
million reasons why I should pardon him while his arrows are
taking pieces off my ass. <br>
Many hits later, I am still alive, Col is not charmed anymore,
after I rooted him, and I am looking for a police station in the
middle of the night to report him for domestic violence. <br>
Ladies, don't fall for the old "The Evil Eye made me do
it!!" trick...<br>

By Protector Starlyli</font></a><!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<a name="star1">
<p align="left"><font size="2"><br>
Have you ever had one of those EQ days where everything that could go wrong did, and then some?  It's the basic story of stories....friends group up, 1 friend pulls, the other friends die.  Well, Aainie, Thomase & myself were grouped in this manner one day, and poor Thomase, being the lovable bard that he is, sang a beautiful song to heal Aainie & myself.  The only problem is that once he did that, he sufficiently pissed off the badguy hitting us & it turned on him.....Loading...Please wait.  And we got his body, and started over and he sang a song.....Loading...Please wait....and we tried again, and he sang a song...and, well...you get the drift.<br>
Well, after loosing all experience gained & then some, we were all a little stressed out...and Thomase was about ready to delete his bard that he had worked so hard to build...so we decided to releave some stress.  I don't remember exactly how it happened, but I believe someone said something to the effect of "I miss being level 1..."<br>
Aainie, Thomase, Kasseyus & I all decided to take a break from the stress of trying not to die & lose levels and all created level 1 characters.  We all made humans, (well, except for me...I wanted to make a wood elf ranger.  I even made the character!  Then, when I started out for Freeport, and Aainie informed me that it was a 45 minute boatride, I quickly camped, deleted & made a human...hehe).  Our only rule was no twinking..just pure clean fun.  We ventured together into the arena in Freeport and proceeded to beat the living piss out of each other!  After about 1/2 hour of that, we ventured out into the outskirts of Freeport and together became the House Kel'Dar Pest Control...we proceded to rid the land of Large Rats and Firebeetles!  It was pure comradarie and fun...the joy of not having to worry about leveling and dying and stuff....I highly recommend it for anyone having an EQ Hell Day!</font></a>
