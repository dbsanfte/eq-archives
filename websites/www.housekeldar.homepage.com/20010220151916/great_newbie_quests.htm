<p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0">This wonderful document was written by
Lothan of the House Kel'Dar</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0"><a href="tips.htm"><b>Back to Tips &amp;
Tricks</b></a></font></p>
<p>

<FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0">Figured I'd take some time to pass on some info regarding leveling from
1 to 20 fairly rapidly. These methods are not by any means the only way, nor are they the best I'm sure, but they have, and still do work
real well for me. I was going to break it up for you by level, but that's kinda hard since a lot of the quests I'm going to suggest, you
can do well into the 20's. Instead I'm going to list some killer exp quests, then follow it up with a summary of where I usually hunt at
certain levels &amp; what I hold onto while fighting those things. Also, a lot of these.. are gg (goodie goodie) quests and
hard for evils(except maybe an enchanter). The evils have some decent quests and routines as well, and maybe I'll write somethin for ya's at a
later time. So... use what ya can, ignore the rest 8 )<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF"><b>FILL YOUR BANK SLOTS</b></FONT><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
None of these quests are worth doing for say... 1 or 2 items. So, the best way I've found is to just put everything in the bank until either<BR>
your locker is full, or you are ready to make the trips to see the specific NPC's. For example, you won't get much exp turning in say... 4<BR>
bone chips... but turn in 160 (full backpack) and DING! DING! (and possibly DING!) So horde yer loot and do these quests in bulk.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF"><b>SAVE YOUR BONECHIPS</b></FONT><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
Zone: Kaladim<BR>
NPC: Gunlok Jure<BR>
Location: Paladin guild<BR>
Turn-in: 4 chips (you can put a stack of 4 in all 4 slots)<BR>
Levels: 1 to 12<BR>
I can't stress this enough. Bone chips are light, stack-able, and accumulate nicely during the lower levels. I'd suggest even buying them<BR>
when you see them auctioned, but do not pay more then 2p. Even at higher levels, smack down every decayed skel that crosses your path and<BR>
put em in the bank, 'cause even though you may be too high for the quest to matter anymore, you may want to pass them onto a lower level, or use
them to boost your next character. NOTE: Most of the major towns have someone that collects bone chips, but I have found kaladim to be the
best exp. Pretty good loot too... you will get a lot of rusty 2-handers. Though only 2g each, you can sell em as you get em... real<BR>
quick.
</FONT></p>
<p><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">SAVE YOUR BATWINGS</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
Zone: Felwithe<BR>
NPC: Niola Impholder<BR>
Location: Cleric's Guild<BR>
Turn-in: 4 wings<BR>
Levels: 1 to 5<BR>
Not the best, but if your close, it's worth the trip. Around lvl 4, there are a bit of a shortage of things to hunt, so this quest is a nice
boost to get you through that, and possibly 5 if you have enough. The faction is ok, but the loot sucks.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">KIOLA NUTS</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
Zone: Kaladim &amp; OOT<BR>
NPC: Tumpy Irontoe<BR>
Location: Irontoe's Eats &amp; Sister Island<BR>
Turn-in: 1 nut &amp; 1 water<BR>
Levels: 1-18 (I still do it, but at 17, the trip got me just more then a bub exp)<BR>
This one's a little long, but if you have to take the boat from freeport to butcherblock anyway... it's WELL worth the effort. One of the<BR>
vendors (sorry, forget her name) on sister isle in Ocean of Tears sells Kiola nuts for a little more then 1gp each. I'd suggest going on the<BR>
boat with 8 backpacks (or the 10-slot job's if ya have em) Keep them empty except for 1 stack of 20 waters. If your quick you can fill up<BR>
your sacks and get back to the boat before it leaves again. Take the nuts to kaladim and go see Tumpy Irontoe. Give him 1 nut and 1 water<BR>
and he will give you back exp, faction and a Tumpy Tonic. Hang onto these because you can turn these in on the next quest for more exp &amp;<BR>
faction. You can buy more water just outside Kaladim from a high elf in a hut to the left of the entrance.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">TUMPY TONICS</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
Zone: Kaladim<BR>
NPC: Trantor Everhot<BR>
Location: Everhot Forge usually... but does wander<BR>
Turn-in: 2 Tumpy Tonics<BR>
Levels: 1-18<BR>
Take the tonics you got from the Kiola Nut quest and find Trantor Everhot. Give him 2 at a time for exp, more faction and he will also
give you some Dwarven Wire. The dwarven wire is specific for the trueshot longbow quest, so unless you plan on fletching to skill 150+,
just destroy it. The game-gods made it no drop, so you can't even sell it.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">CRUSHBONE ORC BELTS &amp; LEGIONAIRE SHOULDER PADS<BR>
</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0">Zone: Kaladim<BR>
NPC: Canloe Nusbeck<BR>
Location: Warrior Guild<BR>
Turn-in: 1 belt or 2 pads<BR>
Levels: 1-18 on belts... up to 20 on pads<BR>
Really good quests. You can turn in the belts 4 at a time if you like for real good exp, faction and ok loot. Only turn the pads in in 2's<BR>
however. Keep at least one main inventory slot open as sometimes you will get a rusty halberd. No big deal, only worth 2g, but 2g is 2g. <BR>
You get some bronze weaps for the shoulder pads as well... so real good exp and pretty good loot on them.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">AVIAK TALONS</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
Zone: Kaladim<BR>
NPC: Bumle Reminjar<BR>
Location: I think paladin guild, maybe warrior<BR>
Turn-in: 4 talons<BR>
Levels: 1-20<BR>
Real good exp on this one. At least comparable to Leg Pads, maybe more. Big drawback though is the only place to get these in any real<BR>
quantity is on aviak isle in oot. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">LIGHTSTONES, LESSER &amp; GREATER</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
Zone: North Karana<BR>
NPC: Gypsy (damn, the one that says something about research when hailed)<BR>
Location: Gypsy Camp (roughly middle of zone)<BR>
Turn-in: 1 Lightstone of greater or lesser variety<BR>
Levels: At 25 I turned in ONE lesser and still had noticeable exp gain<BR>
This quest is the absolute best. Real easy to do as well. Couple things to think about though... Turning in the lessers, will get you a
book on research. While turning it in is great exp, the book is only worth about 8 silver, so that means that exp cost you at least 8 gold. <BR>
I turn mine in, but just wanted to let you know what you'll be doing. Now, the Greaters on the other hand... two words... Holy
CRAP!!! You<BR>
get super exp AND a container called a concordance of research (or somethin like that). The container sells for at least 7 PLATINUM. Keep<BR>
in mind it is a container though, and you'll need at least one main inv slot open to do the quest or you'll drop it and make someone else's day<BR>
<BR>
<b><i>Ok, that's all I have for quests worth repeating. Now I'll go into<BR>
about what I do for each level.<BR>
</i></b>
<BR>
</FONT><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">LEVELS 1-5</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
I like fighting these levels. Fast spawn, no real trains. While fighting I'd hoard my bone chips and bat wings. Experience starts to
slow down a lot at lvl 5, so if you get impatient, or your locker gets full, unload it for exp. You could, however, smoke through them with
the "Kiola Nut" &amp; "Tumpy Tonic" quests without killing a thing.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">LEVELS 5-7</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
Start running some quests to unload the mass of bone chips and bat wings you've accumulated. You should have enough to rocket you well into lvl
7. I don't recall the last time I fought something at level 6. If you did your first few levels on Antonica... do the "Kiola Nut/Tumpy Tonic"
quests on your way to kaladim as well.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">LEVELS 7-10</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
Go to befallen. Fight on the first floor. Big-time bone chips here.&nbsp; Undead ac's here are low, so it's a great time to catch up your skills. <BR>
Stay off the main tracks as trains can be fierce at this level. Again, hoard all your bonechips. Level 8 will go slow &amp; 9 even slower as more<BR>
and more skel spawns will be green. But it's worth the time... the 400<BR>
bone chips you'll acquire here will rocket you. Kill everything that spawns, rats included as they will occupy potential bone chip spawns<BR>
later. You can sell loot at the inn in wc and buy food, water &amp; band-aids to chew up some of that coin weight as well. Stay there until<BR>
you hit 10, but then take off and head to kelethin to turn in those chips.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">LEVELS 10-12</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
Head to kaladim from befallen. On your way, do the "Kiola Nut/Tumpy Tonic" quests. Turn in that probably disgustingly huge pile of bone<BR>
chips. These should take you well into 12.
<BR>
</FONT></p>
<p><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">
LEVELS 12-14</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
You want to start thinking Wisps at this point. Wisps hit big, and most classes can't solo them until 14. Some can kill em at 13, others at<BR>
11. You should however have no problems with them at 14. However, If you can't do wisps just yet, I would suggest you do Crushbone. A full<BR>
bank of belts would get you a full level exp at least, maybe more. </FONT></p>
<p><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">LEVELS 14-16</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
WISPS, WISPS &amp; MORE WISPS. I really like WC wisp hunting the best, I hear Tox Forest is the scheisse. But anyway, kill wisps and save your
greater lightstones. Wisps are a pain in the butt to hunt when you don't get exp, so use up these levels just killing them. Obviously, if<BR>
you and your locker fill up with stones... make a run to do the quest.&nbsp; I'd save all my lightstones at first, replace lessers with greaters once<BR>
I ran out of room, and sell off the lessers. Or, you could ask someone to hold them for you, or maybe put them on another character as well.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">LEVELS 16-18</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
With a little luck, and a lot of lightstones 8 ) you won't even see lvl's 16 &amp; 17. I specifically recall going from 1 kill into 15 to
almost 17 with 3 bags of greaters and 4 bags of lessers. So, if you hunt wisps through 15 as well... you should get at least twice the
amount of lightstones thus taking you from 16 to 18 fairly easily.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#0000FF">LEVELS 18-20</FONT></b><FONT SIZE=2 color="#C0C0C0"><BR>
From this point, it's probably more efficient to group or at least partner up with others. That being the case... I'd make rivervale your
home for awhile. 3 real good places to hunt within 1 or 2 zones of each other. High Hold, East Karana &amp; Beholder.&nbsp;
<br>
<b>HIGH HOLD:</b> HH can be intimidating as many people seem to get frustrated&nbsp;
with each other, but it really is a good place level, and not half as bad as it once was. If you are not a nuker, and there's a "battle of
the mages" goin on, and your not getting any exp because of kill steals... Talk to the other non-nukers and convince them to leave with
you. Within one spawn, the ks's will either bail or die... in either case, they'll stop ks'n for at least as long as it takes them to recover
their corpse 8 ). Spawns are way to slow on the gnoll side, so I'd stick with the orcs.<BR>
<b>EAST KARANA:</b> Gorge Hounds and East Karana. Works well with a partner at this level. Around 21 you should be able to solo them.<BR>
<b>BEHOLDER: </b> Mino's &amp; Muddite Elders. As long as folks are hunting the evil eyes, this zone is fairly safe. But trains do happen.<BR>
