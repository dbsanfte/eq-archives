<h2>Welcome to Moostock</h2>

<p>
What is Moostock?<br>
<ul><li>Moostock is an event that everyone can participate in regardless of level. It involves all the
participants creating a level 1 dorf(dwarf)
with their own character name with the prefix 'moo'. Hence, my name, Glayde,
becomes Mooglayde. Bill would become Moobill, and so on. One the Moocharacters gather, they travel
from their home in Kaladim, to far places across the land of Norrath. 



</ul><p>
Who can attend Moostock?<br>
<ul><li>For the most part anyone can, the first Moostock wasn't as highly publicized because it was
primarily
an in-guild event. Future Moostocks will be open to the general public however. All you need to do is
create the appropriate Moocharacter and be on when the event starts.
</ul><p>
Where and when is the next Moostock?<br>
<ul><li>Moostock is based on the <b>Rodcet Nife</b> server. The next Moostock (Moostock III) will be run
on <b>Sunday, February 25, 2001 </b>at <b>3pm EST(noon PST)</b>. All characters should log in before that
time in order to be given a small
amount of platinum to buy beer, and some food and water. Please meet outside Kaladim once you have your
beer, food and water. Logging in as much as an hour early is recommended.
</ul><p>
Who should i contact for information about Moostock?<br>
<ul><li>Contact me, Glayde at tle@umich.edu if you have questions about
Moostock, or visit our guild message board, <a href="http://a-d.virtualave.net/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi">
http://a-d.virtualave.net/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi</a> and post in the public section.
</ul>
<p>
Are there any rules regarding Moostock?<br>
<ul>
<li>Only a couple, please arrive on time to start the event.<br>
<li>Do not overly spam, this includes public channels, and 
perhaps dueling. Though low level character duels might not 
even create zonewide messages, if this is the case feel free to duel
before the event, but do not duel during the event. It is usually tradition
upon entering the zone, for everyone to announce the arrival of Moostock to the zone
by /ooc'ing moo, or some form thereof. We will do that,
but be warned, the gms/guides usually get petitions from people who are
disrupted by our fun-having. Please listen to instructions that I may give
during the event to control spam. Please also ignore people following and harassing 
us as we run, /ignore is a wonderful thing.
<li>One thing everyone should do, is to create several hot-key social emotes, that
are some form of Moo. Use these liberally as we run through the zones.
<li>Most importantly, have fun and invite your friends!
</ul>
