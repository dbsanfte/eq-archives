<h2>Welcome to Moostock</h2>

<p>
On Tuesday, February 29, the first annual Moostock was held
on the Rodcet Nife server. Moostock was held as the first all-guild event 
by the guild, <a href="http://a-d.virtualave.net/">Altered Destiny</a>, which has recently been formed from
two 
guilds, Souls of Relevance, and the Brotherhood of Steel.
<br><p>
What is Moostock?<br>
Well, Moostock involved all the participants creating a level 1 dorf(dwarf)
with their own character name with the prefix 'moo'. Hence, my name, glayde,
was turned into Mooglayde. Also attending, were Mookrowbar, Moocorona, Mootuvas,
Moomeeks, and so on. For this event, we were able to gather approximately thirty
dorfs for the run, drunk and moo'ing the entire way.
<p>
We started outside Kaladim, each dorf armed only with an ample supply of beer.
From there we made a mad dash to the docks to await the boat to East Freeport.
A goblin spotted us, but the dorf guards were able to save us, and everyone
made it to the docks safely. At the docks we realized an important lesson.
Being super-drunk, and waiting on the docks was not a good combination.
Many a dorf stumbled into the water, and being super drunk, with no swimming
skill, makes it quite a chore to swim back to the shore!
<p>
Once the boat arrived, we all boarded, and partied all the way across the Ocean
of Tears. Arriving at East Freeport, we declared Moostock to the residents of
Freeport, who were quite stunned at the dorf invasion. We gathered around the
Priest of Discord, and mingled in his presence for a while, then headed to 
West Freeport, where we gathered at the west gate.
<p>
From there, we set out to the tunnel in the East Commonlands, where we stopped
for a bit to mingle with a gathering that had formed, which would follow us
to the end, moo-groupies if you would. Once here, we waited for a couple of stragglers
to catch up, we headed to the Northern Ro Desert. Our first stop was at the
fishing village, on the shores of the ocean. Here we took time out to sit around
the fire, and moo, and drink beer.
<p>
Once we had warmed ourselves at the fire, we set out for the Totem pole that sits
on the shoreline, further south along the coast, in the Northern Ro Desert. We
all gathered around here, and waited for more stragglers, and of course to drink
beer. It was here that an unfortunate GM decided to see what all the fuss was about.
While a couple of GM's had met us in ButcherBlock and taken pictures, this one
made the mistake of visiting after we had all been drinking the entire trip.
Schade, the GM, was immediately swarmed, as we played 'Dogpile on the GM!'
Needless to say, he will never be the same, since he will suffer nightmares of
moodorfs for nights to come.
<p>
After we had a few beers over the unconcious body of the GM, we set out again, 
this time heading for the Oasis of Marr, which held our ultimate destination.
Once in the oasis, we stopped to hang our feet off the dock, and drink some
more beer. Here we tested the stability of the dock, which was able to 
support thirty dorfs, all jumping up and down. Luckily it held up.
Satisfied on the docks stability, we headed for our final gathering before
our destination, at the south Pillar. 
<p>
Here we drank more beer, and gathered our courage, for our destination,
the tower in the middle of the lake, infested with deadly spectres.
When we finally broke into our lemming swim, we shouted at the demise
the spectres were going to face, under our blades. When we got there,
however, there was already some brave adventurers in a heated battle with
the spectres. When we arrived, it was a grim situation, but I believe the
reinforcements of thiry dorfs turned the tide of the battle, as we rescued
them from certain death. After the battle, we warned them to stay outside
the tower, while we went in and vanquished the spectres at the source.
Bravely we all entered the tower, one by one, and climbed up to the top.
Suddenly, it became clear, that we had spent all our energy saving the
weary adventurers we had warned to stay outside the tower. We were 
overwhelmed by what must have been hundreds of spectres! It was too much,
and while we fought valiantly, we all perished.
<p>
After our freak deaths to a spectre army in the Oasis, we were awakened
again, in Butcherblock Mountains, where we declared Moostock a success,
and prepared plans for the next Moostock!
