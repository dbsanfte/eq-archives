<br />
This is a full UI designed for a 1280x1024 window.  The 3D rendering area is a 4:3 aspect ratio unobscured by any of the UI panes, so the full world will be visible.  Currently it is 1000x750.  I am working on a version with an 1120x840 rendering area.<br />
<br />
The windows are dark green with gold borders.  Most buttons that duplicate the functionality of keystrokes or /commands have been removed to reduce clutter.  Title bars have been removed from most windows.  A thin 2 pixel border is used to further reduce visual clutter.  Buttons that do have to be pressed, such as Destroy in inventory, Yes/No in the confirmation box, and Track/Cancel in the track window have been made larger.<br />
<br />
There is no Invite/Follow or Disband button for groups.  I use Ctrl-i and Ctrl-d for those commands.  I will not be adding those buttons to this UI, although I will probably make them an option in my next version because so many people miss them.<br />
<br />
Target health bar, group health bars, and pet status are grouped in the player status window in the lower left corner.<br />
<br />
Stats, resists and xp bars are removed from the inventory window and given their own panel at the upper right corner.  Stats are labeled with icons for their buffs instead of with strings.<br />
<br />
The target window (not shown) has a very large health bar, large font target name and a hp percentage.<br />
<br />
Spell icons and the spell book artwork are from Thomus King.  The rest of the new artwork is my own.<br />
<br />
The home page for this UI is: Xymarra's UI Page (http://www25.brinkster.com/xymarra/Skins/Xym_UI.html) <br />

If you shrink it 75% from the full, instead of 50% like it looks you've done, you can still see enough details while keeping the size down. I can't wait to try it ^.^</div></div><hr />

It seems to have exceeded its bandwidth for the day.  The upload function appears to be broken here.  I can put the UI up in three separate attachments, using three posts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The upload system is working fine here..<br />
<br />
go to &quot;complete sets&quot; at the top you will see a &quot;upload file&quot; icon<br />
<br />
the only thing is, if your file is larger than 2megs it will kick it back <br />
<br />
this is a hard code limit of software we use.. we can not raise this..<br />
<br />
my suggestion is do what you did here.. remove Tkings Icons and just include a link in the discription TO his icons... <br />
<br />
also any Trade Skill, Loc Help, or map mods, should be linked... these tend to bring the file size up over 2 megs quickly.<br />
<br />
and as a last resort... break it into two parts and include &quot;-part 1&quot; and &quot;-part 2&quot; and upload it in two files.. We have had a few people do this.. and its worked fairly well..<br />
<br />
hope to see it soon.. VERY VERY nice mod..<br />

<br />
This is beautiful. Great work, and that is a definite understatement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info, Kudane.<br />
<br />
If the upload kicks you back for a file too large, it would be nice if it gave some indication that this was the problem instead of presenting a blank screen.<br />
<br />
I wanted to include the icons because I modified them.  The stock set of TKing's icons won't really work nicely for the stat window, because all the physical stats look the same.  I'll just include tiny icons for use in the stats window instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">casperinmd</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incredible work. I have been waiting on a mod to use viewport. I will be using it tonite.<br />
<br />
Don't know if you are taking requests...but, the only thing I would even dare change if I could would be to swap the compass with the target window. For me, I always keep the target window in the dead center of the screen above my chat and stuff...<br />
<br />
Great work Xymarra. <br />
<br />
As for the icons, can you just zip and upload the icons you changed from tkings? or did you change them all?</div></div><hr />

sounds like a good plan,<br />
<br />
You see there was a kick back message, we just found out in the last 2 days that it was not giving a message, we uploaded some of the back-end server files, and the download portal was written with some custom items for the version we upgraded from.. <br />
<br />
SOOOOOO a few things we have to tweak.. =)<br />
<br />
thanks for the info..<br />
<br />
Added a download link to your first post, its all approved<br />

<br />
Was wondering if one is just able to use your spell-bar?  If so, how please? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for the icons, can you just zip and upload the icons you changed from tkings? or did you change them all? <br />
<br />
Yes, actually that's what I did.  I only changed three icons and they are in the first page.  You will have to download the rest of TKing's icon set if you want them to match.<br />
<br />
Was wondering if one is just able to use your spell-bar? If so, how please? <br />
<br />
Yes, you can use it without the rest of the mod.  You just need the EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml file and GoldCurves.tga.  If you want the gems to look right, you'll need to copy the definitions for the spell gem art into your EQUI_Animations.xml file.  They have to be defined in the global file because they are also used in the hot box and for cursor attachments.  These are the relevant items:<br />
<br />
	&lt;TextureInfo item = &quot;GoldCurves.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;256&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;256&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
	&lt;/TextureInfo&gt;<br />
<br />
and the Ui2DAnimation entries for:<br />
<br />
A_SpellGemHolder<br />
A_SpellGemHighlight<br />
A_SpellGemBackground</div></div><hr />

I checked all over the screen but didn't try any of the ALT + x hot keys. Are the hidden from use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Littie</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All i can say is wow love it  i realy like the spell bar</div></div><hr />

Any plans to implement this in the future? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lasagna</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the mod! But, I dont like the mouse (prefer the plain gray one). What files would i remove to change this? Also, if I import a different inventory or other window will the background textures and borders be like the rest of your windows or will they be put in as-is? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there are no FOLLOW/INVITE buttons for grouping<br />
<br />
Correct.  You can activate those commands with key strokes, so I didn't want them cluttering the screen.  There are also no buttons for pet commands or for sit/stand or camp.  Any button that can be activated with a key press or a /command has been removed.<br />
<br />
Just grouped with a necro friend...and I noticed there is no support for seeing other group members pets. Any plans to implement this in the future?<br />
<br />
Hm, it should be in there as a green line at the bottom of their health bar.  That's one of the harder features to test myself, since I have to find someone with a pet and group with them.<br />
<br />
I'll try to see what happened to that.<br />
<br />
But, I dont like the mouse (prefer the plain gray one). What files would i remove to change this?<br />
<br />
You would need to edit the EQUI_Animations.xml file and replace my definition of A_DefaultCursor with the one from the default UI directory.  I didn't color it gold in my window_pieces01.tga, so it should be the familiar one.<br />
<br />
There are two other cursors in the tga file along with the curvy one.  One is a leaf and the other is a fern frond.  If you change the size and location tags for the cursor, you can try those out instead.<br />
<br />
Leaf is 23x22 at 0,188.  Fern is 23x23 at 0,233.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Layper</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm very new to using a mod, in fact this is the first one I&quot;ve downloaded.  I'm very impressed :)<br />
<br />
Question:  I have PoP and use the Raid Window Feature quite often and noticed that one didn't come with the download.  I may of course not be doing something right so if you could steer me in the right direction I would be extremely grateful. :)<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any file that does not appear in your custom skin will use the default.  I left out the Options window because Verant keeps adding new options.  I left out the Raid window because it is too new and I suspect it will see some changes in the near future.  Both windows should appear normally with this UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oops, when I redid the zip files, I grabbed an old version of the EQUI.xml file that was missing the lines for the raid window.  I just uploaded a version 2.11 that fixes that bug.  If you are having trouble seeing the raid window, either download that version or add these lines to your EQUI.xml file:<br />
<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_RaidWindow.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_RaidOptionsWindow.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
Also, many people have asked me where the Invite and Disband buttons are.  The answer is, they aren't anywhere.  I use the key bindings to access those commands.  I tried to put them on another page in the main window, but the UI won't do that properly.  By popular demand, I'll probably include them in the next version, but this one isn't getting them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">casperinmd</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well for invite/disband..I just didnt' know the &quot;follow&quot; command, it is invite. Or just use CTRL + I to invite or follow an invite. I am happy without now :)<br />
<br />
Any word on pet hp testing? What server are you on..I can create a character to help you tes if you'd like. Fennin Ro for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pet health bars are there.  They are not very visible, since they cut across the bottoms of the bubbles in the bar, but they can be seen as a thin line of green dashes.  I will make them wider in the next version.<br />
<br />
The same key command for Invite also works for Follow.  I believe it is Ctrl-i by default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrrialle</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the screenshots I've seen of your UI and am most anxious to start using it, however I cannot find the UI_Basic_00.ini file in the zip you have supplied. <br />
Also attempting to load this using the /loadskin results in the old UI being loaded.<br />
So, I'm missing something somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh ... I guess that got left out when I redid the zip to meet the file size limit here.  I will see if there is a way to update my UI zip file without creating a whole new version.  In the meantime, here it is as an attachment.  It has to be changed to a .txt file for me to attach it here, but don't worry, that won't mess it up.  Just rename it your character name and server number, change the .txt to .ini, and put it in your EverQuest directory.<br />
<br />
For /loadskin to work properly, you have to give it the name of the mod.  If you have unzipped the UI to a directory called &quot;xym&quot; in your uifiles directory (for example &quot;C:\Program Files\EverQuest\uifiles\xym&quot;) then you can load it with &quot;/loadskin xym&quot;, which will place all the windows in default ugly positions.  If you use &quot;/loadskin xym 1&quot; instead, it will load the UI without changing your window positions.</div></div><hr />
