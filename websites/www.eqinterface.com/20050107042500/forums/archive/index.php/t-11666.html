The tags make sense, I'm sure I could figure out the location tags and such....it's the pieces. Please tell me if this is correct. A piece must correspond with an object (dunno if I've got the right word here, like the target box, or inventory), which must first be drawn out in photoshop or the like? I think I have at least the first part right, that it has to correspond. But, no matter what I try to open the pieces with, I see nothing but symbols. If someone wouldn't mind pointing me in a direction for help on this, I'd very much appreciate it. <br />
I've downloaded XMLSPY and am going through the tutorial with ****'s UI as my tutorial mix and match. Just trying to tweak it here and there. However, a horizontal bar...is that a piece? Hmmm, help?<br />
