<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abattoir</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Made a few changes, get my UI here:<br />
<br />
http://mywebpages.comcast.net/lmilhanjr/EQUI/abattoirv1.zip<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of my UI:<br />
<br />
http://mywebpages.comcast.net/lmilhanjr/EQUI/myui_ss2.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
A few notes:<br />
<br />
Please read the 'readme' file and follow the instructions (VERY IMPORTANT).<br />
<br />
Things I changed:<br />
<br />
1) Added a custom colored compass (to match the color scheme of my UI). Compass located below the main chat window.<br />
<br />
2) New buffbuox, removed the buff labels (c'mon, you shouldn't need them anymore!). Buff box is located below the main chat window. Yes, all 15 buffs fit nicely.<br />
<br />
3) Added a 60 minute count up timer (located below the main chat window).<br />
<br />
4) Added a min-portrait of my character to the hotkey window (there was dead space I wanted to fill). Feel free to substitute your own pic.<br />
<br />
5) Added a custom graphic background to the target window. This ties the entire UI together nicely.<br />
<br />
6) Custom gems, icons spellbook, etc by tking.<br />
<br />
7) A bunch more stuff I am sure I forgot to mention here...<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

I very much appreciated the readme file... but after doing all that you said I ended up having to just /loadskin abattoirv1 in-game.  Either way, it works and looks great!<br />
<br />
One question though, please.  May I ask how I would go about adding a pic of my own to the inventory?  If you, or anyone, have a spare moment I would really appreciate a semi-tutorial on how to go about taking a screenshot and turning it into a cool graphic and adding it :)<br />

Is there a way i can keep everything from the current UI im useing and just add your inventory screen to it? the area with the pic and my items and stuff =P ive tried tons of different combos of the files in the zip file you give but it keeps haveing errors<br />
<br />
another thing, when i do install it 100%, i do not get a pic in the inventory screen area.  i converted the pic to a bmp added my bmp pic then converted it back to tga and its saved under the same name, yet the pic never shows up =P not sure what im doing wrong harhar, any help would be great!<br />
<br />
just a bit more info on my problem.  If i install it right out of your zip i get the background for your inventory, nice and grey.  Ifn i convert it to bmp, cut and paste my bmp image in, and then convert the finished piece back to tga, i get a clear inventory screen with no grey background or no pic =P<br />

Open the Readme file and be amazed.. tells you how to change the backgroud pic for the inventory<br />
<br />
<br />
Yah, you basically modify the 'wnd_bg_inventory.tga' file in the new UI folder. Note that the new background pic must be the exact same size and a 24 bit TARGA file, not 16 or any other bit, otherwise the image won't display. <br />
<br />
I've tweaked the player info box a bit, added a seperate pet health bar in and evened out the new spacing. Screen shot at bottom of post. <br />
<br />
Yes, I'm using T.King's awesome spellbook mod.<br />
<br />
<br />
obtw I tried the UI in different video modes mostly 1280x1024 and above.. and everytime the chat windows end up stacked.. they are not locked and can be resized, but unable to move the windows.. any ideas?<br />
<br />
<br />
The windows probably need a *small* move bar at top - I've been moving them by resizing them across the screen.<br />

Great skin again. But I have tried everything it says continuously.  I open photoshop, open the inventory file, use my photo, (also saved as .TGA and 24size) drag it on top of the background and save and implement the .TGA and 24size, but then when I go to close Photoshop it prompts me to save changes to it again, and only gives me the option to save it in Photoshop format, thus negating the saving I did earlier even if I press no &lt;shrug&gt;<br />
<br />
Any way I can send both files to someone and have them send one back with my pic on it?  E-mail me or post if you have successfully done this please.  susieq7669@yahoo.com<br />

:(  Exactly what I did. Step for step.  But once I click no, I open it again to check and I've used /loadskin in-game, and in both instances it is regular without my graphic :confused: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lmilhan</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all.<br />
<br />
Regarding the target window graphic not fitting your screen:<br />
I suspect that your are running in a resolution below 1152 x 864. If that is the case, then no, the target window graphic will not fit your screen properly. Set your resolution (in game) to 1152 x 864 and you will be good to go.<br />
<br />
I do not currently have plans to make this work in a resolution smaller than 1152 x 864, sorry :(<br />
<br />
Regarding the hotkeys window, I only included 4 inventory slots and the primary slot, becuase I found that this set up best suited my needs. This is still a work in progress, and I may add the full inventory, and secondary slot back to the hotkeys window. I may even throw the range and ammo slot in for good measure.<br />
<br />
Regarding the chat window: the only way to move the chat windows is by using creative re-sizing. Otherwise, if you add the title bars back to the chat windows, you will be able to drag them around by the title bar.<br />
<br />
Regarding the inventory window: I don't think I have the energy at this time to make it smaller, sorry. I made it the size it is because it looks nice in 1152 resolution. I would venture a guess that it starts to look HUGE in resolutions smaller than 1152. You are more than welcome to modify my existing inventory in any way ya want though. Post a screen shot here so I can see what ya did ;)<br />
<br />
Regarding windows not showing up in the proper places: you have to use the file named UI_Abattoir_20.ini file. Rename it to UI_yourcharactername_yourservernumber. Then copy and paste this file into your EverQuest directory. This file contains the proper locations for where all of the windows will appear. More details on how to do this are contained in the readme.txt file.<br />
<br />
That should answer a few questions for now. Basically if you follow the instructions in the readme.txt file word for word, you shouldn't have any problems.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.<br />
<br />
P.S. I would love to see screen shots of the pictures that people are pasting into their inventory!<br />
<br />

I have a seperate folder for casters and non-casters.  Normally I use it with my rogue, but occasionally have to load a caster on that computer.  Thats when I noticed something missing.  Maybe I'm just missing it though, but there seams to be no spellbook button on the bottom of the spell gem window.  Is it just me or is it really missing.  I kinda learned to enjoy that little button.  Any chance you can put that on the spell gem window and include that one window in a link on a following thread or post code as to how it might be added?<br />

How does one go about changing the mouse cursor in this skin?  I love it to death, I play a rogue and a chanter and want to have the chanter epic cursor when i play my chanter.   <br />
<br />
I have the pic and tried copying over mouse.tga, windows_pieces01.tga and the mouse.tga-ragebringer....but it seems to merge the rage and chanter epic, kinda makes a dark rage with blood on it (red from the epic).  Is there somekind of mask that makes only the ragebringer outline show up?<br />

Any help would be great, thanks!<br />

It just happens to come up like that, rather odd. Well for the mean time I have just set the normal transparency to 0 so that the bar appears to not be there and the target just floats above my hit boxes.

<br />
 Very nice I love it.<br />
<br />
 As said above the graphic for the target window is not exact because my GeForce 4 card will not allow me that exact resolution setting. Is there a way to manually change the setting for that window to work with 1280x1024 resolution?<br />
<br />
 If not its not a big deal is only off by an small amount on each side.<br />
<br />
<br />
 The only thing I cannot move is my buff window. Its stuck in the top right of my screen and I cannot move it. I did use the ui_charactername_server number file trick but because the resolution is not exact it will not put it in the correct spot</div></div><hr />

 The only thing I cannot move is my buff window. Its stuck in the top right of my screen and I cannot move it. <br />
<br />
The only thing I can suggest for that is to make it huge....drag left side all the way over, the bottom all the way down (yes this will cover most your screen...for now)...then when you have the left and bottom edges lined up where they are on the picture, then move the top and right back down to fit.  So you can't drag the window, you just make it fit the area you want (if you can understand that)....<br />

OMFG I didn't think I would like it as much as I do.  It really is awesome.  Kudos Abattoir.  The only think I would like to see implemented in a possible upgrade would be the ability to either, 1: Put in a reset button on the timer<br />
or<br />
2: Some how set up the timer to be more fully functional (I.E. not only a reset button, but a way of actually making it a count DOWN timer as well with the ability to set the time to whatever you want for such things as counting down a spawn timer etc.)<br />
