<br />
I've been trying to get my curser to display attached items in a spot other than the dead center of the pointer.  When using one of the pointers i made, i've noticed the items disappear behind the curser because its wider than the item that attach.<br />
<br />
After doing multiple changes and comparing the results, i've come to the conclusion that there is some sort of boxed area the item shows in..If you stray to far to the left, it cuts your left side off (right, top bottom).  I've tried changing everything to try to get this box to get bigger so that i can move the attachment area on a pointer.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any experience doing this that could maybe assist?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I got this one figured out.<br />

This is the actual area of the cursor attachment.  You adjust how much area the cursor attachment has in the sizes listed below:<br />
<br />
&lt;Screen item = &quot;CursorAttachment&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID/&gt;<br />
		&lt;Font/&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;false&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;15&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;100&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;38&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
You then adjust the location of individual pieces items to where you want them in relation to the CursorAttachment size.   After I got it figured out, i could see its really no different that a regular window.  I just wasn't thinking of it in those terms, which had me puzzled.</div></div><hr />
