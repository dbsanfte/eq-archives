On my cleric, I have the ugly default skin going and he works fine; he can zone and camp and do whatever, no crashing.  On my bard, I switch between Sars and Bay's (this was from bay's) and both crash when zoning, logging out or /loadskinning.  When I log back in after /loadskin, the new one will be up, and work fine for hours and hours, but as soon as I zone WHAM desktop.<br />
<br />
So, first question: does anyone know where I can find baylerithe's new skin (assuming there is a new one).  Second, what are those first two error messages?  Not understanding that &quot;child&quot; thing.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just tried sars latest skin and I still crashed when I zoned.  UIErrors didn't change, it still has my old Bay version there.</div></div><hr />
