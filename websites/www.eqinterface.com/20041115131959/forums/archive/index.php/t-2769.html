It was very handy in finding a precise direction if one used the eqhead.xls table created by Maas. <br />
<br />
I  tried to locate this file since VI has implemented the compass heading once again. It seems EQvault has a broken link and has failed to fix it.  So,  down loading the file from the site is impossible. <br />
<br />
I have notified them of the problem and asked for the link to be fixed or to send me the file. They have been unresponsive and decided to generate the file from scratch. <br />
<br />
Include with the zip file is a text file (almost complete in formatting) that could be used in a UI window.  It would be nice is some savy XML expert out there would implement the table for in game use.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you find any bugs.<br />
