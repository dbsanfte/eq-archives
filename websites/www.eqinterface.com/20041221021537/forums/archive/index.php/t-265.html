<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melosa</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you completely on this. And due to the size of the monitor I use (it sucks being broke), 800 X 600 is about the highest I can use and still be able to see. Therefore, space is at a premium. I did a temporary &quot;fix&quot; on mine, by moving it over just a bit more to the right (it's in my bottom right hand corner) to eliminate that extra bit. However, this isn't much of a fix in my opinion. I love what Geddine has done and don't really want to give it up though.</div></div><hr />

I decreased the font to 1 redid all the code, dropped the decal tags and have the buff window a whopping 170x205 umm...so I'll give credit to Geddi for the awesome bmp files I stole that I had to resize as well. I use 1024x768 and that buff box is about 1.25 in by 1.75 in or so on the screen and it fits all the buffs in it.<br />
<br />
All joking aside, need to take a look at some of the size and locs on the code and fix them. You might have some problems when you zone with your window.<br />
<br />
Geddine put alot of effort into this window. Asking for it to be smaller is....basically redoing the window. If you don't mind not having the Spell Icon on the buff tab I'll send you the modified version that I have done, making sure to credit Geddi for his bmp's ;)<br />

<br />
And I've had no problems with it when zoning.  The changes in the code may not be perfect, but they work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cinius Shade</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Change the loc of &lt;Button item = &quot;BW_Buff1_Button&quot;&gt; to:<br />
<br />
&lt;X&gt;48&lt;/X&gt;<br />
&lt;Y&gt;3&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
<br />
Also make sure the size on &lt;Label item =&quot;BW_Buff0&quot;&gt; are the same for 0 thru 14.<br />
<br />
And another item(not an issue but to be thorough) Change<br />
<br />
&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Rounded&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
To<br />
<br />
&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_RoundedNoTitle&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The bug you're having while zoning is a result of Buttons 0 and 1 being coded with the same Loc.<br />
