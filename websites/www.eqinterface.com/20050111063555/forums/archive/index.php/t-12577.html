<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">conjureous</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay I downloaded the Lodi Dodi ui yesterday 2/10 and when I went into the game it gave me an error message and said I should load the default skin again, so I did. <br />
I came here this morning to find out why this was happening, changed the eqclient.ini file so it said &quot;NewUI=True, UISkin=Default&quot; instead of just &quot;UISkin=Default&quot;. Then I went into the &quot;UI_CharacterName_ServerNumber.ini&quot; and added &quot;UISkin=CustomFolderName&quot; since it wasn't in there. I assumed I wasn't supposed to replace the &quot; UISkin=ui2&quot; file that was already there.<br />
<br />
I installed the ui as I always do with ui's. I made a new folder in the &quot;uifiles' folder and extracted the ui into the new folder. I give the folders names like ui1 and ui2, etc.<br />
<br />
After I changed the necessary stuff in the files like the help forum said to do, I tried going into eq this morning (not for long as it is going down for another 3 hours!) and I still had the same error message. I can post it if you want, but it's huge and has something to do with my xml files not being compatable with current eq files, so I am at a loss.<br />
<br />
I'll leave it at this for now and see what I should do next. I'll be hanging out here for the next 3 hours since eq is down, hoping for a reply. Thanks in advance for the help :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and here's the link to the mod I am trying to use...this is the link to the updated version of what I got yesterday which was the lodidodi202.zip  I haven't been able to try the updated lodidodi203.zip since eq is down, but I'm not sure if it will fix that xml file or not.<br />

All those warnings are a good thing, they are telling you that the Ui is doing what it is desigend....taking parts out of the default when they are not found in the custom folder.<br />
<br />
Here are the only actual errors in the file:<br />
[Wed Feb 11 04:55:23 2004] Error: Could not find child ChangeButton in window BigBankWnd<br />
<br />
[Wed Feb 11 04:55:24 2004] Error: Could not find child SELW_CombatSkillsToggleButton in window SelectorWindow<br />
<br />
As to your problem...I read your thread, but did not make an attempt to solve it because the solution may be found by using the 203 update and you had not had the opportunity to try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">conjureous</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's all I needed to know hun. Hopefully it will be okay when I go in next time with the updated version. I appreciate it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lodidodi</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for trying out my UI.<br />
<br />
If you are using version 2.0.2, that was made before the 2/10/04 patch so it doesn't have the new pieces they added like the &quot;Change&quot; button in the Bank Window and the &quot;Combat Skills&quot; button in the Action Window.<br />
<br />
In my testing, the 2.0.2 version would run fine after the patch, but it does give that error message (&quot;Your XML files are not compatible with current EverQuest files, certain windows may not perform correctly.&quot;) since it can't find the new pieces that were just added in the patch. Like I said, the UI appears run fine, but obviously you won't have access to the new buttons they added.<br />
<br />
Once you load the 2.0.3 version you won't get that error message any more and you'll have access to the new fuctionality (buttons, etc.) they added in the patch.<br />
