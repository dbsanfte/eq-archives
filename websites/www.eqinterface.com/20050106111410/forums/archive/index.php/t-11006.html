<br />
1) Only usable for the Target Window.<br />
<br />
Many custom mods will lose out on the new feature<br />
<br />
2) You cant resize the Target Window.<br />
<br />
Even if you go to the trouble of making a custom TargetBox.tga file the graphic is fixed in size and will not go around any window other then the default size.<br />
<br />
This second one is very bad for any custom UI builder who wants a bigger Target Window to allow of the long target names.</div></div><hr />

I was on the test server the other day and fixed it all up to work with my UI.  I logged onto test yesterday and it was still working propertly, but then about an hour later I logged onto test a second time and it wasn't working anymore.  The same thing is happening today on the live servers.  I can get the target ring around the MOB to work, but the target window indicator isn't there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sisca</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can adjust where the color appears by editing the TargetBox.tga file and creating a custom alpha mask that works for your target window.<br />
<br />
Just know that when the game draws the color portion it uses the file specified in the:<br />
	&lt;TextureInfo item = &quot;TargetBox.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;128&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;32&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
	&lt;/TextureInfo&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
I was able to edit TargetBox.tga and make it big enough to cover my target window then create an alpha mask to only show the color around the target health gauge. Then I just adjusted the size info in the TextureInfo section to match my new graphic.<br />
<br />
I do agree that it would be nice if this could be used in other windows though. I know a lot of the UI's out there have moved the target info to different windows and this will force them to either re-write or just not have the new functions.</div></div><hr />
