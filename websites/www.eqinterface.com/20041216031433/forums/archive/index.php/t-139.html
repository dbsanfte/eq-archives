<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SisterLi</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a shaman and tend to cast using my mouse to left click on the spell icon.  My dream skin would allow me to use the highest resolution, but would make the spell casting icons bigger, and a bit further apart.  Roughly 2 to 3 times the current size.  The current size is damn near useless as you cannot make out detail and basically just have to memorize what you have memmed, and in what order.<br />
<br />
Ideally it would also make the spell book bigger -- allowing you an option that has the book cover all of the screen but the chat boxes.<br />
<br />
And, finally, it would do all of this without changing the size of the Buff Icons.<br />
<br />
Buff icons can be small because they are not meant to be interacted with -- they are just off somewhere to the side and used only for information.  But spell cast icons need to be much bigger.<br />
<br />
Anyone know a way to fix this without a skin?  Anyone interested in designing a skin that does this?<br />

What resolution do you play at? Can you send me a screenshot, I'd like to see what kind of work... I mean, &quot;play&quot;space I have to work with. :)<br />

<br />
I'm in 1600 X 1200<br />
<br />
I've also noticed that the inventory screen is too small.  Should be twice as big to be really useable.<br />
<br />
The group screen is not quite user friendly -- hps just don't stand out the way they should.  But this may be more contrast than size, although size might help.  <br />
<br />
It is really nice to have 3 chat screens runnign though, so that's why I'm on 1600 X 1200.<br />
<br />
I've used Viewport so the picture does not overrun my chat windows.<br />
<br />
Will post a screen shot later tonight.  Thank you so much for being willing to take a look at this.<br />

Beware, it WONT be pretty, stretching the icons pixxelates them.<br />
<br />
--EDIT<br />
I cant do it.  No matter what I do the spell gems get drawn as 24x24.  The size is apparently hard coded.  I even tried using the normal spell icons but they get shrunk down from 40x40!</div></div><hr />

I'm not wed to keeping the hot keys there-  although I prefer not to have to move them down into the chat area.  <br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for looking into it.  I am hoping the spell icons are not hardwired at such a small size.  <br />
<br />
A larger spell book with larger icons would also be helpful.  I often sit down to swap spells mid battle, and having to squint to figure out what they are slows me down.  <br />
<br />
In the old interface I play at 800 X 600 on a huge oversize screen. =P  <br />

Turns out me new notebook computer needs to be run at this high of a resolution for best graphics performance.<br />

It will bump up the size of the spell gem icons to about 200% of thier original size..pretty easy to reverse the process and tailor to your tastes.:nana:</div></div><hr />
