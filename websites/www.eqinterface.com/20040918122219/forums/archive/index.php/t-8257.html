The basic philosophy is still to keep a small footprint interface at the bottom of the screen but I'm always looking for better ways to do things so please let me know if I've missed a good idea or if something just isn't quite right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dioran</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently using lowrider, and I like it quite a bit.  I did do a bit of re-arranging to fit it to my preferences, but I love the fact that it's so small and clean.  The only real issues I have with it are the target window (that big chunk of red right in the middle of everything is a bit much for me personally) and it would be nice to see armor slots in the hotbutton window (tabs, maybe?).  <br />
<br />
Before I started using this UI I was using Caleal 1.4  ...nothing wrong with that UI either, I just wanted to try something new out.  Caleal1.4 (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1476)<br />
<br />
The other thing I miss from Caleal's UI is the weapon and ammo slots in the container windows.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp...perhaps I would be best off to mix and match the elements I like from Caleal1.4 into this UI...doesn't seem to work very well for me tho when I do that.  Any pointers for me on how to use the container window from Caleal in your UI?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">husky</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Changing the container windows is actually quite easy.  The file name is:  EQUI_Container.xml<br />
<br />
You may also want to consider moving EQUI_Inventory.xml and EQUI_MerchantWnd.xml just to move all of those windows with a similar purpose and feel.<br />
<br />
Just move the preferred versions of those files to the directory of the interface you are using.  There are no other &quot;hooks&quot; unless Caeal has added something.  If he has and that doesn't work, it will typically be an issue with EQUI_Animations.xml or EQUI_Templates.xml.  Try moving both of those as well (but only do that if you have to - this can cause problems with patches if the files were not altered correctly).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback and good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been using this UI for about 6 weeks now. and its great.<br />
<br />
Its clean, easy to read, and all the info I need is right there.<br />
<br />
Only one thing needed. When group mates are in a diff zone I connot see any names on there bar in the group window. Is this easy to tweak?<br />
