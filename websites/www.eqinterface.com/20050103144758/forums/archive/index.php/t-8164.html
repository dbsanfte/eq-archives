<br />
I've tried a couple of UIs in the past, but I've never really been able to get one working 100% properly. I just visited the site again, however, and saw SOE's UI, and I simply have to have it. :) I've been using the Default because I didn't like the others I tried enough to bother keeping up with the UI changes when they patched the servers.<br />
<br />
Now here's the question:<br />
<br />
The UI was posted awhile ago.... here is the link:<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4770<br />
<br />
Do I need to go through every single change made to the UI since the date that this mod was written and modify it all?<br />
<br />
If not, please let me know what needs to be done. I'm really anxious to see this one up and running, and would like to *keep* it up and running.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
