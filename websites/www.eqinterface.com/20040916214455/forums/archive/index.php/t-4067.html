<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alyys SKupre</div><div class="date">11-17-2002, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First spell book I put up, suggestions were made to make it look more like a book and less like a plaque with a line down the middle.  I hope this image has succeeded.  I'm using the image sizes from the default directory, so as not to make too many changes all at once.  Please let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is looking better all the time.  I think you have done a great job making the pages appear to be a little rounded near the binding.  Makes it look much more like a book.  Keep up the great work and I look forward to the completed version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alyys SKupre</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the information!  It looks good, but I can't put my finger on what doesn't look right, other than it doesn't have the pointers or the spell squares.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that you've rounded out the pages a bit, try smoothing that sharp line in the middle. Think about a real book for a second- there's no thick line between the pages, the left page just curves down into the binding and the right one curves up and out right next to it. The division is part of the natural gradation of shadows as the pages curve down to meet each other. If you make the line itself very thin and light, like one pixel, in just a darker version of the color of the pages themselves, then just make it so the shadow on each page reaches down to touch the line...<br />
<br />
also if you're trying to make it look real, have an idea of where the light on the pages is coming from. The book itself may be exactly symmetrical, but imagine a light source, say above the right edge- the left side of the left page might be a little darker, then the right side would be brighter because the light would be shining directly at it, the left side of the right page would be quite dark because of the curve of the pages, then the right side would be brightest of all.<br />
<br />
It's beautiful btw, infinitely better than anything I could ever do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, aeluin just reminded me of something as well.  Remember this spell book has some 50+ pages in it.  Might want to look at make the binding of the book look like a binding.<br />
<br />
Like aeluin though you are far superior to anything I could even try let alone create.  And as I said earlier I think you have done a great job so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I guess I should clarify that a little.  What I was getting at was the fact that this is a good size book for the day and age of this world.  The pages would have a good bit of bend in them to the point that if it a three dimentional object the page bulge at this bend would more than likely make it so that you could not see the outside binding of the book.  <br />
<br />
I am not sure I am explaining this very well but I think if you take a look at some of the other interesting book like spell books on this site you might find that some them are showing what I am trying to say and not doing very well at saying I might add.<br />
<br />
Please though,  even if you stop now I would love to have this book.  I love the purple color and the way that you have made the corners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alyys SKupre</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get what you are trying to say.  It needs the little dimple that the binding would create when opened.  I can probably play around with some bevelled edges to create that effect, as it's not exactly a pamphlet now, is it?:) <br />
<br />
As far as using it for yourself, let me finish the graphic first, and then I get to play with figuring out XML.  (I do nice graphics, but I know nothing about XML)  I've got ideas for a whole set like this (well, inventory, casting bar, couple other things) but I'm working on spell books first.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the input, will post next phase when it's done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like we are opposites.  I am lousy with the graphics side of things but I am a programmer and that is what I stick to.  <br />
<br />
I look forward to the final products...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and if you need any help with the coding just let me know.  I am always happy to lend a hand to those looking to learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alyys SKupre</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, with the suggestions that were made, and the pointers for page turning put in, here is the next phase of the graphic.  I still have the original saved as a PSD file, with the basic bottom layers merged since they were, I felt, complete.<br />
<br />
Suggestions appreciated!:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's beautiful, but for some reason it still looks...flat :( and the shading is nicely done, but for some reason it gives the impression of just a stripe down the middle- maybe it could taper off more gradually?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alyys SKupre</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I think I fixed the flatness this time (the shadowed area needed to be expanded before I applied the blur.)<br />
<br />
Let's see how this one looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that's lovely :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobeken</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did a little bit of quicky editing that may help ytah abit, if you like it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alyys SKupre</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember mac curl!  I think I may have that somewhere!  I'd probably go a little more diagonally across the page, but it's not a bad addition.  Personal feeling is it's just one touch too many, but then I'm funny about my work.  Still, it looks kinda cool too.<br />
<br />
Ok, now to fool around with the XML....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Alyys,  Here is a rendition of your book that I have tried to show the one last thing that I think the book might use.  Now I am not much of an artist so don't laugh too hard at this but here it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alyys SKupre</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I am still trying to figure out how to get that, I think I've got an idea of how to make that look smoother.  I'll give it a try and post it here.<br />
<br />
Later:  I think I've got it this time, take a look!</div></div><hr />
