<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skizard2</div><div class="date">05-08-2004, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wonder if we might finally get new character graphics / animations on this one? I know it would be nice ot have it just plain work first, but I still would like to see more than just plate/chain/leather human/elf/ogre/etc.. where the only difference is the color of your armor. <br />
<br />
Level 70... So many of the gods will be even cons... Interesting.<br />
<br />
Maybe the will let us make say 15% profit on trade skills. Come on Sony 15% is a profit margin most companies would fire CEOs for. Why not make trade skills worth our time (might even create a whole new merchant class out there.. and the game is all about the interaction with others, not just killing mobs...right?)<br />
<br />
EPIC 2.0 WOOT.. You know the Bards, Shaman, Druids will be running around doing those. Esp the bards that are ties to their epics until they can raid Time.</div></div><hr />
