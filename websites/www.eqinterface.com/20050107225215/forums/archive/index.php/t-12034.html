I joined eqgui.com today and have searched unsuccessfully for a similar GUI to download.  I'm not real savvy with the whole concept of changing GUIs, I've done it once before.  Does anyone know of a necro type GUI, packaged together, that I could download and use?<br />
<br />
Sorry if it's already out there, but I did spend some time searching before posting this question. :)</div></div><hr />
