<br />
So here is the starting image let me know what you think, and where you think I should place all of the goodies.<br />
<br />
http://whiteorb.net/UI.jpg<br />
<br />
Also feel free to mess with the psd, but if you do make sure you show us what you've come up with please.<br />
<br />
http://whiteorb.net/UI.psd<br />
<br />
Just so you know these images were yanked from the artist that designed all of the cover art for EQ. So please don't yell at me I'm not trying to steal his work I just think it's beautiful.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW why can I not post any HTML? I played with my options for a while, but I couldn't figure it out.</div></div><hr />

If that doesnt agree with what you have in mind its cool :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
<br />
Also the image link at the top will be updated almost every day so don't go looking for new links. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Idea for ya...<br />
<br />
Maybe move player/group info to left and hotbuttons to right, and incorporate a secondary image that will be the spellbook... basically, make it so it will open right next to the spell gems, and will incorporate into the entire image... this is an idea that I'm considering for my necro skin, not that we need to do alot of swapping, but when we do it's more of a life-or-death situation (ever pulled without loading up a root or fear? lol).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WhiteOrb</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good idea I think maybe the spellBook could be an extension of the image behind the chat box. design it to look like rocks or something to that extent.<br />
<br />
Here is a picture of my current UI on Andeberon I was thinking of laying out this interface to look like that...what do you guys think?<br />
<br />

<br />
And here's a copy of my UI in full if you'd like anyhing from it...the eq atlas has all of the city map jpgs attached as well....<br />

<br />
I know a good percentage of you guys are creative and talented so reply and let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gixxerryder</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think maybe in game , the images of the little goblin like guys might be a little big , and seeing how most people like to use two chat windows maybe make the backround pic a little smaller and add a second chat window in there. This way its easier to see stuff while you play...<br />
<br />
Just an idea , let me know what you think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WhiteOrb</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">good idea I've been thinking of that because I use three chat windows myself...as you can see above.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with the viewing size thingy myself as well Think I'll make it a whole lot smaller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey Gix, check my UI :) BlueFantasy, in Released</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gixxerryder</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked your UI Ael , but... The UI i use now has everything i would like , its a combination of Vert and a few others all mixed into something very functional , what im really looking for is somthing that is FUNCTIONAL and of the wall with creativity IE : White orb or ...   Cleric perspective (pipe works : D )  (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1805) <br />
<br />
Both of these UIs are KILLER , could be worked on a little bit for functionality but none the less very cool.<br />
<br />
Thats just what i think...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe I like that one a lot too :) I'm sick of Vert clones, it's so...bland...anything creative and functional is all good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gixxerryder</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only stick with vert because its what im used to , its not worth changing around your whole setup for something just a little better , i want somthing alot better b4 i go thru all the truble.<br />
<br />
If i had seen your UI b4 or near the time i DL vert i wouldve gotten yours : ) <br />

<br />
I've kinda dropped from eq a bit because I logged off one night in perfect condition then logged on the next day with no gear and at my bind point...not knowing where I had died.<br />
<br />
I'll continue to make my contributions..I'll post that image back up there for yah, and get a little bit more done with it.<br />
<br />
Once again i appologize for being lazy.</div></div><hr />
