<br />
I have included a copy on one of my GUIs for the Necro (yes I have GUIs for every character class due to the Inventory Animation and Pictures :-P) when loaded it gives me the &quot;you XML files are not compatable with current please  etc etc etc&quot; the thing works but i would like to get rid of the message at least also i would like to see if anyone can make a Horizontal Buff window and short dur buff window that would fit with the theme.<br />
<br />
also resizing the player info and group windows to be more readable at 1280 x 1024 screen size would be great :-)<br />
<br />
I Take NO credit for this GUI it is entirly the work of MANY others and is a Mix and Match if these fixes are done i will post All of the GUIs (fixed versions of course) so that anyone can use them :-) I dont wanna post anything that appears to be broken<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
