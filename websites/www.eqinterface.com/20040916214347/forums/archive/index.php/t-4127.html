<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my newest rendition of BlueFantasy. It's compatible with the current patch and should be compatible with all future ones. (screenshot is from today- see music player!)<br />
<br />
Features:<br />
Seamless no-borders UI. Designed for /viewport. Takes up nearly no space; mouse-friendly. Mynlaeni's tube gauges, lots of t.king art, Athee's loc wizard, Xymarra's castbar with big gems, my small t.king inventory, and more. See screenshot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here's the first part of the zip. This one also contains the ini file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here's part 2:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and part 3:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You must download all three zip files. To install:<br />
<br />
Unzip all three files to your desktop. Open your UIFiles folder and create a new folder-call it whatever you want. Now open each of the aeluin folders, open the folder inside, select all the files and move them to the folder you created in your uifiles directory.<br />
<br />
The skin is now available. To get the window setup and have EQ load the skin when you sign on, you need to use the ini file I provided. Open the folder aeluin1 and you will see a file called UI_YourCharacterName_YourServerNumber. Now open your Everquest directory and you will see a similar file for each of your characters. Find the character you want to use my UI with and note what their file is called. Rename the file I provided to that, then paste it into the EQ directory over the old one.<br />
<br />
When you log onto that character the skin should be loaded. Change your resolution to 1280x1024 and you're good to go.<br />
<br />
Edit: This release should remain patch-proof as long as you do NOT alter any of the following:<br />
EQUI.xml<br />
EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
EQUI_Templates.xml<br />
<br />
The only exception is if Sony decides to make major changes to the hardcoding of any window I have modified. If that should happen and your UI breaks, you need to simply delete the offending file from your custom directory until such time as a fix is available.<br />
<br />
Edit 2: As this is a complete set, most individual pieces cannot stand on their own as written. If you are taking pieces for a mix-and-match, all the shared code that the windows depend on is in EQUI_Aeluin.xml; find those portions that you need and take them along with the windows you want.<br />
<br />
If you want to add another mod to the set, however, there should be no problems. You can remove or change any file other than the three listed above and EQUI_Aeluin.xml and everything will still work and the UI will retain its patch-proof characteristics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buzze</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, nice UI, I will try it out.  :) <br />
<br />
How do you change the viewport?  I have heard of a command to type but I'm not sure which numbers to use.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uahaa</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/viewport  x y x y<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice work, but could you post this as ONE zip file to the Download section... it has a higher size limit (2 meg) and you should be able to get it all on 1.. (may have to take out Athee's loc guide and link where you got it)<br />
<br />
I will link it back to this post as soon as you do if you will post it..<br />
<br />
then you can keep better tabs on whats going on with it.. and not need to keep 3 files here.<br />
<br />
(kinda why we put in the DL section)<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT AGAIN.. nice work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kreeden</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just tried your UI, did it as said on your instructions, but it loaded up the viewport settings, and all the windows in the right place, but they are the default style windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kreeden</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nm, fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe Kudane- trying to keep people away from the download section for now because there are two old versions of the UI available there, neither of which will work anymore. Speaking of which, I'd appreciate it if you'd remove bluefantasy and bluefantasy1.<br />
<br />
On the assumption that you'll do that, I'm uploading the new version now.<br />
<br />
Edit: You're right, I can't fit Athee's loc chart in 2 mb so I'm posting it here as an attachment for those who want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnost</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the UI, one question, where are the buffs?  I might of just missed it, but does the buff window have the names of the buffs listed?  Major thing for me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah- I'm using Cairenn's 3 line buff window, which does indeed have names. If you use my INI file you'll notice your buffs show up across the top of the screen, as large icons with the names directly below them. The window is almost entirely transparent, with a 'handle' at the top which I have hidden above the edge of the screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zenimer</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using Blue Fantasy since I first ran across it.  Its a excelent UI and thank for posting it so that we can use it!<br />
<br />
I found the new  version yesterday and haven't been able to get it  to work (mainly the music player, and Athee's loc wizard :confused:) Everything thing else is looking and working correctly.  I've gone into the UI and tried to move the loc so it was on the screen and nothing happen.  Has anyone else had this problem yet?<br />
<br />
I know there is a play for the default UI, and it was in the middle of the screen. <br />
<br />
I admit plainly that I don't know much about coding and such, so please forgive me if this question isnt enough information.  My email is zenimer@earthlink.net for more questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not entirely clear- are you using the version posted in this thread, or the old new version available as bluefantasy1 in the downloads section? That version works but as you have noticed the mp3 player isn't in it- however if you like it better than this one you can fix it with Cairenn's patch fix.<br />
<br />
And to open the loc chart you type /f. This command is hardcoded and can't be changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zenimer</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for not explaining that a bit better, I d/led the 3 zip files and the extra file from this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm- I don't know then. Did you know you open the mp3 player with alt-K, and the loc chart with /f? because all I did was zip up the same files I was using when I took that screenshot, and as you can see they were both working for me.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you have sound in EQ disabled in any way other than the ingame volume controls the mp3 player will not come up. Check that it's enabled in your options and that you don't have a file called nosound.txt in your EQ directory.<br />
<br />
Edit: I noticed that you said it was coming up with the default skin, so that can't be it.  Could you post your UIErrors.txt file? maybe I can figure out the problem from that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weawen</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really love the bars you are using, they look really sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jazx</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any way that you could rework the graphic to include a stamina guage?  I know a little about the coding, but not enough to avoid messing up a beautiful UI.  Maybe just a XML file download for us who need the stamina bar visible too? =)<br />

Thanks for all your hard work on this great skin!<br />

<br />
Edit: here you go. Sorry it looks a little squished; there's not a whole lot of room to spare in the group window, and I was assuming you wanted to keep the mana bar.<br />
<br />
Edit 2: problems editing in an attachment, will try in next post...grr<br />
<br />
Edit 3: can't attach anything. Sorry :(<br />

I had 1 comment and 1 question/request<br />
<br />
I play a mage and use the /pet taunt off command pretty regularly when grouped. The new version doesn't have it in the pet window so I patched in the one from Blue Fantasy 1. Of course, its too big so I had to change the viewport a little to fit it.<br />
<br />
My question is: I can't seem to find the spell book in the Spell Cast  window.  Can you make a spell book icon in that Spell cast window?  I would much appreciate it as hitting CTRL + B is not always convenient.<br />
<br />
MANY THANKS FOR A GREAT UI:)<br />

I do want to move stuff around a little.<br />
<br />
Im right handed, and my mouse cursor tens to stay on the right side of the screen. So I like to keep &quot;clickable&quot; items on the right.<br />
<br />
So I wanna move the (player/group), (pet), (hot buttons) to the right side, and the replace the space by moving  the (actions), (bags) and maybe one of the (chats) to the left.<br />
<br />
Is this easily doable? Is it just a matter of ini file/dragging ? or do I have to edit some x,y coords in the XML.<br />
<br />
Also I dont see a casting bar. Is there one in there somewhere?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure Jim, I can put the book back in.<br />
<br />
As far as flipping the screen Naas you can do most of it by dragging windows but you'd have to do a BUNCh of xml editing to flip the hotbutton window (the bar across the top). I can work on that but can't promise it'll be done anytime soon- very busy at work and all. I'm sorry :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimflyerfan</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Aeluin!...no great rush, but thought it would be good to ask. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avatar190</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the speedy update on your UI post-patching (I spent a good two hours today trying to figure out if I could repair it http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ).<br />
<br />
Also, just wanted to say that you've made a great UI.  I love the color change on the hotkeys...makes it real easy to see when they refresh.  Arrangement wasn't to much of a change from how I had my windows set up either, so wasn't to much to adjust to (aside of I prefer my buffs verticle, and on the left side -- if that could become an option in the future http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif )<br />
<br />
I do have a question...is there a way to make the main bar (hotkeys, etc.) stretchable?  Prior to this UI, I played in 1600 x 1200 graphics. Whereas your UI is compatable with that resolution...the bar doesn't fill the screen.  If not, that's cool...I'd rather get used to 1280 resolution and your UI than be without it.  http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif <br />
<br />
Thanks again, great job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avatar190</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, btw...<br />
<br />
I am using the update that you posted in the beginning of this thread, and I am getting an error message on it.  It isn't a UI crash error, it just says that some windows are incompatible with current EQ UI, and some windows may not function properly (something to this effect).<br />
<br />
Anyone else getting this, or any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mirrah</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok well some nice person created a fix for the original bluefantasy.zip ... not bluefantasy1.zip aka aeluin.... that will allow it to run now with out errors.<br />
<br />
just download the original bluefantasy.zip, then download the fixit file that you can find at the site below.  once downloaded add the new files to the original and say &quot;yes to all&quot; to replace the existing files and the original should work.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5395<br />
<br />
oh and i am getting the same errors as the guy above me with the new aeluin.zip files and i followed instructions like posted.  :(<br />

You made beautiful UIs <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avatar190</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I fixed the new files myself, inserting the information given in the UI Fix threads by Cairenn.  I tried to match up the sizes and locations as best I could from the Aeluin files.<br />
<br />
Errors are corrected, however, bard songs do not have text labels (only icons) in the Song Buff window.  They do label themselves when going in the normal buff window.  Comparing the SDBuff file and the Buff file, they seem to be the same, so I don't know why there are no labels in the SD box.<br />
<br />
Other then that, works fine.  Just insert Cairenn's information into the updated files from this thread, and you're good to go.  :)</div></div><hr />
