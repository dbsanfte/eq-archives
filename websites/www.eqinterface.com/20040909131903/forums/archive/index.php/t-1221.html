You can get it here (http://members.shaw.ca/Anathae/compass-mod.zip)<br />
<br />
The intent is to have a more accurate compass.  The compass display consists of a 1440 by 24 image that has been split into five 256 by 24, and one 160 by 24 image to fit in the window_pieces04.tga<br />
<br />
There are only three modified files, window_pieces04.tga, EQUI_Animations.xml, and EQUI_Compass.xml<br />
<br />
Three possible results, eq crashes, it only shows the part of my graphic from a cut off 70 degrees to a cut off 115 degrees, or it shows the full 360 degrees.<br />
<br />
Feedback and screen shots if it works would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to the funky nature of how the compass works, there is a good chance that you have to keep the exact same width for the graphics, and thus for the compass itself.  By altering the equi_animations file directly, as well as increasing the length of the graphics, this could have unforseen side effects - like it crashing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Feeback from the ui errors file would help.<br />
<br />
I currently do not have an active account and am not entirely sure when it will be reactivated, but I do know i would love to have this.  At last resort i'm going to make this a 1024 by 128 image and reduce the compas to 720 by 24<br />
<br />
This will, of course, make the mod not work on video cards that can not support a 1024 by 128 texture.<br />

it is here (http://members.shaw.ca/Anathae/compass-mod1024.zip)<br />

would appreciate if someone with the true north spell could confirm the compas points to 000 after casting the spell and a successful sense heading check.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sum1ntheus</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I tested both the regular compass mod and the 1024 version, here are my results.<br />
<br />
The regular version gave me a number just as it was supposed to but it would only show from the front edge of the 70 until the first 1 in 115. I think this has the most potential myself.<br />
<br />
The 1024 version gave my compass outline window with a pointer in the middle but only had a white backround in the area of the numbers or headings.<br />
<br />
Sorry i didn't get a screenshot of mine since i didn't know you would ask for one. Will try that tommorrow for you.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps I like this idea.<br />

<br />
1) it must be in the upper left corner of the window.<br />
<br />
2) it must conform to the correct width, or else it starts to look funny.<br />
<br />
As such, all you can do really is stretch the compass height, and add things under it, but without increasing the width of the window (which the compass will take up the full width of the window).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anathae</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've made no modifactions to the size of the window.  The only modification is to the compass strip image.<br />
<br />
According to what sum1ntheus reported, you can change the length of the compass stip because my first version showed 070 (split) to 115 (also split).  That image from the first version was a 256 by 24 image.<br />
<br />
btw, made a minor change to the window_pieces4.tga file.<br />
<br />
Sum1ntheus, would you download the 1024 zip and try it again?<br />

In your animation file, you are pointing &quot;A_CompassOverlay to x=0, y=24; but in your windows_pieces04.tga file, that coordinate doesn't have any graphic on it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anathae</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">eep, sorry about the delay, kinda lost interest a little when i couldn't just pop in game and see what was happening.<br />
<br />
I'm back and have made a modification that &quot;seems&quot; to work but points out some problems with the programmers' at verant assumptions.  As a programmer i'm disappointed.<br />
<br />
My current mod, that works, after a fashion is here (http://members.shaw.ca/Anathae/compas-mod512.zip)  My overlay is broken, but you do get a numeric style read out.  However... it seems to compress my 360 by 24 pixel display down to 180 by 24... and compresses it down to 180 by 12 if i set the source graphic tga to 512 by 512 (current graphic file is 512 by 256.<br />
<br />
My next attempt, after finding out what happens after the next patch, may be to try and squeeze as much info into 256x256 as I can.<br />
