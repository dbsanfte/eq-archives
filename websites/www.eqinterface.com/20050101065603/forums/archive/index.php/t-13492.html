What is the filter to move your bow does double damage message from main chat to a different window?<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

As far as the damage message, I believe 'Other Hits' is the filter you want to look for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lazaru5</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I know some UI authors move certain information to other windows so they can use the window to display something else (if that makes any sense at all), so I would try every Alt + *letter* combination and you may be able to figure out which command it is.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I don't know what to tell you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You may have changed the key binding to open that window.  In general, if you want to find what key opens and closes a window, you can find it under the Keyboard settings in the Options window.<br />
<br />
However, I don't think that is your problem here.<br />
<br />
- You may have an error in your custom mp3 UI window.  You can try deleting or renaming it and see if the default one works.  If the default works, come back here for more help to get your custom one working again.<br />
<br />
- The window might have gotten positioned off screen.  You can force all windows to default positions with &quot;/load &lt;ui&gt; 0&quot; or you can edit your UI_character_server.ini file and move just that window to some visible location, like (0,0).<br />
<br />
- You might have turned off sound completely from the Options window on login.</div></div><hr />

thanks a ton.</div></div><hr />

Took me a bunch of tries to move that spam! Gets to be a lot especially once you finish Combat Fury!</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for your bow damage.. it's &quot;non-melee&quot; for the filter.. listed in the filters under spells</div></div><hr />

OK, I downloaded it, and installed it per directions...but there is something sort of missing -  missing.  How can I get the player part of the player window? Also, is there some way to remove the dividers? I only use it for randoms and others ... so all i need is 1 chat window there=)<br />
<br />
Thanks=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noonway</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I downloaded everything an read all the faqs and help files so far but i can't seem to find the answer to my question.<br />
<br />
I am supposed to be able to rename the UI-charname_servername.ini to my exact charactername and server name and have everything automatically position correctly for me, right?<br />
<br />
When it loads up, i see all the windows, but they are all smashed down in the right corner.  i tried moving the windows to line them up as the picture shows, but i can't even move the target window at all.  I click on it and try to drag but nothing happens.  I have tried changing resolution from 1280x1024 to something else to try to be able to grab the target window and move it and i cannot.<br />
<br />
I would think this would be easier than this so i must be doing something wrong.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />
