<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read through most of them, and  the Legion of Light seems like a nice guild, i think they have most of their priorities straight, too bad I am not a Beta tester or else I would've applied. Don't know if rogues(which is all I play nowadays) would be considered good, though I personally try to be it myself. Can't wait till I have EQ 2, maybe I'll look them up then.</div></div><hr />

External Beta has not begun, that list is of people who have gotten together to form thier guilds before the game has started..<br />
<br />
Last time I was at SOE, they were still dealing in daily builds, and the servers were only up for specific test times (such as my tour)..<br />
<br />
you haven't missed out on Beta yet.<br />
