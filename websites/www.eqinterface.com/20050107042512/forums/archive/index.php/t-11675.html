Noob levels are simiilar to eq, and you get the &quot;trash loot&quot; off noob mobs.  But whatever you do, don't sell to merchants...ever...no matter what.  You can make up to 100x than what you can get from a merchant by going to the auction-house in each town (EQ bazaar), and selling to pcs.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I almost forgot to mention macros.  More so than EQ, macros make or break efficiency in FF11 since the setup is is menu-based, thus slow.  Get to know the macro system, you can get pretty creative =)</div></div><hr />

EQ is by far a better game in everyway. FF XI has so many things wrong with it i would tell you not even to buy the game.</div></div><hr />

EQ is the first and last MMORPG that i'll play. Wish i played FF11 first because it is built way better. Plus it has a lot more people playing then EQ. The job sysytem is just...wow its so great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkchyld316</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The designers of FF series &quot;Squaresoft&quot; have been making hit RPGs for decades now. They know what thier doing FFXI is extremely well thought out, the bazzar system is by far superior to the mediocre bazzar of EQ, you place your items in , set your prices depending on the history of the last 20 sales of that item, and you walk away and play the game. I dont know how many hours I've spent/lost keeping my toon afk in the bazzar, plus you can send items to any char in the game using the convienent delivery box system where you talk to an NPC near each towns bazzar and they offer to send items to another player weather thier on or offline. That in itself is an awsome feature. Also the job system is verry well thought out and improving all the time with future patches , you can pick one main job and then at a later time choose a support job which acts at half the level of your primary job. Example, you can be a 40th level Warrior and a 30th level White mage (cleric) if you chose Warrior as primary job then it would stay at lv 40 effectiveness you being able to use all the job abilities and traits, and your White mage ( cleric) would  function as if it were 20th level and all the spells job abilities and traits associated with it. The best thing is you can change your primary and support jobs anytime you like ! So you have total control of your char and total flexibility.<br />
<br />
Now when you first make your char you may think the job selection is rather limited, but dont let that duant you being only able to select from Red mage (some offence and some defensive magic little fighting ability) Whitemage ( cleric main healer type) Black mage ( damage dealer wizard type) Warrior ( tank) Thief (good dps and abilities) or Monk (good hp, and dps support tank) ,, but even with these selections dont get discouraged , cause at lv 30 you get the oppertunity to embark on a short quest to obtain an advanced job, Dark Knight, Paladin, Samurai, Ranger, Summoner, Dragoon, Bard, Ninja  these advanced jobs come with all new sets of skills and abilities with phenominal effects, watching a Ninja or samurai in action is a thing to behold , as thier bodies seem to phase in and out of reality for a moment and are surrounded by mystic symbols and runes before they unleash thier deadly abilities.<br />
 All this and you would think that maby something was lacking, maby the graphics , Youd be dead wrong, the scenery and landscapes are breathtaking, I've found myself taking screenshots of the hilly terrain and georgous lush fields just to use as the backdrop of my computer, the sunsets and starry nights with quiet winds blowing in the background add to the ambience the sounds of your armor clinking as you walk through the grass, or slushing through the fields as it rains adds that little bit of detail that makes the game memorable. <br />
<br />
The game also has a verry user friendly Quest system it's easy to pickup new quests from each town and carry them out and the rewards you get are = to the level of your char doing the mission unlike EQ where you could be level 50 and take 12 hours to do a quest for a rusty dagger , well its not that bad but you know what I mean.<br />
 Also I wanna give a little tip to anyone thinking about playing and wanting to make a little extra money. Killing at the newb levels is where all the money is at cause you can solo and keep all the loot for yourself and then resell it at the auction house . When your in a party you have to cast lots to get loot or wait for the game to randomly distrubute it, just to clarify, casting a lot is a way to randomly distribute loot, you click on an item in the party treasure box, you select , &quot;cast lot&quot; from the item and the computer randomly rolls a number from 1 - 1000 the highest taking the loot, but anyhow as I was saying the newb levels are where most of your money is at or at least untill you get higher to the point monsters start dropping decent armor you can then resell or what not, for instance killing goblins you can get a peice of goblin armor at a fairly low level, you can then put that peice of armor in the auction house and sell it for about  500 - 600 gill which is what it went for on my server. Those sold verry fast and you can make some nice profit. Basically There are going to be a lot of japanese players with you since this game opened in japan about a year ago already and most of them have started working on different trade skills systhesizing armor weapons items food , potions etc from crystals so all that usless junk you may find they value highly and buy at the auction house for decent Gill.<br />
<br />
All in all if it werent for my friends that I've made in EQ I would quit it all togther and just work on my Char in Final Fantasy Its an awsome game and a lot of fun. <br />
  I hope anyone that plays enjoys it as much as I do.<br />
<br />
Oh I've included a pic I took that I think gives a slight example to the type of visual clarity in the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well race is purely what type of class's you want to play. Taru's are the best caster class, galka are best for pure melee like monk and war. As for the rest their kind of toss ups. Hume is average on every level. <br />
<br />
Make no mistake, race has much much more impact and gameplay in FF11 then in EQ. Always sad to see someone running around trying to be a monk taru or a galka caster just because they can't do that type of thing in EQ.<br />
<br />
FF11 is a hit or miss when it come to people liking it but its definitely more hit since they already have more subscribers then EQ.<br />
<br />
Heres a pretty good place to get info on race's and class's.<br />
http://ffxi.crgaming.com/races/viewarticle.asp?Id=30 <br />
<br />
Again if I didnt already have 2 65 chars in EQ I'd be playing the hell out of this game.<br />
<br />
Edit: Don't be fooled by the RDM class either. Its very fun doing both melee and casting but they don't make a very good sub-job if you plan on going the melee route, which i wanted to do and I already got a 17 RDM heh. Every combination has their benefits, you'll just see debates galore on which one has more benefits.</div></div><hr />
