I am trying to download interface components from your site, but am unable to do so.  Perhaps it's the settings of my SecureIE browser, but I have tried downloading with Popups, Flash and ActiveX Blocked and with them enabled and I still get the same thing.  The browser appears to be downloading the file, but when it says Complete, I have a link as below:<br />
<br />
s=&amp;id=2671&amp;<br />
<br />
that says it has downloaded 25475/0 bytes (or little shy of 25k out of a 0 byte file).  I get different tags for each different file I tried to download, but they're all the same status, 25475/0 bytes Complete.  Is there an FTP site I can go to to download these files directly instead of going thru the java(?) scripting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falconer8r</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that there's some trouble with my security settings in SecureIE.  I just ran IE6 in a seperate window and am able to download with no trouble. If anyone knows anything about SecureIE and how I might enable it to download from here, please let me know. Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

Edit...<br />
<br />
Ahh looks like you have to pay for secureIE.<br />
<br />
My guess is that it doesnt like the ? or &amp; 's in the URL for some reason. Which is needed for php as thats how you input your var's.</div></div><hr />
