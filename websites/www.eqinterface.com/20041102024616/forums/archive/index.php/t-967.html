This timer features both a tick dial (for timing mezzes) and a digital timer (for timing spawns). A particularly useful option is the ability to mark a target tick on the dial.<br />
<br />
http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/images/timer_normal.jpg http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/images/timer_faded.jpg<br />
<br />
Timer features: Tick Dial<br />
The tick dial represents one minute, divided into 10 in-game ticks (6-second intervals). Useful for visually eyeballing the duration of short-term events. Tick Marker<br />
The tick marker allows you mark any tick on the dial, to help keep track of an event. Simply click on one of the numbers in the top row to mark the beginning or end of an event. Digital Timer<br />
The digital timer displays hours, minutes, and seconds, and counts up/down to 10 hours (duration is configurable). Useful for timing the duration of long-term events. Timer Reset<br />
The digital timer can be reset to 0:00:00 at any time with the following macro: &quot;/load foldername 1&quot; (note that this will also reset the dial). Window Toggle<br />
The timer window can be shown/hidden at any time by pressing the window's configurable hot key (choose from 8 different windows). Window Fade<br />
The fade level of the timer window is configurable using the right-mouse menu, like any other window.<br />
There are several pre-made configurations to choose from, or you can customize it yourself. Screenshots and timer files can be found at the timer home page:<br />
<br />
http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp<br />
<br />
NEW! You can now generate a custom timer configuration using the new web tool. Visit the timer page for more details.</div></div><hr />

Yes, that is intentional. Each mark represents an in-game tick, which is a 6-second interval, not a 5-second interval like a normal clock - you'll notice that there are 10 intervals in the dial instead of 12.<br />
<br />
The dial is designed this way because things in the game happen in &quot;ticks&quot; (6-second intervals). You regenerate mana/hp each tick, durations of spells (mezzes, DoTs, etc.) are measured in ticks, etc.</div></div><hr />

The beauty of this UI is, with certain exceptions, you can copy/paste the xml from one window to another window.<br />

This mod uses tabs, so it requires a window that supports tabbed views. Unfortunately, the friends window does not support tabs (I originally tried to use the friends window for this mod, but it didn't work). You can put this mod into any window as long as it supports tabs, just look for the timer's &lt;Pieces&gt; elements in the pet window, and move them to the desired window. If you don't want the timer in the upper-hand corner, you'll have to offset all the &lt;Location&gt; elements by the same X and Y in the timer XML file.<br />
<br />
Alternatively: the only part of this mod that uses tabs is the feature that lets you mark a tick on a dial. If you don't care about that feature, then the rest of the timer (dial and digital timer) can be placed in any window, whether or not it supports tabs.<br />
<br />
Aside from the &lt;Pieces&gt; elements that need to reside in the specific window element, all of the timer XML is consolidated into the EQUI_Timer.xml file, so that the file can be used no matter which window you choose and doesn't interefere too much with other mods.<br />

Yes, the timer can exist with other elements in the pet window. In the mod's pet window XML file, I've put a comment to indicate which &lt;Pieces&gt; are for the timer. Other &lt;Pieces&gt; can be added, or you can move the timer &lt;Pieces&gt; to another version of the file. Again, you'll have to offset all the &lt;Location&gt; elements by the same amount if you don't want it in the upper-left hand corner.<br />

The timer is simply an animation that cycles its frames. As far as I know (and correct me if I'm wrong), the only way to restart animations from the first frame is to re-load the UI. Fortunatly, if you include the &quot;1&quot; parameter following the folder name, it will preserve all your current settings.</div></div><hr />

But I was wondring how I could create a hot button to reload the skin right on the timer. I set all the buttons in the friends window to 0 size, but I could add one back in. I'm just not sure how to make it into a customizable button. I'll have to take a closer look at the xml code for the hot button window and see if I can figure it out. <br />

If you are referring to making a macro, go to the actions window and select the socials tab. Right-click on a button, give it a name, and type /load foldername 1 in one of the lines. Afterward, left-click and hold the button to pick it up and drag it to any hot key slot.</div></div><hr />

(Map mod here http://eqtoolbox.not.net/modules.php?name=Downloads&amp;d_op=viewdownload&amp;cid=31) <br />
It would take some extra work but it is possible. However, the main reason I didn't use the actions window is because I feel the map mod is very useful, and I don't think people should have to choose between the two. Since the map and timer have vastly different sizes, it would probably not make sense to put them in the same tabbed view - the tab view automatically makes the &quot;tab&quot; part of each tab the same size and spaces them out evenly.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I'll most likely create a pre-made configuration for every window that is available, but I'm planning to focus on other &quot;combo&quot; type configurations first.<br />
<br />

Ahh, I see. Unfortunately I *think* the hotkeys are tied to the hotkey window, so the button won't work if you put it in another window. However, in the next configuration that I'm going to provide, I will put the timer in the hotkey window, and move one of the hotkey slots next to the timer (you'll have to sacrifice one slot on each page for that macro though). The other nine buttons can fit in a nice square arrangement.</div></div><hr />

Changing either the pet or friends window was my hope. You may be right about the hotkeys been tied to the hotkey window since it won't load the skin if I add the hot button code to the friends window (of course I could just hav hosed the XML, but I think its right).<br />

Oh well back to the drawing board.</div></div><hr />

Simply change the screen item and properties to whatever you wish, and put in the appropriately named xml file for whatever window you want it in...<br />

Yes, putting the timer in any window is very quick and straightforward, I would agree with you there.<br />
<br />
However, unless I'm mistaken, what the person was referring to was adding the timer as &quot;additional&quot; tabs to the action window, i.e., 10 tabs for the timer and still keep the 4 original tabs for the actions, making 14 tabs total. The timer tabs need to be narrow to keep the numbers close together, but the action tab icons are currently wider. There will be some size tweaking needed to make the tabs look right when used together, and possibly new smaller graphics icons for the 4 action tabs (to match the timer tab icons better). The dial should most likely be re-centered also, to account for the width of the 4 new tabs.<br />

To get just XX:XX:<br />
In the XML file, at the bottom where you see the &lt;Screen&gt; element, under &quot;timer pieces&quot; section, remove (or comment out) every &lt;Piece&gt; except for TimerMinuteA, TimerMinuteB, TimerColon, TimerSecondA, and TimerSecondB. Those 5 pieces should give you what you are looking for. If you want them in a different location, you should offset each element's &lt;Location&gt; by the same X and same Y.<br />
<br />
=== Upcoming ===<br />
I'm currently working on a web-based tool that will let you specify any of the following information:<br />
1) A particular X and Y offset, so the timer can be in a different location in the window instead of the upper left-hand corner.<br />
2) Which pieces of the timer you are interested in (dial, tabs, digital timer, etc.).<br />
3) Which window you want the timer to reside in.<br />
4) Desired attributes of the window (transparent, sizable, title, etc.).<br />
<br />
Once you enter in the desired information, the web tool will dynamically generate the XML that you need based on your specifications. Then you can save it to a file to use as-is, or cut/paste particular parts to combine with other stuff. For me, it will sure beat the heck out of maintaining and providing many different downloadable configurations.<br />
<br />
This tool will be available on the timer web site when it is ready (hopefully some time this weekend, if I have the time).</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, the web server appears to be down currently. I've contacted the hosting company, hopefully they'll bring it back up soon. In the meantime, you can download the timer from EQInterface.com (look for &quot;Mez/Spawn Timer&quot; under Miscellaneous), since they store their own copy of the file.<br />

If you need a configuration other than the default (timer in pet window), PM me and I can send it to you.<br />

Interesting idea, but I don't think there is any way to automate clicking on a tab (think of your Actions window - if you want a view a particular tab, you have to click on it). To use the current timer to keep track of hours (assuming you are not using the mark-a-tick feature for other purposes), you have to manually click on the next tab when the hour occurs.<br />
<br />
To automatically keep track of hours would require a new animation. For example, an additional digit in front of the digital timer to get X:XX:XX. This digit would change every hour, and cycle every 10 hours. However, since there is a hard cap of 10-seconds per animation frame, this equates to 3600 frames for that one digit. This would severely increase the size of the XML file (but is doable if you are willing to cut and paste 3600 lines). I would not personally recommend it due to file size issues.<br />
<br />
On a side note, the mark-a-tick feature was originally added because it is simply not feasible to reset the dial often for short-term events. With the feature, the user can simply mark the starting tick (or desired ending tick) of an operation, which helps keep track without having to reset the dial. This feature may be useless for people who like to keep track in their head, or people who don't time short-term events too often. Thus, the feature can be used to manually track other information if desired.</div></div><hr />

I really like this timer but there's a problem. When I reset it with /loadskin Filename 1 all my abilities for some reason revert back to their number. For example, on my druid forage might be 1, fishing 3, etc, and I have the click on the hotkey and select name. This isn't so bad on my druid but on my rogue who uses a LOT of these abilities it really is a hassle, so I don't reset it often.  Has anyone else noticed this problem with abilities? Is there away around this, or is it a bug in the UI that Verant needs to fix? Verant probably didn't forsee a reason why someone would want to reset everything so often. It's a shame there's no way to reset it without doing that command.</div></div><hr />

As far as I know, this is a bug that happens whenever the UI is reloaded. Hopefully, Verant is already aware of this issue and will fix this in a future patch. Sending /bug may help get this problem noticed by the EQ staff. In the meantime, zoning or logging seem to be the only ways of resolving the problem.</div></div><hr />

To automatically keep track of hours would require a new animation. For example, an additional digit in front of the digital timer to get X:XX:XX. This digit would change every hour, and cycle every 10 hours. However, since there is a hard cap of 10-seconds per animation frame, this equates to 3600 frames for that one digit. This would severely increase the size of the XML file (but is doable if you are willing to cut and paste 3600 lines). I would not personally recommend it due to file size issues.<br />
<br />
Or one or two for loops in your asp page. :D</div></div><hr />

Yeah. :) However at the time of that writing my XML generator didn't exist yet, so they would have to make the modifications on their own if they wanted the extra digit. Even now I still haven't provided it as an option, because it would make for a pretty huge download, not to mention possible loading time issues when you type /loadskin.<br />
<br />
<br />
On another note, it seems that tab pages will fade regardless of the fade settings you specify through the UI menu, while other window elements (not in tabbed pages) will use the setting you specify. This causes the tick marker to not be as distinguishable as I'd like. Has anyone found a way around this? I'm thinking of adding an extra graphic for the tick marker in addition to the existing number highlight, to make it easier to see.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the digital timer can be used as a buff timer. If you reset it as you cast the buff, you'll know when the buff is about to wear off by looking at how much time has elapsed.</div></div><hr />

Is there anyway you might make a version of this without the &quot;clock&quot; using JUST the digital timer?<br />
<br />
I use the version for my friends window, and i love it.  I time respawns with it.  Currently i usually just move the window up so that the &quot;clock&quot; is up off the top of the screen, but i was just wondering. :rolleyes:<br />

Would be cool to let people choose how long their timers is though (maybe even if it counts up or down).  Would be interesting to see how big a XML file EQ could load too.  Anyways keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />

When I said &quot;download time&quot;, I was referring to the download of the XML from my web server when it is first generated. The dynamically-generated XML is uncompressed, so it will take longer to download from my site.<br />
<br />
As for how large a file the EQ UI engine can load, it's good to hear that you've loaded a fairly large file without noticeably increasing the load time. Since users have to /loadskin whenever they want to reset the timer, I want to keep the XML parsing time reasonable.<br />
<br />

You read my mind! That is actually the upcoming enhancement that I currently have in the works, due to several requests I've received for different timer durations. When it is done, users will be able to have multiple digital timers (selectable with tabs), and specify the duration and up/down of each one.<br />
<br />
Since there seems to be a demand for hour counting, and the extra parsing time is not too significant (mentioned above), I'll also add an option for hours on the timer for those who want it. Keep those ideas coming!</div></div><hr />

The digital timer continuously keeps counting and never stops, when it reaches 59:59 it will start over at 00:00. As far as I can tell, opening and closing the window does not affect the timer's counting. You can leave it closed, and when you open it you'll find it counting up, at some time between 00:00 and 59:59. You only need to reload the UI if you want the timer to start from 00:00 at a particular time.</div></div><hr />

I like it a lot, but on a 640x480 screen this thing is too big.  I went through the xml and figured out how it works, to see if I could move the round part up closer to the numbers along the top.  I was impressed that you could make the page borders out of 0x0 parts -- that doesn't work so good on regular window borders.  But it turns out you've already moved it up as far as possible.  I did, however, change the tabwindow to size 78 by 90 instead of 78 by 100 (makes no difference), and turned the borders and titlebar off.<br />
<br />
But I did make one nice change, which you might want to consider for your offered customizations.  I moved the minutes and seconds counters up 85 pixels.  That's it, no resizing or anything, just 85 pixels up, so they're right under the numbers at the top.  I deleted the colon image.  It looks good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, version 2.0 of the timer is now available. This new version is more compact, so it takes up less screen space. Also, the timer now counts up/down with a max duration of 10 hours (configurable). The default timers still count up to 1 hour, so if you want a different duration or direction, you can use the customization tool to generate one.<br />
<br />
Currently, the tool only lets you select durations that result in a uniform cycle for each digit, to cut down on the amount of XML that is generated. For example, the right-most digit in a two-hour timer can be represented by 10 frames (0-9, repeating cycles). However, change that duration to two hours and one second, and the number of frames for that one digit jumps up to 7201 due to the partial cycle at the end. So for now, you can select from a list of uniform-cycle durations. In the future I will add an option to select non-uniform durations for multiples of 6 (in-game ticks), up to 96 seconds. If there is enough demand, I will also be adding the option to specify multiple durations that can be selected with a tab view.<br />
<br />
I've also added some entries to the FAQ, and will be adding more shortly. Thanks for all the feedback so far.<br />

I just tried it and the timer worked fine with Drakah's mod - make sure that you also put &quot;timer.tga&quot; in the drakah folder, in addition to replacing &quot;PetInfoWindow.xml&quot;. Both files have to be in the folder in order for the timer to work.<br />

It's possible to have multiple timers as long as you keep in mind that you can not reset them individually, as the /load command will reload the entire UI. One of the upcoming enhancements will include an additional tab view for the digital timer, with a different (customizable) duration on each tab. So you will be able to use one timer at a time, but select from different durations. In the meantime, you can still use the customization tool to create one digital timer with whatever duration you specify.<br />

The timer uses tabs (each number in the tick marker is a separate tab), and as far as I know, tab views can not be nested. So there are three other options:<br />
1) Use the tab-less version of the timer (no tick marker), and put that on another tab.<br />
2) Integrate the timer tabs with the other tabs. That would make 12 tabs total (10 for timer and 2 for the other ones), and some size adjustment would be necessary. I think I posted about a similar thing about the Actions window, earlier in the thread.<br />
3) Put the timer in a separate tab view, next to the other tab view. You are allowed to have multiple tab views in the same window, as long as they aren't nested. Of course, this defeats the purpose of trying to save space.</div></div><hr />

This question gets asked a lot, but unfortunately, it is not possible to display real time via a UI mod. As mentioned previously, the timer is just an animation that cycles through its frames. Thus, it has no connection to RL (or EQ) time.</div></div><hr />
