<br />
With many of these new targeting rings using 50 million files it can be a PITA to update one when a new version comes out.  <br />
Take for example the Ariania Ying &amp; Yang ring that she recently updated.  A few files were removed, or renamed, and were no longer used.  Without an uninstaller, these &quot;junk&quot; files are left behind when updating.<br />
Unlike a complete ui, you cannot simply &quot;delete your folder and install the new version.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've been converting the ones that I use into exe files so that I can have the uninstaller for easy removal if needed.  I was going to give copies to the original author for possible upload, but wanted to know what the conditions on exe files are before doing so.</div></div><hr />
