I heard something about  XML files or soemthing of the sort to fix the custom UI issue but I don't know how to get that to work.  When i disable the new UI I can log on, but if i enable it I can't log on to my characters with custom UIs.  If anyone have any idea how to fix this, please let me know.. this is very frustrating and nobody has been able to help me so far!  <br />
<br />
Thank you, and please let me know if you have any ideas!</div></div><hr />

New UI is still in beta, don't expect it to be perfect.  (This also belongs in the help forum not bugs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruuss</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have custom mod files or skins and then EQ patches some of the same files you have customized, the UI may be unstable or crash because you are using an out of date file now.  You need to identify which files were patched and either get updated ones from the author who made them or go back to the default UI until such time that you get an updated one.  Type /loadskin default 1 to return to the default without resetting the window positions.</div></div><hr />

Without these lines of code, you're screwed.  There are several threads in here regarding the patch... 8/14, was it?  (I never know what day it is)  If you do a search, you should be able to find the info you need.<br />

I've deleted the &quot;default&quot; folder &amp; downloaded it again.  I've made the appropriate changes in the &quot;eqclient.ini&quot; &amp; &quot;UI_Character&quot; files.  I even went as far as to removing the &quot;UI_Character&quot; files from the directory.  I was able to log on with the default skin once, but after that, it won't let me log in.  Always goes from the character selection screen to the server selection screen.  Took all the folders out of the UIfiles folder just to start from scratch.  Any help or insight would be much appriciated.  Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
No, seriously - did you try turning off the new UI altogether and seeing if you can even load at all with the old one?  If not, you may just have some corrupt EQ files that has nothing whatsoever to do with the UI.  You can also try saving your char_##.ini files (the ones with your settings and friends lists) somewhere, then deleting all your files in the EQ folder - they'll just be re-downloaded when you log back on.<br />
<br />
But, unfortunately, that's the best advice I can give.  You may also just need to completely remove EQ (via add/remove programs)... i would save the char files, first, so you don't have to redo your colors and friends.... as well as any UIs you've dl'd or done yourself.....  then just reloading it.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't be of more help.  A very strange problem, indeed.  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinwar</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same problem. I posted to Everquest.com forums and got a reply from a GM with a link how to fix it and it worked. In a nutshell delete all files from you uifiles folder and repatch. the patcher will load all the new files. After that install your mods to a seperate folder named whatever you want but just install the moded files don't copy all the other files from the default folder like before. hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exellion</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm gonna try to just remove the whole UIfiles folder from the EQ directory.  Let EQ just repatch the whole thing rather than just the &quot;default&quot; folder.  Hopefully that will work.  If not, I'll just reinstall EQ all together.  Thanks for the words of encouragement, I'll let you all know what solves my problems, or you will be seeing more posts from me here :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exellion</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went ahead &amp; uninstalled EQ all together &amp; reinstalled.  That seemed to fix the problem.  When in doubt, reinstall...heh.  Must have been a corrupted file somewhere else &amp; having nothing to do with the new UI.  Cause now when I load up into the default skin &amp; try to load a custom one, it gives me an error &amp; reloads the default.  The I can just check the UIErrors file to see what happened.  Kind of a nice feature.  Before it wouldn't let even log my characters on.  It would just from character selection screen --&gt; server selection.  Even when I had repatched the UIfiles folder, it did the same thing.  One strange thing did happen was when I reinstalled EQ, all my settings were the same as if I never reinstalled.  I did just goto Add/Remove Programs &amp; clean it out.  Even made sure the EQ folder wasn't there anymore.  I dunno, creepy.  Either way, its all good now &amp; wanted to let you all know what I had to do to fix this.  Hopefully it helps someone, even though it is kinda drastic.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marcin</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's because add/remove programs only removes the files that were created during installation, not files the game generates afterwards such as *.opt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinwar</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the older mods that havent been updated since the new patch will cause the client to load to default, I had a spells window that had an eqanimations.xml and equi.xml that was attached to it and when those older files were loaded it caused my client to load default. I found a spell bar that doesnt have those files modded and it works fine now. If your loading seperate mods try one at a time until your ui wont load then you know which is corrupt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exellion</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I went ahead &amp; just redownloaded the mods that I was using.  And tested each one out to make sure they would run with the update.  The big problem before was that it wouldn't load the default, as a matter of fact, it wouldn't load at all.  It's all good now, so I'm not complaining. :D <br />

<br />
Just do this...<br />
<br />
1. Rename your custom skin folder to anything...this way when you log in it will not find your skin and give you the default, but keep you in the new ui.<br />
<br />
2. In the new ui default skin.....hit Alt-D and get rid of the stupid new compass they added with that patch....just close it out.<br />
<br />
3. Log out and rename your skin folder back to what it was and come back in (or just do the /load newfoldername 1 to reload your custom skin from whatever you renamed it to).<br />
<br />
It was the addition of the new compass window that screwed my gui up, turning it off and going back solved it for me.</div></div><hr />
