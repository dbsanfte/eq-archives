<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those who cant seem to patch the mods correctly (?), I am trying to see if I can get the files of the Complete UI's deleted off here, and replaced with the updated fully-patched versions so that this thread can become null/void.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with the mods currently on Eqinterface.com as long as you Patch them with the files listed and follow the directions therein. I am finding most people are not taking the time installing it. I know directions are aweful and boring, thinking &quot;hey I dont need to know that&quot;.. well, I got news, you do. More and more I am finding that people say they followed the directions to the letter and it still doesn't work. Im sorry, but thats quite hard to believe. Sorry, its just real fustrating having to contend with after a while, it gets old. :(<br />
<br />
For those of you who are having trouble, I edited the very first post under &quot;Drakah's UI Released!&quot; to help those with installing it the &quot;black and white&quot; way. Please take the time to read it, mainly the Red text.<br />
<br />
Thanks :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All Full UI's and Tking's Inventory has been re-uploaded to EQinterface.com. All are fully patched. <br />
<br />
No need to download any patch. I would advise to download the full versions so you have less chance of breaking it =)<br />
<br />
So now technically, this thread is null and void. :)</div></div><hr />
