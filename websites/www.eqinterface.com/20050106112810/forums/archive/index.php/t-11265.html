<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Equidae</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ladui was the ui that i was useing.<br />
<br />
and i had tried reloading the default ui several times.  and i had even deleted the original default one so that i can get a freshly downloaded ui &quot;default&quot; folder. My guess is that it might be in the .ini that i will attemt to delete now and see if that might take care of the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mutley</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had a few buttons mysteriously vanish on me also like that.  One common one is the Random button on the mp3 player, but only if I have the player set with no texture (which is how I prefer it).  When that happens, even the default will show no Random button.<br />
<br />
I fixied it by deleting the UI+name_bristle.ini section having to do with the mp3 player and copying over another good one (didn't want to lose all my settings).<br />
<br />
But it seems that certain combinations just &quot;go bad&quot; on some system for no apparent reason.  It will vanish again after so many loads of the UI when it's in no texture background mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does anybody have an idea? I've deleted the UI and have had a new default folder patched.  What else do I need to clean up??<br />

thx, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">becksta</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same problem :(<br />
<br />
it's a bad ini file.<br />
<br />
I don't know which one exactly.<br />
Maybe someone here could pinpoint the exact one.  <br />
I just went crazy and trashed all of em.<br />
Works now ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fumata</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having the exact same issue. All I did was use the default ui and added 5 things to it (i.e. hot buttons, group, player, spell buffs, songs windows)...<br />
<br />
put those 5 and all default into a new folder i created under UI folder and loaded the ui by the name I gave it.  It all works great, but when I die, there is no accpet or deny on the rez box and if I try to zone I will have a client side crash.<br />
<br />
This is my first stab at a UI that I want to keep simple yet fit my needs.<br />
<br />
ANY specific info to fix this rez box issue would be really great. Pls help :) /beg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skuzzo</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same prob here also, was using sars4 at the time when i first noticed it so i switched back to default and nothing, im out of ideas and dont like screwing around with ini files(cause i dont really know what im doing) If anyone has fixed this plz give explicit instructions on what u did so i can get it solved pls pls pls <br />
<br />
thanks a ton</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fumata</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok I figured it out and fixed this problem with mine.  What I found the problem to be was that I had other ini files named for instance:  UI_charactername_ini  (not to be confused with charactername_ini).  The UI_charactername was associated with my previous UI and it caused conflict. I deleted it out then logged on again and let it create an all new first time logging on that character on that UI ini file... all has been good since.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
