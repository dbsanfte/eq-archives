<br />
&lt; snip &gt; but it doesn't show the progress or time info<br />
<br />
You can put a label there all you want, but it won't do anything.  You can't remove buttons from their parent window, nor can you create new functional buttons in any window.  Check out the Things the new UI can't do (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2267) thread.</div></div><hr />

The hp/mana/xp/etc guages are all EQTypes. An EQType is universally available anywhere in the UI. The adventure counters are not EQTypes, and therefore must be in the Adventure window to work.<br />
<br />
I understand what you're saying about including the whole Adventure window inside the Player window, but I have no idea if it would or wouldn't work. Depends on how SOE coded it, I guess...<br />
<br />
How exactly did you include the Adventure window inside the Player window? Most of my editing has simply been tweaking the existing stuff to add or rearrange small things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drylar</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, Sir/Ma'am. There are no no eqtypes as of the recent patch. You aren't going to see any functional timers in other windows. I did a feedback requesting eqtypes, others should too. They are hard coded to the window, much like the shared pp slot in the bank window. You cannot make them work in any other window than the one they have it coded for. They allow us to do ALMOST anything we want, but that is one of the things that we can't do. Yet. If you wanna see what all can be put where, check out the tutorial section, the list of eqtypes doesn't include those. Go figure, they have an eqtype for spent aa points, but not unspent... They dont always have things make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They did finally add an EQType for the unspent AA count, and a couple others (for labels items):<br />
71 = unspent AA count<br />
73 = Sur Name (isn't it supposed to be Sir?)<br />
74 = class AA Title<br />
<br />
But the adventure info is still hard coded and does not use EQTypes.  Hopefully they will change more things to have an EQType.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get off topic, but answer your question, no it isn't supposed to be Sir.  It's &quot;surname&quot; (one word, not two):<br />
<br />
Main Entry: 1. sur·name <br />
Pronunciation: 's&amp;r-&quot;nAm<br />
Function: noun<br />
Date: 14th century<br />
1 : an added name derived from occupation or other circumstance : NICKNAME 1<br />
2 : the name borne in common by members of a family<br />
<br />
(aka: last name)<br />
<br />
Wheeee, let's hear it for random trivia! :p ;)</div></div><hr />
