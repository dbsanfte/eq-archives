Very nice work, I have been using this skin for my necro, but in the previous version, you were able to move the chat windows around to your lliking and add chatwindows etc, any chance you'll fix that in version 3?  <br />
<br />
1. Open the Grown3 file.<br />
<br />
2. Open the EQUI_ChatWindow.xml (You can use your word pad for this)<br />
<br />
3. Scroll to the bottom until you see this<br />
&lt;Style_Border&gt;false&lt;/Style_Border&gt;<br />
&lt;Style_Sizable&gt;true&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt;<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;CW_ChatOutput&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;CW_ChatInput&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
&lt;/Screen&gt;<br />
&lt;/XML&gt;<br />
<br />
4. Change &lt;Style_Border&gt;false&lt;/Style_Border&gt; to this &lt;Style_Border&gt;true&lt;/Style_Border&gt;<br />
<br />
5. Then save and exit.<br />
<br />
You will be able to adjust and move freely around now<br />
<br />
If you then want to remove the border once your have set up your chat windows just follow these steps again but change the &quot;true&quot; back to &quot;false&quot;<br />
<br />
Good luck and enjoy,<br />

<br />
Changes i made were to the pet window, I essentially got rid of the spell bar and pet commands. <br />
<br />
I moved in my 4 pack as i call it, I very often use my wrist to make a pouch of quellious which is 3 sets of 20 stars and a bag, so I have setup 1 wrist slot, ammo slot, range slot, and 1 inventory slot in the 4 pack this is along the left hand side. <br />
<br />
There is also a wide open area at the bottom where my tink bag is for you to get 2 open bags at one time, this allows up to 12 very quick swapable items such as weapons or right click buff stuff you dont wear anymore. Quick switch Primary and Secondary slots appear under your attack and ac numbers.<br />
<br />
and the last mod is just change HP size.<br />
<br />
Hope you all like it.<br />

Maybe you are working on it and i hope you will post a fix soon =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Izzeren</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I was originally using the Grown 2 version of this UI up until todays patch everything worked just fine for me, but now when I logged on my boxes was out of place and when i moved them and locked them back into place and zoned they moved again on me. Any suggestions or ideas why this may be happening?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Izzeren</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I just figured out what was causing the problems, but I am to affraid to go in and make those changes. Growth I really hope you fix them because I love the UI it has been one of my favorites by far that I have used to date. Until then I will just keep shifting the boxes around as need be I guess.<br />
<br />
Ok I downloaded the Grown 3 and copy and pasted the stuff out of the folder and overwrote the other stuff just to simplify things basically. The problems I am having is the Target box is messed up because the target it off center of the box, the compass bar at the top is shifted to the left, the spell icon section shift up towards the middle, the buffs section shifts upwards as well, the hotkey/inventory boxes move upward, the one large box on the left I had origianlly split it into 2 boxes for my hit/being hits so I can parse information with a parser a bit easier and I can see what I actually hit for consitantly without all the spam of me being beat on. The far box which was originally the big one that I cut down to size without moving it is now shifted to the left off the edge of screen and I can not move it back over.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that this will help you identify some of the problems and hopefully will be able to get them fixed. Is anyone else having thes problems as well?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Growthgloth</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what I would do to insure that it works properly.<br />
<br />
1. Exit EQ totally<br />
2. Unizip the UI into your Uifile folder.<br />
3. Change the UI_Grown_93 to your UI_Char_ServerNumber.<br />
4. Place the file your renamed into the folder where your screenshots are located.<br />
5. Click yes to replace the older file.<br />
6. (Optional) Open your EQclient thats located in your EQ folder.<br />
7. Scroll down or use search to find UISkin=Default, change that to read UISkin=Grownfixed.<br />
8. Close that file and save.<br />
9. Log on to EQ as normal and you should be all set!<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

You should have to rewrite it if not there will be problems</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Growthgloth</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok ill explain in detial<br />
<br />
In the Grownfixed file you DLed there is a file named UI_Grown_93 or something close to that. Right click on that folder and click copy.<br />
Then go to your desktop and right click on it, then click paste.<br />
Now, right click on it once and click rename.<br />
<br />
Change it to UI_Name_servernumber now what I mean by this is your In game characters name, like my necros name is Grown and I play on Stormhammer and the Stormhammer number is 93 so it looks like this  UI_Grown_93 now if your characters name it Slasher and you played on Tallon Zek it would look something like this UI_SLasher_84. Now to find out what your server number is, open your EQ folder and search for your (lets say your characters name is Slasher) UI_Slasher_## (This &quot;##&quot; is your server number) when you find that, rename the UI_Grown_93 to your infomation. and place it in the same folder, and it will ask you if you want to overwrite the file and click yes.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

Where you extracted the ui files too, there should be a file called uiblablahxx. Here's what i do, Open it with notepad, hit edit, select all, copy, then find the character name you want to use in your eq directory. Open, select all, delete, then paste, save changes. go in game, alt o, video displays, change it to 1024 x 768? I forgot which, it tells ya in the readme file. now, all you have to do is /loadskin blah blah 1. bam! your there!~<br />

All that ive read says that its a mater of changing true to false but when i change the borders to false the UI seases to work. error in all cases looks like this<br />
<br />
[Sun Mar 16 22:09:30 2003] Warning: file EQUI_NoteWindow.xml not found in directory UIFiles\growntake\.  Attempting to use file from Default skin.<br />

[Sun Mar 16 22:09:30 2003] Error loading skin: loading default skin instead.<br />
<br />
i was hoping that you might be able to tell me what i need to do differently to make the changes work without borders?</div></div><hr />

I dont believe I added a Note file into Grown so you might wanna start there by removing that file. Then look for away to impliment it. Also If the skin was created by another person, they may have made it for use with there own skin, so you would have to open the file and look for things that wouldn't normal exist.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trupoet</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey just wanted to post here to say that I love the UI....but one minor bug I noticed was that the PoP AAs do not show the Cost.<br />
<br />
General,  Archtype, and Class show it just fine but the 2 PoP categories dont show the Cost column so I have to manually switch over to the default UI just to see what cost I'm currently at for any of these AAs. Just something that would be nice to fix. If you know an easy way to fix I can do myself, let me know, thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS ~ Also no support for Shared Bank gets really annoying...have to switch back to default ui jsut to use shared bank.</div></div><hr />
