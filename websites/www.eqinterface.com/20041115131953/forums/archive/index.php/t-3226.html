<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, as long as you are using the same version of Vert (Vert 2.2), the color you use shouldn't be a big deal. <br />
<br />
Just download Ventrix's modified/patched copy of Vert 2.2 CM and put the .xml files in your Vert folder. <br />
<br />
Near as I can tell, the only difference between Crystal Meth and Canabis is the graphics files. So if you just copy the .xml files into your UI folder, everything should work fine.</div></div><hr />

Difference is for us 56k slobs... first fix took me 25mins to DL... this one took me 25 seconds. :)<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
ALL those files were fixed?? To my knowledge only the animation file needs a fix... peeps don't use all the original files from vert, so they wanna know EXACTLY what files you changed... so they can add just what needs to be added... ya know? :)<br />

To get the Vert UI working, you only need to edit the animations.xml file by addignt o statments for checkboxes.<br />

I haven't been able to afford POP yet but will soon. In the meen time Kudane is gona tell me if it worked right. It should. It loads and such just cant access the raid window.<br />
<br />
PS. I also uploaded new versions of evrt 22 Green and Blue and vert 11 that work, aswell as the animations file that should work for any of you using standard vert with minor mods. <br />
<br />
NOTE: any mod that I made for 2.x that has an animations file in the mod has been updated as well get the enw version pls, NOt the default vert 22 animations file! Also they are now ziped in a folder, so unzip and copy/paste from the folder.<br />

EQUI.xml file the only difference between this and the default si that it does not contain the players note window feature, nor the gem window feature.<br />

In short you do NOT need it to enable RAID window<br />

The only file that is necesary is the EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
file. you do not have to have the other files as they are loaded from the default file. <br />
<br />
Adding extra files into the vert directory makes bigger problems when Verant decides to patch again, by leaving them in the default directory they get patched by Verant and you do not have to update them.<br />

Hope this helps answer the questions.<br />

Thanks for the UI, this is the best i have used so far. I have only one problem, aproximately half the time i start up, the game locks up on the char select screen. Seems it only does it, when the shammie epic is on instead of normal cursor. Is there a fix to this? (And even better, a fix with the wiz epic instead of the shaman one :-)<br />

Yes, it should not be so big, he copied all the default files to it, thats a bad thing, just DL the standard Vert 22 from the featured artist section for Vert.<br />

<br />
ALSO just remove the bazaarsearchwindow.xml file from verts ui and the error message for bad xml will go away.<br />
Vert fixed a bug verant had in this file long before verant fixed it, now sony patched to it, and you do not need this file in verts directory.<br />

I'm sure the major skin authors will have fixes out shortly. In the meantime, there are only two problems I've experienced:<br />

Delete your directory DownLoad the new POP version of vert, unzip, DownLoad the mods you want install them one at a time. You should not have these errors if you do this, and if you do It will tell you what mod is the problem, then I can help you more.<br />

Delete the bazaarsearchwindow.xml file from your vert directory.<br />

The issue with the pet windows is a known issue, actauly the buttons are there, just the size of the window prevents you from seeing them. I've seen fixes for this posted on various evrt threads, but I'll get on done later tonight and post it in the Vert DL section.<br />

http://www.texaspride.com/skeeter/images/eqpics/badbook.bmp<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me WHY it's not lined up properly and how I can fix this?  Everythin works great after a bit of tweaking I had to do... Please help me on this spellbook thing though.  It happens with any graphic I try to use... :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ynar</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that too. The problem appears to be that the background graphics and the spell slot locs don't line up (duh). There are three ways you can deal with this:<br />
<br />
1. Replace the background graphic (spellbook01.tga or something like that) with one of your own and just let the spell slot squares appear ( I did this first and it worked fine - used a nice fabric texture).<br />
<br />
2. Figure out XML and change the location of the spell slot icons (I didn't even want to think about doing this).<br />
<br />
3. Download one of the lovely new T.King spell books (version 2). It's a simple replacement and I didn't have to edit any other files... just overwrote the spellbook window xml file and the associated spellbook graphics files.<br />
<br />
If you really like the smaller spellbook and want to stick with it, options 1 or 2 are your best bet. Option 1 is definitely the easiest.</div></div><hr />

Vert is in hietus...<br />
<br />
Simply DL the vert Tking Mod from the DL site to get Tkings book working.... Or just re-Download the full vert file, and over write the spellbook.xml file this will bring it back to the off cenetr view...<br />
I'll look at fixing this, but i've been busy as of late.<br />

<br />
First make sure you have the vert22_CrystalMeth-Pop2.zip <br />
File, and NO Other fixes/patches. There should be no RAID error as this does not even contain the raid window file. Second just remove the BazaarSearchWindow.xml file from the vert directory will fix the second error message. As for the drag Items error, those reside in the default directory and this just says it's loading them from the default directory.<br />
<br />
Here what you should do. Get the vert22_CrystalMeth-Pop2.zip <br />
Unzip it to a new directory, and load it without anything else. It works just fine for me. and when you see it works begin adding mods one ata a time and test them.<br />
<br />

PS. If you downloaded the crystalmeth fix from THIS thread, you willg et these errors, and I would recomend getting the file from the sites Download area under featured artist Vert/sokol again the name of this file is vert22_CrystalMeth-Pop2.zip</div></div><hr />

OK, ONE LAST TIME. (Sorry had to shout there as no one seems to notice) The DL on this post, the one you downloaded was not MY fix, and is a bad fix if you use it you WILL have problems...<br />
Goto the main download section of this site, and click the featured artist Vert/Sokol find the full version of vert tagged with the pop at the end. (theres also an animations file fix that works too) Get that DL that, remove the bazaar search window file and you will not even have the minor error text telling you to laod default.<br />

I had the same problem with the tk file not found.  For an easy fix download the tk zip from EQInterfaces:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/download.php?id=103<br />
<br />
Just unzip the tkspellbar.tga file from that zip and put it in your custom UI folder.  It wont change the look of your spell gems (at least it didnt for me).<br />
<br />
When you get those type of UI errors its important to resolve them, they can cause serious performance issues.<br />
<br />
Hope this works for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're talking about the tkspellbar files, it's because they're not really part of the Vert UI. Any of the custom UI files you find that start with tk are almost certainly part of the t.king/Remelio interface components.<br />
<br />
I like the t.king spell icons/gems and spellbook, but those are the only pieces of the Vert/Sokol interface I replaced.</div></div><hr />

I have had reports from some that it lags and others saying it doesn't. What windows do you have open when it lags? IE is the raid window up etc etc.. Try closing windows like the pet/player info window etc... see if you can isolate the lag.<br />

For an easy reference could someone please post a link to the newest and standard vert UI?  Thanks.<br />

I was having issues where it would take forever from server select to the EQ splash screen and it turned out to be UI related.

Okay I have it up and running in game fine, but when I go to zone, or camp, the game tottally crashes, it says my UI files arent compatiable with EQ, but plays fine while I am that zone and is remarkable, just when I zone I have to reset to default and then reload it and resize everything. You know of any reason this might be happening?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and thanks for all the hard work, the UI is sweet, I wish some of yall worked for verant, the interfaces would of been ten times as sweet.  <br />
<br />
what download version are you using? Does it contain the bazaarsearchwindow.xml file? did you DL it from this thread or the Download section under featured skins Vert/Sokol?<br />

Where is this pop_3 version ? Can't find it in download sokol menu.  <br />
<br />
Kudane will be updating my post to a pop4 version which will fix minor problems like the error caused by the bazaarsearchwindow.xml, and hopefully removes some of the issues that a few have had with lag. It's should be posted later today.<br />

its also really easy to prove. When it happens swap back to the default UI and check if you can see it. <br />
<br />
If you cant its not a UI issue. <br />

If you can see it in the default UI..swap back to vert and check..if you cant see it then again its a vert issue.<br />

I'm having the same problem as Kocco. I cant see some items that are on corpses or have been looted. I noticed this in the PoP drops and only on some items. I can right click on the item and see the stats. This is what I did so far. I went back to my default and was able to see the item. I then logged out and installed vert once again the item again was not visible. I downloaded Vert 2.2 full version (crystal meth) from the top of page 1 of this post. I get no error message in my eqerror folder. I installed it by unzipping the vert and putting the folder in UIFILes. I then simply logged in and typed /loadskin vert true. I also removed the bazaar search and equi raid html from vert do to the fact I would crash to desktop. This fixed the crashing problem but may have caused this other problem.<br />
<br />
I also gave the item to other Vert mod users and the item was not seen by any of them. Thanks for any assistance you can give me in getting this corrected.<br />

Ok, send me your ui errors.txt file and did you DL the newest version I just uploaded afew days ago?<br />
Also none of the changes made to vert should cause it to lag, and some have reported it lagging some say it's just fine, so to narrow it down I'd like a complete list of what mods your using down to the names of the zips please...<br />

<br />
Did you downloaded the file at the begining of this post? Please goto the regular download section under featured skins Vert/Sokol and get a pop enabled version of verts UI. <br />
<br />
Also never ever copy the files from the default to verts directory those are not errors but notifications that it's loading it from the default folder, and very normal copying them from the default to verts will cause nothing but problems later!!!!!<br />
<br />
If it persists after that, let me know there's been no crash issues with that yet.<br />

What version are you using, the exactname of the zip? Is it the one from this thread? If so do not use it, get the one from the sites download section under featured skins Vert/Sokol it's taged with the pop name and says it's pop enabled. It will and does work :)<br />

Those are ALL the files you need to get vert to work. Never copy the default files to your mod directory.<br />

Did you download the fix from this thread if so the gems game is disabled among other problems, if it's from the main featured skin DL section Vert/Sokol it should work. As for the mp3 player i am unsure try it :) I haven't been on eq in a week due to stuff...<br />

NOTE: Vert by default does not contain the EQUI.xml file!<br />
If yours has it it's not from the main DL section! This is important to get the proper one, or you will have bugs pop up! Further more, I saw on a post about some one suposedly getting a trojan that he suspects is from verts UI. Let me refute this now. He said he had a batch file with Verts Ui, and there is NO batch file! So be VERY carefull with your source of DL's for Vert, and ALWAYS check the contents of the downloads.<br />
<br />
-Sokol<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE: The new patch modifies nothing in the exisitng vert mod folder and therfore should work just fine.. nice to have a patch where I'm not deluged with emails way to go Sony!<br />
Not that I mind.. :)</div></div><hr />

Well I was wrong, it seems there is a problem once again, this error means theres a duplicate listed in a file in vetr, and the playernoteswindow, copying the xml file will NEVER help only cause problems.<br />

Well THATS the problem, and yes it DOES have soemthng to do with it! chuckle the test server gets all the experimental updates first, and they obviously updated something, send me your uierros.txt file and I can help you out. I've done this for other test players before but don't like to as they change things WAY to often. When you guys post something please give as much info as possible! Especialy if you play on the test server. I spend many hours working for you guys not justf rom these boards, but many more via PM and email don't make me spend time checking something that a little extra info would have prevented the whole time.<br />

I've read through everything and I still can't find a solution to the problem I am having.<br />
<br />
With the latest version of vert, I get kicked to desktop every time I zone, die, breathe wrong, etc.<br />
<br />
The old version of vert (1.1) doesn't even load. EQ just loads default.<br />
<br />
On &quot;featured skins&quot; page... where is the download for JUST the vert mod (official)... all I have seen are the mods to the mod itself?<br />

ps.  it seems to only crash when i load a character going into a pop zone.  when i went into a luclin zone with my ranger, it just loaded the default ui.  i tried to /loadskin vert and everything, but it didn't work.  then when i camped out, my character selection screen was back to default rather than still using the vert ui.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am trying to use only the Player, Group, Target and Buff windows... but when I do, I get horrible lag.<br />
<br />
If I load the whole vert mod, I have no lag. If I use the default UI, I have no lag.<br />
<br />
But if I do a new directory, copy only the player window, group, etc. and load that new &quot;custom&quot; UI, I have horrible video lag.<br />
<br />
(Same goes with downloading the mods for only the player window, etc. in the download section).<br />
<br />
Any ideas why??</div></div><hr />

Considering EVERYTHING seems to work fine, I don't understand the nature of this error.  I get the red text everytime I zone though that suggests loading the default skin (/veto) because some XML files may be incompatible.<br />
<br />
Also, when I read a book or a page, it's all screwed up.  Am I the only one that gets this?  Should I post a screenshot of what mine looks like?</div></div><hr />

Ignore the warnings there just telling you that the default files are loaded from the default folder AS IT SHOULD BE if there un moded. Try checking if your vert fodler has the bugreportwindow xml file if so remove it and this should fix the errors. As for a fix for the book, thats an old Vert bug which I fix long ago, and posted a fix called bookfix.zip in the DL section.<br />
