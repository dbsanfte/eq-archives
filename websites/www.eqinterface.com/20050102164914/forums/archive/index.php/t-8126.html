I am having trouble downloading this file =(. It looks like it saves fine, but when I try to open the folder it says &quot;Compressed (zipped) folder is invalid or corrupt&quot;.  Is this a bug? Or do I have to change my settings to something? I'm not very good at computers, and this downloading UI's is totally foreign to me =). <br />
<br />
Also I think I saw something in another UI download using a mix and match t.king UI that one needed to select a .ini file either &quot;pet or &quot;plain&quot; and change the name to player name/server# and delete the last part of it if it ended in pet? I don't know what it is talking about =(. Where do I find these plain/pet.ini files?  My apologies for my questions.<br />

The name, or the address of the page (the http:// stuff at the top of your browser, when trying to download that UI), will help folks figure out what kind of problem you're having. :)</div></div><hr />

But while I'm here, the file I was trying to download was . . .&quot;t.kingbased UI Ver 2a- by Cairren&quot;<br />

It does save (I think), but zipped folder is still corrupt, therefore no files can be extracted =(<br />
