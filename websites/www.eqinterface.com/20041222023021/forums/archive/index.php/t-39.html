<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NijK</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">edit3: ok here we go again:<br />
http://www.geocities.com/dakkon44/index.html<br />
sorry for all the clutter, should work now<br />
<br />
Ok now that that's working, my question is: Is any of that possible the way the pic shows? (specific lables etc, spellbook popping out of gem mneu etc.)<br />
<br />
wtb suggestions criticism and the like<br />
<br />
Oh and while I'm at it, are you guys all using the same XML editor and whatever other programs it takes to create the UIs you're coming up with, or do you guys use different ones? Would any of you mind posting which editor and/or other programs you use (and possibly why? hehe) Thanks again<br />
<br />
edit4: just found one finally:<br />
http://www.xmlspy.com/download.html<br />
30 day free trial or something like that, going to see how much XML I can learn now =) XML Spy a good editor? Anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arantius</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dunno what &quot;xml program&quot; people use, I use notepad! RAWR!<br />
<br />
Anyway, my skin has a few of the things you want.. take a gander if you would like in the &quot;Developer template gallery&quot; then &quot;beta&quot;.  As for the spellbook thing, I have selected a smaller spellbook size, but I don't think you can realistically shrink it down to the size of the spell gems, unless you make it really wide perhaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orcinart</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use XML spy. I consider it the best atm., and I have been doing XML encoding in my software development for a couple of years. However,  without Schema files, you may as well edit them in Notepad,  because you just end up editing or reverse engineering the examples.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">psychogears</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Ultraedit. It's like a very streamlined Word that's used *just* for text and hex files. Like a multi-window Notepad pretty much.<br />
<br />
As far as what you have in your prototype picture there, I think all that is possible. I'd like to see your UI when you're finished. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bordaaf</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am really interested in seeing this one come about<br />
<br />
the spellbook thing would rock</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NijK</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I went through a couple tutorials in XML Spy and made this wierd company thing where it would show employee names addresses and other crap but I'm still a total XML newb, I tried playing around with all the EQ UI stuff and totally ruined all my UIs other than the default hehe. Have a nice tutorial now that actually explains commands and what they do, and why. Going to do it with Notepad like the old HTML days. Day 1 down, back to learning =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">buzweaver</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, that would be awesome. Great for Raid Prep as a Druid. Will getting everyone SOEed, Invised and such a one button to get to a section of Spells would be awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best way to learn XML is to get a small book then read.<br />
<br />
Then, use XML spy to play with it. Get a large XML document, create a DTD from it and learn about the restrictions as you play with the XML doc.<br />
<br />
That's how I've learned. Having to merg 2-3 similar XML files under one DTD file. XML is nice, and DTDs are definatly a must. I'm quite disappointed VI didn't make any DTDs. :(<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: DTDs (Data Type Definition) are basically your definition of the XML file. With a valid DTD document, you can't make an invalid XML document.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NijK</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently reading a free ebook from the net about DTDs, XML, XSL, and I think it later goes into CSS or something else. WIth any luck, I'll have my EQ UI in a month or two roflmao =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NijK</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just trying to figure this out still. If I were able to put group member health gauges with %s into my player window, seperated by a bar or line or something, or text such as &quot;Kath's Posse&quot; in the screenshot - that would leave the group window with the invite and disband buttons right? And those can be removed right? However, because of a child in the group window, you can't completely get rid of it, right? And as for putting the target, pet hp, and casting time underneath the group member hp gauges, you can't completely remove their respective windows can you? Aside from maybe spell casting window. Is that how it works?<br />
<br />
And also, what exactly denotes a child, is any &quot;sub-element&quot; I guess they're called, a child? For instance:<br />
<br />
&lt;element&gt;text or something&lt;/element&gt;<br />
     &lt;whatisthis&gt;who knows&lt;/whatisthis&gt;<br />
     &lt;andthisone&gt;not me&lt;/anthisone&gt;<br />
&lt;element&gt;please help&lt;/element&gt;<br />
<br />
Would &quot;&lt;whatisthis&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;andthisone&gt;&quot; both be considered a &quot;child&quot; of the element &quot;&lt;element&gt;&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;element&gt;text or something&lt;/element&gt;<br />
&lt;whatisthis&gt;who knows&lt;/whatisthis&gt;<br />
&lt;andthisone&gt;not me&lt;/anthisone&gt;<br />
&lt;element&gt;please help&lt;/element&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;element&gt;<br />
  text or something<br />
  &lt;whatisthis&gt;who knows&lt;/whatisthis&gt;<br />
  &lt;andthisone&gt;not me&lt;/anthisone&gt;<br />
  &lt;element&gt;please help&lt;/element&gt;<br />
&lt;/element&gt;<br />
<br />
Now they are child elements.<br />
<br />
As far as your first question, you kind of lost me there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NijK</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks guice, also, do you have to have an end tag for EVERY SINGLE beginning tag with XML, unlike HTML? I think leaving off an end tag is why some of mine wouldn't even save.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every element must have a close. There are some that don't need to, but VI didn't code any this way.<br />
<br />
If an element doesn't need a closing tag, you will see it like: &lt;atag \&gt;<br />
<br />
What does and doesn't need a closing tag is suppose to be defined in a DTD file. VI thought it greasious to exclude these.<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit - doh, I ment Exclude not Include. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NijK</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks again man<br />
*bows*</div></div><hr />
