<br />
I basically was going for a flat and simple UI and have spent only the past 4 days tweaking and adjusting it.  I still need to do the buff bars and spellbook, but otherwise it is almost ready to send in.<br />
<br />
Only problems is when you hold down ALT...well, the spell text overlaps with the way I've set up the spellbar.  Otherwise....  n.n<br />
<br />
1024x768 screenie attached.  (skin for that or better res, 800x600 would cut the top bar)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onetwo1212</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest resizing the player window to the same width as the compass to make a smoother and less bulky look.  The intagrated options window and stats is a nice feature.  T he invintory window does seem a bit bulky.  You may try moving the main and secondary buttons down to their own row then condence the window to take out the unused spaces.  Might I also suggest making the hotbotton window horizontal and make it fill the room on the bottom to the left of the main window.<br />
<br />
Overall I have to say this is a very nice looking mod.  Kutos for your main window; I really like the graphics.  One question..is the green stuff at the top of the main window an error?<br />
<br />
I give this two bananas :nana: :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuakkgom</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fortunatly, compass movable.  :D<br />
<br />
And I'll get the Inventory crunched up as suggested as well as the hotbuttons.<br />
<br />
Now as for the green stuff, you mean the wierd blades or the line between the compass and name in target window?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your review and advice!  Hope to get this fairly well tuned.  (I'm also scared to think how puny this will look in 1600x1200) :cool: <br />
<br />
[Note: I forgot to move the arrows on the spellbook...that fixed. :D]<br />
<br />
Onward!</div></div><hr />

Enjoy the players box at the bottom, <br />
reminds me of an old time roleplaying game setup (ala Final fantasy)..so of course i would enjoy it.<br />
