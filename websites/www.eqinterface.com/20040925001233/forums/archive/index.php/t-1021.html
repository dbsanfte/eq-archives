If so, are there mods that have already been written? <br />

Thank you in advance, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Font size, yes.  Within every EQUI file that has any reference to text, it says &lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt;  .... the 3 indicates the size... it goes off the same sizing as it does when you do /chatfont 3 when you're in the game... so you can figure it from there what size you want.  If you make it larger, you'll usually have to increase the <br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;15&lt;CY&gt;<br />
that comes a little later in the code... just increase it by one or two - this will avoid &quot;clipping&quot; the letters... having half a &quot;g&quot; for instance.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the font itself, as far as I'm aware, EQ determines that.  :(  I wish we could change that.  Maybe some day... /sigh<br />
<br />
<br />
And you can probably find something with a larger / smaller font size... I think a lot of people alter those... but it's done per individual window/screen piece... not an overall thing.<br />

<br />
I tryed to get the font for the main view smaller, but have not found a solution till now.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone can tell where the Fontsize for the /shown text is found.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But no, I don't have a solution.  :(<br />
<br />
It's probably something defined by EQ, tho - just as the graphics for your charater are.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the misunderstanding.  :)<br />
<br />
Gluck!  It certainly would be nice to edit that.<br />
