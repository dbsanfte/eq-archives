<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trewayn</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the bard songs have truly ridiculous graphics.  Selos Song Of Travel has the same icon as the Direct Damage songs, for instance.  I would like to be able to change the graphic for a specific spell or song without having to change the graphic for all spells that use the same default icon.<br />
<br />
So my question is, does anyone know if the graphics are tied to individual spells/songs in one of the XML files and is therefore modifiable, or is it hardcoded into SPDat?  If it's the latter then I guess I am out of luck.</div></div><hr />

They contain the graphics that are displayed for buff icons.  If you know how to load up a tga (graphic) file and edit it..  Go crazy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trewayn</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This would only allow you to change the spell icons for a whole bank of spells though.  What I want to know is can you assign a unique graphic to a spell independent of all other spells that, by default, use that same graphic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
however i am in the process of redesigning the 150 spell icons as it is.<br />
<br />
look for it in a week or so, as i will have several different flavahs to include:<br />
<br />
Old Spell Icon Mod - (use the new UI with the old spell icons)<br />
New/Old Hybrid - (new icons, but with a 10-20 pixel mini-icon of the old version)<br />
<br />
and an entirely new icon set, but this one will need to take some more time as i am still in the process of parsing what spells use what icons across the board so i can determine what the best representation would be for that icon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
but personally, i think that nearly ALL of the new icons are complete trash.<br />
<br />
i mean damn near all of my icons have absolutely ZERO reflection as to what the spell that cast them was.<br />
<br />
My DD-Tap line uses what appears to be a red-annul magic icon, and my Dot-Tap line is identified as a detrimental spell....<br />
<br />
not to mention that summoning a skeleton pet looks all cheery as well... ugh...</div></div><hr />
