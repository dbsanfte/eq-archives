<br />
<br />
also if you patch this in today, you could cause your UI to crash..(but not a guarantee)<br />

<br />
<br />
On another note I made a mistake and missed a file on the three Full version packages. If you have downloaded either of them you'll need to do it again or grab the patch.<br />
<br />
However, the OoW patch was uploaded a few minutes ago and should be solid.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

I was looking for a horizontal buff window and did not see one in your ui. I was wondering if you had plans to make one?<br />
<br />
Also was wondering why the chat boxes cannot be minimized and if that is difficult to add?<br />
<br />
The vertical group is an awesome feature.<br />
<br />
Thanks again <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonekracka</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">- I agree it would be nice to have this option, I'll add it to the 'to do list'.<br />
<br />
- Sars chats are re-sizable only, grab any of the four edges. Sorry, no plans to change this or add min option...<br />
<br />
FYI - Team Sars is on somewhat of a vacation ATM, every member is having fun in at least one, if not more, betas atm. So, any new additions coming to Sars are going to be down the road. Not to mention I need some time to do some graphics for some folks that I promissed awhile back.<br />
<br />
Glad you like the UI and will get to additions ASAP...<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
