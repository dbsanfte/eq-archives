My email program managed to zip the files for me when I submitted them several weeks ago... but that's a different discussion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the two columns are moved any closer to eachother the tooltips will overlap.  If I don't use specially-defined backgrounds and offsets the tooltips on the left half of the second column won't be placed correctly.<br />
<br />
I've thought about ways to shrink it even further.  I can arrange the graphical parts better, but that would just make the text harder to read.  So far this is as good as it gets, unless I make the slots smaller -- 20x20 instead of 40x40 perhaps.</div></div><hr />

But, I believe on the Test server they are working on increasing the merchant's inventory to a total of 80 items.  How would you redesign your mod to accomodate such a change??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hope there is a 80 slot version when the change goes live.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was gonna say... 80 slot merchants on the way.  That's gonna be messy to fit on the screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Three thoughts on the 80-slot merchant window.  First, you should know that merchants can have up to 20 standard items.  Jewelry and alchemy vendors do have that many.  Items after the first twenty are always things players have sold them.<br />
<br />
First thought is to do the same thing but on a bigger scale.  Instead of two double columns 8-high I'd need four double columns 10-high.  Total size 640 by 440 -- or more like 760 by 440 if you leave room for the last column's tooltips.  That's a huge window, but it should be possible with a custom tga file.  Holding down the alt key would fill almost your entire screen with blue-and-white.  But more importantly, if the merchant window takes up the whole screen how will you open up your bags and click on items you want to sell?<br />
<br />
Second thought is to make a tall thin window with four columns of twenty half-sized slots (with a little blank space between the columns).  By half-sized I mean each merchant slot would be 20x20 instead of the standard 40x40.  There would be a scroll bar at the bottom (or perhaps top) of the window to scroll left-to-right.  Since only one column of 20 icons would be visible at a time, there would be only one set of tooltips up at a time.<br />
<br />
Third thought is basically the same thing, except the first 20 are full sized, arranged in the standard 2 by 10 arrangement.  But then the last three columns would be half-sized icons.<br />
<br />
I know what you're thinking... 'I have a fourth thought!'  Just like number three, but all four columns are full size.  Sorry, won't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mischief</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 sounds alright.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">09-03-2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wrong about the tooltips.  They appear on the screen even when the item itself is off the window to the left or right.  Scrolling an item off to the left does not cause the tooltip to go away.  It just appears floating out in space off to the left of the window.  This problem doesn't occur scrolling up and down, so it came as quite a surprise to me.<br />
<br />
I was wrong about bags too -- the merchant window doesn't cover them up.  The merchant window always covers the inventory window, but it never covers the opened bags.<br />
<br />
And finally, I was wrong that the other columns can't be full-sized.  It's actually fairly easy to do several two-wide columns by nesting subwindows in subwindows.<br />
<br />
So I came up with the design pictured here (still in pre-beta).  Note that the 79th and 80th slots are not used on merchants, only on PC traders in the bazaar -- and rarely even then.  And tooltips don't work on those slots.  So the last two slots (where the pointer is in the picture) shouldn't cause any problems.<br />
<br />
This won't work at 640x480.  There simply isn't room for 80 slots in any arrangement at 640x480 without shrinking things a bit.  Maybe I'll do a version with 36x36 icons instead of 40x40, just to make it fit.</div></div><hr />
