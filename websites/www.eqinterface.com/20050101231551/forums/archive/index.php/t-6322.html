Do you actually have custom EQUI_BugReportWnd.xml and custom EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml files?  If not, delete those.  Do you actually have a custom EQUI_CharacterCreate.xml file? Delete it.<br />
<br />
Pet Info, Loot and Selector window errors are all dating back to the patch 9 Jan.  Find the appropriate fixes in this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5314) thread, and apply as explained in the thread.  Also, if you have a custom EQUI_Animations.xml file, you will need to apply the fixes for it as outlined in that thread as well.</div></div><hr />
