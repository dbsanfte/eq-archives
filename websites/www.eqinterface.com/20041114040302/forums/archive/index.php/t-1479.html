Then did away with the border and backround. heck look at the picture hehe. The area around the outside of the window lights up when you press attack. Notice that the original group window is used only for grouping to invite, decline, follow, and disband. I just pull the grouping buttons up as I need them.<br />

Very compact spell gems casting window and spellbook. The book is closed by clicking in the center of it and the pages are turned by clicking on the edges of the book. The scribe and memorize gauges will appear at the bottom of the book when used. The casting timer pops up in between the two rows of spell gems.<br />
