All I can think about are the Austen Powers movies. LOL<br />
Very cool to see this technology developing. Kinda wierd they are showing it off. I would think they would keep that hidden as much as the new area 59.</div></div><hr />

Was most likely on the radio but anyways, it amazes me how they would basically advertise our technology.  I mean I understand how the government is fearful about other countries developing nuclear technology and all that so basically i am guessing that this is our way of saying make it however you want cause we'll still shoot it down? Not sure bout that philosophy.  Whats area 59, this is new to me?</div></div><hr />

First of all, to answer your questions, Dolby was either just including that reference as a joke, or referring to the fact that area 51 isn't really used that much anymore--it's only secured in order to keep the major nutballs out. Why test on a base where people have known about &quot;top secret stuff&quot; going on there for decades? No, shortly after the whole &quot;crash landing&quot; fiasco, and after the sucessful test of the now-decommissioned (or so we think) Blackbird experemental spy aircraft, area 51, or at least its purpose, was moved to another base, I believe in Montana, and since then has been said to have been moved elsewhere, perhaps Ohio. <br />
<br />
As for the lazers, that's just freaking cool. Maybe now we won't pour billions of dollars into a barely-functional &quot;missile defence shield&quot; that tries to incercept missiles with missiles, and instead just arm our coastlines with high powered lazer assault turrets, where once there were submarine watch towers. Of course, then people will try to shoot planes down with them, and then we'll create a shield that deflects the lazer energy, which our enemies will put on *thier* missiles, and the whole system will once again be rendered ineffective, and we will have no choice but to resort to building a massive armada of manned mechanical humanoid robotic fighting machines, or &quot;mobile suits&quot;, which will spark several horrible, bloody wars and as many mangas and spinoffs.:D</div></div><hr />

Montana is fine by me.  One, i don't plan to live there and secondly I don't think there is anything to go there for.<br />

But on the robot thing... that would be the worst possible idea for anyone to come up with.  I know they have discussed something to that affect and i'm sure something has been developed.  If memory serves me correct they have already made little bugs that are remote controlled used for spying and such.  But could you imagine what would be left of the 2 countries at war or for that matter the world if everyone had robots to do there deeds.  That would be like everyone pushing the red button (nuks)</div></div><hr />

To quote Dolby, &quot;sheesh :P&quot;<br />

I was, of course, making an obscure, sardonic, and (I was hoping:rolleyes:) humerous reference to the Gundam series, as my random rambling about the process that might, in a less realistic world, sprout from the sucess of these &quot;lazers&quot; and what is in my opinion the only possible explanation for why *anyone* would invest trillions of dollars into creating a mecha-robot army (when you've got nukes up the wazoo), as occurs in the various iterations of Gundam; that reason being, that with the development of &quot;force shields&quot; the only alternative to projectile combat would be direct-close-range mecha-combat.<br />
<br />
Damn, that was a long sentence.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaherashadowwol</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, I completely understand that fact that is was a joke, but I was just trying to imagine what would be if the science-fiction movies ever came true. :eek:</div></div><hr />
