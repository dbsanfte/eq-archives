<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lerhos</div><div class="date">03-25-2003, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I created a Beastlord UI, pretty much for my own use.  It's designed at 1280X1024, and is a mix of some other UI pieces I found useful, as well as my own personal modifications.  I thought that if it fit for what I was looking for in a beastlord UI, it may fit in what others were looking for.  <br />
<br />
If you like it, download it and give it a shot.  If you don't..well sorry =)  Any feedback is welcome, as well as questions/comments or whatever else really.  Again, I wasn't really designing this to be a generally liked UI, just one for my own use that I thought I would make avaliable to others if they were interested.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lerhos</div><div class="date">03-25-2003, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't had any lag issues so far....<br />
but who knows.<br />
<br />
Why do you think it would have trouble during laggy situations?<br />
(just trying to see if I missed something here).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanys.Neoconker</div><div class="date">03-25-2003, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe.  I meant I would use this when I get lag.  Drakah's UI is a showy UI and a little too much for my computer during raids and such.  This would work good for a raid and or laggy zones such as Dawnshroud and &quot;foresty&quot; zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lerhos</div><div class="date">03-25-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh...gotcha =)<br />
<br />
I actually developed it in Dawnshroud =)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the clarification!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">verit</div><div class="date">03-25-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking great Lerhos...<br />
<br />
Only thing I would add as part of a wish list is a damage window. I use the numbers only type damage window, normally transparent so only the numbers themselves show, I run it down one side or the other of the screen in a very tall and thin window. Its not really needed of course, the UI is great.....just my two cents ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lerhos</div><div class="date">03-25-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe..yeah my friend (who plays a SK) tested the UI for me since I was out of town on business.  I got the same thing from him..he likes to have the numbers up on screen with the action.  I'm probably gonna make a UI for him that's pretty much that.<br />
<br />
Personally though I tend to play most of the game based on what I see in the numbers.  If I don't...then I die a lot.  I can process a lot of info at one time though and sort through it later in my head so I like having all my text gathered togheter in multiple windows at the bottom =)</div></div><hr />
