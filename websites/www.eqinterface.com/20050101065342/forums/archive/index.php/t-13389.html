<br />
I loaded up a UI skin that is cool but couldnt use, (not skins fault), but when i camped the screen for toon selection was absolutely beautiful. I want that to be my default selection screen every time i log in and have to select a toon, how to I make this happen? <br />
When i load up first time, I always get the default drab grey boxes sony has cursed us with, Now i want the nice white bone colored boxes that i saw, but i dont want to use that particular skin....can someone tell me how to make this happen?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

In your eqclient.ini file, there is a line that says UISkin=Default; change it to the name of the new folder.  When you enter, it will show the character select screen by default.  But you'll need to put the same files in your character's UI folder as well, or when you log out it will be back to default.<br />

Now, does anyone have a good Character Creation mod?  Not that a lot of people would, but it'd be nice to complete the set.  =)</div></div><hr />
