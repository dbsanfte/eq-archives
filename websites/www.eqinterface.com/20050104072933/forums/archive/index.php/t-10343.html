I don't like it at all.  Sorry.<br />
There are quit a few little errors in it (ie. strength is spelled wrong) and the graphics need a lot of work.<br />
<br />
Looks like you have some people who do like it though.  Keep working on it !  :D <br />
<br />
BTW, why do you have the text of linux-gamers in your sig pic but it goes to some freaky vamp page?  Is that your site?<br />
<br />
Buh bye!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for at least trying it though... :-)<br />
<br />
what errors did you find aside from the fake Strenght error (it's spelled right in the coding)<br />
<br />
and as for the graphics, I cannot draw so I resort to stealing other modders graphics (with thier approval of course) but I'm working on it :-)<br />
<br />
as for the sig misdirection, I forgot to update the URL tag when I made this new sig, it's updated to the site mentioned.</div></div><hr />

It's really not bad, if you like the minimalist thing...</div></div><hr />

thanks for at least trying it though... :-)<br />
<br />
what errors did you find aside from the fake Strenght error (it's spelled right in the coding)<br />
<br />
Actually I looked in EQUI_buffwindow.xml (I figured that was where the tabbed thingy was you did) and it is spelled incorrect.<br />
&lt;Text&gt;STRENGHT&lt;/Text&gt;<br />
As for other errors, I took a screenshot and annoted the little visual errors but I seem to have deleted it like a dope so I'll just go from memory. If I find the screenshot later I'll post it up if you like.  <br />
When the bars are at 100 in the Health/mana/sta/xp/AA window they bleed over into the edge of the bar graphic.  The panel containing the stat bars itself needs to be made longer by a few pixels to accomodate the 3 digits.<br />
<br />
In the group window, only the top of the invite and disband buttons are visible.  You may have done this on purpose to conserve space, but may I suggest making a graphic or something other than hiding 75% of the button.  It looks bad.<br />
<br />
This is just a person thing.  It has nothing to do with a bug or visual error in Lunix.  I can't stand invisible panels or parts of windows invis.  The inventory is the one that bugged me the most.  But that's just a personal thing.  ;)<br />
<br />
In the Stats tab, I know it's probably not a bug but you should try and move the numbers over more so you can use the full name of the stat (ie. no INTELLIGE words) or simple stick to old D&amp;D abbreviations - STR STA AGI DEX WIS INT CHA  <br />
as I said not a bug but it's the little things that make things look professional, even in beta.<br />
<br />
and as for the graphics, I cannot draw so I resort to stealing other modders graphics (with thier approval of course) but I'm working on it :-)<br />
<br />
I find that if you want things done you have to do them yourself and I'm glad to see you're working on it.  Trust me, I've seen some HORRIBLE graphics for some of the GUI here.  Not everyone is a T.King. I'd offer my help with graphics but I'm not so hot at it myself. But I'll be happy to help if I can. <br />

<br />
LunixBETA1.9 has the gauges fixed<br />
<br />
Lunix_SteppinMod_BETA1.3 is broken though, I&quot;m not sure why but it also has the gauges fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
in the group window the buttons are supposed to be completely gone, but I haven't gotten around to removing them yet.<br />
<br />
in Steppins mod I am going to leave the buttons but I don't know where I am going to put them yet.<br />
<br />
the clear and trasnlucent backgrounds...  well I like them, it's a nice change from the original backgrounds (dead leafs)<br />
<br />
now on the stats, the full name I like because I had the room to do it :-)<br />
<br />
and I am getting better at graphic work, attached is a ZIP with version 2 of my Sword of Sigil</div></div><hr />

I haven't given it a try yet with the newest version but I will.<br />
<br />
Anyway keep up the good work Taleisin!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your support Perkoset_BB, <br />

Inner Thoughts: ahhh, yet another soul joins my army, soon I will destroy the nameless :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
A text preview of BETA1.6(RC0) has been posted on my &quot;All Things Lunix&quot; thread in the released forum...  it calls for a couple of minor changes and another gauge remake, but I want public opinion on the new gauge design before I go ahead with it.<br />
<br />
more later<br />
<br />
/peace</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if I will stay or not even though the poll currently says majority of voters want me to stay..  and if I do I want to thank all who support Lunix and my other various projects<br />

I like the way Lunix is headed, personally, but I'm not a big fan. Prefer my UI over it. Sorrs. =/</div></div><hr />
