<br />
You have to set the slider when you log in.  Then it keeps accurate time until you log out (or switch characters or load a new UI).  Never loses a second, even if you go to Luclin or you're a slow zoner.<br />
<br />
This is a beta version, I expect to make improvements soon.<br />
<br />
I'm no artist so it's not the prettiest, but it does work.  If someone could make a new daynight.bmp file, at either of the shown widths, I'd appreciate it.  Maybe the numbers could be integrated with the picture instead of hanging below.  The width should match one of the scales (15 pixels per hour or 18 pixels per hour), but it can be any height.<br />
<br />
The blue line that's supposed to point to the entrance to an instanced zone doesn't appear on the compass with this mod... does anyone know why?  If I put this mod in any other window it wouldn't be an issue, but I'm still curious.<br />
<br />
The main technology here is placing an animation in a scrollable subwindow.  I believe this technology could be used to make a 'resettable' timer, where you would 'reset' the timer by adjusting the slider.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jethal</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought about trying something like that.. my Nightelf UI has a 1 minute timer which shows sunny clouds transitioning to starlight.. but i couldnt figure a way to make it syncronize with EQ time.. but the timer option would certainly work.. well done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQexplorer</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello -<br />
I loved the timer idea, very cool. Perfect for somewhere like Kith, where the *mood* changes when it gets dark hehe.<br />
You requested a more fitting graphic, so I plowed through some pictures, squeezed them to fit and Photoshopped a transition. I hope you like it - this is the first time I've posted anything here.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice work there Explorer.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very Nice work!<br />
<br />
I moved the graphic over to my Selector window. The UI I am using (based on Kaori UI) has a long compass window with all sorts of stats. So was easier in another window.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">VERY good work.<br />
<br />
Used it since it came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beautiful work !<br />
and as an added bonus, we have proof yet again of the community coming together. One person has idea and codes it, someone else supplies graphic and presto we have a wonderful final product.<br />
Thats 5 bananas !!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQexplorer</div><div class="date">08-01-2004, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow. I'm so pleased my little addition was well-received, and thanks for all the support. I've been downloading stuff from this site for a couple years now, and it feels good to be able to contribute.<br />
<br />
I'm a little verklempt...<br />
<br />
I made a streamlined inventory window recently, as well as a change to the spell-casting bar. I'll post them as soon as I get a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wolja</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any update on getting the LDOn adventure bar working ?<br />
<br />
Otherwise nice compass. Being a high elf who may have played with the gamma I never know if it's day or night  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm really perplexed by the blue line.  I have no idea why it doesn't appear and I have no clues to work with either.  It extends all the way from the top to the bottom of the window when it works, so it's not an issue with window height.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Novawulf</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">got the blue bar to show..  change the Transparency from false to true.  Its the only thing I see different from your compass to any others ...  every thing still shows and with transparency on the bar shows too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Transparency made no difference on my compass.  The blue line remains a mystery.<br />
<br />
In the final version I got rid of the arrow buttons.  Then I tweaked the width a bit and simplified the scrolling to 1-minute increments.  I did that to impose some control on the scrolling... now the hour-marks always line up accurately with the compass pointer.<br />
<br />
It'd be cool if there were other graphics available too.  I can imagine a halloween-themed picture, a xmas theme, and maybe one with the characters from WTF comics (if they could be drawn that small).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you're having problems with the blue line in the compass window, is there a way to incorporate this as part of a seperate &lt;Screen Item&gt; in a different window.  What i'm thinking is, that i have my compass showing through a transparent section of my actions window, i could just add this as a small bar above or below the compass cut out in the actions window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kindidarx</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">very nice work. Using it now =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">09-06-2004, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adding this to other windows should be easy enough, it's all packaged into a single piece (CMPW_PicHolder) which doesn't reference anything specific to the compass window.<br />
<br />
If you change it to a width other than 98 pixels it won't scroll by exactly 5 pixels at a time... but that can be fixed.</div></div><hr />

How would I add this to the bottom of the compass window in jethals UI without losing the leaf border?</div></div><hr />
