<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythal</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have modified most of my UI windows to add a border. <br />
<br />
As the border is thicker than the default one, however, I also had to adjust the size of a few windows -- either in-game, or (for those that are locked) by editing the XML files further.<br />
<br />
There are a few windows, though, which pose some problems. Namely, any window that contains Tabs, or a slider (i.e. Loot window and Options window). Such windows, when left set as Resizable in the XML, can be made taller or shorter -- but cannot be made wider.<br />
<br />
Changing the Width/Height numbers in the XML while leaving the window sizable produces no result, so I ended up having to turn off their Sizable attribute in order for me to change their size manually through the XML.<br />
<br />
Any idea if there is a way to change their size (width, mainly) in-game?<br />
<br />
...Hope this makes sense heh... :)</div></div><hr />
