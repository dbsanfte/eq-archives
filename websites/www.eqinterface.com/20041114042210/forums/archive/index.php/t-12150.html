However, I had to shelve my aspirations due to one small fact: there appears to be no weight info to be had anywhere.  As a monk I can't, quite literally sometimes,  survive without that info.  Once that small oversight is addressed (unless I overlooked it somehow) I'll resume my testing with great eagerness. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Therefore, I'm going to take this time to say that from here out, I do not plan to make any special modifications to this UI for specific people unless I happen to really need to do it.  I apologize but my schedule just doesn't allow it.<br />
<br />
The only exception to this rule is the addition of the color changing hit point bars.  Which I along with a friend are working on (mostly him).<br />
<br />
I will however continue to maintain the UI through patches, bugs, etc.<br />
<br />
So -- sorry :(</div></div><hr />

Mouse near the top of the window and move left.. you can drag it.<br />

It is very nice except I do not have a mana bar at all.  In the screen shot it is on the line with Stanima, XP and AA XP but it is not located on my screen.<br />

Is it missing version 2.3? I simply unzipped the files to my EQ UI directories, added my spell gem icons and copied in the 1200 resolution file.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on getting the mana bar back?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To fix this, i had to grab the status bar from an older version of this UI that was release back in November (I think) It was called something like Delta 2 Patch.  I grabbed this, copied ONLY the status bar from the folder (which was dated the same day as the melee one in Delta2.3, letting me know there no significant changes to it, at least I hoped not).  <br />
<br />
Things work great after copying in the status xml file from the patch folder and reopening EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the most, unless there is a serious problem with your interface, the file should get no more than about 19 - 20kb in size. <br />
<br />
Even on a small hard drive, that's not much space.  And the file doesn't grow under normal circumstsances.  (Note that it will grow like crazy if a graphics file is missing since every time the EQ client tries to draw that graphic on the screen, the client will write a new error to the log.)</div></div><hr />

I thought that was a lame gimick by SOE to take the heat off of one of their nerf swings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a couple things, when I copied the EQUI_SelectorWnd file from the 1280x1024Melee section for my tanks I get a xml error upon loading.  When you don't use this file no errors.<br />
<br />
Also in a previous version there was an attack indicator around the target window.  Was this omitted on purpose?  I personally would like to see it back as I play a lot of the time with out sound it comes in helpful.  If not no biggie.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for a great UI.<br />

I use 1024x768, so I dumped everything from there into the main Delta2.3 file ( with the exception of melee since I'm an sk and need mana bar and I didn't put in grey either.. only because I don't know what it is) I get that retarded xml file error with reg eq files.  I also can't locate the attack indicator. I tried deleting the equi_playerwindow because I saw the equi_playerwindowgood - but when i did that it just fugged things so i had to put it back.  Any suggestions on why I can't see attack indicator?</div></div><hr />

Either that, or just delete your Options Window XML file, since thats the one thats messing things up.  You dont need to have a custom one anymore, and the default one is almost exactly the same as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i play at 1280x1024. only problem i have is the main middle windows with xp/aa xp/endurance/etc won't stretch enough in that resolution to give the look of the ui. its minor but if you could modify the 1280x1024 files to fit that'd be great.<br />
<br />
or if you are back into working on this ui, stick the mp3 player in that gap.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

I love Delta 2.3 and I know there are many other versions of it but this is by far my favourite.<br />
I am praying some kind modder will update this to show the mana and the new aug window</div></div><hr />

I added max mana and current mana to the right next to the compass. I had to change the XML file selector and the tga file containing the ui-interface. Hope this goes to any help. I have not concidered how it looks on a non-mana character. But I guess you can always use the current version if you so like. Add and replace the 2 files.<br />

<br />
Is this UI being updated for OoW?<br />
Of all the delta's this is my favourite and from looking at the others it seems that the only changes required are the 9th spell gem and new buff slots.<br />
I dont know how hard this is as I am a complete numpty at the code. I tried seeing if bits from other UI's would work but to no avail.<br />
<br />
Please can some one have a look at this one as I love it, hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RonsterM</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've updated Delta 2.2 for OoW.  I only updated the 1024 X 768 resolution, Hybrid UI as that is what I use on all of my characters.  My update has the recent mana and endurance numbers added as well as current favor (Tribute Points).<br />
