<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilo</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone updated this file for their UI for gauges?<br />
<br />
I am looking for a window_pieces01.tga which uses four ticks pre bubble vice the five that Sony uses.<br />
<br />
A new one of these was pushed with the LDoN expansion.<br />
<br />
I had a version from someone's UI (I wish I could remember whose) which had the gauges' tick marks counted as four per bubble. Sony's has five ticks per bubble.<br />
<br />
Since a yellow bar = 100 percent, each of the five bubbles = 20 percent.<br />
<br />
In terms of blue bubbles, each blue bar = 20 percent, and each of the five bubbles = 4 percent.<br />
<br />
Therefore each of the four ticks would equal one percent. Very handy when watching exp progress.<br />
<br />
The date on the window_pieces01.tga file I have is 1/24/2003 8:12PM. Would anyone know which UI piece this might be from?<br />
<br />
I had downloaded from Tking, Remilio, Avi, and possibly others. And I have simply lost track of what it was for and who it was from. I am certain it was for the gauges.<br />
<br />
Again, has anyone updated window_pieces01.tga?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance...<br />
<br />
Edit: Thinking it might be from a player info window ... still looking<br />
Edit last: Found it. It came with TKing's Forest Inventory V2 (charm + LOY). I have posted my question on TKing's forums to see if he intends to update his version of window_pieces01.tga<br />
