Let me guess, you copied the default folder first, then overwrote it with your custom files, right?  Please don't do that.  The only files that should be in your custom folder are the files that have actually been customized.  Otherwise you end up in a situation like today, where SOE changes something and your UI no longer works.<br />
<br />
Please back-up your current custom folder.  Then make a new empty folder.  Unzip into it only the custom files of your UI.  Then go into game and load it up.  If it still doesn't work, come back here and post your new UIError.txt log file.</div></div><hr />

I am wondering if you have two installations of Everquest.. I have seen this type of thing once before and the problem was 3 version of EQ.<br />

post back how many folders named UIFiles it finds.</div></div><hr />

well i found 2 folders and have since deleted the extra 1. Still getting the crash &gt;&lt;.  <br />
<br />
well, i would check the path of the EQ file you click to run the game (find out what folder it goes too) make sure you using that UIFiles folder.. if you deleted the wrong one, it will simply patch it back in.<br />
<br />
also what Cairenn said.. post new error text</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldisar</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">uierrors was exactly the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, try doing this.  Go to your eqclient.ini and UI_CharName_ServerName.ini files and change UI to &quot;default&quot;.  That way you can at least log into game.  When you get into game, choose your UI from the /load window.  Log back out again and post your new UIError.txt log file.<br />
<br />
Actually, before you do that (log in that is), right-click on your UIError.txt log file, go to Properties and make sure that it is not set to read-only.  Then go ahead and log in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah ha!  Well, that's a step.  Okay, so you say you got the base UI to work?  Back it up.  Then add one piece.  Check it.  If it works, back up the folder again.  Add the next piece.  Etc.<br />
<br />
When you finally get to the one that doesn't work, note which one it was, and come back to us with the info.<br />
<br />
Long, but looks like it's the only way we are gonna track this one down ...</div></div><hr />

what UI are you using.... the AUTHOR has included the base default file and THAT is prolly part of what is the problem... <br />
<br />
link what UI your using as your base and I bet we find it has the default UI files.<br />
<br />
THAT is why we are seeing such a short error message.</div></div><hr />

one gets through ever so often.. there is one author who INSIST on including everything and Dolby let a few of his go..(he only had 2).. gonna laugh if this is one of the people that are using it, because I had an email debate with him over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, what UI?</div></div><hr />

<br />
SO which UI is it.. we might beable to speed this up for you...(we can weed out the default files from the ones actually changed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldisar</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is no UI found on this site. An old friend of mine did it and i have since kept i up to date and modified it to suite me.</div></div><hr />

It is no UI found on this site. An old friend of mine did it and i have since kept i up to date and modified it to suite me.  <br />
<br />
two suggestions..<br />
<br />
1. weed out the default files.. remove any file you have not made changes too. if you can't remember.. drag it out and keep it handy..just incase<br />
<br />
2. make all the changes Cairenn list in the PATCH forum..<br />
<br />
outside that all I can say is good luck. the downside to using a really old mod, is that there are tooooooooooo many variables for us to track. The mod was prolly made when they *did* require you to copy the default folder first.. but since Sept of 2002 they have not required it and 99% of authors have re-done thier UIs accordingly.<br />
<br />
Good Luck Friend!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ditto what Kudane said.  Let us know how it goes, please?</div></div><hr />

I am having a similar problem as the other poster, every time i try to load my UI the client crashes and that is the error message in my UIERRORS file.  If either of you have any clue as to why it is doing that your help would be greatly appreciated... this is Mavarrien(sp?)'s UI if that helps any, haven't done any modding to it.  Client will not crash when using Carienn's UI or the default UI.</div></div><hr />

I've had this happen to me while trying to test my UI's alot..  some stupid little mistake in the .xml and it crashes the game, but never updates UIErrors.txt to let me know why it crashed..  One suggestion would be to load your UI into SidlWidl to see what error it shows.. It's not always an easily understandable error, but at least it might point you in the right direction..  <br />
<br />
Sometimes it's due to a reference to an object that doesn't exist, or may be caused by an object reference that is duplicated in more than one file..  of course there are alot of &quot;gotchas&quot; with some of the required window pieces now, so it could be one of those, or any number of other little nit-picky things ..  It could also simply be due to a typo.. hehe.. <br />
<br />
If you wanted to send me your customized files I could look at them for you.. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just wondering if anyone has figured out this problem yet, because I'm getting the exact same thing with my new UI I'm building.  I have figured out that the problem is coming from my EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml file.  If I load the skin without that file in the directory, it loads up just fine.  If I load the skin with the file, it will crash me to the desktop.  I can't seem to find anything wrong with the code, but I'm going to attach a zip with the PlayerWindow.xml and the 2 tga files that are used by it...could someone please check them out for me.<br />

The following is my UIErrors.txt file after loading the new UI (when it crashes):<br />

If your UI causes EQ to crash to desktop, or lock up the computer (as mine has done) EQ will not record the problem in the errors log.  I can't say I am happy about this.  I really liked having the log to help with bugs even if it did reload the default UI.<br />

Try removing the extra &gt; from line 527.<br />

In your file ie reads :<br />

I have not tested this in game, just noticed it looking at your code.<br />

O.k.  I just tried loading it in game and it still crashed.  Guess that didn't do it.  8)</div></div><hr />

I do not know where the error was.  So please check this version against the original that you have.<br />

I took the liberty to do some alignments.<br />
Also, the attack indicator did not line up so I made a new tga for it.<br />

Good looking mod.  8)</div></div><hr />

THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!  I haven't had time to compare the files yet to see what is wrong with my original, but yours works just as intended.  Thanks for the compliment too.  I'm trying to make an interface that goes across the bottom and up the right side of the screen at 1600 x 1200 (currently for melee then caster later).  Thanks again for your help. :D</div></div><hr />
