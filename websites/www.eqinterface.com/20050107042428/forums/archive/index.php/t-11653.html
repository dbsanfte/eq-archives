<br />
he is doing King Kong now (or very soon to now) and then I expect we will see him turn his attention to the Hobbit.</div></div><hr />

I have the 2 DVD (extended versions - Which I must add is a major plus. I love the additional footage added to the movie!) and have watched them both back to back prior to the release of the third movie and am dramatically awaiting the time to go to the viewing as soon as the wife has the available time to see it.<br />
<br />
Yes most definately go see it (if you can't sit in the theater for the first two - rent them and view them at home).<br />
<br />
I hope he gets the rights to do The Hobbit..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw a 12:01 am showing as well.... loved it.   Only thing I didn't like is that some of the battle scenes were a bit confusing.<br />
<br />
Some of the things I did like (spoiler ahead):<br />
<br />
When the Beacon of Gondor was lit, how they showed the relay system of watchfires being lit was great.  Very good camera work on that.<br />
<br />
I loved the way they showed the effects of the catapults when the armies of Mordor and Minas Tirith first started going at each other.  Once again, great camerawork... although a bit unrealistic.<br />
<br />
The way the mounts of the Nazgul picked victims up off the ground and flung them through the air and dropped them was great.<br />
<br />
Really liked what Peter Jackson did with the oliphaunts... although it wasn't true to the books.  Watching them in battle mowing down the forces of Rohan like a lawnmower was great.  The way Eowyn took one down by hamstringing the Oliphaunt was nice.  Really, REALLY loved the way Legoloas took one down.  My favorite line from the movie was right after that when Gimli said &quot;That still only counts as one&quot;.<br />
<br />
There was one thing that Peter Jackson put in the movie that wasn't in the books that really surprised me.  It was when Frodo was standing in Mount Doom at the edge of the pit, and was about to throw the ring in.  In the books, he turned to Sam and said, &quot;No.  I think I'll keep this for myself&quot; (Not exact quote, but close enough).  But in the movie, I couldn't believe what happened at this point:<br />
<br />
The Eye of Sauron turned it's gaze upon Frodo, and finally we finally hear Sauron's voice say the most unbelievable thing... &quot;Frodo... I am your Father&quot;.....:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too bad that last one is a total lie =(<br />
<br />
<br />
And he said &quot;The ring is mine.&quot; to Sam. <br />
<br />
<br />
Best part?<br />
<br />
WIZARD WHOOP-ASS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullear</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imagine if Wizards in EQ were more like Gandalf?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know after seeing ROTK I think Gandalf has the title wizard but is really more of a paladin....<br />
<br />
He melee's, breaks curse's and has spook the undead...<br />
<br />
<br />
Not trying to start an argument just noticing the similarities with the powers Gandlaf exhibits and the tradition powers of Paladins hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bik, I agree he has extra abilities.. he actually doesnt fit into a EQ Class.. since WIZARD is his race...<br />
<br />
Think of it this way<br />
<br />
Race Wizard<br />
Class Paladin<br />
<br />
Gives him access to Melee, Arcane, and Some Divine spells..<br />
<br />
he was dual-wielding, casting spells, and had one helluva summoned Mount (Shadowfax was summoned to him.. hehehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starshelle</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I figured he must have picked up Shadowfax when his guild raided Emperor Seru. ;) But I think your explanation makes more sense!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things I noticed the 2nd time that were missing (based on Preview or TV )<br />
<br />
<br />
PREVIEW MISSES<br />
Merry telling Pippin &quot;We will see the Shire again&quot;<br />
<br />
Gandolf and Merry riding shadowfax up in Minas Tirith and coming face to face with the Witch King.<br />
<br />
Elron telling Arwen &quot;you gave away your life's grace... I can not protect you&quot;.. <br />
<br />
Eothain sitting on the battle ground holding someone and crying<br />
<br />
Aragor finding someone or something and kneeling to retrieve it.<br />
<br />
Merrying being knighted/squired by Theodin.<br />
<br />
<br />
FROM TV<br />
Aragorn fighting the big ugly Ork (the leader ork)<br />
<br />
FROM MOVIE<br />
Merry stabs the witch king and falls down, but when pippin finds him, he has an ork laying on him.<br />
<br />
Where did aragorn get the torch he was carrying in the path of the dead.. Brego ran off with all his equipment.<br />
<br />
<br />
All I can say is, I can't WAIT for the Directors Cut on DVD, its gonna end up over 4 hours I can tell already.</div></div><hr />

I could not believe Jackson was able to get so many elements from the book into the movie. I kept thinking, there's no way he will be able to end this in 3  1/2 hours and piece after piece just fell into place.<br />
<br />
As with the first 2 parts, there are minor modifacations from the book, but DAMN... Jackson portrayed nearly, very close to perfectly what I envisioned when I read the books in 3rd and 4th grade (geez, almost 30 years ago, I'm getting old). It  is the main deterrant to seeing a movie based on books I love, having to sit through what OTHER people think things should look like. But not with these. And the extended versions.. I was not as taken with the Two Towers in the theater, but from the opening scene on the DVD I was enchanted. And who could have thought Fellowship could get any better? Return of the King was just epic, probably the most majestic film I've had the pleasure to see. Can't wait for the extended version.<br />
<br />
Way to go Peter Jackson, and all that were involved. Anyone else wanna take a vacation to New Zealand now?<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, the signal fires... pure magic, brought tears to my eyes.</div></div><hr />

Glad you mentioned the lighting of the beacons.  Brought tears to my eyes also.  For a min I thought I was getting goofy or something when I told others about that being one of my favorite parts.<br />
