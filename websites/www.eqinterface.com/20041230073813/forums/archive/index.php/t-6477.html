For now there seems to be a definate bug with the left edge of the screen. Please try not to place your windows off the left edge of the screen or else, they'll get eaten up if you zone, or when you toggle through them. You may have to type /loadskin default within the chat window to get those windows to come back. There should be another patch to fix the problem. Yes, another patch. I apologize for the inconvenience all. Again, thanks for all your patience. <br />

Solution that Worked for Me!<br />
<br />
1. Opened My UI_Kudane_91.ini File<br />
<br />
2. Found &quot;[CastingWindow]&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Changed THIS:<br />
XPos1280x1024=-485952<br />
YPos1280x1024=27<br />
TO:<br />
XPos1280x1024=3<br />
YPos1280x1024=27<br />
<br />
The first number &quot;X&quot; is how far in from the left, the second &quot;Y&quot; is how far down from the top, as you can see, the bug moved my casting window to some where just outside Tulsa Oklahoma. This did fix it though.<br />
<br />
As of 2/7/03 its been reported that no more windows should be moving, but any that have moved will need to be manually reset using one of the two methods shown above<br />

I haven't been able to login and have a question... <br />
<br />
WTH Does this mean:<br />
Windows should be fine now?<br />
<br />
Are the windows still moving around?  <br />
<br />
I understand that if a window or 2 moved off screen they will need to be moved back manually..  But did they get it fixed to where it won't move off screen again?</div></div><hr />
