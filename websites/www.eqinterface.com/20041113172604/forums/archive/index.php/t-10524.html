<br />
my reasons for pushing it back are simple... I have 4 I am ready to post, however since PNG pictures cannot be compressed by means I have found the resulting zipfile is 1.22Mbs large, not much smaller than the full version of the patcher.<br />
<br />
so untill I find a good compressor (other than .zip .rar .GZIP .wiz) the first expansion is delayed...  however as I satated above you do get a preview of the first two backgrounds.<br />
<br />
 |||||||||||||||||| More News |||||||||||||||||| <br />

though I have had many requests for it, there will be no GU arted Patchers ( at least not offical ones from me )<br />

<br />
If you can't compress it it means the file is internally compressed and at best you'll probably manage to shrink it by 1% (notice that some files in your zip do compress a little). That's why zipping MP3s is pretty pointless. Anyway, can't you just tell people to copy over the whole default folder and add your main-bg.png file into it?<br />
<br />
Also, why the crud do you include main-bg.png_delta.gz in your zip? It's 355 KB and a temporary file that the patcher downloads for a new graphic. I don't even know how you grabbed the whole file before the patcher deleted it, but there's no way a dev told you to include that file unmodified, it's not even important.<br />
<br />
I DO like what you're doing, the patcher skins are great and I'm glad someone figured it out (the &lt;skin&gt;foldername&lt;/skin&gt; thing) but I think you're crazy. How you get so much attention is beyond me.<br />
<br />
The REAL Haliken<br />
<br />
P.S. - Enok will be back in like a week, he doesn't have his computer with him yet. He says sorry to anyone he promised to do stuff for but he'll be back asap. Also, I remember Enok had a patcher skin but I know he didn't use &lt;skin&gt;blah&lt;/skin&gt; to load it. I think he made a copy of the patcher and hex edited it to load a skin from a different folder and disrupted the skin patching process. Boy did he do that the hard way...</div></div><hr />

<br />
and if you want to get a devs attention go to the test server and talk to one...  they didn't tell me to include it, they just told me not to modify it.<br />
<br />
if you are the REAL Haliken,  then who is Enok?<br />

yeah I tryed it that way too, but the &lt;skin&gt;WTFPatcher&lt;/skin&gt; seemed a bit easier.<br />
<br />
|||||||||||||||||| More News ||||||||||||||||||<br />
<br />
I've updated the patcher (full download) to version 2, it's a little smaller and some of the buttons have been cleaned a little, I do have plans for a total remake of the patcher, but that will be at a much later date.  <br />
   The preview you will now see when you click on it's picture in the file info page, will show you the visual readme (this also helped make the download smaller since I didn't include it in the zip), I've linked the preview to the first pic in this post.<br />
   On to more stuff.  I am going to go ahead and upload the first two pics of my expansion, since Haliken (or is it Enok now) was right and you can't compress the PNG format much past where it is now.<br />
<br />
*Note*  there is no need to download the second version of the patcher if you downloaded the first.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking you might have extracted the files into <br />

if you are useing one of the skins from the expansion pack you must removed the (nameofskin) from the front of the file...  I put them there so that I could put more than one file in each expansion</div></div><hr />

I would know if what happens to me is normal, or as intended, or not.<br />
I install first WTFPatcher II, and works correctly.<br />
Then i saw the new ones by Zone, and download one of them.<br />
I install it and start, and to my surprise, ocurred two issues:<br />
<br />
1- minor one: the patcher (ver. 1.1.6), pop up a window asking to buy LDoN expansion set. I already has purchased and installed, so this was my first surprise. And to more surprises on that, this window pop up ever, also if i check on prompatstart button. Is this normal? how can i fix that?<br />
<br />
2- second and more important, when patcher scan is ended, the PLAY button is not enabled, and my only way to play is checkin on the AUTOPLAY box, in other way is not possible to enter play. any suggestions on that?<br />
<br />
Please, explain me possible solutions as clear as u can, cause my bad english and noone knowledge on &quot;mods&quot; files.<br />
<br />
thx u a lot!.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. copy the main-bg.png from zones zip into the WTFPatcher folder it will overwrite the WTFcomic skin but it will work for you.<br />
<br />
2. follow step by step instructions on how to create a custom folder which can be found HERE (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11218)</div></div><hr />

<br />
:EDIT:  infact yes you MUST make a new copy of the default folder, the old one doesn't allow you to download GoD without switching back to the default patcher.</div></div><hr />

The Thumbs.db file is used by Windows to hold the thumbnail image for your folder on your computer.  <br />
By default it is a hidden system file, but you must have changed your Folder View settings to make them visible.  I keep mine hidden just for this reason, I figure if I do need to find or change a system file I know what I am looking for and can use the command prompt to get to it.<br />
Removing that file drops the zip size form 854k to 612k.</div></div><hr />

overwrites the files?  are you sure you aren't unziping the patcher skin you want to use into the default folder?<br />
full tutorial (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11218) <br />
It is overwriting my eqp_config.xml file.  Dreamweaver updates it automatically whenever its changed externally.<br />
Yes, it is in dir /Everquest/Skins/Bellsix/<br />
The images are in the the folder /images/ in the above dir<br />
The .xml file is /Everquest/Skins/Bellsix/Bellsix.xml<br />
In the eqp_config.xml I have the following:<br />
<br />
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br />
&lt;EQPatchConfig&gt;<br />
&lt;skin&gt;Bellsix&lt;/skin&gt;<br />

<br />
try making the entire name lower caps<br />
<br />
Folder &gt; \Everquest\SKins\bellsix<br />
imagesXML &gt; \Everquest\Skins\bellsix\bellsix.xml<br />
Skins Tag &gt; &lt;skin&gt;bellsix&lt;/skin&gt;<br />
<br />
also you might want to check the name of the modded background you want to use (if you have changed the XML that is related to the images file the skin will not load)<br />
*IE the background MUST be called main-bg.png</div></div><hr />

~question~ what is dreamweaver? <br />
<br />
Only the best WYSIWYG editor/Site management package available.  Made by Macromedia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bah best editor is a simple text editor...   Serizial <br />
 <br />
 ~ try adding that line useing notepad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serizial</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have the bg named main-bg.png<br />
<br />
Have done the lower case... not the problem.<br />
<br />
Aha!  I had Dreamweaver set to a different encoding!<br />
<br />
Well that solves my problem. :)  I need to set it back to standard, instead of unicode.<br />
<br />
And I use dreamweaver for all web based/layout based files, because it understands almost all of the languages used, and colors and assorts them accordingly.  MX especially.  Best of the pack, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neori</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something I was wondering about after picking up the Patcher M-EX5 (which I love).<br />
<br />
Is it possible to modify the main-bg file to use some of the nice art from previous EQ expansions?  The GoD art just isn't as good in my opinion, especially compared to some of the top-notch artwork from well known artists on the original and Kunark boxes.  I'd love to alter my patcher to bring back memories of old EQ, or back to days of Velious.  I know the current format of the patcher hasn't been around in all those older expansions, but I'd love to see what it could have looked like, had they used it back then.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm thats a idea...  I might release something similar soon :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I added two skins today<br />
<br />
well one skin and one kit<br />
<br />
the skin is a LoTR spoof I couldn't resist<br />
<br />
and the kit (which is still in moderation) is a background kit that moves the download/play button away from the artwork.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!!</div></div><hr />

If you look at the attached picture, you will see that I am using a custom skin, but that in the text box still shows the original graphic.<br />

Can this be edited?  If so, how?<br />

Those are not in my images folder or my main EQ directory.  Where might they be located?</div></div><hr />

~edit~ sorry mort, looks like the popupbackground is part of the EverQuest.exe  I can make it use the custom background but I am not going to post a cracked version of the everquest.exe</div></div><hr />
