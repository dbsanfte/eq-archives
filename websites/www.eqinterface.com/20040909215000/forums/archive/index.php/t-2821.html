**Version 2.1 is now out. It is compatable with the 01/10 patch** (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=927)<br />
<br />
 Just released v.2 of my Necro Spectre Pet Info box!<br />
<br />
Things that are better:<br />
<br />
Lined up a couple graphics and darkened the spec's shroud a bit.<br />
<br />
Took out that treehugging bubblebar and made the scythe into the HP meter. This allowed me to overlay the pet's name on top of it, as well I have also added in the pet's HP percent in front of his name.<br />
<br />
With the scythe as the HP bar, it allows you to tell at a quick glance whether your pet is still alive or not. Before, only the spec's eyes would light up to indicate life in your little undead buddy.<br />
<br />
View the screenshot HERE! (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=362) <br />
<br />
Go to misc. section to download it, or just click HERE. (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/download.php?id=362) <br />
<br />
Hope you like it!<br />
<br />
Forgot to mention: You click the eyes as the pet get lost (hence: RIP on his forehead). I did this so I could use the button to light his eyes up, have a smaller button to avoid accidental clicks, and you would know when the eyes glow brighter that you are about to kill your little boner. PLEASE! THINK OF THE PETS!!!**Version 2.1 is now out. It is compatable with the 01/10 patch** (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=927)</div></div><hr />

The spellbar is still in the works, so if you find it and try it, let me know what you like or dislike plz  :D</div></div><hr />

I really like the separation of the attack and follow commands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bump... so people know... been getting alot of messages about getting this updated to the patch. Fortunately, I didn't have to fix it for the last patch that changed the code. This still worked fine with the 01/10 patch, just came up with a message saying some of the files weren't compatable and may not work properly.</div></div><hr />
