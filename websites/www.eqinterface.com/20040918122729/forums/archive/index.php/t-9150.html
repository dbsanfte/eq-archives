<br />
As a Wizard, I spend much of my time staring at the Target's health and my casting gauge, so I created this so I would have something enjoyable to look at.  <br />
<br />
It may be a bit too animated for some, but it is also very functional.<br />
<br />
The orb in the center of the graphic changes color from Green to Yellow to Orange to a Pulsating Red as the target's health diminishes.  In the center of this orb is a numeric display of the target's health, expressed as a percentage.<br />
<br />
Two bar gauges are located at the bottom of the graphic.  The top most is another gauge for the target's health, and the lower one monitors spell casting time.  The bar that diminishes from right to left is an animated bar that looks like electrical energy.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
