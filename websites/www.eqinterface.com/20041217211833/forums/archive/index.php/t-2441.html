I've found sites scattered through the forums, but i thought might as well make it easy for people (mainly me;) ) . If you have a site, post it here!<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. Whats the diff. between GUI and UI, if any?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There really isnt that many sites out there. <br />
<br />
We host uibuilder http://uibuilder.eqinterface.com where you can make your own custom vert skin.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqskins.com although not really a site ment to download UI skins also has a downloads section now.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqmods.com is up too.<br />
<br />
Those are the really only dedicated ones I know about other then us. We have all the same skins they have because I think all the skin authors know about us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrik</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Thanks Dolby. It was a good idea i think. I guess my winter break project this year will be to try to figure out all this XML stuff (can't wait til those FAQS are up:D ), got 2 weeks this year:nana: so I should be able to figure it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started my skinning habit posting on EQSkins.com... then I found EQInterface and have only been posting here since. I get alot more hits here, and it is an overall better community. Dolby and Kudane (and Kelric) are very hospitable, and do a good job of keeping up with things, even while they are switching servers!<br />
<br />
There are some people who host their own UI mods, but most of them come here to post about them and alot of them end up uploading here anyways. Just look up EQ UI or EQ User Interface in a search engine and you should come across any strays that haven't made it to this site.</div></div><hr />
