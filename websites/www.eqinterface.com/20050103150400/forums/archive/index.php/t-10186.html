RE: The Term “DKP”<br />
<br />
Starting today the term “Dragon Kill Points” or “DKP” will no longer be used. The dragons are upset that we are rating other mobs we kill as dragons. So, in a long conference with the dragons a new term was agreed upon. Below are the agreements made between NUL 1187 and the Dragons. <br />
[list=1]<br />
 Instead of “DKP” the term “Standard Treasure Denominator” or “STD” will now be used for the points earned.<br />
<br />
 Monsters Dying will now be called “Going Down”<br />
<br />
 Since they have added “instances” of mobs and there is more than one of the same mob for guilds. When you take on a monster in a fight, the term is now called “getting some”. This means that after you get some, you will have definitely gotten STDs. <br />
<br />
 When a monster goes down, the acceptable items to shout are “Oh God, you animal!”, “Sweet Jesus!” , or a simple “Yes!!” can be shouted to the zone. You may even mix them up as the mob gets close to going down, for example “Yes, sweet Jesus, Yes!, Oh God you animal! Yes!! would work just fine<br />
<br />
 Its not recommended that real life husbands and wife try to get some without the other. Eventually one of them will have a massed quite a few STDs and the other will be upset. For this we have established the next rule<br />
<br />
 STDs are transferable; some people don’t want to believe this. But, Husbands and Wives have discovered that if they get some without the other, that when they get back together the person missing will in fact have gotten STDs<br />
<br />
 STDs don’t wear off, go away, or expire. This can be a pain for those who don’t like the amount of STDs they have.<br />
<br />
 It is not recommend that player characters go down on a mob, though some guilds are noticing a rise in STDs when players go down on a mob. And this seems to add to the STDs they get from getting some.<br />
<br />
 When trying out a new guild, its recommended you get some often and have as many mobs go down on you as possible. Most guilds have it established that applicants will not get STDs no matter how many mobs go down on them.<br />
<br />
 It is also not recommended that you tell a new guild that you have STDs from a former adventure; they tend to frown on this. They also seem to be afraid that you will try and share your STDs with current members.<br />
[/list=1]<br />
Thank you very much. I am sure you will enjoy these changes. And we will see many of you in our newly discovered dungeons getting some soon!<br />
