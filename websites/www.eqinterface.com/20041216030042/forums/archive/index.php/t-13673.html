<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arakonn</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings all, fellow brothers and sisters!<br />
<br />
On my quest for a nice, customizable and easy to use interface for my Paladin (I am very dedicated to this profession) I saw that there is not one in existence I would like to use. I was looking for a nice theme, easy to use, and the closest I came to was the T.King UIs, which are beautifull and efficient at the same time.<br />
<br />
I started building my own, and I am quite pleased with it (though there is always room for improvement). I will post the link to it right when the moderators at eqinterfaces.com have approved it, but in the meantime I wanted to let you all know that there is one on it's way ;) <br />
<br />
Here is a small teaser, the screenshot of the Holy Crusader 1.1 UI:<br />
<br />
http://www.nova-militia.com/EQ/PaladinUI.jpg <br />
<br />
Comments are always welcome, hope you like it. There are a lot of credits to different people included in the readme, as I took much from T.King and others and just modified it, as well as some on my own. Credit to whom credit is due.<br />
<br />
Will keep you informed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arakonn</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the approval went fast, here is the link:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbernor</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok...so I have been checking out the different UI's here and none of them seemed to fit quite right for my Paladin....when I come across this one.<br />
<br />
My verdict: Awsome!<br />
<br />
I would like to say thanks for putting this UI together, from the moment I loaded it, everything clicked. <br />
<br />
So I tip my hat, and offer a hearty Thank you for your work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fragment</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow for the lack of hybrid UI's out there you did one hell of a job Thumbs up to you my friend. Keep it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arakonn</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well thank you all for your kind comments. Very well appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">reaper304</div><div class="date">06-19-2004, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice UI btw, DLed it, and ran the remmy.exe like u said to, but got an errer about MSCOMCTL.OCX not being a registered file or something like that, anyone else get this and how can i fix it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arakonn</div><div class="date">06-19-2004, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm, never encountered this problem myself. Looks like you have an old OCX-file on your computer. Try updating windows (Extras-&gt;Windows Update in your Internet Explorer). This should fix it, else let me know and I will see what I can find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">reaper304</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/smacks self upside the head several times<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume that the class animation in question is one created by Thomas King.  If so, you need to have the Microsoft .Net framework installed on your computer.  If you use the Windows Update function from your Start Menu, .Net framework should be listed as one of the optional upgrades for your system.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
If you still have trouble installing this class animation, go here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pukan</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love this new UI  :)  Really gives a good feel to the Paladin class the only problem I have ran into is that the Character info window always says &quot;Player&quot; &amp; not my character name, but heck to me that is very minor!  This is a great UI &amp; i would recomend it to anyone!!!  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gladrael</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very Nice UI....Thanks!!<br />
<br />
I am having a couple problems that have already been mentioned....Can't &quot;Patch&quot; as it is greyed out and I am also known as &quot;Player&quot;  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Any Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowswolf</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I updated the frames stuff with windows update, restarted etc but still has patch button grayed out. Ill keep monitoring this post to see if there is a good solution posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arakonn</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry that I did not answer earlier, was very busy in RL.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the new version, 1.2, has been uploaded. It holds the following changes:<br />
<br />
**** UPDATE TO 1.2 ****<br />
<br />
History:<br />
2004/07/16<br />
Changed the EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml to display numerical mana in the player window. I left it out of the inventory screen because of no available space, and it is of more use in the player window I guess.<br />
Be advised: some of you asked me how to remove the mouse pointer from the UI, and I sent them instructions. The updated version has this pointer, again, so if you want to remove it send me a mail, and I will send you the files to exchange them.<br />
<br />
*********************<br />
<br />
Concerning the patch-problem with Remmy: If you already used it in another UI, you cannot run it again (that's why it is greyed out). As it only changes the rate of animations in the EQUI_Animations.xml, you can run the UI without any problems even when not patched (only the class animation of the Paladin helmet looks weird if you never used Remmy).<br />
<br />
Concerning the title &quot;Player&quot; in the window, I will look into it and fix it asap.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for your comments, very well appreciated *bows*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xylan Trueheart</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for doing a great job on this UI. Fits my paladin quite nicely. One slight problem tho. The nurmerical mana is shifted to the far right on the mana bar so much so the last number almost goes off the edge. Is it me or can it be fixed to be centered on the mana bar? Also are there any plans on doing a numerical endurance as well? Great job nonetheless.<br />

<br />
Concerning the shifted mana display, strange. I had this problem too, then corrected the coordinates for it, and uploaded it. So it should have been fixed...will look into it.<br />
<br />
As for endurance, yes, will definitely build it into the UI. No eta atm, but asap ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xylan Trueheart</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you much for the effort. And as a tangent I found an old Bikther file on my computer that has class animations and had several class epic cursors. I located it here Bikther Class Mod (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=2518) In this file was a animated Paladin sword. The only thing is I got the not authorized to access this file message even though I am logged in and all. Thought this would help those who like a epic cursor.<br />

<br />
My girlfriend uses this UI for her pally.. in fact we both use it, great UI thank you !<br />
<br />
Am just having problems with the mp3 player seemingly not appearing on the screen when I try and use alt-k to bring it up<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas please for a fix?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharian15</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the hard work on this Arakonn. My one major request is to some how make the buttons stand out more when they are unavailable and suppose to be indented. Its very hard for me to tell when something like Lay on Hands or Hand of Piety is not availble by looking at the buttons.  If you can even point me in the direction of where that data is and how to tweak it myself I would greatly appreasiate it. Once again keep up the great work and I thank you for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arakonn</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Tharian15: I answered your message, check your mails. Sorry for the delay.<br />
<br />
@all others:<br />
Apologies for not coming back to you earlier, but RL got me in it's grip...anyway, new version on it's way, may be even today or tomorrow. Many fixes in it (most of what you folks complained about), as well as...<br />
- compatability with OoW (spell bar enhanced, buff bar enhanced)<br />
- numerical display of mana and endurance<br />
- Player name displayed in char info window<br />
- and much more...<br />
Hope you are all well, will keep you informed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arakonn</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As mentioned before, it is not necessary to use Remmy in order to be able to use this UI. There are some problems existing with Remmy, some people not being able to click the button though they have never used it before. If a solution to this problem arises, I will post it here. In the meanwhile you may use the UI, only disadvantages is the class animation not being shown. All other functions work fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinag</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok thanks Arakonn was jsut trying to get i all to work after reading thru muliple threads. But this is an awesome UI keep it up</div></div><hr />
