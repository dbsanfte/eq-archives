<br />
For example, the combobox drop-down showed up but was actually behind the listbox and once the listbox was populated, both became unreadable due to transpareny overlay.  By ensuring the combobox was drawn last, it ended up on top of the listbox and did not generate any transparency.  The weird part was that even when there was transparency, the control retained focus.<br />
<br />
Don't get hung up on how this sounds, just know that switching the order of the &lt;piece&gt;&lt;/piece&gt; can sometimes solve transprancy issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ doesn't understand the concept of Z-Indexes. So it will place them one by one, with the first one first, next one, on top and down the line.<br />
<br />
It affects all &lt;Pieces&gt; elements in game. You can create nice effects in places, if you play with it a bit.</div></div><hr />
