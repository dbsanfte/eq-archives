<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylverpaw</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tonight I counted 7 mods using my leaf texture and 4 using my blue and silver compass with no mention of credit to me at all.  I've given up on sending emails but just like everyone else, I want my name to go along with my work, too!  Even for such a little part, at least a little credit is due.<br />
To see the compass, go to the Compass section and look for Sylver's compass.  You can also see the leaf texture in one of the first and oldest skins on this site in complete sets, Sylverpaw's Druid skin.  <br />
A little credit please, that's all.</div></div><hr />

Go ahead, laugh all ya want, but if someone spent the time to create something you like the least you can do is put their name somewhere in your mod.  Show some class.</div></div><hr />

Either way, though, while I agree that in principle, rational individuals should give you credit if they use your work, there is only one 'sure-fire' method to make sure none of your work is used without mention of its creator... and that is to not post it at all.

Of course, as there is several different definitions of the word &quot;credit&quot;, the way the title is written is still correct.  Credit in the monitary sense wouldn't make much sense here on eqgui.com, however credit in the &quot;mention my name as the creator&quot; does.<br />
<br />
My reply above was mainly supposed to be a &quot;Well, DUH!&quot; response, not something against the original poster, just that I sometimes am baffled by how people think.</div></div><hr />

Of course... he meant 'credit' abstractly, not literally... thats why the 'literally' at the end of the title doesn't fit... he doesn't mean it monetarily.</div></div><hr />

He did not in fact mean it in the abstract, he did mean it literally, and correctly titled the post as such.  He is asking for the credit due to him as the originator of the mods under discussion, literally.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
That would seem to show that the original source for 'credit' in language was 'something entrusted to another'. Meaning that the original usage of 'credit' would have been how he used it, as opposed to how I (wrongly) interpreted it. Meaning that my usage would have, at one point, been abstract and later (present day) became literal.<br />
<br />
Interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, unless he's second rate, I doubt he is any of us.</div></div><hr />
