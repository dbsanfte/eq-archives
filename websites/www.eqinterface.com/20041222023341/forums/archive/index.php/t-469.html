My particular problem is the exp gauge.  On the default Inventory window it is 116pixels (are measurments in pixels?) wide.  I created the gauge on my screen with a width of 80.  Now only the first 3/4 of the gauge is shown.<br />

So what your getting is just the first 80 pixels of the gauge.  To get a gauge that is 80 pixels wide you'd need to create an image of a gauge that size.</div></div><hr />

I assume this means that any element that uses a graphic will have the same problem ie inventory slots must be 40,40.  I've never used TGA files before so I don't really understand them.  I assume they as a collection of idemtically sized images grouped into a TGA file with a header that indicates the position of each image.  For now I am happy just moving things around.<br />
