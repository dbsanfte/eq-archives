<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be nice to have a few maybe 6 EQ Types to identify inventory slots we can drag and drop items to from the main inventory like the hot key box does only definable in any window. This would be a god send for modders as it would make it eaiser for the end user to change any clickable items that are currently coded into the window.<br />
<br />
The inventory boxes do not need to be assigned a hot key for actuation just be able to drop any new inventory slot there so one can change a clickable without exiting game editing thier XML then reloading thier UI.<br />
<br />
This would be a great help to modders who could make a change like this in minutes literally (a few annoying minutes) but an insane help to non modders who just download a UI and use it as coded and may or may not know how to change the XML. <br />
<br />
Drag and drop! Tell SOE you want it!<br />
