<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlakGard</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a fan of Paint Shop Pro (PSP), also. I started using PSP years ago, when I couldn't take the bugs in PhotoShop any longer. This was back in the &quot;darkages&quot; of PSP (version 1.0), and at the time, I still used PhotoShop for the more advanced features. However, with each subsequent version, I started using PSP more and more. These days, I find that PSP can do nearly everything PhotoShop can do, and it can generally do it easier. I still use both, but PhotoShop comes in a distant second.<br />
<br />
For all that it can do, the price tag on PSP can't be beat, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, a spelling, grammar and overall style overhaul, because I'm an ass:<br />
<br />
What is the the graphics program any of you prefer to use? I have Paint Shop Pro 7 and Adobe Photoshop 6.01. I prefer the former, because I first learned to use PSP 4 and thus I am accustomed to its features. What do you think?<br />
<br />
But that's alright, because not everyone has typing classes or 3 minutes to spend or 5th grade English.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, since this is actually a decent thread topic, I prefer to use PSP as well, mainly because it's free, and the only one I have besides MSPaint, which quite frankly sucks donkey anatomy. I have version 5, which came with a printer I bought a few years back and i'm too poor/lazy/cheap to upgrade it. It works well enough for me, although I'd use Photoshop if I had it, and I'm sure a bunch of people would swear by Photoshop since it's the &quot;more powerful&quot; of the programs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chadoz</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, so my spelling and grammar is horrible. Just wanted to see what everyone was using?<br />
<br />
BTW thank you for the lesson *S* <br />
<br />
Copy paste into word spelling and grammar check :D . Copy paste post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelorn</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dolby and I are on the same page, there is nothing better than photoshop in my opinion. Some people prefer PSP cause it's easier to use and much simpler, but I love the complexity for Photoshop. I've been using it since v3.0 and I loved it then.<br />
<br />
PSP is great but it's a step under Photoshop in all its capabilities.</div></div><hr />

I use photoshop all the time, but a lot of people can't afford it or don't wanna spend that much.  You can go the their web site (http://www.gimp.org) for more information.</div></div><hr />

I still have it actually. It's small enough to fit on a 1.4 MB Floppy and still have a little under half the disk left.<br />

Photoshop rules.</div></div><hr />

I'd be using PSP most of the time except for one thing. I can't figure out how to edit the alpha channel directly like I can in Photoshop.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pasini36</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I use Corel Photo paint mostly. This because I used to design logo's for t-shirts, pain schemes for bike bodyparts etc... Also working with the wire frames is interesting in Corel Draw.</div></div><hr />

If needed, I export the file and finish it off in Photoshop.. I just find the interface of PSP endlessly more pleasant to work with. :)<br />
<br />
(Nope, I don't do skinning here, but I do graphics alright.. http://www.heronmarked.com in case you're interested. :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tipop</div><div class="date">09-13-2002, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adobe Photoshop 7 all the way.  I tried several other paint programs, but nothing suited me the way Photoshop does.<br />
<br />
The learning curve is steep, but there is a *reason* it's the tool of choice by professionals.</div></div><hr />
