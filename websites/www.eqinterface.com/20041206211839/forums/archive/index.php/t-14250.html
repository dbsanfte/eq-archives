<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the amount of support SOE has offered us for EQI and EQ2I, and the lack of suppport Blizzard has given or offered us, Dolby and I have decided it was best for the EQI and EQ2 community if we concentrated our efforts on one company.<br />
<br />
In the next month or so you will see the extent of SOE's support, we are working a deal to have a contest for beta slots for EQ2, give aways of EQ stuf and some other great stuff. In the next week we will be announcing our first contest for a fun prize.<br />
<br />
So we consider it the best thing for the EQ community, and we hope you find it to be too!<br />
<br />
thank you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sad to see the lack of support from Blizzard but I guess that's how it goes.<br />
<br />
Look forward to all the goodies coming up!<br />

<br />
Looking forward to your contests, hope it havent got anything to do with skinning, as I have no idea how to do this and wouldn't be able to compete :)</div></div><hr />
