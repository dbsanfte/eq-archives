Please someone tell me there is a simple solution here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">haijak</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It'd the last three partys thart your errors.<br />
So first thing to try is rename the ActionsWindow.xm to somthing diffrent like Broken_Action_Window.xml. Then try the UI make shure there arn't other problems in other files.<br />
<br />
If it loads ok with no other errors<br />
Go back to the 3 errors. Change the name of the actions window back. Then open your Animations.xml and try to find the missing peices the error log speaks of.<br />
<br />
A_HB_Barimage<br />
A_HBLeftFlyby<br />
A_HBRightFlyby<br />
<br />
You probibly won't find them.<br />
So open the Default Animations.xml  and try to find them in that one. If you do, coppy those sections to the modified animations.xml (the first one)<br />
<br />
that should fix it although the pices may not look like their suposed to. it will sucess fuly load the skin. if the 3 pices dont look right then is is more complicated to fix.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
