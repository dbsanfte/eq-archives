<br />
I'm using Delta 4, and made a separate chat window last night to get rid of some battle spam. Well, now I don't need the window anymore.<br />
<br />
Chat windows in Delta 4 are missing the little X's you can click, and right-clicking and going to Window shows only a greyed-out Close. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking the solution is in the UI_Occam_Zebuxoruk.ini file, but I'm not sure how to interpret all that stuff. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this maybe a pebkac problem...but i really dont think so as most of the other windows are fine...<br />
<br />
i just d/l'ed this UI and i love it. it is very user friendly and easy on the eyes, and i am pretty picky. most all of the windows are easy to move around except the chat windows. i do not know what it is (and i have found no other posts about this problem) but i cannot move them. i can rezise them until the cows come home but i cannot get that nifty little 4 arrow cursor to come up to move them around, and they are not locked. i can move the spells, windows options...all the other stuff. i have tried putting my cursor everwhere on those stupid little windows and no go.<br />
<br />
anyone know what the h--- is up with this? is it me, or something with the windows that i can fix in a file somewhere? anyone else had this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Occam</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the same way in Delta4, and it's the same way in a minimalist UI I just d/led. The only way to move them is by resizing. (i.e., drag one corner to where you want it, then resize with the opposite corner. It can get kind of annoying, but it works.<br />
<br />
BTW, if anyone is wondering, I found a temporary fix for the &quot;no close&quot; problem. Just load a different UI that includes an &quot;X&quot; for closing, close it, and switch back. :) Kind of a &quot;duh&quot; solution, but whatever works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To move these windows that don't give you the cross-hair mouse pointer - (the ones with no title area) - resize the window by dragging the left top corner side up and over to the position you want it. Sometimes this may mean that the chat window takes up your whole screen, if for example you want to move a window from the bottom right corner of the screen tot the top left. Then grab the right bottom corner and pull it up until you have the window the size, shape and location.<br />
<br />
There are mods out there to DL if this is too much of a pain. I use a variation of the Delta 4 - a combo from Delta 2.3 by Rellix and Delta 3 Spaghetti Remix by neorain for the chat windows and containers.</div></div><hr />
