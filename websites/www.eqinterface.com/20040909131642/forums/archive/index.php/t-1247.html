Love you interface.  It is exactly what I am looking for (including the increased sized target window and moved compass), except in the play info window I would want to see Mana instead of STA and would want to find somewhere to fit in Pet HP.<br />

Is there anyway you could please post a zip of your UI files?  Also would anyone wanna sort out the Sta bar into a mana one and squeeze in pet health? Puhleeease :D</div></div><hr />

I really like your inventory window, but I had to load the default due to the fact that yours has no auto-equip window.  It's an odd request, so let me explain:<br />
<br />
As a magician that raids frequently, I drop a ton of mod rods.  The most efficient way to do this is to fill my inv slots with bandages (I get a stack with my food and water anyway) and then drop rods on the auto-equip box.  They automatically fall to the ground without a confirmation.<br />
<br />
This is a critical feature IMHO for raiding mages.  Without the autoequip box, we'd have to click on the view area to try and drop items.  Too often, that results in a trade dialog we don't want.<br />
<br />
Again, I really like the UI's clean, easy to read look.  I'll keep using it.  If I get the time, I'll try to mod your inventory screen to add an autoequip box...likely where you recently added the done button.</div></div><hr />

Is there anyway you could make both the spellbook and Inventory screens bigger AS WELL if you could add the drop in part to the inventory screen? I really like that feature.

<br />
ETA: will vary..<br />
<br />
Asadd, <br />
Changing the spell book size is a major mod, as it messes with ALL the spell book graphics. <br />
<br />
Make the WHOLe inventory screen bigger? by how mutch? again this means graphics changes.<br />
<br />
Drop in IS in the inventory, your whole stat area is a drop in box :)<br />
<br />
HB window minus resist with afew moded hotkeys should be done today...<br />

No it's not moveable, so my HB mod with the INV slots in it can not have the auto equip, but it IS in the inventory mod with a done button I made, AND in verts standard.<br />

But along the line few ideas came up that some may like it, some may not.<br />

However I have a question. Has anyone been able to make the spellbook open without using the spellbook icon? Such as click over ClassAnime to open book, or any other button?<br />

I know sounds strange or impossible, but it would make sokol/vert skin worth having with few tweaks i have in mind.<br />

It inverts it and infact the whole left side of the book is messed up, you can't even see the top-middle graphic.<br />
<br />
Also I just wanted to mention that if Sokol and Vert team up.. I would be very excited as well. When I first saw Vert1, I knew I would be using it for a long time. The other UI mods/skins just can't compare with this, its just amazing, and the fact that it doesn't just change the background look, but actually changes the stat bars and all that, and the sizes and well.. its just sweet :)<br />

I'll be watching you guys very closley, and as a druid, that canabis version of Vert will be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrim</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya, I'm trying to modify a player window but staring at all the code without really knowing what most of it does is giving me a headache. ;) Are there any guides for beginners on how to change this stuff?<br />
<br />
If anyone has some specific tips, I'll give my situation:<br />
<br />
I'm a minimalist for the most part. Only need the basic info and I dont like a lot of clutter on the screen. I'm trying to modify Vert's Player Window so that hp/hpmax appears in the top right instead of the lower left. Nix the labels on the left side (f1, F, xp, aa). Add a full size air guage between stamina and xp, and have <br />
<br />
AC &lt;value left side&gt; ATK &lt;value center&gt; WT(weight) &lt;wt/wtMax right side&gt; (Without brackets)<br />
<br />
on the bottom of the window without the icons, and listed horizontally.<br />
<br />
I think I am correct in assuming x.y is a coordinate position in pixels, but some of the values I saw didnt add up. the first position (player name) started at 16,-1 but if it starts at neg 1 it would be off the window? it doesnt show off the window in game.. the next value (hp guage) is at 3,12 but this doesnt entirely make sense in my mind since it's overlapping the line above it by 4 pixels.. The size of the player name section is CY=15 but that would also cause an overlap in my mind since the next item starts at 12.. I dunno. I'm prolly confusing myself more than helping, the answer is probably pretty simple but I'm not seeing it. ;)<br />
<br />
A simple guide would probably be the biggest help, or some pointers on how to accomplish the things I'm doing. Once I start to learn how it works I hope to make a complete interface, but it's gonna be a while if I cant figure out the first window I want to change. ;) I read aboutSIDL.doc but that thing just confused me even more. And looking thru the posts here, most seem to be oretty specific with not a lot of general info for the xml-newbie.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sokol</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, the player name is -1 because it's how do you say this LARGE, for it's space so by placing it at -1 it is where it needs to be. IE lets say it's 10x10 they whant the text name to be at 9 they make it -1 so this happens.<br />
<br />
As for over laping, the SIZE of a text field determines the size of the text, so while it would over lap if the field was full, it is usualy only afew letters, so this never happens.<br />

Hope this helps a little.<br />

<br />
like Asadd already mentioned, and since im a wiz too, i use robe and primary slot often .. as well as leg slot. I like the hotkeys with 4 or 8  inventory slots and maybe add to the right of that the slots : chest, primary , legs ,and maybe if it doesnt make much work ( only then ) a feet slot ... <br />
<br />
and maybe the hitpoint counter in the playerwindow file could be done in a bit more larger font ? that would be awsome<br />
<br />
the rest of that mod is perfect imo :)<br />

I have fixed the books to work with this mod.  Both the Tking books and Remelio's condensed versions.  It just took a small modification of the Animations file. <br />

If you want a copy of the animation file I use PM me and I will send it to your email address since we can't download anything here.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My alt is a necro...so is it possible to change the hotbutton file to simple replace the inventory and item quick slots with the Pet window (alt F1) ??  That would be very nice if it can be done!<br />
<br />
Thanks a million, hope the DL start to work again soon! =P<br />

As well It has a second for epic, robe, belt and bracer right next to the hotbutton as well as it has the 8 sloot backpacks for easy access... now you can use your hotkeys for things like manaburn and Imp familiar... I'll get you a pic shortly...<br />

T.King, Rombus UI, VertUI and My own editing of XML and I have this layout so far... I like simple yet functional...  Also I'm going to look at the spellcasting bar and throw around some Ideas...  If you want me to email you the files zipped up PM me and I'll email it out to you....  What you also dont see is that the Target and group bars have been tweeked I like the small minibar on the bottom of the gauges so I re added it and changed it to look like your normal... health bars... I'm going to work on tweaking them back to the original colors of Vert when I have more time...<br />
I didnt choose T.kings gems b/c I found that some of the Default ones were better to look at then the ones he created...  There are some Default ones that had like no effort put into them but I cant stand looking at a tornado and thinking okay that's a magic based spell.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
just to say once more : GRATS !<br />
awesome mod !<br />
<br />
i currently use Vert's mod with hotbutton/inv_slots from you Sokol :)<br />
that kicks ass for monks i think :)<br />
<br />
and since your are taking some requests i'd like to know if you could do a little something for overweighted monks:<br />
<br />
this is what i'd like to see as a window (using the pet one maybe) :<br />
<br />
-------weight-------<br />
--[copper]-[silver]<br />
------Destroy-------<br />
--[Platinum]-[gold]<br />
<br />
think that's doable  ? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Make it show only 8 bags/items and no inventory slots in the lower left 'hot box'.<br />
<br />
2) Make the Spell book bigger, say 1 1/2 times the size it is now, with the ability to minimumize and maximumize with ease like the other boxes.<br />
<br />
3) make the T. King SpellBook skins fully compatable with the Vert<br />
<br />
thats it as far as i can tell, everything else is prrrrrrfect heh. <br />

Spell bar shrinking:<br />
Again this will require graphic changes.<br />

Best editor I've found is xmlspy<br />

First of all i want to say that this is really great work!<br />
<br />
But one question, how can i modify that Player Window for hybrids? I myself play a SK so the more important for me is STR INT and STA instead of WIS and WT ;)<br />
<br />
So can ya just give me a hint how to change that?</div></div><hr />

is there any reason the pet bar in the int caster player window doesn't have a corresponding percentage?  if not could that be added?  a minor thing i agree but it'd be nice.  :)<br />

<br />
at the begining of this thread you mention the stand alone mod that allows buttons and inv etc to have vert's clean look. i assume this can be used with any ui. now that the download section is up and running will you be adding that zip to the hotkeys section&gt;?<br />
