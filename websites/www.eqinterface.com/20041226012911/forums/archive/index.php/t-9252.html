<br />
for some strange reason whenever i save my file (in adobe photoshop 5.5) as a TGA, it never shows up when i attempt to preview it on SidlWidl.<br />
<br />
okay so heres what i do...<br />
<br />
1.) i start off with a transparent background<br />
2.) i do whatever drawing i need to do (sometimes on separate layers)<br />
3.) i merge everything down to one layer<br />
4.) i go to save as copy... and save it as a TGA<br />
5.) im prompted to put in a quality and click on 32 bit<br />
6.) i save it as part_01.tga<br />
<br />
and BOOM youd think everything would be okay, but its NOT.  like i said i try to get it to show up on SidlWidl, but all it shows is a blank white screen.<br />
<br />

PNGs use transparent layers.. you need alpha channels in TGAs to tell it what to show.. look at the default TGAs on the tab CHANNELS to see what I am talking about..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evildevilchild</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehehe okay, well lemme just MAKE SURE that im doing this correctly...<br />
<br />
i start of with a PSD... save as copy into a TGA... then open up the TGA and add the ALPHA layer... correct?<br />
<br />
/edit<br />
<br />
okay i did what you said and took a look at the default's TGA files, and i noticed that on the alpha layer that the default had, the ALPHA layer was black, with the white spots being the graphic that WASNT transparent...<br />
<br />
but when i looked at my file, the whole background was black... and didnt show any white spots like the default file had... what exactly am i doing wrong?  i know this might be a bit of a chore, but can you explain what you do when you begin a new graphic from scratch???<br />
<br />
/edit off</div></div><hr />

Even if I'm making something completely new I copy a default graphic file, open it, then paste the new graphics into it. That way all the formatting of the alpha layer is there (although I do have to make the alpha layer either match the image or at least set it up the way I want it).<br />
