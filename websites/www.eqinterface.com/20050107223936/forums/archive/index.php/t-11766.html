Btw kudane if ya can make a sticky of this some where this is a nice temp fix til the people at sony make the change for the live servers... and not just at the test server....<br />
<br />
from  a guy named harnci's post......<br />
<br />
<br />
I will try to be more specific in my instructions, of course I only know it helped me with my 9600XP so yrmv (your results may vary).<br />
When you run the shortcut on your desktop, it runs the &quot;EverQuest.exe&quot;. So to patch, goto your eq dir and run the &quot;TestEverQuest.exe&quot;. You only need to patch until you see it FINISH getting a new &quot;eqgfx_dx8.dll&quot;. Once it has gotten that file, hit cancel. Now you goto your eq dir again, find that file and copy it. I went back a directory and pasted it, for safe keeping. You could also paste it to the desktop.<br />
<br />
To use this file on live servers, you have two options. First, for both you WILL need to run the patcher to fix any test files back to live. Once this is done, BEFORE you press play... paste that eqgfx_dx8.dll file BACK into your eq dir. Make sure you paste a copy and don't just move it, so later if you need to do it again you don't have to bother with the test server.<br />
<br />
Now, your eq is using the test version of eqgfx_dx8.dll. If you EVER run the patcher again, it will over write it so here is our two options.<br />
<br />
1) Run the patcher every time, and when its done copy the file into the eq dir.<br />
<br />
2) Copy your everquest shortcut, then modify it to point to &quot;eqgame.exe&quot; with the word &quot;patchme&quot; at the end. The following is an example, based on MY system.<br />
<br />
The current shortcut reads &quot;C:\Games\EverQuest\EverQuest.exe&quot; and I would modify it to &quot;C:\Games\EverQuest\eqgame.exe&quot; patchme<br />
<br />
The &quot;patchme&quot; part HAS TO BE OUTSIDE THE &quot;&quot; in the shortcut. The &quot;&quot; let windows see file/dir names with spaces as a file, if you put the patchme inside the &quot;&quot; it would think you were looking for a file named &quot;eqgame.exe patchme&quot; which obviously doesn't exist. by putting it OUTSIDE the &quot;&quot;, it becomes a parameter instead. Notice it isn't -patchme or /patchme, but just plain &quot;patchme&quot;. Despite the &quot;sly&quot; naming, it actually tells eqgame.exe to run w/o patching <br />

enjoy ati users ya now have targeting rings atleast temporary with a bit of copy and pasting...  <br />
