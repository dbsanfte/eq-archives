Check out this forum (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050668.html) what others who have played the game and played EQ think (and no, its not a &quot;Sony rulez&quot; post. Its actually very helpful). But in the end, let the decision be your choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcLite</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Played DAoC for about 1 1/2 years (starting from beta 3) and always came back to EQ.  Mainly because RVR is limp unless you're a ganker or ZERG.<br />
Content is pretty boring at level 50<br />
It's also really easy to get 50, just boring as hell after you get there mainly.  lol<br />
<br />
Anyhow, good luck with it if you get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ÆÆÆÆ</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Start DAoC if you want, but know that it is for the most part &quot;dead&quot; thanks to EQ, PS, SWG, etc... last time I was on it, in Febraury,  hardly anybody was playing... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stopped playing back in May and the roleplayer server that I played on was quite populated. Please note though, your server may vary (just like EQ - as some servers aren't that popular vs. others).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcLite</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DAOC is far from dead.  While I'm not a fan of the game if you go here (http://www.camelotherald.com/index.shtml) and look on the right side you'll see current servers with the players on each.  <br />
When I checked it was at about 28k and some change (Saturday peak).<br />
<br />
Dead games are more like AC2.  I think less than 4k play that game at peak.<br />
<br />
Planetside is doing rather poorly as well and right behind it is SWG.  Each of those at peaks float in at around 8k to 10k.<br />
<br />
EQ is the King though.  Coming in at a hefty around 30k - 55k at peak times (maybe even more).  <br />
Now that's a lot of people!<br />
<br />
Server populations will definately dip though at the end of this month when Final Fantasy Online comes out (FFXI I think it the number).</div></div><hr />
