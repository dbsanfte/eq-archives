<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bajen</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi I am absolutely new to this but have fiddled around with small XML bits now and then.<br />
<br />
I am fairly happy with the original GUI and only want one change as it is.<br />
<br />
I want to see % on XP and alt XP.<br />
<br />
This is what I have found so far on tutorials and by searching on XP. Labels EQType:<br />
1 = Name<br />
2 = Level<br />
3 = Class<br />
4 = Deity<br />
5 = Strength<br />
6 = Stamina<br />
7 = Dexterity<br />
8 = Agility<br />
9 = Wisdom<br />
10 = Intelligence <br />
11 = Charisma <br />
12 = Save vs Poison <br />
13 = Save vs Disease <br />
14 = Save vs Fire <br />
15 = Save vs Cold <br />
16 = Save vs Magic <br />
17 = Current Hit Points <br />
18 = Maximum Hit Points <br />
19 = Hit Point Percentage<br />
20 = Mana Percentage <br />
21 = Stamina Percentage <br />
22 = Armor Class <br />
23 = Attack <br />
24 = Weight <br />
25 = Maximum Weight <br />
26 = Experience Percentage <br />
27 = Alternate Experience Percentage<br />
<br />
define your 24bits Tga (dunno if this has to be a 24bits tga) in the &quot;EQUI_Animations.xml&quot; and access them in the window config files.<br />
<br />
The EQTypes for Guages is:<br />
<br />
HP - 1<br />
Mana - 2<br />
Stamina - 3<br />
Experience - 4<br />
Alt Experience – 5<br />
 <br />
<br />
My general thinking is to look for the HP % on gauge and to add/tweak 4 and 5 on Guages. Do I do this in EQUI_Animations.xml or do I use Labels 26, 27 somewhere else to enable %-info on my XP bars?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance from a complete noob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InvisiBill</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume you want this in your main player info window. If so, you'd want to edit EQUI_TargetWindow.xml.<br />
<br />
If you weren't aware of it, (EverQuestDir)\uifiles\default has all of the XML files for the default setup. Any changes made to those files will be overwritten by the patcher, but it does let you see all the different things you have the ability to change. You need to put your modified files in another directory, like (EverQuestDir)\uifiles\mine, then use the command [B]/loadskin mine 1[B] in-game to have it look at the file(s) there. For simple tweaks like yours, it will probably work best to just copy the default files and edit them, rather than trying to rewrite the whole thing from scratch. I'm sure some people would try to do that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bajen</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
Now lets see; edit EQUI_TargetWindow.xml<br />
<br />
I just copy the section for HP gauge and rename the paste to 4 (XP) and 5 (AA). Load the new mod and run in to the sunset?<br />
<br />
Easier than I thought. Can't wait to get home and whip up the trusty text editor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InvisiBill</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty much. You'll have to change the name on the copied section from &quot;HPpercent&quot; or whatever it's called (I didn't actually look) to &quot;AApercent&quot; or something, so that it makes a new item, rather than just having the same thing coded for twice. You'll also need to edit the location of the item, so that it draws in the right place. And you'll need to make sure you add your &quot;AApercent&quot; item to the window, usually at the end of the file. You'll see a listing of all the items that are in the window...<br />
<br />
Just think of every single thing in a window as an item and you should be fine. So you want to copy the code for the HPpercent item, change the name and location of the new item, and tell the window that the new item is there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bajen</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again.<br />
<br />
Prior to reading your second answer I looked in downloads and loaded a inventory mod down that looked like I wanted (well the xp bars anyways). I will copy the bits that I want from that code and paste it in my work copy of the original skin.<br />
<br />
After a few trials and errors I will probably get it working.</div></div><hr />
