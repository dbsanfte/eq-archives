<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gdbob</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I just looked at FAQ again, it has 2 pics of how the folder should be saved. It looks as though when I saved mine it went -<br />
uifiles&gt;ocean&gt;vert  and I need it to go - uifiles&gt;ocean , if thats correct. So I made a new file under default, I named it ocean and unzipped the UI I DL'ed onto my desktop into the file named ocean...does this sound right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, looking at the error log, you have it in one folder too many.  Move the files back up to /ocean (like you said you did) and try again.  If it still isn't working, post the new UIError.txt log file. Good luck! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gdbob</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I looked again and yes its now a folder named Vert going into the new folder I created under the default UI folder named ocean. How do I exactly extract the zip on my desktop just into the ocean folder, so when I click on ocean it shows all the UI info and not another folder named Vert?<br />
I am sorry about these questions if they seem noobish, but as I posted above,this is all new to me..at least I figured out what my current prob is, heh )<br />
<br />
Thanks Gdbob</div></div><hr />

I know I only want one folder, but I cant seem to extract the zip file just into the ocean file, it makes a new file inside ocean named Vert, any help please? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gdbob</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man I feel like a goober, heh, I finally figured out how to make one folder, it loaded in game, it looks great. Now I have a text message that reads my xml files are not compatible and it loaded its own defaults.<br />
Should I click and look at every window and make sure they are all the Vert Ocean mod or do I need to DL any new fixes or adds to the file I just made...since I DLed the mod I assume there have been changes and/or fixes to it I may need to also DL. I guess I'll do a search for the Ocean vert and see if theres a file I need to DL. <br />
Thanks, Gdbob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, make sure that there aren't already some patches released that you need to snag.  If you don't find any, again, post your UIError.txt log file, that way we can tell you what files are out of date and need to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gdbob</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I just relogged in and it was back to the EQ default skin, how do I keep the new UI on as I look to see what files I am missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gdbob</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did finally get the new UI to stay on, I went into the eqclient folder and changed the default to ocean, but this vert had stuff missing, like the new ldon buttons- inspect and open, I just gave up and deleted and went back to default. <br />
My question is, are there any UI's that you have here for DL complete and up to date? Wouldn't it be easier to just add in the fixes and new updates and just repost a totally complete mod than having to look here everytime something changes?<br />
Like I said, im a newbie, so please bear with me.I really liked that vert mod, and I think I could maintain it if I can find one thats a bit more complete than that Vert Ocean one was, Thanks - Bob</div></div><hr />

Well, Vert matured, as all good UIs do.  It has become Solaria (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?s=&amp;op=showfiles&amp;catid=56&amp;sortby=date&amp;sortorder=DESC).</div></div><hr />
