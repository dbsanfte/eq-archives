<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agraza</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I searched and saw this has been spoken of before. but it seems to continually fall into disuse.  the most recent 1600x1200 UI I liked was xymarra's version.<br />
<br />
I'm using drakahlegacy now tho since I'm apparently stuck in 1240x1280 in xym or legacy.  Can someone enlarge legacy (drakah?) to be 1600x1200?  or update xymarra's 1600x1200?  I feel BLIND with such low res on :( but need the elite UIs.  default is not good.<br />
<br />
I want black 1600x1200 xymarra or a 1600x1200 enlarged drakah.  really the only &quot;problem&quot; with using legacy at 1600x1200 is the compass bar is too short.  but you also have issues of small buff icons and numbers and all.  dont want everything enlarged. but a few things like text on the player/group windows and the spell names next to their spell slots.<br />
<br />
sorry if this is ask before.  I like all UIs even as are but like 1600 more.</div></div><hr />

It's harder to work on than the others since my monitor does not do that resolution nicely.</div></div><hr />
