<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madea</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which way did the community go with installing UIs? To copy default folder and extract or just extract? I copy the default and extract, I get no errors. I did try just extracting and got UIerrors.txt... but with so many people saying one way or another... which is the right way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelric</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way it's SUPPOSED to work, according to Sony, is you only include in your custom folder the files that have been modified; any files the engine finds missing there SHOULD be pulled from the folder labeled as the default folder in your *character's* ini file (that is, not the UI_character_server.ini, but the main INI file in the \Everquest directory, the name of which escapes me at the moment).<br />
<br />
Note the emphasis above: supposed to, and should.<br />
<br />
As to why it doesn't always work the way it's supposed to is a mystery to me... anyone know more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kweil</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm always worked for me.  Of course I stear clear of the mods that change EQUI.XML</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfhugger</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the very first mod I tried, I always have the default folder copied into the custom folder then re-copy the mods from their &quot;safe folder&quot; elsewhere on the harddrive. It has yet to screw me up (atleast until I accidentally mess the code up when tweaking) so it will always be done this way. I just don't trust Sony to have the &quot;look in default folder&quot; feature work when I need it to. :p</div></div><hr />
