Need Help! Color Match Graphics<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I could really use everyone's input here. I would like to get my monitor to view the same color/gamma as everyone else so I can keep the intended colors intact when creating mods.<br />
<br />
I have re-downloaded the Adobe ICM profiles but I use one that was generated for my particular monitor (G75f Viewsonic Graphic Series). I have re-calibrated my montior with the swatch and program that came with the monitor. I have dabbled with Adobe-Gamma control panel options. I really think it has to do with the &quot;monitor settings&quot; you have IN Adobe PS, but I dont know what that setting should be. Either that, or its an EQ problem in general.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the problem.:<br />
<br />
I view the art in Adobe, edit as needed, saved as TGA for EQ, code it, and load EQ. Mind you, the original TGA looks just fine to me. Now here is the kicker... you would think that the graphic should look exactly the same in EQ as out of EQ, but it does not for me.<br />
The picture, to me, looks way too bright now. I have dabbled using gamma-setting from 14% to 42%, and it does not do any justice to pinpoint the actual color. I would have to reduce the pictures' brightness down by Neg25, Neg30, Neg40 or Neg45 to make it look exactly how it does out-of-game. Sometimes lower the Contrast by Neg10, Neg15, rarely Pos10, Pos15.<br />
<br />
If I use gamma-setting for 14% or 28%, its too dark for me, and even at that, the TGA is not the same, just makes everything super dark. I cant really make out the &quot;window_dark_background.tga&quot; at all that is for the default background picture or whatever it was called. Seems almost black to me. Perhaps I am just used to the 42% ever since knowing that upping your gamma, you basically have &quot;night vision&quot;, I dont know.<br />
<br />
My questions is:<br />
<br />
1) When you make/view a graphic tga file, is it exactly the same in EQ for you? Is it too bright? If so, by how much?<br />
<br />
2) What gamma setting do you have EQ set to?<br />
<br />
3) Can you see the default dark background in misc. windows clearly?<br />
<br />
4) Is there a way of changing the setting of this brightness for EQ without having to make EQ set its gamma so high?<br />
<br />
5) If you use adobe, what are your settings in &quot;Color Correction&quot; preferences? Be explicit.<br />
<br />
6) Is there a program that can tweak EQ's color settings for graphics? (Perhaps a DirectX tweak program that can set for individual programs). Im thinking this option is in the Nvidia control panel someplace.<br />
<br />
7) Do you have a Geforce3 or 4 card? If so, what are the settings for &quot;Color Correction&quot;?. Also need to know what Gamma setting you have (should be 1.0). --do you use Adobe Gamma Controls in conjunction with this? What are the settings you have in there?<br />
<br />
Any information you can give would be greatly appreciated! Please only post if you have relative information that would help in this matter. Explicit details if you can so I can try and mimic configurations for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've tried in PSP6.1 to match up the gamma adjustment to the in-game quality....too long.  Now, I just put the best effort in PSP and if it is in game too light, I then go back and drop the gamma by whatever percent (in-game) i needed to bring it to a close enuff color.</div></div><hr />
