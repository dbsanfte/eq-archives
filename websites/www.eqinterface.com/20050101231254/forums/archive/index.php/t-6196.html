The only thing that's suppose to be in your Custom EQ Folder are the things that were customized, and whatever is not found in the Custom Folder it will pluck from default, right?<br />
<br />
Ok so after it loads custom stuff, i.e. tk-briar spell bar etc...  And it gets the other info not available in the Custom Folder, from the Default Folder... and it gives you an EQ-UI-Error in the txt... How do you fix that?  <br />
<br />
I'll see if this works, and I'll post my eq error thing too...<br />
<br />
Enclosed is what is in my Custom Folder as shown... I did not copy over my default, is this how it should look?<br />
<br />
Got a big ol' Error, wayyy long saying it couldn't find animations, sinl, facepick, about all of them I believe... I can post it if ya really want me to...  I just want to make sure that what I asked above and the attached picture are correct...  And if not, since I am getting the errors, how do I fix those errors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-01-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks right to me.<br />
<br />
Post your UIError.txt log file, I can tell you if it is &quot;right&quot; or whether there is anything in it that you need to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CVamian</div><div class="date">02-01-2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I loaded my Lucrece folder... and I got the&quot;Your XML Files are not compatible with current Everquest Files, certain windows may not perform correctly...&quot; etc...&quot;.... But my UI stuff still worked...<br />
<br />
My equi error file is VERY long... so... lol.. here ya go...  Still randomly dropping to desktop... What is shown in my Custom Folder is pretty much what is in there now, I was fudging it up before...  :( I don't know if I will randomly drop now that I know I was fudging it up...<br />
<br />
I just want to log in and  not have this Error message, and hopefully I won't be randomly dropping to desktop anymore when it's fixed... Which would be oh so wonderful :)<br />

Here's the UI Error Txt<br />

<br />
Those are your two problem children.<br />
<br />
For the first, the loot window, look to the 9 Jan patch fix.  IF you have a custom Loot window, make the appropriate changes.  If you don't, just delete it from your custom folder.<br />
<br />
For the second, that is part of the mess from last Tuesday's patch.  Go to the 28 Jan patch fix, download the 3 files that are attached and put them in your DEFAULT folder.  (Yes, this is completely not the norm, but nonetheless ...)<br />
<br />
Then see how it goes.</div></div><hr />

I did not get the Error message when logging in, but this info is in the UI Error txt...<br />

Will see if I get dropped to desktop now, cause that's been a reoccuring thing past few days...<br />

<br />
As for the rest of your UIError.txt log file, it is completely normal and precisely as it should be (except for the very last line, as already discussed).  It just means that it is looking for those files in your default folder, as it should be, when it can't find them in your custom folder.  That is exactly how it should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CVamian</div><div class="date">02-01-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you put the three files into the default folder? <br />

yep did it  :)  Going to log in and see if I get dropped to DT</div></div><hr />

(Related to and discussed in part here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6054).)<br />
<br />
The best thing I can suggest at this point is to check around over at the Technical Help (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Technical+Help&amp;number=3&amp;DaysPrune=20&amp;LastLogin=) forum at the EQLive site.

Was saying thanks for trying... Been dealing with about 5 CSRs in the past week or so, talking to them almost every day, even talked to the Moderator for the Tech Boards; tried all their fixes and ideas, but still randomly dropping, even installed EQ 2x, all drivers are updated and so on, list goes on and on as to all the stuff I've tried...  Sucks now though cause' I cannot really group with anyone because I don't know when I'm going to get dropped to DT.. :(  All I hear right before I get dropped is that it sounds like my computer is doing something, what? I don't know... Already talked to my husband about it, and he knows what needs to run in background and what doesn't, he says it's all ok in the background and it's just something with EQ since we've tried everything else... Soo... Still posting on their Tech Boards, and haven't really gotten a clear answer yet as to why it is going on or how to fix it... :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check power source?  Make sure fan working right, cpu not over heating?  Everything else runs fine, just not EQ?  Are you trying to use the mp3 player? (For whatever reason, every so often that will lock my system up solid, no idea why, you aren't the only one who has weird stuff happen for no apparent reason =/)  Did you go and check the VideoModeBitsPerPixel thing in the eqclient.ini file?  Try running patcher, un-check auto-play, after it loads but before you actually go in game, open the file, make sure it's set to 16 or 32 (whichever is right for you), not 0?<br />

I did your change to the XML, but when I went to the patcher it got a whole new XML file...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nevergone</div><div class="date">02-02-2003, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those changes were meant to be placed in your custom EQUI.xml file. The default one should already have all of that code in it already.<br />
<br />
Usually, if you alter a default file in any way, the patch server will redownload the altered files. This is the way the game attempts to preserve at least one working copy of the UI. Of course they don't always do a great job at it.<br />
<br />
However like I said, that chunk of code should be put in your custom EQUI.xml file. I don't think the patcher will download anything into your custom directory.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-02-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is absolutely no reason to add an EQUI.xml file to your custom folder if there isn't one already there.  If there *is* a custom EQUI.xml file in your custom folder, then you should only need to make whatever changes are required to make it current as per the Patch Fixed forum.<br />
<br />
Copying *everything* from in the default EQUI.xml file into your custom EQUI.xml file, overwriting the existing information, merely turns your custom EQUI.xml back into the default one, in which case why bother having a custom one to begin with?  All you've done is overwrite whatever had been customized about it and made a copy of the default one.</div></div><hr />
