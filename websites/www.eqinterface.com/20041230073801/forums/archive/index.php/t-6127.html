 I had a good UI for my necro but the LoY update messed it all up.  It was a mix of a lot of different things and now I have to use this one below.  <br />
 What I really need for a Nec is a health gauge that stands out so I know when I am killing myself getting mana.  Is there one where the health bar is like a big bubble that changes color as your health drops?  I think I remember seeing one but can not find it now.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my UI page.   The one I need to upgrade is Deecay's (my Nec)<br />

You should check out the pet window I made... My necro UI isn't too fabulous. You have done a lot of work there. It's a little busy for me, but very necroish. :D</div></div><hr />

I started this tread about three months ago looking to help someone out with a necro request and WOW, over 500+ downloaded the UI! I thankyou sencerely. I have not been playing Eq for over 4 months no and not to sure if I will ever play it again anytime soon. I wish I was still playing so I could help those get an upgrade of the UI, but RL is the card holder. If you can convice my significant other that Eq didn't take me away from RL then I might be back to do the work*. You all take care and thanks again!:D I can be reached at Gurusoul@sbcglobal.net if need be and maybe I might be able to barrow a friends account in the Little rock area if it comes to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Yes it is.  I keep changing UI's too much lately though trying to get the perfect one.  There have been so many different things I can put on it and a few that I have to take off the full UIs posted.  Its too bad that when a full UI is made and uploaded here that you can't just download the pieces you want from it. hehe.  I have redone my whole Necros UI and will have it posted on my site soon.  It clears up alot of mess and gives me more screen space to view my killing spree.<br />
