<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saerdna</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok until the last patch i was using some custom ui files. Most were the defaults except I was using different group window and target.<br />
<br />
Now none of those work. I tried to find a complete set UI but I can't find anything as before.<br />
<br />
I need a group window with F keys and % on it. I do not won't any funsy designs. Something similar to default but with F keys and the % next to the player not on the bar. I found a vert one but it has no f keys which are very important for me since i am a healer.<br />
<br />
Also I had a nice target window  showing % and having a spell cast bar as well with it attached.<br />
<br />
I tried to find something similar but i can't. I tried to pick some from the full set but unless i use all the files of the set they won;t work as individual. Anyone can help me please?</div></div><hr />
