<br />
I and Mr.X ( the other coder ) might even put AFK, GuildMate tags in.  also taking any sugestions from anyone in the comunity atm :)<br />

<br />
( assignment boxes now only scroll vertically. mouse can be used, however arrowbuttons are to the right of the boxes BUT are very small..  I will have to make some more changes to make them viewable. )<br />
<br />
I would like to thank the person who helped me make these scrollable, but,,  he is still anonymous<br />

<br />
I have always thought that groups should have this possibility and the ability to assign a ML (like in raids).<br />
<br />
Nice work Talesin and to your annon m8 aswell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
F1 is the player steppin, and is only in the Avalon group window :-)<br />
<br />
F1 also targets your pet</div></div><hr />

now if I just could get someone to move this thread to the released forum :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steppin</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehehe im gonna PEEK at this out of curiosity and cause YOU did the work on it.. but  seriously doubt it will ever replace your avalon group window   :)   <br />
yes f1 targets self  and f1 the 2nd time targets pet . but  that doesnt' give healers a fast viaual on their hp ... that's why default group window is not a favorite of mine  )   hehehe<br />
<br />
but you know me.. i gotta at least TRY what you worked on  :)</div></div><hr />

I'm not real sure on the function.  Is this just for personal information, or do they coincide with some sort of leaderhip ability command?<br />
<br />
I would like to suggest that you change the font size of the text in the drop-downs to something a bit smaller.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
this has no function outside of letting you know what a person in your group is doing, if you set their function.<br />
<br />
I think SOE will take this in the future and change it just enough so that I and Drakah don't get credit for it.<br />
<br />
the current font size cannot be changed smaller at this time, due to the way the graphic works.</div></div><hr />
