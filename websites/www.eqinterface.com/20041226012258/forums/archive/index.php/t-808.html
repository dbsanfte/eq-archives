<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelric</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to have this as a recurring problem:<br />
<br />
Whenever I try to add new features to a window (say, Player or Group), I seem to screw something up in the window sizing and the label placement. The numbers just do not seem to make sense.<br />
<br />
For example: I took the group window, and wanted to add HP percentages to the end of each gauge. Yes, I know it's been done a thousand times, but not by ME. :p So I find the right EQTypes, add the labels, name them all properly, set them to be on the same Y as the corresponding gauges and an X that should set them to the right of said gauges. Then I included all the new labels in the list of Pieces. Finally, I change the CX size of the window to allow for the greater width required. Save, run EQ, /load... unable to load.<br />
<br />
Grrrrrrr.<br />
<br />
Similar problem with my Player window... added stats and weight, everything's cool... except the weight labels are all funky, over top of each other. I adjust the X, a little better... finally got it readable. BUT... given the size of the text (I used the 35/14 size that seems to be standard), the numbers just dont' add up.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I guess my question is... do the size and position coordinates actually correspond to each other? If a label is specified to be CX-35 CY-14, do I need to place the next label to the right at least 35 coords away? And does the next line below need to be at least 14 down?<br />
<br />
I'm at work, so I can't post my XML or do screenshots... hope the question makes sense.</div></div><hr />

It'd at least be something to reference that works. :)</div></div><hr />
