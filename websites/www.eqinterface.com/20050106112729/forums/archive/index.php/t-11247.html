**/end Need to know stuff**<br />
<br />
Ok so.... Really I'm a little mad because I can't figure this out.  I have a radeon 9700pro 128mb video card.  I get scores around 13000 in 3dmark 2k2.  I run games like halo on full everything at around 50fps.  My video card is nothing short of great.  Though... when I go into everquest, w/ all OLD models in a 30ish person raid (most times even less) eq runs like SH*T.  Less then a frame per second. <br />
<br />
I know its not the drivers because I run everything else just fine.  There is nothing physically wrong with the card, or with its software.  Then my friend comes over with his 1ghz computer and an Nvidia Geforce3 4600 and runs eq with all new models, in a full raid at like 30FPS.  I talk to many in my guild and a few other friends that play EQ and its the SAME WAY.  EQ is not playing with radeons all that well....  WHAT IS GOING ON?  Is there any documented proof or REASON eq doesnt?  I play eq hardcore and im in an elemental guild and we have lots of folks on every night.  I raid with alot of people and this is getting rediculous.<br />
<br />
Anybody out there with any answers? (I'm not looking for help with my comp, I just want answers)</div></div><hr />

I deleted my eqclient.ini and eqgfx_dx8.dll, repatched them and the game ran fine.  course it could also be your ATI card, they are bad cards, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shrumhead</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is no isolated event.  I have formatted 4 times since I have had this card, its the same every time (I didn't format because of the card, I formatted just cause I like to regularly)<br />
<br />
EDIT:: and like I said it doesn't seem to be just me.  Its like this with EVERYBODY I have talked to that owns a radeon, I simply want to know y everquest doesnt play with radeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fanadarmy</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Must be something wrong with your system hardware. I have been running a Radeon 9700 for just about a year and EQ runs awesome, Had a TI4600 and it sucks compared to the 9700 in ANY game. I have no issues with my 9700 even in places like the Bazaar, it all runs smooth. I recently tried a FX5900 Ultra 256mb and it still did not perform as nice or as clear and vibrant as my 9700. So you have some other kind of issue and its not ATI, they make the fastest and the best visual cards on the market.</div></div><hr />

The Nvidia chip MBs are touchy about setting up Radeon cards... though it seems if everything is ok in one game it should be ok in another *shrug*</div></div><hr />
