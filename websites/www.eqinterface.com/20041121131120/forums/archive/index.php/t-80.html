<br />
However I looked at the file and it made no sence to me, plus would like to see the window &quot;change&quot; as you edit that file. Otherwise I have no clue on what to change, what the numbers mean in relation to where it is, blah blah. Totally lost. Praying for a program...or else im dead in the water.</div></div><hr />

http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=39<br />
but other than doing the tutorial in the Help -&gt; Search -&gt; Tutorial, I would do what everyone else suggests and use Notepad. Notepad is the way I learned HTML even with about 15 HTML editors on my computer back then. All you need is a tutorial or webpage that walks you through the commands like &quot;&lt;whatever=whatever&quot;and_why&quot;something&gt; etc, which I would throw a link up here if I had one but I don't. I'm going to go find one now though to hel[ myself learn, because XML Spy just kicked my butt and made me feel stupid hehe. I'll reply if I find something for beginners in English. If you find one before me though feel free to post it for everyone! =)</div></div><hr />

Edit: The &quot;kickstart&quot; url I had before was so basic it confused me more than jumping in and making an XML document, so I removed it =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using SidlWidl to edit my UI so far. But I recently downloaded a UI and tried editing it, but it said there was an unexpected error in the player window file. &quot;Line 3, Position 3&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I found that if I delete the player window file I could edit the rest of the UI visually. But I can't stand the look of the default player window. The only reason why I want to edit the player window is because of the hp/mana/stam bars. They all have those lines at the bottom of them. I hate those. And if that wasn't enough, the person who made it was using red/green for hp, and blue/white for mana. All I want to do is get rid of those lines, and I think I know how to do it. I recently downloaded some trial version of an xml editor, and made the changes I wanted, but it wouldn't save :mad: I tried three times and it didn't work.<br />
<br />
So what I want to know is, How exactly would I use notepad to edit xml files? I don't think I can save the files in .xml after I change it. And when I open xml files it opens up into a window that I am unable to edit or anything, so would I have to copy all the xml and paste it into notepad and edit it that way or what?</div></div><hr />

The error you recieved was most likely a result of a programmer note inserted into the playerwindow xml file within the first 3 lines of code. I had the same problem trying to load Vert in SidlWidl, I opened the pw file in notepad, deleted the &quot;Vert PlayerWindow&quot; note at the top, and it loaded fine in SW.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gave XMLSpy a try and succesfully edited the player window. :)<br />
<br />
On another note though when I loaded the window it said there were LOTS of errors/warnings in it. Not sure if that means anything important. I still cannot see it in SidlWidl but I found out how to edit it manually with xmlspy.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the tip lunakin, I'll have to try it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tuoneves</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those of you who are having problems getting a certain XML file to load in SidlWidl her is what is posted by the creator on his message board:<br />
<br />
Some files will not open if they are not 100% Xml conformant. EQ does not require this, but I do for now. What this means is that a few of the mods out there need to be manually edited to insure that the ?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;? tag is the very first, and the root XML tag is next. That's been the only problem I have found so far. <br />
<br />
I have found EVERY time a file wont open there is a coment entered by the author in the first 3 ines or so.<br />
just remove them and it will load fine.<br />
here is what the top of all my XML files look like:<br />
<br />
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;us-ascii&quot;?&gt;<br />
&lt;XML ID=&quot;EQInterfaceDefinitionLanguage&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;Schema xmlns=&quot;EverQuestData&quot; xmlns:dt=&quot;EverQuestDataTypes&quot; /&gt;<br />
<br />
if it looks like this your window will open in SidlWidle...<br />
Hope that helps<br />
