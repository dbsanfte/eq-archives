<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolleo</div><div class="date">09-13-2002, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a similar problem when I changed resolutions to a lower number. What happened, is the buff window reset to it's default size, but kept it's location where I had it at the higher reso. The result was it was sitting off the viewable area of my screen.<br />
<br />
I had to manually edit my ui_character_server.ini file and change the position of the buff window. I just slammed it about 100px from the top/left and saved. When I logged back in, the buff window was sitting in the middle of the screen, and I was able to stick it where I wanted to.<br />
<br />
Might help, might not. Worth a try though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavarien</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had the missing buff bar issue happen to me as well.  Here's how I resolved it:<br />
<br />
1.   Type: /Load default  (leave off the number 1, we want the boxes to go to the default locs)<br />
2.   Move the chat boxes and buff box to the the center of the screen.<br />
3.   Type /Load default 1<br />
4.   Type:  /Load &lt;whatever you named the UI folder&gt; 1  (Be sure to use the number 1 at the end to lock the widows in place while the UI loads)<br />
5.   Move and stretch the boxes as desired.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps  :)<br />
<br />
See ya, <br />
