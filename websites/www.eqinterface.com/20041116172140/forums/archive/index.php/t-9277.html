How do u get the char image into the inventory like so in this picture http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1847  <br />

Well the way i did it in the picture you used, I simply took a Screenshot of the character in game, and got the pose that she wanted. Then i took an Image Editing Program, (i use Paintshop Pro) and cut the character image out of the screenshot and shrunk it to a useable size. Next, I took the Inventory screen background graphic from the EQSkin folder that she was using (Slayer) and pasted the character clip into the center of the background image for the inventory window and then saved my work. The next time she logged in to EQ, **POOF** the inventory window had her character image in it. We also did this to her Hot button window background, i just had to shrink the character image alittle more was all.<br />

Hope that helps.<br />
