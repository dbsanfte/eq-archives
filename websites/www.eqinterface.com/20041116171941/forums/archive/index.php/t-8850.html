NOTES<br />
<br />
Moving / Resize Notes:<br />
<br />
Chat Window: to resize you can resize top border, and in the upper right and upper left corners you can stretch it's width. To move it, move the mouse one pixel down from the vertical resizing and click and hold to drag it around.<br />
 <br />
Moving the Selector Window: you must click on the far left or far right pixel to move it; this thin line is hard to find.</div></div><hr />

But I can only change how tall the chat window is and cant move it otherwise. Also the window selector window seems unmovable as well. Not sure if theres some trick to it or not.</div></div><hr />

Looks Great! But I can only change how tall the chat window is and cant move it otherwise. Also the window selector window seems unmovable as well. Not sure if theres some trick to it or not.  <br />
<br />
The chat window has a little lock above the up arrow, click that and then try moving it.  Not sure if that will make the final release or not. ;)<br />
<br />
As for the Window Selector, it's VERY hard to move right now but keep at it, you'll get it.<br />
<br />
Enok, think we can get a bit wider grab area for that window?</div></div><hr />

Actually, I think it will be work with the patch the 11th with no problems whatsoever. Have you tested this on test server or something and it failed? <br />
<br />
Just updated the post, I tried it on test and it worked fine. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well its now perfect. I have some cosmetic probs though. The background is too transparent (i already adjusted the transparency controls) when i have one window on top of another their both unreadable. Also more buttons on the window selector for windows would be nice but i already knew all the keyboard commands to open them. Those my only probs. Thanks for making my new permanent UI :)</div></div><hr />

That's why there's that GIANT tooltip that shows up when you mouse over and they aren't usable.<br />

P.S. - I'll get it worked out sometime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellyana</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried this out this morning. I did not like it. here is why...<br />
<br />
1- the  &quot;player&quot; window info where it is,the size it is and  in the format it is displayed is awkward. <br />
2- the chat windows are to difficult to position.<br />
3-  the combo &quot;window selector/hotbutton&quot; is a different look but the new look isnt worth the lost functionality.<br />
4- the Inventory screen is too bulky.<br />
5-I liked the spell cast window!<br />
6- I saw no modifications to any of the other windows, beides that semi-transparent background which IMO need to be a little darker and a little less transparent.<br />
7-I also liked the buff/Sdbuff windows, especially the way the buffs filled in from left to right!<br />
<br />
these are my opinions on the beta version i saw.</div></div><hr />

I have everything in its place now, and my only issues are the known hotbutton error, which isnt that big and the lag meter chain icon doesnt seem to work for me.<br />

For personal use I have changed the spell book and inventory to something else as I didnt much care for the default ones, but other than that this rocks! Maybe a little darker trans background, not sure. But I love this. Thank you for making it!<br />

<br />
Every UI I have seen had them going left to right.<br />
<br />
I thought that it was a limitation in the UI as for how they are drawn.<br />
<br />
It might be nice to have a screenshot for people to see what the UI looks like before downloading, that way they can see the concept.<br />

Just a suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 - 3.)  That is the basis of the skin is the unique format of these two elements.  Neither of them will be going through any major changes...<br />
<br />
I'm curious as to what you feel is lost in fuctionality...<br />
<br />
2.)  Please note the first comments in this thread...<br />
<br />
4.)  I entirely disagree, that is the exact format I was looking for in the skin. :)<br />
<br />
5.)  Glad you like that. ;)<br />
<br />
6.)  Right now that is the majority of the skin, I'm going to work other elements as inspiritaion hits. :)<br />
<br />
7.)  Another thing that I think is great. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your thoughts though I don't think you're going to care much for the final any more than this beta. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Group Window - Percentages or off center<br />
                           Fifth name font size bigger then others<br />
<br />
Spell Book - Memming bar is oddly placed so its under several graphics of the book.<br />
<br />
Chat - Cant click on the text input part where the typing would occur and cannot click on equipment links.<br />
<br />
Inventory - This is cosmetic but the size of all the text could be bigger<br />
<br />
Buff - Would like to see those icons put in regular order, cant seem to figure out a reason why you would want to reverse them.<br />
<br />
Background - Be nice if it were darker, had to change a lot fo text colors and rearrange a lot of windows</div></div><hr />

<br />
Group Window, I am not a grouper. ;)  So I've never noticed that. :)  Enok, check that will you?  ;)<br />
<br />
Chat box, simple fix.  Look above the Up Arrow, there is a little lock there.  Click it.  I think that will be going away shortly, not sure but I think I'm going to ask Enok to kill it.  It just drives me nuts. ;)<br />
<br />
Inventory, hrm, I thought about it but anything bigger makes the window even larger than it is and much more makes it hard for lower reses...<br />
<br />
The buffs?  Hrm, perhaps a place to have a mod made for normal also.  I like the Left to Right personally. :)<br />
<br />
Background?   Hrm, might need to check into that, it use to be REALLY bright. ;)  This is much lower than the original but worth looking into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, time to fire stuff off.<br />
<br />
Group window was completely untested. I can get every window to work perfect first try except that window. There's just so many repeats that I forget to change somethings (font size of last member for example). I'll fix that.<br />
<br />
Spellbook, the bar doesn't ACTUALLY go under the graphics. 50% of the bar is on the left of the thingy, 50% on the right, totalling 100%. This used to be symetrical when there was a close button on the right, I'll redo this a little.<br />
<br />
Chat, yeah yeah, I LOVE the lock but it's in my own personal UI so I can live with cutting it out of this one.<br />
<br />
Inventory, I could increase font size to default without moving any of the labels, so no space loss. They just wouldn't match most of the UI being at font size 1.<br />
<br />
Buff window. I'll just make a normal version as an optional downlaod. No biggie.<br />
<br />
Background, I'lls ee about making a slightly different background for chatbox so it's more readable (just as an option or something).<br />

Go for it Enok, I was actually thinking about that a little earlier myself. ;)<br />
<br />
Go ahead and kill the lock for now and see if people seem to say they want it, if they don't, then I think the kill is a good idea. :)<br />
<br />
I can't test the UI until I get back to my PC (On my notebook right now) but I'm sure that any fixes you put into effect will be fine. :)</div></div><hr />

The only real problem right now that I have is the backgrounds for the chat windows is to light. The moving part is not that much of a problem after I read your post on the lock button thingy. They realy should put a move command in the menu like Windows.<br />
I like the new spell idea and that is another thing, the spell book has the same problem as the chat windows. If your in the sand, you realy can't read it. <br />
But anyway, I think I am going to make this the default for all my characters. Think I am going to try out the other spell book for now. <br />
Thanks for the great UI.</div></div><hr />

You are probably right. maybe because it is such a departure from the EQ norm. after years of playing EQ it feels awkward for my eyes to travel to the top left corner to see my hp,mana etc..<br />
Heheh although I didnt seen to have a problem with this layout AC   :) Also I tend to like my fonts larger...my eyesight isnt that great and any  alleviation of eye strain is a plus. You two have done a nice enough job twisting the AC interface to fit EQ but it just doesnt work for me.<br />

<br />
Font size in group window<br />
Problem with links not working in windows- seems that u can make links from your inventory but not click on them<br />
Also found that only way to type in main window is to hit enter, click in the area with the mouse doesnt work<br />
<br />
Still would love a stats box someowhere possible such as the major ones , STA STR HP AC maybe in a horizontal bar just below the HP and Compass box would rock.<br />
<br />
Also just the problem with the hotbutton window.<br />
<br />
Besides the obvious I think it rocks.<br />
Great job you two and keep up the good work<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaros</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok first the bad news to get that out of the way.<br />
<br />
1. Moveability of the elements. Way to difficult as is, but you know that already. I think I gave myself carpal tunnel trying to land the cursor on that 1 pixel that would activate 'move'.<br />
<br />
2. The selector bar was doing weird things. I know you know about the hot button errors, which gives you that nice huge tooltip letting you know you have to reset them. This is seemingly related to that. <br />
<br />
After I got that error tooltip a few times, the selector endcaps became unmoveable. You know the parts with the buttons for group, actions, inventory etc. <br />
<br />
Even stranger, this carried over to the next character I enabled the UI for. Toon 1 got UI all positioned like the screenshot. Toon 2 I couldn't move the endcaps for the selector bar no matter how hard I tried. Weird eh?<br />
<br />
3. Names in the group window are really very small at 1280x1024 (my normal play res) it's not such a huge deal but would save a lot of squinting for those of us who play at high res, I'm too young for crows feet!<br />
<br />
Ok, now for the good news:<br />
<br />
when I got it all lined up on toon 1, it blew my mind. It's so open and clean and ... invisible! It's as though there's no ui on the screen at all. I think I stared at my screen for a good 5 minutes just amazed at how much of the game world I could actually see now.<br />
<br />
So my verdict is, when the bugs and user friendliness is ironed out, this UI is going to be truly stunning. I'll be switching all my toons over to it as soon as the windows become easily moveable. Very very good job you two.<br />

<br />
I personally LIKE it when windows are super hard to move (hence the reason the window are so hard to move) but, my fans have spoken and they demand easiness. So I'll change it.<br />
<br />
Now I'm gonna pass out.<br />

And now for the part where I tell you about bugs and whatnot.<br />
1) As stated in another reply is that the hotbutton bar has a bug that in order to fix it you have to push Alt+H twice. once to turn it off and twice to bring it back up. it'll work until you zone or log on (at least that's what it does with me)<br />
2) Whenever something is linked like gear or loot you can not click on it. It could be just me or not but I thought that you would to know so you can look into it.<br />
3) When I tried to move the option bar clicking it in some places caused the hotbar to dissapear. Which freaked me out but later I realized that it was something you setup. Not really a problem just thought you should tell ppl that clicking on it in certain spots will do that.<br />
So far that is all the bugs I have found so far. Now on to a request. This is only if you want to do it just wanted to ask. It is your baby and you can do what you want with it. But I was wondering if you could add a space on one of the windows that would show your stats like WIS and weight. Sometimes I like to be able to glance at it without haveing to open the inventory all the time. Something like this http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1428<br />
Anyhow I love this UI and I can't wait till you release the finished version, of course I won't be changeing the UI cause it is a beta. I can look past the faults. Also wanted to show you how i had it setup on my shammy cause I like it so much.<br />
One more thing I just love the cursor, it is so hard to find good cursors and this is the best by far.</div></div><hr />

I have already added a casting bar to the target window by myself but since I am not good at this UI custom thing it looks like crap. So I would love to see one done by the masters. =)<br />

<br />
Ok, uploaded the UI. ACUI Beta v2. Stuff that changed:<br />
<br />
Spellbook - Right aligned the right page. Centered gauges.<br />
<br />
Group Window - Fixed last group member name size. Percentages are NOT off-center. They are where they're supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Chat Window - Remade it. You can still drag it if you're careful (down one pixel from stretching the top edge). If that's too hard, resize to move. No more lock.<br />
<br />
Minor bug fixes.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - Next two posts will be custom mods.<br />
<br />
P.P.S. - Attached to this post is an extra dark, less transparent chat texture. Try it if you have trouble reading the chat and let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />

This is the best UI ever. Of course there is still the hotbutton issue but I assume you know that. I personally still do not care for the inventory window so I replaced it once again.

And Enok, if possible I would like the casting bar in the target window some bigger, I can barely see it in this one, and maybe a bit brighter in color if that is possible. And I would like to super-size it to go please. Oh wait... forgot where I was for a second. lol<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dinian</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Experimented with the beta 2 using my druid twink.<br />
<br />
My first recommendation would be to eliminate the casting gauge from the player window and move it to the target window.<br />
<br />
I found myself very disoriented with the packaging of so much data on the upper left hand corner of the screen while keeping the party and target somewhere else (I tried to model the setup after Enok's screenshot).<br />
<br />
I suppose this would be fine for soloing and what not, but it is extremely frustrating for a healer to move their focus all over the place since their HP, their mana, and their spell casting bar is so far from the other interesting data. I suppose one quick work around would be to have another guage above the rest of the group to represent the current player. However, I am not sure this would be the ideal solution as the player window on the upper left appears to be a design decision.<br />
<br />
My work-around today was to simply move the group window to the upper left and move the target below it. Very strange indeed focusing on the upper left when I'm so used to focusing on the lower half of the screen for EQ data.<br />
<br />
I'll get back to you on other stuff, unfortunately I couldn't play long today since I was dutifully working on Microsoft products late into the day *cough* *cough* ;)<br />
<br />
Incredible job with this Enok, and excellent design Elezibeth.<br />
<br />
Additional note: I found this UI to be extremely playable at the 1024x768 resolution. To the same extent that I found it difficult to play at 1280x1024 and completely unplayable at 1600x1200 (too easy to get lost when the player window is so far from everything else).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dinian</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Followup:<br />
<br />
I modified the UI in a few places.<br />
<br />
- removed the custom hotbutton and window selector<br />
- attempted to replace the stamina guage in the player window with the current target guage repeated (but obviously larger than the target window).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I seem to have run into a bug with my stamina -&gt; target guage change. Probably due to the ordering of elements in the screen element at the end of the XML file, the 2nd digit of the &quot;target&quot; gauge is always fixed to zero.<br />
<br />
My hunch is that is the mana percentage taking precedence (i.e. 0%) and hiding whatever the stamina percent label is trying to draw. Unfortunately, if this is true then any work around for this will result in the UI showing an erroneous mana percentage on caster toons.<br />

Once u made yours the standard hotbuttons it went back to everyone elses UI :( <br />
<br />
Oh well I think at least for me it rocks.<br />
A fix on the hottbutton thing , which is annoying but I know prolly a pain in the arse to fix.<br />
And a bar underneath the compass and HP bar that has stats for <br />
STA, Dex, AC STr etc would rock<br />
just a thin bar just like the compass bar with stats would rock , but i guess maybe STA and STR and AC would be awesome, let me know if you can maybe do that as a pet Bar for me Enok, instead of the existing Pet Box.<br />

<br />
I saw that you have 1 window selector button connected to the hotbutton window. I figure you can just take one whole side of the window selector part and attacht it to a side of the hotbutton window. Instead of having the hotbutton window in the middle of a split window you could just have 2 windows side by side and it would still look the same. <br />
<br />
Dont know if you can move the buttons around that much but i figured i might suggest it. Trying to think of a way to fix it because this UI would be perfect for me except for that problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brumuur</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded your beta2 and messed with it some.  I saw that the spellbook was fixed and I still think that this UI is one of the best looking to date.<br />
<br />
Previously I posted that I thought the target/casting window would look good if it were larger.  I did not download the one posted as it was mentioned that it was small.  I run at 1600x1200 which may prejudice me to larger guages.  <br />
<br />
All the modification requests and input regarding this UI is a testament to your craftsmanship.  I may attempt to alter your target/casting gauge to look like http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1476 and if I have any success I will post it.  I have no problems swapping pieces but I rarely have success when it is necessary to edit the code.  Wish me luck...<br />

Also, I'm curious if it would be possible to get these same gauges  in the group window?  Just the HP and pet of course...</div></div><hr />

The chat windows are still hard to move, like Enok said. I don't suppose you could make them as easy to move as the other windows? Yeah you can resize them to move them, but then you are stretching the window all around the screen like an inchworm lol. That's my only complaint actually. It's very minor.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact I even switched it over to my mains UI. It's that good. I totally love it and don't see myself switching out for a long time, if ever =)<br />

would like some kind of right click / inventory-bag slot 1-8 / primary &amp; secondary window, maybe built into the friends window or some such. i played my bard last night with the new windows, and not having right clicks / bags / weps available unless i opened up the inventory window made gameplay too difficult. i had to switch back to my old ui for that reason.<br />

maybe you could add a bag slots / weapon slots option above the hotkeys with a separate window for right clickables.<br />

Hi Revol, just logged in and saw your comment...  First off, there are no known issues with bags...should be easy enough to move...that is an odd bug that hasn't been reported before...<br />

Double check to insure your windows are set to 'locked' in the right click menu...</div></div><hr />

For the buffs window, check a page or so back, I think Enok posted one of those. :)<br />
<br />
To address what everyone is saying about the larger target window...I don't foresee a major change in the 'RTM' build of the UI but I'm sure someone will write a larger targeting window and if it's good, maintains the skins look, I might see about packaging it as an option for the skin. :)</div></div><hr />

Have a paper to write today, then two finals friday and moving out. If I get a chance later today (it's 2 am so I mean at like noon) I'll try to fix some things and release a version 3.<br />
<br />
Also, I just got level 57 (which is pretty useless for a mage, it's the dumb gap between the awesome levels of 56 and 58). And I got a Signet of Grisk which I'm proud of because me, plus a 65 Druid (Haliken, the REAL Haliken) and my 61 Ranger buddy Rallere, killed the crazy skeleton in Tox forest (has like 32k hp, hits for 375, summons). I also got 1 AA and a decent charm from the new PoP flag junk they gave as rewards. Haliken got 2 AAs, my friend on Stormhammer got 7 and a godly charm (for a mage, 12 int 80 mana plus tons of other stats).<br />
<br />
AloneStarwalker: expect me to make a lot of options for this mod once it's released.<br />
<br />
Revol: to move bags click on the name. The borders aren't dragable. This is so it's harder to accidently move bags. Personally, I love them (note that they can be dropped into any mod, just copy over EQUI_Container.xml).<br />
<br />
Alaros: next version, chat windows will be better.<br />
<br />
Brumuur: as stated above, I will make many optional downloads for this UI including a larger verion.<br />
<br />
Nelioch: can't move button to a different window. My original idea doesn't seem to be functioning right. Exploring an alternative.<br />
<br />
Teannas: your requests will be covered post release. This UI is supposed to sorta be a space saver in it's default form. Showing stats all the time is wasteful (in my opinion). And thanks for the compliment.<br />
<br />
Dinian: I'll make a modded release for you too after the mod is finished. It's complicated why I left the second digit locked at 0. It IS because the mana percent overlaps it and for meleers is always zero. If you want to, convert the mana gauges/percents to the current target info and that should work.<br />
<br />
Also, everyone should note that they CAN put windows wherever they want. I personally would never have a player window in the upper left, I'd just put it in the upper right. But as far as trying to match the initial design goes, it's an upper left window. :D<br />

Currrently I am using two other little windows with this and it is perfect with them added. The inventory window below is a more classic look which I really like and am more comfortable with. Plus I have the target window below set to &quot;0&quot; normal and &quot;0&quot; fade so as to make it kind of invisible except when I have a target or casting. Now the UI is perfect. The only thing now is a the little hotbutton issue, which I use the keyboard more anyway so doesn't really bother me too bad.<br />

<br />
It's np, your work is beautiful and easily understandable and modifiable to anybody's tastes... I look forward to v3, and I'll probably try to swing together a more raid-centric version of this UI.<br />
<br />
One more thing: how difficult would it be to add permanent buff names below the buff buttons in your left to right buff window when you make the larger screen version?<br />
<br />
For 1024 and lower I *love* the proportion, size, and lack of buff names. However, when I pump up to 1280 or 1600, the space is not a critical issue anymore and I start missing those names ;)</div></div><hr />

P.S. - One quick reply to dinian: stats always showing is still a personal preference, I do raid, but after I'm buffed a glance at stats and basically know where I stand. I don't need to know I have specifically 203 DR when just knowing I have around 200 will do. But I will make you a stats window eventually, I promise. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead of having selector window buttons left and right of the hotbuttons, could you instead put hp/mana on the left and target info on the right? Whilst keeping the look of the current selector window.<br />
<br />
Also, vertical buff window would be nice.<br />
<br />
Would be nice if you could make a group window about the size of the actions window too, since the way I like my UI is group info on left of chat box and the actions on the right. Which means that right now there's a space that looks quite out of place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Working on what might be called ACUI Revision 2.<br />
<br />
I've come into possession of some slightly higher resolution images as well as deciding to take some of the lower quality ones and do them again by hand...<br />
<br />
This is allowing me to implement a few other things that I wanted to do originally but couldn't because of lack of imagery...<br />
<br />
Nothing new to show yet, the new Map window isn't quite finished nor is the new Inventory design, but expect to see more smooth-lines that match the bottom bar's style in the forth coming revision...</div></div><hr />

The first public preview of a new element of the ACUI rev 2.0 window I'm working on...<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind, this isn't code, this isn't final...this is just a Photoshop Mockup...<br />
<br />
Just so you know, this window is about HALF the area of previous one so I've got to see if I can mockup all the data inside it. ;)<br />
<br />
All black areas are the transparent black you are all use to.  I am excluding all un-needed items such as the class animation (given the entire window will be a Auto-Equip area).<br />

<br />
;)  One at a time...<br />
<br />
Glad you like the Inventory! :)<br />
<br />
Yes, I do have plans to rework the spellbook not far off the current design but implementing a few other tricks to it that I've been reading about and thinking up. ;)<br />
<br />
As for many changes...yes.  As was said, I suppose you could consider what I'm designing a version of ACUI Pro, a few graphical upgrades (Still trying to hold down the lag though) along with a few changes/additions as were suggested around here.  However, most of the elements you all have come to love in the massive screen open area will still be around. ;)<br />
<br />
I think I've realized the hotbutton issue (Layering, am I right Enok?) and not sure what to do to fix it. :P<br />
<br />
The answer to the woodchuck problem is 12 board feet. ;)<br />
<br />
And the sky is blue due to the mixture of Oxygen and Nitrogen in our atmosphere. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elezibeth, yes the hotbutton is a layering problem. I THOUGHT I had a workaround for this, but it just isn't stinking working! I'm afraid I'm gonna have to say that the selector window won't be able to be on both sides of the hotbutton box at once. =(<br />
<br />
I would suggest trying to reformat the bottom bar like:<br />
 _____________ . _______________ . ____________<br />
[Selector Window][Hotbutton Window][Actions Window]<br />
  '  ' <br />
This was a suggestion by a person interested in this UI early on and I think we should try it out.<br />
<br />
Are we gonna want to wait for a revision two of this UI or work your new stuff into the current UI? I'm game either way. And really excited and relieved that I have vacation now. I'm moving in a month but I have time. =D<br />

the sky is blue because blue is a lighter shade of black. i.e. the color of space. ;p</div></div><hr />

Remember that option we had originally of having a new window but it would require to be 100% at all times by default?  Is that still a possible option?<br />
<br />
As for the r2 Elements, don't hold up on them.  I will work at getting them into RTM mode and show them as I can but don't hold up the newer builds for them.  I have a hell of a lot of tweaking and work to get them done, I am planning on trying to represent all the different windows in some way. ;)</div></div><hr />

Is what isn't working like I had planned. I can stick gauges and labels in this window but the buttons (to my amazement) don't work even though they're on a child piece of the main window. This works in some cases but apparently not in this one.<br />

<br />
This is what ACUI was envisioned by me originally and I cut a lot of stuff out since I didn't know if it could be done...keep in mind, some of the windows are still in concept fashion (again) but I'm sure you will be able to see the raw quality increase of the imagery I had to work with even in this small shot. ;)<br />
<br />
Quick Explanation of the new features...<br />
<br />
Health / Stam / Mana features have been moved and integrated into a larger secondary command bar...<br />
<br />
The 1-4 buttons are a substitute for what I had intended to be the Actions Dialog which would 'drop down' it's menus, I know that isn't possible so what you are seeing is truly a placeholder for a new idea.<br />
<br />
The blank box next to that is going to be the new Targeting Window with integrated casting timer.<br />
<br />
Next box is the Super Secret Square. ;)  I'm not saying what I plan to put there...<br />
<br />
So...thats the quick run down along with the new inventory screen so just getting thoughts and suggestions so far... :)<br />

<br />
What about the idea of moving the window selector back to the top and making it in the style of the top bar, and then putting the player info and target plus secret square down with the hot buttons? Would that fix the hot button issue?<br />
<br />
I love that inventory, can't wait to have it. That all looks much better graphically too. Great work! Thanks for your efforts on this project.<br />

P.S. Oh and what resolution is that screenshot at? That top bar looks like it might be a bit big for 1024x768. Just curious.<br />
<br />
P.S.S. Um there is no spell bar. And do you think we might be able to have current xp and aa somewhere on the ui other than just inventory, like with the current ACUI with the playerwindow?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Margrave</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah for some reason in that screenshot comparison the one labeled &quot;old&quot; looks better, maybe just because it has the scrollbar and the little button on the bottom right.<br />
<br />
I do like the buff bar there better than the 1-4 from the other screenshot. I just thought since there seems to be no fix for the window selector /hotbutton issue if the next step would be to consider repositioning the windows themselves. Since the selector cannot be broken up between the hotbuttons without error maybe put the window selector back as a whole window somewhere and place something else on the sides of the hotbuttons?<br />
<br />
Haven't tried the new casting bar yet but I can't wait to. I can see a small casting bar in the target window of the new screenshot. I love the idea of having it there. Do you think it might be made a little bigger and maybe a bit brighter in color? And do you plan on putting xp and aa somewhere on the ui itself? Just some questions. Thanks for all your hard work. Can't wait to see the new graphics. Woo!<br />

Yes, most of the things from r1 (Labeling and the like) will make it through the transition to r2. :)<br />
<br />
The space below the Air meter is going to be either statistical data on resists or attributes since I plan to anchor the compass in a slightly different spot. ;)<br />

Working on a mockup I like a bit better now in that area so I'll post the update when I get it done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just got the 'fix' from Enok...  <br />
<br />
Now, I'm in no way slighting his work (he's great) but if that is how it'll have to be I'm going to end up trashing the majority of the concept behind this UI and end up removing the things which make it unique. :(<br />
<br />
Why?  I can't stand the only way to fix it we've found and I'm not seeing a fix in the near future without the developers fixing their buggy code in EverQuest.<br />
<br />
As a result, I'm going to suspend any further development work on the newer r2 release...  As it stands right now, I don't think there is a way we're going to find to get that bottom bar to operate. :(<br />
<br />
I will keep you guys informed of any developments.  :(</div></div><hr />

I've been running through a dozen different ideas using my r2 source file to alleviate the problem but to date I've yet to find one that is both functional and ascetically pleasing out of about (Not exaggerating) 400 design attempts, it's driven me so far that I've gone to bed frustrated to hell that I can't figure it out...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that was the single most missed part of the original design. ;)<br />
<br />
The entire design has been made around that bar. ;)  That was (in all honesty) my entire reason for starting this project.  Wanted to get a concept like that into EQ.<br />
<br />
I knew the risk when I posted the Mockup that it might be impossible but if I go about implanting a version of this concept with a pod interface which would be what is required, then I start getting into the realm of design where everyone else already is. :(<br />
<br />
Sleeping on it isn't going to help unless divine knowledge hits me and gives me a work around because I've slept on this stupid problem for about a week now (while doing r2.)<br />

If so, could you possibley move all 8 to the one side and possible make 8 identical slots on the other side that would be right click items?  It will make the window much wider, but you wouldn't have to have the hotbutton window overtop of the selector window...they would be side by side instead.  Just a suggestion.  ;)   Good luck with coming up with something because it is a great looking skin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">tch that bar is easy to fix with some imagination. One way i thought was keeping it the same size and taking out the hotbutton part and puttin in more window selector buttons and putting the hot bar above the chat window with some nice corner designs at the ends to smoothly form it into the chat box. Or you can blow the spell bar up a bit and set it up vertically next to that and make it look like one device. Hell i'd do this myself but i suck ass with art otherwise it'd be cake for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dang you want to quit over the selector window?!? Holy cow. I never even use the dang thing, it's pretty but that is it. I can run my char in game faster with keyboard shortcuts. I say you take that original r2 screen with the playerwindow, and the target window stylized on  the top and flip the graphics vertically. Then put them on either side of the hotbuttons on the bottom. That way the hotbutton window has nothing to fall behind, and problem solved. As for the selector window, flip its graphics vertically as well and line it up at the top of the window on either side of the buffs window. Who cares if it falls behind the selector or not? How often do you need to click off buffs. Every now and then but that wouldn't be that big a deal to turn off buffs and back on since you would be needing to click on it so rarely!<br />
<br />
I can't believe your wanting to quit over something so small in the cleanest UI ever designed. Dang, we never even got that kick butt inventory window of yours or the new chat design. If you want to quit that is your choice but your project now has a base and people that are expecting and hoping for updates. If you don't want to continue pass the PSD files to another, so that the dream does not die.<br />

That said I've been using this UI since R1 beta was released, on all my characters. The hotbutton bug happens so rarely that when it does it barely registers to me. I just hit alt-h and keep on going with whatever I was doing. This UI is good enough, that I can live with that, and WILL live with that bug, forever if needed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Margrave</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not think that just hotbar lined up with the selector window made the UI what it is. It is all of it together. The custom playerwindow is a big part of the look of this UI also. What made this UI so great to me was it using so very little screen space. That made it the ideal UI for me. I now use it on all my chars and will continue to regardless. I still think that repostioning the windows can be a nice fix if the hotbutton error is deemed that big a problem.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of having all my important info down near the chat area so that your eyes don't have to travel too far on the screen for anything you might need to see, like in my suggestion in my previous post. I do know that this is just my opinion, and so I do hope that I have no made anyone mad. If so, I am sorry. But I love this UI and hate to think about it's development coming to a stop over one small issue.<br />

And what do you think of using the spell icon set from http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4464 I like them, there a bit more colorful? Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've given consideration to that but due to the lack of accurate images to base buttons off of I've abandoned it...<br />
<br />
The current design I posted there is something I'm extremely unhappy with, to put it in simple terms I think it looks like ****.  *sigh*<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I don't think I'm left with much of a choice.  The lack of the lower bar in a decent style is slowly but surely taking the wind out of my sails too but I don't see any way to get it to work properly.  Sony needs to implement authoritative layers in their designs so that you can set one element to be locked behind another.  Think if I asked them really nice? :P</div></div><hr />

I think that was a great idea, I had not thought of doing it that way. I thought that looked great. I don't think a lack of symetry is a big enough deal. Remember, form follows function, not the other way around. That last screen had me excited until I read all the posts after it and how people reacted. And as for the left over circle on the far right, why not make that the lag meter? I thought it was a good idea..... dang...<br />

It's worth a shot actually. Not that you'd get a response right away but you could try, who knows maybe they could even give you a tip to get around it. The only thing I would worry about is if they see your work and start thinking about copyrights and stuff.<br />
<br />
I have to say again though, I'm happy with it as is. The error doesn't happen very often. Doesn't happen to ME when I zone, only when I change hotkey banks, and even then, only occurs about 1 in 10. On top of that, since I use the keyboard to trigger the hotbuttons, it doesn't affect me at all. Even with the error it still works.<br />
<br />
If you do decide to go with the asymetrical layout you posted, 1013 I think you called it, that would work, it would still have the spirit of the theme at least and have the function you wanted as well, even if not balanced.<br />
<br />
lol I don't know why I posted this, this ui just been on my mind a lot lately and I wish I was an xml wizard so I could help. I don't suppose you could actually add the hotbuttons to the selector window could you? I mean intergrate it into the actual file or something? I'm assuming Enok has already explored all avenues though so won't be surprised if he thought of that already. Cause in a perfect world if you could do that you could make the button layout whatever you wanted. Yeah I know wishful thinking.<br />
<br />
As always, appreciate both of your work on this, it must be maddening.<br />
<br />
take care,<br />

<br />
that's juste a (great) UI :p<br />
<br />
my opinion : leave the hotbuttons/selector windows as they are now, they are great and the layer bug is not much of a trouble (same bugs happen xith cairenn's UI, with the buff bar, you can't click out the buff if you don't ALT B before upon zoning) and ppl can leave with it :D<br />
<br />
i'd say : just keep focused en r2, now that i've seen some shots of it, i want it ! :D<br />
<br />
and by the way : great job Liz and Enok ! keep on ! :)</div></div><hr />

It's great. I love it. I am assuming that the little bars on the right under the target are XP and AA? What are the blank areas underneath them for? And the blank areas under the player window? Is that for stats and such like you said earlier? If so is there a chance to get a version of this UI made without that? You know like one download with those and one without, kind of like ACUI Lite, tastes great and less screen filling. =) Just curious. Looks great!<br />
<br />
Thanks for still going on with this UI!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaros</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That R2 shot is nice work, the graphics are really clean on that one. I hope you will do R1 with those source files. <br />
<br />
There's only a couple things I don't like about R2. <br />
<br />
First is just personal preference. The bar at the top seems really... thick, and kinda would make me feel like being in a car with a low roof. If you get my meaning. But that's just me, and if I get to actually try it in game it may not be as noticeable as it seems to be.<br />
<br />
The other thing is the chat box frame. The scroll bar outside the window like that seems too off balance, you know like it's just stapled to the side of the box kind of. Not real clean. Also would make it hard for those of us who like to align chat windows to get a clean look. I for one have no less than 3 windows up, with R1 I can have all three side by side with no gaps. I couldn't do that with that scroll bar hanging off the edge. But once again, that's just me :)<br />
<br />
Your UI has really changed the game for me m'lady, I used to be all crammed behind dashboard and stat windows and now it's like being in a convertible :) wide open! I love your work and glad to see you're going to carry on!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I played the whole day with your UI and changed the position of the windows serveral times and found a great solution the position the windows for me. Your UI takes less space and provides more informations then my old and I like the transparent windows.<br />

Last night, I had a friend over who brought her son with her...I turned my back for one minute and he had DELETED my revision 2 folder and I have officially lost all previous work on the r2 Interface.<br />
<br />
I could have cried...in-fact, last night, I think I did. :P<br />
<br />
r2 is dead. :(<br />
<br />
Now, for the good news...<br />
<br />
As of 12:00pm 6-22-2003 I'm now the proud mother of a new User Interface hence forth known as ACUI rev3.<br />
<br />
Given I lost the files in r2 and a few things I wasn't happy with anyway, I sat down with my background screenshot and the source file backup from my PC and have begun a reconstruction.  This time taking the time to entirely rebuild my own elements in the UI in addition to using the high quality source files. :)<br />
<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen...allow me to present the first ever shot of the new r3 interface.<br />
<br />
Please note the majority is the same but the buttons in the Inventory Window are now made of the same source file as the Images in the hotbutton bar to further improve uniformity.<br />

R3 is on temporary hold.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because I'm installing Mac OSX 10.3 in the morning and have spent the night archiving up my system to insure I don't loose anything (I mean, seriously, who would DARE update an OS?  Reinstall is the only way to go EVEN on a Mac)<br />
<br />
Soon as Panther is up and running, I'll let you guys know and get back to work on R3. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Margrave</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tinkfu, I don't have the uneven bar at the bottom that I was referring to in what I posted. I cannot make such a thing as I do not have the graphics in order to. Elezibeth posted a screen a while back of a possible new layout for the bottom bar of the UI, a few people said they did not like how it was not even, and then she said that since she could find another solution, she was going to quit work on this UI.<br />
<br />
   Then a bunch of other people posted saying how this is one of the best UIs ever, and she decided to continue her work, and just leave the bottom bar as it is currently. I think I must be the only one, but I liked the newer design of the bottom bar, I even kind of liked how it was uneven, but I guess I am an unstable person. lol The only thing I have done in the shot I posted was mostly just change the target window to mimic the player window that Elezibeth and Enok had done. <br />
<br />
   I discovered for myself as I was redoing the target window that the lag meter was no lag meter. That was one of my main motivations for moving my info back down to my chat window so as to turn the real lag meter back on. I didn't think that was skin-able.... lol<br />
<br />
   Elezibeth, I work at a college in my town, in fact I'm one of the senior, lead technicians in support here. When we change the OS in our labs campus-wide we make our software loads on one machine from scratch and the use ghost to deploy it all over campus. So I understand where you are coming from with the OS install and backup... Take you time, the wait will just make R3 all the sweeter.<br />

BWAHAHAHAHAHA! Woo, that's hilarious. Now back to our regularly scheduled program:<br />
<br />
I'm finishing up the trimming of the border around spells down to one pixel. That was so much tedious coding, you have no idea. Expect something tomorrow (and I mean it for once, heh).<br />
<br />
Anyways, any bugs/complaints/etc. with the current beta?<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - I have an uneven hotbutton/selector window already coded and graphic'd. I'll release it with all the other optional mods to this UI after the release version is done.<br />
<br />
P.P.S. - Also, glad to hear it's a MAC that the graphics are being done on. I do not like MACs but I willingly acknowledge their superiority when it comes to graphics, movie and sound editing. They suck for games though (just cause they don't have any).<br />
<br />
P.P.P.S. - Who's been drinking bootleg hooch and listening to the jazz?</div></div><hr />

<br />
as of the bugs/complaints/rants/mothers-in-law/...<br />
<br />
nothing at the moment... i now use this UI on my main toon with no problem at all. just d/l'ed the beta 3 and... well... i don't see what has changed :p must be some coding cleaning ?<br />
<br />
but i have a little request : give us a clicky window (inventory slot + bag slots, or maybe a 6 to 8 slots clicky window easily customisable -can we say that ?-)<br />
as a warrior, i need to change rather often my weapons, and use my clickies. of course, i could (and i do now :p) do it the good old fashioned way : a hotbuttons set up on page 2 for my clickies but i must confess that since i use custom UI i've always been using a clicky window (blame Vert please, that's all is fault)<br />
<br />
i think you could maybe change the friend window... maybe... :)</div></div><hr />

but since Haliken allready has a version working I'll stop work on my plugin..<br />

for clickies, cause I use em too, I just dropped Drakah's window seperates mod of the friends window in. It works fine and has the acui look as it doesn't have any graphics that go with it. The one I'm using is here: http://www.shakahr.com/download.php?op=getit&amp;lid=20<br />

<br />
i gave it a try, but i'd need at least a 1 bag slot (2 would be better :p) and i don't need to have a full inv just some slots...<br />
that's why i wanted somethink easily customisable (?) :)<br />
<br />
but that would fit for the moment :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After release I will make some sort of right-click item window, but for now, either find one (there're TONS) that drops in that you like OR just hotkey some items to hotkeybank 2 (or 3 or whatever you don't use) and just use the hotkey'd slots. It doesn't get any more easily customizable than that. And then you can press the number to right click the item instead of having to right click it. My personal hotkey bank has a special item guard so I can hotkey items and right-click them, but cannot pick them up (if I want to move items, I'll open my inventory). But that's how I play; if everyone played the way I do, there'd be no such thing as right-click item windows.<br />

Like usual I HAVEN'T got anything new to release yet. I'm really sorry. I'd like to give reasons for why there's no ALMOST-final ACUI R1 yet. But they won't make it happen any faster.<br />
<br />
I promise I'll give you guys something tomorrow. Cross my heart.<br />
<br />
Two of my friends had catastophic computer failure last night (tuesday night). One had something lovely go wrong with his hard drive so his computer wouldn't recognize it anymore. I changed the power supply cable (the little dealie that plugs into the harddrive) and everything seems better now. Told that friend to go get a new power supply. My other friend's video card died on him for no apparent reason. He doesn't play games or do anything that would put strain on a video card. I'm just glad we figured out what the problem was. But this ate up my day. No EQ for me at all.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - Uh, I'm their tech guy so that's why them having computer trouble ate up my day. I'm my town's cheapest computer repair dude: I work for free or the occasional &quot;have dinner with us!&quot; although a few people have managed to force a $20 into my hand now and again.<br />
<br />
P.P.S. - Wrapping up ACUI R1 and my own Enoks UI Sleek for release. These will both hopefully be crowd pleasers (ACUI more than my UI, people just don't dig my personal style :D).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things Gone:<br />
<br />
 Top Bar - Why ask for more problems like the bottom is producing.<br />
 Overly Fancy Chat Box - Going to simplify it even a little further than the r1.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Things In:<br />
<br />
 Player Stats - As shown below the original design is back but I am going to be making some major updates to some of the rudimentary design.<br />
 New Inventory - Updated the the new design, much less area than the r1 with the same information.<br />
 Updated Images - I trashed all r1 graphics and am using straight source files now which, in some instances, are up to 200% clearer than the default r1 images.<br />
<br />
<br />
So without further ado...the first image of r3 from OS X 10.3 ;)<br />

Well you've been Hyping this for over 3 weeks lol<br />
R1 ..then R2  no Wait back to R1...Wait until you see R3 :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
..and you're welcome. No charge for the insight.<br />
<br />
P.S. Good Luck I really cant wait to see what comes of this.<br />
P.P.S. Elezibeth you work in PR or CS don't you?  <br />
<br />
One man's hype is another man's preview updates.<br />
<br />
I have no release time for r3 right now given that there is absolutely no coding being done on it as of yet...<br />
<br />
r1 is the current 'Beta' build which will be 'RTP (Release to Public)' Final long before the work will ever see even a part of the r3 interface.<br />
<br />
Compare this to Microsoft...<br />
<br />
Windows XP wasn't even RTM and MS was already leaking images of Longhorn and Media Center Edition to the press to keep their appetites wet for the future.  That is the reason behind r3. :)<br />
<br />
r3 is just a looking-glass to the future.<br />
<br />
As for Customer Service, sure have worked in CS in the past for a Major Software Manufacturer. ;)</div></div><hr />
