I have been looking at all the files with &quot;peter's XML editor&quot;, but i can't find anything about borders, or backgrounds.... al the background stuff i find is for the chat box, and inside the inventory slots.<br />
can someone guide me in the right direction to changing the borders?? <br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A good start is to look in your AboutSIDL.doc file.  It talks about how the xml is coded for the EQUI.<br />
<br />
The borders are defined by your DrawTemplate and all the defaults are in the EQUI_Templates.xml file.  They are found under WindowsDrawTemplates.<br />
<br />
There are twelve pieces that make up each border, and four of them are coded to expand to fit the window size.  There are also three pieces that make up the TitleBar.  Only one of them expands.  The default border pieces will be found in your EQUI_Animations.xml file.  They are pretty clearly labeled there with comments, and are all Ui2DAnimations.<br />
<br />
The actual graphics for the defaut borders are found in your windows_pieces01.tga.  There was a thread around there that had a breakdown of what graphic was what piece, but you can also find that out by looking at the Ui2DAnimation code.<br />
<br />
Unless the windows that you have added have been coded with there own borders, you can simply change the  DrawTemplate of eash of your windows to the same thing.  Like WDT_Rounded or something.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps some.</div></div><hr />
