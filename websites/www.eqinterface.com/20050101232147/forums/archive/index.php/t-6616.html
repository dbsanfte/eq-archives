<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morfink</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok...I downloaded this ui.  I followed the directions that came with the file.  I renamed the ini file that came with it to UI_Morfink_26 (on the tunare server).  I then copied that into my everquest directory (where I did not have a previous UI_Morfink_26 ini file).  I did place the folder (which I called DruidUI) in the UIFiles (I do have other mods I couldn't get to work in there too, would that do anything?)  I logged in and typed /loadskin DruidUI true.  It did the whole &quot;zone screen&quot; thing for a second and then came back...still the same.  so I go into the FAQ section.  after searching through...I come upon the link of http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5231.  I do everything it says.  however...number 2...I did not have NewUI=True in my eqclient.ini.  so I added it.  made sure everything was as the thread had specified.  log back in, and still nothing.  dunno what to do.  here's the link to the skin I want http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=939.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">03-02-2003, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, guys, the only way your UIError.txt file has nothing in it is if you made a copy of your default folder and then overwrote that copy with your custom files.  Do not do this.  All you are doing is creating more problems for yourselves.  Go through the F.A.Q. and the three stickied threads in the ReadMe subforum of this forum for the proper way to install a UI skin, and the most common errors and how to find and fix them.  If you still have no luck after that, come on back to this forum and post your UIError.txt log file.</div></div><hr />
