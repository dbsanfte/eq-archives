<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maegwin</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I'm trying to do is this: I'm trying to create a completely new window to hold all the player statistcs so I can take them off the inventory window.<br />
<br />
What I did was, copy the buff window xml file, renamed it to PlayerStatisticsWindow.xml, deleted all the buff icon pieces, and just for a test, put my character level onto the new window ( and removed it from the inv window ).<br />
<br />
I also included the PlayerStatisticsWindow.xml file in the EQUI.xml file in the &lt;Include&gt; tags.<br />
<br />
When I load the package, I don't get any compile errors, but the new window doesn't show up.  I am kinda at a loss to explain why it won't show up, since technically, the new window should be showing up.  Anyone else tried to do this?  <br />
<br />
Is it even possible to create new windows beyond what comes with the defualt package?  I don't see why you couldn't...</div></div><hr />

<br />
for a workaround it should be possible to take a pre-existing window that you don't use (such as the pet window for non-pet classes) , gut it and put the stuff you want into it</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far I've had no luck unless Vi have changed it since last patch.  You can download my Invent/Pet window.  I had the same thought as you and tried exactly what you did but gave up and just replaced my pet window with all the player info.  You don't really need the pet window anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no information in SIDL about the windows, and I do not see anything in the EQUI that would create new windows. I have checked the EQUI_Templates and EQUI_Animations both to no avail.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell all changes allowed the MODer are superficial window dressing type.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, can you not call a new window from within a window???<br />
Something like &lt;screen&gt;<br />
&lt;Child&gt;<br />
&lt;Loadmyfilehere/&gt;<br />
&lt;/Child&gt;<br />
&lt;/screen&gt;</div></div><hr />
