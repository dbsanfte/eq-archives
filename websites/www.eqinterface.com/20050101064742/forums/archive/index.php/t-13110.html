Help - I want to train! :)<br />
<br />
Edit: I should note it's any &quot;choice&quot; box - example - it always happens when trying to loot NODROP items too...anyone know what that window is titled? I've looked thru my UI directories and can't figure it out :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
A friend said to delete the Default UI folder and re-download it, and that did nothing.  Anyone have any suggustions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had same problems... including the suggestion in the above linked post not help me at all.<br />
<br />
I'll spare you the gory details of how I figured this out, but this is what I did to solve the problem.  First, make sure you're completely logged out of EQ.  Find the UI_charname_servername.ini file for the character in question.  Open that file in notepad.  Hit the F3 key to open up the Find dialogue.  Find the phrase &quot;popdialog&quot;. (without the quotes).  When notepad takes you to the matching text in the file, look at the lines immediately below that.  Within a few lines you should see a pair of lines that look like this:<br />
<br />
Width1024x768=274<br />
Height1024x768=200<br />
<br />
The values at the end of each line should be different.  In fact, I'm willing to bet that in your case the values are less than what they are in the example above.  What you need to do is to change the values of these lines in your file so they are at least 274 and 200 respectively as in the above example.  Then, search the file again for &quot;popdialog&quot;.  You may have a [PopDialog0] section, a [PopDialog1] section, etc.  Make sure all the sections in your file have been edited as per this paragraph.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go back in the EverQuest and see if you have the same problem.  (BTW, easiest way to test this is to try and drop something).  <br />
<br />
If you want the nitty gritty details as to what's going on with this, reply here and let me know.<br />
<br />
If you have any more difficulty, let me know as well.</div></div><hr />

I switched around to a few different ones and to default but didn't work. Then I went to the one I was using before and it worked again but I am stuck with this UI now :( . And this only happens on this character. I have my others on default and their buttons work.<br />
<br />
I just tried what Vitaee said to do but my width/hight was already 274/200. I changed hight to 250 because that seemed to be the problem. Haven't checked it yet but I will post again when I have.<br />

It's a quick fix if you don't want to mess around with sizes, and if you were planning on a new UI soon, heh.</div></div><hr />

Confirmation Box Error? Please Read, (http://www.shakahr.com/live/forums/showthread.php?t=146)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The original post you referred to, was a great fix in it's time (bout 5 patches ago now)<br />
<br />
Just stopped in tonite and saw that it is getting referred and probably now is only a huge waste of time.  When it came out, SoE had just begun using the 'new DX8' lines and some were still using the DX7 dll etc<br />
<br />
Long story short, we tried that one again on my son's box a few times.  Dont work at all anymore, but Drakah's info took care of it all over again.  Thanx for the post Drak )</div></div><hr />

I find that hard to believe that is is not found anywyere in the file.  It is automatically generated with the UI_...ini file.<br />
<br />
Make sure you are looking in the UI_&lt;charatername&gt;_&lt;server&gt;.ini and not the &lt;charactername&gt;_&lt;server&gt;.ini file.<br />
<br />
Try going into your EQ directory and delete the defaults.ini file, then remove your UI_&lt;character&gt;_&lt;server&gt;.ini.  Repatch, enter game, and try to drop 3 or 4 times and see if you can get the window to come up.  This will create a new file, but you will loose all your windows placement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The section you want to look at is [PopDialog0]<br />
<br />
You may have several versions of this section ranging from [PopDialog0], to [PopDialog1], etc.<br />
<br />
Delete all of these from your UI_charname_servername.ini file<br />
<br />
Essentially what has happened is that the yes and no buttons are being drawn outside of the visible boundary of the dialogue box.</div></div><hr />

that's right.  I forgot about this.<br />
<br />
Actually i was looking in my own files because of this thread and was wondering why there was only one [ConfirmationDialogBox] section.  i remember when I changed my Window that my buttons weren't showing up correctly and I had more than one entry for all the windows I had set up.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the good info. 5-stars*<br />
