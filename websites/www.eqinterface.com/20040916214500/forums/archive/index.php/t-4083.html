It's a combo of Kaoriv4 and Vert2.2 with most windows rearranged to be horizontal. It is up and avaible for download in the Complete Sets sections. <br />

Lemme know what you think. I'm already in the process of tweakin it for the next release ;)<br />

edit: I've only tried running it at 1280,1024 with viewport, not sure how it will do at lower resses, forgot to put that in the description.</div></div><hr />

&lt;gauge&gt;TW_TarHP&lt;/gauge&gt;<br />
<br />
or something close.<br />
<br />
The target gauge in the target window isn't visible, so you couldn't see the changes you were making ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DungnMaster001</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off let me congratulate you on a wonderful UI, I tried mixing and matching UI's before to get something similar but they never seemed right to me. this is one I am 99 percent satisfied with. I was wondering though if it is possible to use a different spell gem window (the one with your memmed spells in it). the main reason I ask is because I don't really like the zig zag spells. I prefer them in a straight line. I have already got a mod that does this but I don't want to mess anything up trying to put it in with your UI. If this is possible I would be 100% happy with this mod. If not well 99% is better than any of the other mods I have seen ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem you will run in to switching the SpellGems window is that the Hotbutton window uses the Gems graphics, which are declared in the spellgem window. That's the main drawback to this UI, many parts are declared in one window.xml then used in multiple windows. As a result, it doesn't really 'play well with others'<br />
<br />
However, I should be able to line those gems up and post em here for you, soon.<br />
<br />
The reason I zigged em like that in the first place was so that when I hit Alt to cast, the spell names don't overlap each other.<br />
<br />
And, Thanks for the props =D<br />

<br />
Just overwrite the castspellwnd.xml in your custom dir with this one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DungnMaster001</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow. thanks for the speedy reply/posting ;) <br />
gonna try it out now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DungnMaster001</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if this has anything to do with the UI or not but for some reason the spell window is ... GONE. Invisible actually (it has nothing to do with the new spell window mod I asked for because I noticed it before I added it) I checked the transparency and every thing is set to max. I checked to see if I had used Alt+S to get rid of it for some reason, I tried re installing the entire mod from scratch and still no visible spell window... I reverted to default UI and I found the spell window but when i try this UI it dissapears. (it worked fine last night but today it is gone... weird)<br />
Again not sure if this has anything to do with the UI itself or if I somehow messed something up without realizing it. If anyone else encounters this problem and posts a solution I would be thankful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Freaky.....check 2 things.<br />
<br />
Are the 'tt_ticker' and 'tt_tickerbar' tgas still in your custom dir?<br />
<br />
Are you having the problem with the original gems, or just with the new 'straightgems'?<br />
<br />
Gonna log back in and start loading the various versions I have to see if I can reproduce this.<br />
<br />
Edit: Checked regular version and one with the new spell window and they are working fine for me. I can see the gems and everything. I was afraid that I had the straightgems too close together which was causing them not to show ( a la the buff window 2 pixel spacing phenomenon ) but this doesn't seem to be the case. Since it sounds like you are having the same problem with either spell window, I'm gonna guess you were playing with the .tga's I mentioned above and somehow that is causing your problem. Your best bet would be to delete those 2 files from your dir, then re-extract them from the original .zip.....but if you deleted and reinstalled from scratch, that would have had the same effect....so....hrm. I'm not sure.  :confused: <br />
<br />
Anything helpful in your UIErrors file?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DungnMaster001</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well I went back and checked the dir and (to my surprise) one of the .tga's you mentioned was missing..  tt_tickerbar was missing. (wierd) gonna log on now and see if that fixed anything. thanks again for help... still don't knwo how the file disappeared in the first place...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DungnMaster001</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh well that missing .tga did the trick so I am now 100% happy ;) thanks again for a great UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent, Smithers! *rubs hands together*<br />
<br />
Lemme know if there's anything else you think needs work. Some ideas I've been having include:<br />
<br />
A shorter targethp/playerhp/mana bar (still oversized, but short enough that it will fit between the inventory and the spellbook)<br />
<br />
Spell names on the spell cast window<br />
<br />
Enok's group window with those gauges I built (I don't think I'd be able to make it horizontal, tho, without figuring out how to make tabbox overlays =p )<br />
<br />
Izy's xp/target window (I already added it in to the version I play with, and it's pretty neat)<br />
<br />
So anyway, feedback appreciated. :D <br />

(note however I haven't logged in for about 3 weeks due to lack of an account) Has there been a patch that made the UI not functional? the only patch I remember is the december 12th one and I don't think it changed the UI ...</div></div><hr />
