<br />
Downloaded from http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2361<br />
Unziped and made a file in UIs called Delta, moved all files into folder, went in game and it wont work. I think i need to put some of files in that it doesn't have, but im not very good with UIs although i do understand a lot of it. Any help would be wonderful.</div></div><hr />

I had Delta 2.2 working until the last patch... then I decided to download Delta 4.  I unzipped it to its own directory in the uifiles folder, but when I tried to load it, it didn't load.<br />

Also, and almost worse... even in the default UI.... I can't get my Music Player window to open anymore; this has been happening for a couple weeks now. :(</div></div><hr />
