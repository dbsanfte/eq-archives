<br />
I love this mod, but I didn't really care for the plain graphics it uses.  Thus I made my own:<br />
<br />
http://members.telocity.com/~Tipop2000/timergraphics.jpg <br />
<br />
As you can see, I prefer a more 3D look.  I also made the left-right arrows invisible until the mouse rolls over them.  I feel this gives the timer a cleaner look.<br />
<br />
Note that to use my graphics you will need to change the text color in the xml to black (the default is white.)  To do this, simply change every instance of:<br />
<br />
&lt;R&gt;240&lt;/R&gt;<br />

<br />
I was thinking of doing a wooden skin for druids and rangers, as I'm sure everyone doesn't like the smooth plastic look.</div></div><hr />

I play a necro and a wizard and like the old style and look of things.  Now what I mean by old style is not the EQ old style I mean the old style as in the things in the mod look like they are from the medievil days.  <br />
<br />
That said I would like to see one that is based around Death for my necro.  More or less would have to be dark and ominous.  Not sure how this could be done but then I am not an artist,  I am a programmer.</div></div><hr />

Keep the skins coming! I think that having a different &quot;look&quot; for each class is a great idea. It's nice to know that people are enjoying the timer enough to create new skins for it.<br />
<br />
Ever since I received your first skin, I've been meaning to expand the UI Timer site to include a page that features user-submitted skins. Players will be able to go there to view and download new graphics files for their timer, once they have generated the XML file. <br />
<br />
It looks like I finally have more free time this weekend, so I will be adding some of the timer features that I've promised in another post (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=13329#post13329). Once I'm done with those, I'll set up a page for the user-submitted skins. Also, it appears that different timer skins will require different text colors, so I will update the timer XML generator to allow the user to choose the text color (that will make it easier for people to use different skins).<br />

Molz - what is the error message that you're getting? The timer definitely works with vert, as far as I know (I've tried it personally). See if any of the troubleshooting tips in the timer thread (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2488) help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tipop</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here is the necro archive.<br />
<br />
Note that you will have to rename the actual .tga file to match the one that came with the timer mod.  This file is called Feeback_Timer.tga right now because I happen to be using the Feeback window for mine.  If you use the Friends window it would be called Friends_Timer.tga.<br />
<br />
BTW, the screenshot above is on a black background.  After I posted I moved it around on my screen and noticed that it looks MUCH better if you place it over the regular scenery.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll work on ranger and druid versions today.  After that I'll be tinkering with some ideas for a mage elemental version.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Molz</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">whenever I tried adding the timers I just get unable to loadskin &lt;folder name&gt; and it loads the default skin.  I dont have purely vert mods, I have changed a few of the windows.  Something I have doesn't like the timers.</div></div><hr />

I've had a few friends complain of the same problem and it turned out their .xml was cut off part-way through.  I don't know why this happens sometimes.<br />
<br />
Check your .xml download by looking at the *end* of the file... the very last thing should be &lt;/XML&gt;.  If it's not, then try downloading again.<br />
<br />
BTW... I'm still working on a druid/ranger mod, but while I was tinkering with some ideas I came up with this look:<br />

I thought it was pretty enough to save and add to the collection, even though I know most of you are waiting on class-specific timer skins.  Oh well, pay me by the hour and I'll stick my nose to the grindstone. =P</div></div><hr />

Make sure you're getting the COMPLETE .xml file.  I've had a few friends complain of the same problem and it turned out their .xml was cut off part-way through.  I don't know why this happens sometimes.<br />
This happens usually due to not waiting long enough for the complete XML to be downloaded. The file size of the XML will vary depending on the number and duration of timers used. While a single 1-minute timer will only be 30KB or so, for example, eight 2-hour timers will result in a file that is over 900KB. Since the dynamically-generated file is uncompressed, a file like that could take some time to download for people with slow connections.<br />
<br />
Waiting until the browser is no longer busy before grabbing the XML source is the best way to make sure you get the entire file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, Arista is going to be hosting player-made skins on her site soon, so eventually you'll be able to get them there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Molz</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i got this to work finally and understand it.  I first Downloaded the necro one cause it looks so cool, but when I logged on EQ it is very hard to read the titles.  I made it so it didn't fade at all and still very hard to see the timer and titles.  So I downloaded the regular version on the timer site and same thing.  The pick shows the background as black and mine is a light grey.  I know nothing about xml so can someone tell me how to make the background black like in the pic?<br />
<br />
<br />
ok me again, I downloaded all three of these timer pics, necro, 3d and then the default one on the timer site.  All had a very hard time seeing the text on them.  The font colors are white and not easy to read.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The XML generator currently uses white text by default (which is used by the default skin).<br />
<br />
The two skins you downloaded from Tipop require the text to be black. I will be updating the XML generator soon so that you can choose a different text color other than white, but in the meantime, you'll need to do a &quot;search and replace&quot; on the XML file (as mentioned in the first post in this thread).<br />
<br />
As a side note, the white text should work fine with the default skin, which has a dark gray background for the text (see the picture in my signature, or on the timer site).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Molz</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the pic in your sig, the background looks like it is black to me or a very dark grey, that looks great.  but when I log on EQ the background is a light grey :(</div></div><hr />

the pic in your sig, the background looks like it is black to me or a very dark grey, that looks great.  but when I log on EQ the background is a light grey :( <br />
That picture is a direct screenshot from EQ, so that's what it looks like in game as well. It's possible that your gamma settings, or video card, is causing the image to appear lighter than it is.<br />
<br />
In any case, I'll be adding a custom text color option to the XML generator this weekend, so user-submitted skins can use different text colors. That'll allow you to choose whatever text color you want.</div></div><hr />

I found that my soloing ability improved dramatically with the use of the timer... no more wasted mana casting too soon and running like a crazy person when I cast too late.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, as a ranger you would use the timer to keep track of buffs (so you can recast without people asking you for them) and to time respawns.  You also might want to use it (at later levels) to time disciplines and AA skills that can only be used every X minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, though, I don't see that SKs need a seperate skin.. the necro one suits them well enough too.<br />
<br />
My enchanter used to use the 3D Plastic one, but I've found that the White Glass one is much nicer, especially now that I made the glass background less opaque.</div></div><hr />

Tipop - send me the updated graphics files and I'll update the user-submitted skins section on the site. Your skins are looking great!<br />
<br />
I noticed that all the skins you've submitted so far are for the &quot;Full&quot; version of the slider timer only. About a week ago, I released timer version 3.1 - this version adds a new &quot;Compact&quot; option in the XML generator, which generates a smaller space-saving version of the timer.<br />
<br />
The compact version uses the following area for the background on each timer: location 28,226 size 128x26. In order for a skin to be considered compatible with the compact version, the area specified above must tile seamlessly, as the timers are placed together with no spaces inbetween them.<br />
<br />
Let me know which of your skins are compatible with the compact version, so I can mark them as such. If you want to submit new revisions of existing skins to make them &quot;compact-compatible&quot;, that is fine also. Currently, they are marked as compatible with the full version only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tipop</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will do.

These skins are for my timer mod, which can be found at the Timer Home Page (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp). More information about this mod can be found in this thread (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3162).<br />
<br />
First, you will need to generate the timer XML, using the web tool at the following URL:<br />
http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/customize.asp<br />
<br />
Then, instead of downloading the default graphics, you can choose from a list of user-submitted graphics at the following URL:<br />
http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/skins.asp<br />
This listing includes Tipop's skins as well as a few submitted by others.</div></div><hr />

For a custom (non-default) timer skin, you will need to rename the graphics file according to the chart on the skins page (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/skins.asp) (see instructions on that page).<br />

If that still doesn't work, please take a look at the posts in the timer thread (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3162). All the timer installation issues and solutions are consolidated in that thread.</div></div><hr />
