<br />
Dolby and I have been a Team for a year now, we have seen a lot changes to both EQ, and to this site. We are at over 123,000 members and growing daily. Thanks to all of you!<br />
<br />
One thing you will have noticed in the last 24 hours is the small banner at the top of the page in the middle. We are testing a new banner sponsor to see if we start supporting outselves. We don't want it to be too annoying, but if you visit the sponsor EQInterface.com and EQGui.com will prosper and grow quicker<br />
<br />
What to expect for the next year:<br />
To start with if you have not seen the teaser sites yet.. EQ2Interface.com (http://www.eq2interface.com) and EQ2Gui.com (http://www.eq2gui.com) are primed and ready for EQ 2 to get underway.  Dolby has a few other things up his sleeve and I don't want to ruin his suprise so just watch for more fun things from him.<br />
<br />
Be safe everyone! Its been a great year and All of us here at EQInterface/EQGui look forward to having another great year!<br />

I don't mind banners, but the ones that get right into your face and drop down in the area you are clicking and scream at loud decibles are downright annoying... <br />
<br />
Oh yeah Happy anniversary!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diepen</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ads I have seen from the new banner are not bad, I was even sent back to EQInterface from the survey once I filled it out. If half the ads on the internet were as nicely done, I think it would be a much better place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brimztone</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the first version of the ads (below the banner and above the threads) was annoying to me. These new ads are much better.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />
