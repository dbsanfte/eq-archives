<br />
Just make sure you have your EQ files open, then go find and search your DL file whatever you named it, drag it and drop it in your UI file. that it how I do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets say you want to download a UI you like.  First things first, make sure the UI you plan to use is current and compatible with all the changes that SOE makes to the game.  Any of them made after the launch of Legacy of Ykesha should be fine, and most older ones are posted as fixed or patched, when someone has updated it to work with the newer files.  Lets take an example such as nightelf-loy which is a UI originally done by SPIRITWALKER and patched by Jethal.  First you download the file (nightelf-loy.zip).  Once you have downloaded the file, you unzip it.  If you are using Windows XP this you can do it by right clicking on the file, or you can always use winzip to open it.  You want to to unzip it into your everquest\uifiles folder.  Some UIs require you to have a certain folder name so check and see if they have a readme file somewhere in the folder and rename it if you have to.  So I unzip nightelf-loy.zip to a folder called nightelf-loy and make sure it is in my everquest\uifiles folder.  Now AFTER i have read any readme files which give important info, I look in the folder and find the UI file i need to make sure all the windows end up in the right place.  In this case the name of the file is ui_name_##.ini  Now before I use this UI i need to change the name of that file to match the character i want to use it for.  Example:  UI_Methuselah_26.ini<br />
the name is always the name of the character you want to use it with, the number is your server number.  26 happens to be the Tunare server.  If you are not sure what your server number is, then look in your everquest directory for it.  If you have played the character before, you will have a file like this already.  So after you rename it, then copy that file into your main everquest directory and overwrite the one that is there.  You might want to back the old one up, by renaming it or moving it to a different folder.  Once you have the UI file in the main directory, you close all those windows and launch EQ.  Depending on the UI some may start you off with everything in the right place, some you may have to use the loadskin command for.  just type /loadskin (in game) and the window will pop up, pick th name of the UI from the list and leave the &quot;use ini&quot; button checked.  When it loads, things should be in the right place.  Hope that helps you out, most UIs have some instructions with them, but a lot do not.  If you still have trouble let me know, and I can put together an example using screenshots and such.  Have fun and good hunting.<br />
<br />
<br />
also note, not all UIs have the ui_name_##.ini type of file, but if they do, you will see it when you unzip the folder.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I think I may see what you are asking...<br />
Of course, I may be interpreting your request too literally.<br />
<br />
1)  Double Click My Computer.<br />
2)  Locate the C: Drive Icon and Double Click.<br />
3)  There should be a Folder that says Program Files - Doubleclick<br />
4)  You may not see anything. - Ther should be a link that says Show my files. if you cant see anything.<br />
5)  Now look for a folder named Sony or Everquest or Everquest Trilogy - Double Click that.<br />
6)  Do 5 over again until you have opend a folder called UIFILES.<br />
7)  Right-Click in an open area and choose NEW&gt;Folder.<br />
8)  Name the folder VERT.<br />
<br />
Now you can copy the files you need into the VERT folder then start EQ and when you get in, type /loadskin vert<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I would say your best bet would be to either PM or email Katn (http://www.eqgui.com/member.php?s=&amp;action=getinfo&amp;userid=1145) first to see if the changes are feasible, and if he/she has the time to make them.<br />
<br />
As for the sig... I did reply to your mail and forum post.  Unfortunately I am in the process of fixing up/selling my house while my husband is deployed so I dont have the luxury of time like I usually do (which is one reason why I am up at this forsaken hour ;) ) so I have had to put a hold on taking requests right now.<br />
<br />
Sorry you didnt get my mail, but I really do try to get to them all.. even if a little belatedly. :(<br />
<br />
Good luck with getting your UI taken care of!</div></div><hr />
