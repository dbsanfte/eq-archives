Before anyone yells at me, I just want to say I've gone over the ***READ ME BEFORE POSTING*** thing, and I've also checked out the FAQ and searching for other posts regarding this... but no post clearly state how to add percentages to bars...<br />
<br />
My first questing is: How do you add an EXP / AA EXP bar to the player window in the first place? I've been trying to find out how to with SIDL WIDL/FIDDLE... but I don't know how...:o Anyone know a post to a good tutorial or something? I've been trying to find out how to make a UI for like 3 days and cant find anything:( ... anyways, I'm trying my best, and any help would be great:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Find an existing ui on this site that has the feature or features you want in yours, then open up the appropriate xml file in Notepad or Wordpad.  At first it will seem like the file is written in another language (which technically it is), but you should be able to figure out how the various authors got what they did into their ui mods.<br />
<br />
In other words, you can find the answer to your questions by closely examining the work of others.</div></div><hr />
