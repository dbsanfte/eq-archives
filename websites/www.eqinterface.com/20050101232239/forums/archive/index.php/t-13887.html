<br />
i believe i am in need of some AYA assistance! n_n<br />
<br />
i downloaded AYA653.zip and followed the installation instructions accurately i believe. :D  i was a tad confused when i got to step 4 when i had to rename the UI_Charectername_Server.ini file  i named it UI_Zefkin_Solusek  since i read another post stating that it works just fine without the actual code of your server.. i copied this .ini file to Everquests directory folder and it said that the file already existed so i overwrote it?  was this my flaw? &gt;&lt;  all the unzipped files are in C:\Everquest\uifiles\AYA  not any sub-folders or anything.. so i can get to the charecter selection screne and select my charecter then go to load the world.. but right before it finishes loading the game crashes along with a message stating Virtual memory low and what not.. this never happened before i installed AYA.. but i have no way of switching back to my default skin and checking to see if the problem is EQ or AYA  i am so confused &gt;&lt;  please help me.  i'd really love to use this AYA skin.. it's beautiful ^^<br />
<br />
thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolvig</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go it your EQ folder and find that ini. file and add a number to the end this will keep the program from reading the file and the default will load. At least then you can see if it was the UI that crashed your system. This is what i usually do to keep from losing my original files if something like this happens.And it has. Since you overwrote this file without backing it up its pretty much gone now.<br />

Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

not quite sure what to make of that :D  i guess i should just stick with default settings.. suck though AYA skin looks way smooth ;P<br />
<br />
(when loading a skin like that should i click off  'keep your layout&quot;? or does it matter)<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />

If you are trying to use AYA 653 that is the problem. That is an old version and I am sure Kanon no longer supports that version.</div></div><hr />
