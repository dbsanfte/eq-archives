<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valgoth Ulv'Sag</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried uploading the Mix-N-Match UI I posted in THIS (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?goto=newpost&amp;threadid=12469) thread, but kept getting the &quot;There seems to have been a problem with our database. Please hit the [F5] key to refresh&quot; error.<br />
<br />
As a note, I've never been able to upload anything here, even my original CentiLS pointer from well over a year ago. I've tried from multiple locations from multiple machines and now multiple files. Could my account possibly be corrupt? Could the apostrophe in my (mis-spelled) last name be the problem? I'm lost.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

There was a time where i had trouble uploading here because of my security settings.  Not that i remember how I fexed it, but you could set them to low long enough to upload for a work-around if this is the case.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, you got me.  Wait for Dolby or whoever coded the site to reply.</div></div><hr />

There seems to have been a slight problem with the EQGUI Forums database.<br />

An E-Mail has been dispatched to our Technical Staff, who you can also contact if the problem persists.<br />

We apologise for any inconvenience.<br />

Still stumped. :(<br />
<br />
 For grins I tried creating a new account (simply &quot;Valgoth&quot;) and tried uploading. Same error. No idea what the problem is.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its becuase of your username. I dont think it likes the Apostrophe in Ulv'Sag.<br />
<br />
I'll take a look at the code and see if I can find an easy fix otherwise I can change your username.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found the problem and it’s now fixed. The system will now let people who have apostrophe's upload files.<br />
<br />
More then likely when you created the other account and still had trouble the cookie with your other account wasn’t deleted and it was still using your old name to submit the file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(I think Dolby had a talk with the database and explain that it was discriminating, and would be fired if it kept it up)<br />

Grats!</div></div><hr />
