<br />
1. KeizLoc3 now included. Added locs for Ykesha, LDoN, and more locs for PoP.<br />
2. BigBank window now has the two Shared banks slots and the Shared platinum bar.<br />
3. Overhauled the Combat Abilities window. Much sleeker, fits nicely next to the Target window.<br />
4. Added Endurance percent to Vitals window.<br />
5. HotButtons window now uses the updated button graphics.<br />
6. Removed the custom Compass window so the LDoN features would work.<br />
7. Slimmed down the Container window and removed clicky slots (Clickies window is much more flexible - KeizRCW2 now included).<br />
8. Tweaked various windows to stop EQ from giving &quot;incompatible&quot; warning messages.<br />
<br />

Overview of features:<br />
<br />
1. Bank - Includes both Shared inventory slots and the Shared platinum bar.<br />
<br />
2. Buffs - Includes numbers for each buff slot, allowing assessment of slots avaiable at a quick glance. Actual name of buff also displayed.<br />
<br />
3. Clickies - Turned the EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml file into a window for right-click items. Fully customizable through the use of the KeizRCW2 utility.<br />
<br />
4. Combat Abilities - Overhauled, now much sleeker and fits nicely next to the Target window.<br />
<br />
5. Container - Slimmed down to reduce screen real estate usage.<br />
<br />
6. Hot Buttons - Includes Primary/Secondary, and all eight inventory slots. This allows for easy instrument/weapon swapping as well as quick access to your bags.<br />
<br />
7. Inventory - Similar to the classic inventory.<br />
<br />
8. Loc - Built a loc referance guide into the Feedback window (also works in Help window). Fully customizable through the use of the KeizLoc3 utility.<br />
<br />
9. Songs - Same changes as for the Buffs window.<br />
<br />
10. *Spell Book - Using the t.King Elven spell book.<br />
<br />
11. Target - Includes the spell casting-time bar and target health percent. Also flashes with Autoattack engaged.<br />
<br />
12. *Tracking - Stripped of Ranger-only features for use by Bards and Druids (Rangers may delete the EQUI_TrackingWnd.xml file to retain full functionality).<br />
<br />
13. Vitals - Includes both the Player and Group information. The game thinks this is the Group window. I did this to allow me to use the Player window as the Target window so it would flash with Autoattack. This also freed up the Target window so I could turn it into the Clickies window.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Please note that I did not code (or create any of the graphics for) the Spell Book or Tracking windows.<br />
