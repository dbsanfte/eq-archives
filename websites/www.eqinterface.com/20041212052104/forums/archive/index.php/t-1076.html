What it did was turn the &quot;common&quot; name into the &quot;coded name&quot; (or whatever you want to call it. So in the normal target window you see a moss snake and when using the coding name target window mod it would be called a_moss_snake01. This was a great thing that doesn't work anymore. Anyone know if there is a way to get this to happen again? This was one of the best mods out there for those of us that do crowd control. It  made life easier to diferentiate the mobs with the same name, and I miss it!<br />
<br />
The mod used EQtype 28 (I think this is what I was told). I guess that is the problem.</div></div><hr />

I never used it - but now that I've heard everyone talking about it, I wish they'd left it alone!  lol  :)<br />

Sorry<br />

Of course, /loc is a debug command that is still in the game...</div></div><hr />
