<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drachandor</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently installed a complete UI fromt he &quot;featured&quot; section of this website.  After having done so, a number of pop-up windows are not functioning properly.  To loot a no-drop item, the pop-up window does not include the yes or no buttons.  To drop an item on the floor, the pop-up window does not have a yes or no button.  When I cam invited into a guild, the pop-up window does not have accept or decline buttons.  In the case of a guildinvite, this completely crashes the game.  In all other situations so far, the window times out and nothing happens.  <br />
<br />
I've reverted back to the default UI, and the same problem persists.  I've deleted the custom UI folder, I even deleted the default UI folder (and patched new UI files), and I deleted my EQclient.ini file.  <br />
<br />
None of these have solved the problem.  Would any of you have any idea on how to fix this?  I'd added a post to an existing thread that touched on this topic, but I've had no replies.  I'm home from work just a few more days and would really like to figure out how to solve this issue.  Thank you in advance for your help with this matter.<br />

Hopefully SoE will look into it and have a fix soon. From what I've seen, I don't think it has anything to do with the UI (or at least the parts of the UI that we control :D)</div></div><hr />

Thank you kindly for your reply.  The EQ tech support had me delete a number of files (eqgame.exe, eqclient.ini, and two .DLL files the name of which escape me at this time), then repatch and do a complete file check.  This did not address the problem.  At that point, I un-installed EQ, then manually deleted the EQ folder.  I re-installed all the software after a cocomplete shutdown and re-patched (5 hours on a dial-up *cringe*).<br />
<br />
The good news is that my no options button issue has been resolved.  The yes and no (or accept/decline) buttons no show as they should.<br />
<br />
The bad news, is that the crashing and on-going disconnects have not been solved.  At this time, I can be in EQ for almost 5 minutes, at most, before I get booted straight to the server selection screen.  Sometimes, the game locks up on exit at the character selection screen and asks if I'd like to send a crash report to SOE.<br />
<br />
Whatever it is that is causing these problems, I'm at this point fairly certain it is not on my end.  Having said that, I'm tired of giving them my money for a service/product that does not work properly for me.  I've had this game since day 1, and I've finally had enough.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any other ideas (I know this is not a general tech support, my apologies) I would appreciate any of your thoughts.  Be well, folks.<br />
