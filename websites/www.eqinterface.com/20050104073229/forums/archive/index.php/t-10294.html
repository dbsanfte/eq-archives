<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LandoChronus</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello. i recently tried to install this UI (hope link works...)  Caleal1.4.zip (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1476) and everytime i try another thing that i was told to make it work, it just clears the chat window(s) and that's it. i hit download and then clicked &quot;Save&quot;, and put it into the &quot;Shaman&quot; folder i had made in the &quot;UIFiles&quot; folder. then i went to EQ, and typed &quot;/loadskin Shaman TRUE&quot; (tried /loadsking Shaman true also...dunno if lowercase matters) and it just cleared the chat windows. <br />
here's wut i found in the UIErrors.txt file:<br />
<br />
UIErrorLog created at Wed Sep 17 17:00:19 2003 <br />
<br />
 there's not much more to say, as i've told you everything i kno to tell u (followed the FAQ directions for &quot;Still Won't Work&quot; page) i'm not too great with the computer language that is needed to make a custom UI and what not, but i can figure out nething semi-simple. thank in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, try this.  Go into EQ and try loading your UI skin using the Option Window (Alt+O).  On the first tab, down by the bottom is a button to click that brings up the list of UI skins you have available to load.  Check and see if your custom UI even shows up on that.<br />
<br />
From the single line that the UIError.txt log file is presenting you, I think it may be that you have two EQ directories.  If you don't see your custom folder in the list in game, that pretty much cinches it.  If that is the case, you need to find your other EQ directory and put your custom UI in there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm, okay ... check to make sure that you don't have a folder within your custom folder.  Path should look (something) like:<br />
<br />
c:\program files\everquest\uifiles\customfolder\files<br />
<br />
If it looks like:<br />
<br />
c:\program files\everquest\uifiles\customfolder\anotherfolder\files<br />
<br />
You need to move the files up one level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LandoChronus</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the path i use is &quot;C:\ProgramFiles\Sony\Everquest\uifiles\Shaman&quot;, but it keeps puttin a folder with the name of the UI FIle in the Shaman folder and i dunno how to fix that.</div></div><hr />
