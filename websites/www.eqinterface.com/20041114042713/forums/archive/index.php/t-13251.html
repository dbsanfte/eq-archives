This is a release because I'm sick of futzing with it.  The UI is complete and code error free. <br />
<br />
It doesn't accomplish everything I'd set out to do, but is fine in it's current form.   I hope you enjoy it. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not perfect for my tastes but it is perfect in the sense that I can add or change the things which I want.<br />
<br />
The color scheme is great, the player info window, target window are just great as is the hot buttons.<br />
<br />
I would personally change the group window to not include yourself in it. As its not really needed when you already have a player info window. If you had done that I would say the group window is perfect as well.<br />
<br />
Love the outline of the boxes though and the almost transparency of it.<br />
<br />
Been through a ton of windows and think I have finally found the one that I am wanting to stick with :)<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Thank you.  <br />

Thanks for the kind words.  <br />
<br />
The Player Info window has had the player guage reduced to a size of 0,0 to remove it from the display.  With some minor hacking you could put it back in and change it to match the other guages in the window. <br />
<br />
Then it's a matter of removing the &quot;self&quot; stuff from the group window.  That reduces the size of the group window vertically, and would require a bit of re-positioning of the remaining elements. <br />
<br />
I have some ideas for &quot;options packs&quot; for the interface, like multiple versions on the Combat Abilites Window (Warriors, Rouges, Monks version &amp; Hybrids version), alternate buff, group and player info windows.  If there's enough call for them, I'll do them.  <br />
<br />
I'm glad you like the interface.</div></div><hr />
