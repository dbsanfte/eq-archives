Can anyone give me any info about the different types of servers? Such as, which are pvp, which are rp, which allow loot, which tend to have more gm events, lower or higher costing items than on others,etc. I alos heard of a server where Lady Vox got pissed off and no longer spawns. any info on these servers and which ones they are would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the servers Im on are as follows (with explanation):<br />
<br />
Veeshan - Fairly new, not too many people on at a given time. In fact I have been on at semi-peak hours in the bazaar and there were only like 300 people there... Not too busy. As for RP'ing... eh you meet the few that do, and they do fairly well, but for the most part they don't talk much. Many zones you dont hear random shouts, for the most part its fairly quiet.<br />
<br />
The Nameless - Older - and getting bad with the twinking and PL'ing.. unless you are looking for that kind of stuff. Numerous, pointless shouts, mostly innane. OOC's run rampant with people shouting at each other bout kicking their arse and whatnot. Very childish. RP'ing... a rare thing, but when it happens, its pretty good.<br />
<br />
Firiona Vie - RP - I don't play that often, was kinda dissappointed with the fact it is a roleplay based server and NO ONE ROLEPLAYS! Sheesh! Might as call it a sometime roleplay server. Very very disappointed with it. Also the site has random inane shouts and OOC's.<br />
<br />
Tholuxe Paells - Older - WARNING! Enter at own risk! Heavy on PL'ing and Twinking on this server. Mega amounts of blantantly mind-numbing OOC's and Shouts... I remember a short while ago, I decided to give this server another chance and I had just finished my character when I just walked out the gates of Qeynos and saw 7 1st - 5th level characters mega twinked. 3 of them were clad in full plate, all seven had magic items that you normally would only be able to afford to buy or get at high levels (im talking about 40+). Its pretty sad when you see these characters getting killed by mobbing rats. Here lies a warrior fully clad in plate and wielding a magical weapon on the ground dead. I logged and deleted my character... Ain't going back there again.<br />
<br />
Hope these server bio's help... Journey well my friend.. and choose wisely. Caveat Emptor when your dishing out that kind of dough.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kungpo</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello LancerChronics,<br />
<br />
I am My self Currently Resided on Drinal Server...<br />
 I have been on many others ..But what puzzles me <br />
Is i noticed your On MM ..which was my old server before i went on Split to drinal ...You dislike MM?<br />
<br />
but anyways ..to answer question <br />
<br />
Drinal - It dont seem to be to bad ..there is some Very nice people on the server..and some very Good Guilds..But there is also lot of twinking /pl'ing that goes on ..Gm events ..well they seem to be rather scares...But The Gm's do seem to be rather helpful when they are able to get to your petition.<br />
<br />
Item pricing ..Seems to flux. but have seen a few highend items go for rather cheap.<br />
<br />
Eci - Would have to Also say the same ..Good people ..Good Guilds... Pretty Fair pricing ..and not to much of real bigtime twinking / pl'ing ..that i really saw ....<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek (pvp) - This server was pretty fun to play on ...but there does to seem to be some ruthless people on the server that would rather stab ya in the back for your items..then make friends with ya ...hehe this was atleast true when i played on it..dunno about now.<br />
<br />
Test - When i played on test ..it was pretty fun as well ..Pricing on items seem to be lil rather high ...but then again it is test =P <br />
 People on it seem to be good people.. some very good guilds.. <br />
GM support .. well not much to say about GM support other then its lil hard to get it =P ..but once ya do ..Gms are very Helpful.<br />
 As far as Pl'ing /twinking ..i am sure it was done ..but to my knowledge i really didnt see a whole lot of it.<br />
<br />
I had been on a few other servers ...but only breifly ..so i could really say ...But the above ..is just based on things i saw ..and or experienced =) ..so i hope it helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanys.Neoconker</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Lancer,<br />
   I am just gonna post a follow up to the above posts.  I have my main characters on Lanys T'Vyl.  I have been playing on that server the most, and since summer this year, I made some characters on Drinal to play with my friend, whom I met at school.  <br />
<br />
Drinal is a very nice server.  I played for maybe 2 months, and I met many friends and a lot of the people on that server seem to be willing to give their services for free.<br />
<br />
Lanys T'Vyl is an ok server.  The reason I played on it was because I have my cousins on that server and I play with them a lot.  The people on Lanys are nice, but somewhat abrupt when it comes to them and their services.  But if you ask for something for your services, most people won't mind paying you, even if you ask for them but they're not required.  Sometimes I just go around porting people all day, only thinking to make 100plat.  Instead I end up making close to 300plat a day just porting people.  If you go up to Nexus or Bazaar, people there will buff you if you ask, because most are just sitting there.  Or you might see people advertising KEI or group AEGO for money, or see people asking for KEI for 100plat.  People also pay for ports.  You see, the people expect money, but they give money also to keep things balanced.  Twinking and PLing on this server...Well twinking is quite common, because the server has been around for quite a while.  I remember running around Greater Faydark and seeing about 3 Bards in one day with full suits of Lambent Armor or better.  But PLing is not much of a big deal.  Occasionally you'll see a character getting PLed by a guild member or by a friend, etc., but its not as common as stated above.  Its a nice server.  I really enjoy playing on it.  Also, from being on Drinal with my bard and buying items and stuff, I noticed that the prices are a little lower on Lanys.  Centi SS for 700 on Drinal, and they go for 200-300 on Lanys.  Usually...</div></div><hr />

I've been on veeshan the day everquest went live. Most players on veeshan play during the night and when I go to the bazaar there are well over 500+ people in the zone. Also If you sort servers by activity Veeshan is always in the last 3 crowded. <br />
<br />
Veeshan is not a server for a n00b since there are so many old timers there. http://www.veeshanvault.org</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do play at night on Veeshan and it is rather empty... many zones are pack with a max of about 10 people at a pop... granted I havent been on Gfay (because im currently KOS) but areas like Qeynos, Blackburrows, WK, NK, EK, SK as of lately has had a maximum of 15 people... Qeynos even less. I play within the hours of 6p to midnight and I dont see that many people. I have went to the bazaar during PEAK hours it does get busy, but like I stated ealier it was semi-peak hours.<br />
<br />
As for it the fairly new statement I said, that was a shout that I asked people on how new was this server and the most response I got was a fairly new... so I based it on that...<br />

<br />
our server is very guild orianted. Unless you have a well known rep you need to be in a guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so, several different kinds of servers. veeshan sounds the most interesting, and i know enough not to get eaten alive by the veterans. Now all I have to do is figure out what race/class:confused:  But i will probably go mage or some caster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye... of all the servers that I have been on, Veeshan seems the best IMHO.<br />
<br />
There isn't the immaturity that I have seen on the others, and you can play in rather quited solitude without being assaulted by people asking for free cash or items. I personally enjoy this setting. Good luck to you my friend... and if you ever come across Sisilisko, feel free to pass on a 'Hello'<br />

Journey well my friend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorren</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started playing on Brell Serilis when I started the game and since then have checked out a few of the other servers.  Personally I have yet to find one I liked as much as Brell.  Twinking on the server doesn't seem to be to as high a degree as on others and usually the irritating ooc and shouts are at a minimum.  As for overall population, the server seems to fluctuate at times.  I have also noticed that out of all the servers I have been to the players on Brell are some of the most kind.  Many will help out new or low level players without expecting a reward for doing so.  PLing also doesn't seem to be overdone on Brell.  As for roleplaying, some do and some don't, it's probably about half and half.  The guilds also seem to have variety.  Some are large, some very small, some only raid, some hardly never do.  There seem to be a lot of smaller &quot;family&quot; type guilds as well as the big name uber guilds.<br />
It really depends on what you are looking for.  Personally I haven't found a server I like better than Brell yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the server select screen - I haven't haven't seen a &quot;preferred green&quot; server highlighted for about 18 months.<br />
<br />
Terris-Thule is the newest of the American blue (non PvP) servers at about 2 years old.  oddly, Terris-Thule seems to support a very large Euro based group of players - so grouping during odd hous isn't as difficult.  Also, I would say that attitudes aren't quite as nasty as I've seen on some other servers.  It has a few guides but support is pretty thin (last 6 in-game petitions expired without answer)<br />
<br />
Also with the new chat channels you can keep in touch with whats happening on the other servers.  So there isn't the pressure to put all characters on the same server as there was previously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm on Ayonae Ro.<br />
<br />
Ayonae Ro's an okay server. It isn't so HORRIBLY balanced towards the uber game, but the majority of the people are, indeed, 55+. I'd say 90% of the newbies you see wandering around are twinked, and the monk population is THROUGH THE ROOF.<br />
<br />
People are okay. You get a lot of nice people, but in the same instant, you'll get a lot of *******s. It tends to be evenly mixed, although a lot of the people giving KEI and ports are generally very good about their services, and when they say donation, it usually MEANS donation.<br />
<br />
As far as prices go, Ayonae has some of the weirdest prices in the game, but generally are MUCH lower than most other servers due to our very borked economy from the Karana/Cazic-Thule/Solusek Ro split.<br />
<br />
I used to play on Solusek Ro when the game went live, and it was taken over by germans last I played there. =/<br />

Tholuxe is the second-newest regular-ruleset server. The reason you see a lot of twinks is that there are actually low-level characters- unlike, say, Veeshan, where /who all 10 20 will usually get you no more than 20 people, nearly all of whom are twinks who'll be 25 by the end of the night. And you may call the Tholuxe chat 'mind-numbing;' I would call it a vibrant community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alas... I beg to differ. The server I joined when I came to EQ was Tholuxe and it was alright THEN.. but by the time I left it (after being on it for about 11months) it was a horrible wreck of twinks, PL'ers and 'vibrant community' chat (still mind-numbing in my book). Hey its great if thats what you are looking for, but for me the server has too many downfalls than perks. And 11 months was more than enough for me to take (though I did try again to see if it toned down, but it did the opposite... it got worse). Many of the people who I guilded with many a months ago, are also leaving Tholuxe for pretty much the same reason, if not because of the chaos the server has wrought. And the guild I was part of was in the mid upper-to-high double digits in guildies (now it has dwindled to a mere paltry 27 to date).<br />
<br />
Sorry if it ruffled some feathers, but Tholuxe has been quickly sliding down into the Swamp of No Hope.  :( <br />
<br />
And as for the quote of <br />
where /who all 10 20 will usually get you no more than 20 people, nearly all of whom are twinks who'll be 25 by the end of the night.<br />
<br />
I have not seen what you speak of.. majority of people on the server are high level merely because (as Dolby said) they are the old school veterans of the game. And I have to agree with that statement. Yes there are mega amounts of High levelers, but I have seen my share of low levelers and they dont seem to rush through like you say. I can be gone for a week, and return and see people who I chatted with or been fighting around areas I have and see they havent jumped 25 levels in that week let alone overnight (as you so say).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taranas</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I dont know much about Blue (Non-PvP) servers as I went to RZ about a month after I started EQ.<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek-The first and oldest PvP server.  There are no teams and you can attack anyone  within 4 lvls of you.  When you kill someone you can loot 1 No Drop item, as long as its not in a weapon slot or a bag, and all the coin on the person.  I havn't been on RZ in a year so im not too sure on what the server is like player wise...<br />
<br />
Tallon/Valon Zek- PvP Teams, There are 4 teams..Humans, Elves, Shorties, Evils and a PvP limit of 8 lvls.  Dont know much about these as I never played there...Loot is Coin Only.<br />
<br />
Sullon Zek- The cesspool of EQ....This is the forgoten server...  There are 3 teams based on what god you worship, Agnostics do not exist and there is no PvP limit , a lvl 65 can and oftentimes will kill a lvl 1.  if you kill someone within 5 lvl you loot coin and an insignia of the god, if an evil Greater Sig you can get a summon corpse potion, other then that they are useless.  If you are killed by someome within 5 lvls of you or more then 5 lvls below you ( Even and Green /cons) you loose exp.  Training is allowed, Corpse Camping, Bind Camping, Kill Stealing.  Want to CC someone till there corpse rots?  Your welcome to try.  Evils own the server with newts (Neutrals) not too far behind.  Gods are a ways behind and have to fight for everything.  The server is full of children and &quot;l33t d00ds&quot; and I think only 1 GM, if that.<br />

      I have been playing this game now for nearly 3 yrs and only played in 2 servers. I liked them both, but the choice is yours to make.<br />
<br />
Tunare - Old - Played in this server when I first got in game. Met many very helpful and kind people here. Had a blast too. At the time there were a number of RPs there, can't say if they are still around since I no longer play on that server. Pricing was pretty decent back then. Plvling was one thing I did see, not much of it, but it was present. Twinking is also present, but not as much. Guilds came in all sizes. I was in one of the largest back then, but it has since disbanded. Times change you know.<br />
<br />
Innoruuk - Old - I play in this server still. There are many high end players here and almost double the low end as well. A good number of them are twinks, but not to a drastic degree. My only complaint here is you get no response from others when trying to get a group. Whenever that happens I just shout that I am forming a new chainpulling team and the others come to me.  :cool:   As for pricing, they are pretty fair since most items are obtained by the high end folks at a good pace. People are quite friendly, but you do meet the occassional butt-head in game. Plvling does happen, but not as much. The server seems to believe you must earn your points. Might explain why it took me 2 and a half years to reach 42 as my Shaman. <br />
<br />
     As I had said, the choice is yours to make where you wish to play. May the choice you make be the right one on the first try. Happy hunting! <br />

It adds some danger to everything.  However, I will admit there are some immature people here. =p  Its all good though.</div></div><hr />
