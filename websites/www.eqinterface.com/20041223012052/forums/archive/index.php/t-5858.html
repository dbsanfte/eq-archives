I Stoped playing eq for over a year while playing AO (Anarchy online), which i like better then EQ becasue fo its fast game play, however it lacks the society that EQ has developed. ANyway My sk on Terris Thule lvl 26 is lacking a good UI. I have seen some nice Ranger ones, how about a nice SK one something evil looking ? Pleeeeeease</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canorne</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:D  I know how much SKs and Paladins have been wanting a Working UI with a nice look on them. I have just the thing for you guys. This one is the Shadowknight version and I use it on my SK alt now, that is how I test what I put together. If it doesn't work for me, it doesn't work for you!) Heh, anyways I don't want to sound like an Engineer expressing my job here for pete's sake.)I you have any problem with the UI, please let me know at this e-mail address. (Ferg6244@bellsouth.net) I can also be reached at my guild's website in the forums section. (http://www.Vanguardsofexcellence.com) <br />
