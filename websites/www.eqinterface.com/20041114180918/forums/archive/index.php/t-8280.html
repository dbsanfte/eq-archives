<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyphun</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been a while since anyone bothered to update Kao's UI sooooo.... I thought I'd post mine. It's not exactly Kao's anymore, it's more a TKing's now, but after trying out TKings G2/Celtic yesterday, I decided I'd stick with mine. Actually I thought I’d go one better and post it here. So here it is for your approval… or not. <br />
<br />
I am pretty decent at modifying the code so if you have anything you'd like me to change or add; post it here and I'll do my best to get you what you want. My next addition is going to be adding those color coded indicators to group windows, not that I like it much yet, but I figure enough people do so I might as well let it try and grow on me. ^_^<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hmerly</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any chance you could do a different casting bar?  I really like Daellig's casting bar as its horizontal and includes the target bar within it.  It would fit very well with your theme and help to reduce your vertical profile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jamul</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it'd be cool if the spells were shrunk and placed directly in between the player window and inventory(where rings are) box.  <br />
Maybe shrink the main chat just enough for it to fit?<br />
<br />
Then you could move the pet window over to the left and it'd fit directly above all 3.   Then the target window could be placed directly over the main chat.<br />
<br />
IMO, this would give you a area down on the left where the player could do a lot of clicking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyphun</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I didn't have time over the weekend to tweak out a new horizontal casting bar, I did have time this morning to locate the old Kaori UI and snag his spell bar. It fits in height with the rest of the windows. Already included in the UI in the 'Add' sub folder is both a flat casting bar and flat 'no frills' target bar. ^_^ As for moving the pet bar, to do that in your own ui is move it over and move the target bar on top of it if you like. I am still not happy with the pet control window and I plan on twinking it in the future. I am just not sure how yet. ^_^<br />
<br />
BTW if you like a piece of someone elses UI, try just overwriting the one in mine. If it's written correctly it should work. Just remember there may be graphic files that go with it and you'll need to copy those over too. <br />
<br />
Here's a preview of the spell bar, click on the attachment below to download it and then just copy it into the ZyphunUI folder and over right the file that's already there...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyphun</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is just a notice that I made a few changes to my UI. All were suggestions and observations made by people that have tried or use my UI. I look forward to the challanges give and ever more forward to finding the time to do them ^_^ hehe <br />
<br />
Changed in this update is:<br />
Fixed the Short Buff Duration Window (Song Bar): You'll now see the graphic as well as the colored background. *thanks Zonaa*<br />
<br />
Added Weight and Max Weight to Compass / Stat Bar: This is a direct request from someone that sent me a tell in game. ^_^ *waves to Grubs*<br />
<br />
I also added code to the group window so the UI won't report an error when it's loading. I am still not sure why it wants all that in there so I just have to move it off to the side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrianA</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I noticed when I started using your UI.  As a beastlord, the pet window is screwed up.  The &quot;warder&quot; part of my pet is overlaid over the guage.  I tried to figure out how to move it over, but had no luck.<br />
<br />
Also a request, would it be possible to remove the stamina bar from your player window and make it a pet health bar?  Similar to this:<br />
<br />

<br />
Again, I tried, but couldn't figure it out.<br />
<br />
Thanks!  Love the UI!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draky</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any update for the new stuff? Would be nice to use those 2 extra slots in the bank without having to load to default and then load back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yarg Soulfyre</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like this UI.<br />
I was a Vert fan or a long time, got converted to Daellig.<br />
I loved the Daellig UI, but it seems the latest patch has rendered it unstable.<br />
Only thing I can't seem to find is the new spell book commands<br />
that link off of the book button on the spell bar. Am I doing something<br />
wrong or is it indeed something that needs to be fixed?<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: well I had to reinstall EQ because of some bug problem I  developed<br />
with crashing to the desktop randomly.  <br />
When I reinstalled this UI though the spell book set thin was working.<br />
So No need to &quot;fix&quot; anything there.<br />
<br />
Do have one other request though: could you make it so the buff sets don't have the text elow the icons?<br />
I am definitely hooked on the UI.<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyphun</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am going to start working on a new update for ZyphunUI semi-nearish future (I should be starting sometime in the next week or two). I'm currently working on a new pet window, something that will give pet/warder users something they can really use. As for making a bank window, I haven't modified the bank windows; they should be loading from default.  ^_^ As for a buff bar without names, I'll put that in the next update, but you should be able to put just about any buff window you want there. I know that alot of UIs don't have them. I like it there because I can see what are harmful at a quick glance and what are not.  If you want something added or changed, now is the time to speak up ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yarg Soulfyre</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent!<br />
<br />
I am still too new to this xml stuff to try modifying your files to remove the tags myself.<br />
I tried with SIDL, but couldn't get it to work. I am patient though and can live with it for a while.<br />
I am in a raiding guild, and pretty much have full buffs all the time.<br />
I almost always set them up in a specific order, so when I do get a dot or malignant buff, I can spot it right away anyway.<br />
<br />
Learning to adjust to the combine at the top on bags too, but I like the large button size for that,<br />
as well as the fact that I have access to the hot slots in inventory at the top of the bag window.<br />
<br />
One more little thing to maybe add as an option would be a full size vendor inventory window. <br />
I go shopping a lot and the tiny icons are a tad hard on my old eyes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tryed to get normal mouse courser (sp) with no luck.<br />
Any easy way to explain?<br />
Animation file is big hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brimztone</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but what happens when  you press the ALT key to see what the items are? don't the names run together?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poetsword</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the merchant window...is  it easy enough to mod other UIs with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyphun</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Update: Getting close to getting to really working on the UI again. I've been fixing some bugs in the UI off and on, still working on my pet window (want to make beastlords happy and as well as accommodate people that don't have pets without having to add tabs and keep it streamlined.) It's possible I see it in my head I swear.<br />
<br />
As for a cursor, I'll post the change you need to get rid of the custom cursor. It's not hard. Better yet I'll see about just posting an edited animations file. <br />
<br />
As for the merchant/loot window, yes the 'ALT text' or tooltips overlap. I haven't figured out a way to get around it, I am looking into it though as I really don't like it either. The pain of it though is worth it to me so I can easily see everything on the merchant (to make sure I am not missing any hidden goodies someone sold) and on my corpse (for fast looting). You should be able move the merchant window over to another UI, it might not be pretty, but it will be functional. hehe I am not sure though as I didn't write it ^_^ My UI is nothing more then a collection of what other people did with some modifications I made to them and other parts of the UI. ^_^<br />
<br />
One of the things I want to do in the next release is to standardize the look of everything, some windows are using different background textures along with tooltips being different styles. Just a lot of nit picky stuff I hope makes the UI look more polished. Anyway, please keep posting your ideas and wishes, I'll do my best to address them and add them ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samthin</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any chance you could do an update of your UI from the August 28th patch please =)  I have multiple characters I run using your UI and really enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Best Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rathmorg</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this UI.  Nice job.  A question tho.  Is there an update to the compass that will show the blue line for the LDoN adventures?<br />
<br />
TIA for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyphun</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the UI got updated. Made some changes here and there, fixed the pet window (finally). Still no blue line for the compass though, didn't have LDoN for a while so I never got to test it or anything. Going to see what I can do now that I have it. I'll post a fix here, and a new updated version of the UI when I do. This UI should be fully compatible with all the patches up til now. Anyway, enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rathmorg</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalamos</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any idea if it's possible to add the stone texture in the area where the pet buffs go?  The dark black area of the pet window sorta stands out in my old Kaori setup hehe.<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
