After been using this website for quite a while now, I have decided to start working on a UI.  Was wondering what kind of graphics I should use?  Anyone got a website or something that I could use to make graphics?  I have Adobe Photoshop 7.0, and I still haven't tried making anything with it yet, but I will and check it out.  Was wondering where people get your ideas and graphics from?  Also, I have SidlWidl downloaded and working already, with the toolbox enhancement.  So just let me know what I should do about the graphics.</div></div><hr />

Someone help this poor lizard.  The only thing I can say is that I don't know the first thing about making a UI except to just mess around with the files and imitate things... BUT, I'm sure someone can point him in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Someone give this guy some pointers, it's not normal for the community here to bypass such a post.  Let's go people, move it.<br />

Dropped into Graphics forum, since it's this general end of the board that you want to be hanging around in. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the major part of a UI is the Functionality of it, then skinning it with something unique. Alot of mods I see become way too graphic-orientated thus lessens the use of it, hense clutter. Although there are a lot of mods that have a ton of graphics, yet the functionality was still intact. =)<br />
<br />
Trying to find a good medium is difficult, thus I would suggest drawing one up 1st and re-vamping it on paper before you start one, it will save time in the long run. Try also to look at the mod as if you were a pure melee, and a pure caster. It should be user-friendly to all classes if you can. Another thing to try is .. never use or create a custom EQUI_Animations file (or Templates). This will cause your mod to break and add stress to the questions &quot;so wheres the patch?&quot;. Anything you make that is Custom Code, just put that in the window you are working on.<br />
<br />
As for the graphics, that is really up to you. There is no &quot;place&quot; where you get them, perhaps try drawing them if you are good at that sort of thing. Adobe can reallly make a stick-figure look like a beautiful object =). Its all a matter of &quot;what do you want the skin to look like?&quot; Then search the net for ideas of the objects you need.  You could browse around the net for misc sites that have 256 x 256 backgrounds and such. There are plenty of sites out there with &quot;free graphics&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and Good luck to you! Looking forward to see what you come out with =)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for being concerned drakah, I hope it helps the lizardman that started it.<br />

And yes I found it. :)  Drakah, thanks for the hints.  I will start drawing my basic outline soon and maybe hit it up on Adobe to see what it'll look like.  Hopefully I'll be able to get something done by the end of the week.  I'll post it up if I get anything.  Thanks again!!</div></div><hr />
