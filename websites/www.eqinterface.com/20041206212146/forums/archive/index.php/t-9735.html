<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mattwebb</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is nothing serious, but i would list to see one more column added to the EQ GUI site, and that column could be called &quot;designer resolution&quot; or &quot;intended resolution&quot; that way we can glance at that column and see if that skin is compatible with our preferred resolution.  I, for example, pretty much exclusively run 1024x768, my monitor doesnt do high resolutions well and it would probably just cause lag in EQ, but it would be cool to glance at the column and rule out a GUI, albeit, just for use, not for quality, rather than having to load a big screen shot of the UI to find out its 1280x1024.. just another 2 cents in the bucket.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your input.<br />

In the mean time you can use the filesearch block on eqinterface.com and manualy type in the resolution and if the author listed it in their description it will show up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xilus</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree, having the resolution posted in another column would be useful.  Sure, some designers post their resolution, but not all do, either you have to second guess it's resolution from the screenshot or install it and see if everything isn't scattered.  One thing that sort of makes me a little angry is when there is no info on the ui about it's size, not in the more info link, or even see a README.txt in the downloaded file.  Having a resolution column would make browsing go by a little faster, not to mention going back to EQ a little faster also :p</div></div><hr />

I agree. Adding the ability to search all UIs by resolution would be an awesome idea, and a lot of help.  <br />

That feature will come soon. :) Authors as of right now can enter the resolution there interface works with.</div></div><hr />
