It's set for 1024x768.  Will look fine in higher res but probably will suck below 1024x768.<br />
<br />
Take a look (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=723) <br />
<br />
Some nice addition like t.king's Crimson spellbook, Stretchable Target window, Earthscum's Necro Skull Cast gauge, and some other refinements.<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoy.<br />

 *EDIT* The buff window is invisible.  You'll need to buff yourself to see where it is.  The hotspot to move the buff window is just below the name of the buff.  If you buff yourself and you still do not see the buff window then you need to /loadskin bloodynecro.<br />
This should bring all the pieces onto your screen.</div></div><hr />

Loving it so far, and i got the spellbook fix, but with regular books, (like research materal lists, stories, stuff like that) the text is still black, and difficult to read on a black background.  Just making you aware, i personally have little UI knowledge or i'd offer a fix of my own.<br />

I changed to a spell book that is a lot easier to deal with.<br />
<br />
Should help when you are using scrolls as well.  <br />
<br />
Give it a try and let me know.<br />

Thanks<br />
