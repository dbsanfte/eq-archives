The description says it was updated  for the 8/26 patch, which wasn't the LDoN patch but on the other hand it says the files were last modifed on September 10th which indicates to me it might have already been updated for LDoN.  If this is not the case you can find out on the Patch Fixes board exactly what changes were implemented for LDoN, and Cairenn gave detailed instructions on what was changed and how to correct it. If you have exhausted those options, post the contents of your UIError.txt the experts here can give you better advice. :)</div></div><hr />

Look at the list of changed files in that post, then look in your inifinity2 folder for those files and make the changes indicated.  I use Infinity2 and did those takes a few minutes :)  As I recall only EQIM and EQUI_animations need to be updated in infiniti</div></div><hr />
