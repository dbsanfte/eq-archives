An unknown intruder attempted to insert a Trojan horse program into the code of the next version of the Linux kernel, stored at a publicly accessible database. Security features of the source-code repository, known as BitKeeper, detected the illicit change within 24 hours, and the public database was shut down, a key developer said Thursday. The public database was used only to provide the latest beta, or test version, of the Linux kernel to users of the Concurrent Versions System (CVS), a program designed to manage source code.<br />
     The changes, which would have introduced a security flaw to the kernel, never became a part of the Linux code and, thus, were never a threat, said Larry McVoy, founder of software company BitMover and primary architect of the source code database BitKeeper. &quot;This never got close to the development tree,&quot; he said. &quot;BitKeeper is really paranoid about integrity, and it turns out that was key to finding this Trojan horse.&quot;<br />
     Linus Torvalds, the original creator of Linux and the lead developer of the kernel, uses BitKeeper to keep track of changes in the core software for the operating system. On a daily basis, the software exports those changes to public and private databases other developers use. <br />

It's it interesting how one person tried to use a similar type of exploit on the Linux machine only to have it foiled by internal secutiry checks.<br />
<br />
Where on the other hand nothing stopped it on the windows OS.</div></div><hr />
