<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atheenath Dawns</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys, im back ! :D<br />
<br />
My location wizard MOD is finally released. Its still a Beta version, but fully operational. Contains over 700 locs all over the EQ world.<br />
<br />
Ive seen many MODS with maps, but a map is worth crap when your lost, and especially when you tend to, like me, look for a zone running with a Benny Hill type of line of mobs on your arse <br />
<br />
General continent tabs (norrath, kunark, velious, luclin) gives locs of all zone connections, dungeons entrances, wiz druid and nexus rings, gems vendors when they sell peridots, as well as docks when applicable. Also listed are popular outside dungeons like Giant forts, or mobs cities, etc. Zones like OOT or TD give locations for every island.<br />
<br />
Cities tabs gives locs of all the zone connections, all the classes guilds (or class trainers for luclin when there is no actual guild), banks, docks when applicable, and gems vendors when they sell peridots.<br />
<br />
Succor tab gives landing loc of succors in all the zones, dungeons (and planes)  included, as well as a brief description of where you land.<br />
<br />
It can be downloaded  **EDIT** Beta 2 is out, check page 4 for link :D<br />
Locs were obtained through eqmaps.com, eqatlas.com, and eqdruids.com mainly.<br />
<br />
Dont be afraid of the mod size. Unlike maps MODS that use pictures, and despite of its 700+ locs, its very small (48kb), since all it contains is text and code.<br />
<br />
It uses the EQUI_FeedbackWnd.xml file, and is toggled on by typing /F in game. That keyboard shortcut is hardcoded within the original window, and therefore cannot be changed.<br />
<br />
You get out of the mod by pressing the Esc key.<br />
<br />
<br />
/Enjoy !!<br />
<br />
<br />
Atheen<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is a screenie<br />
<br />
http://eq.stratics.com/eqskins/equifiles/other/LocWizard.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS : This is a BETA version. (Once I am sure that they are no errors in the locs anymore, I will remove the word beta) Most of these locs were taken from EQMaps.com, EQAtlas.com and the succors were taken from EQDruids.com. I obviously didn't check them all, and it would be delusional and extremely arrogant for me to believe that I didn't do any mistakes entering over 1400 locs and 2250 labels in 51066 lines of code. So if you happened to notice an error, please email me to Allanath@hotmail.com and mention the zone, the item and the correct loc.<br />
<br />
Please email me SIGNIFICANT errors, don't bother sending me an email because I wrote pos300 and it was pos297...<br />
<br />
I hope this mod will be as useful to you than it is to me already.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atheenath Dawns</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woot thank u ! :)<br />
<br />
I wanted to edit my original post and add a poll, but apparently i cant do that so I will just ask in here instead of starting a new thread.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you guys would find it better if I added a tag containing the original eq /feedback window. I personally never used it, (and basically you can allways /load default if you want to get it up), but I was wondering how many of you would actually find it an improovement to the above mod if there was an additional tag containing the feedback window.<br />
<br />
It wouldnt change anything to the mod, except for an additional tag and a slightly wider size.<br />
<br />
Another option would be to put it at the bottom (scrolling down) of the last tag (the succor one basically)<br />
<br />
Please tell me what you think, and give me your comments. They are the only indications I have to know if you liked a mod or not, and if not, why :D<br />

Thanks a whole lot, especially for putting it in the feedback window. Now I can keep my map mod and my Quartz UI. <br />
<br />
I personally don't miss the feedback window one bit, really.. But I suppose you could put it in another tab if there was demand for it.. I'd appreciate two versions then, one with and one without the tab.. I personally would rather have this mod without. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again for this great work.</div></div><hr />

Roy Eltham, Senior Programmer for Everquest interview<br />
<br />
To be specific ...<br />
<br />
Question: Could we get an exact definition as to what kind of UI mods would be against the EULA now. We assume if it doesn't interact with the datastream or alter the actual client's code, it would be allowed.<br />
<br />
Answer: UI mods should not be able to violate the EULA. However, if through some bug in our system you should find a way to alter the code of the game such that it allows you to exploit or cheat then it will be considered a violation. However, while I can't say this will never happen, I can say that is it very unlikely because we have set thing up in such a way that it should not be possible.</div></div><hr />

You've solved a miriad of problems for me. <br />

As for putting the /feedback tag - IMO it's not worth the trouble. In almost 4 yrs of EQ'ing (Since B2) I think I've used the Feedback feature twice?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elpiper</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Folly is correct about the WK succor point.  EQDruids added that it is near the Queynos Hills zone, but the /loc was not changed.  It is now closer to pos 500 neg 1000.<br />
<br />
Also note that the Cobalt Scar point was changed in a very recent patch.  It is no longer in the middle of an otter camp, but on the ramp to SS (where using the key from within SS drops you) which is at about neg 750 pos 800.<br />
<br />
*Note:  I looked for the Velious succor point to correct the CS one in my file, but did not locate it.  I found Antonica, Faydwer, Luclin, Odus and even the planes...  Did you perchance forget to include the Velious Succor points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atheenath Dawns</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOAH so many replies thank u thank u thank u !! <br />
<br />
:nana: :nana: :nana: <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Rivervale<br />
Can you believe that I've played this game since beta and that I ALLWAYS referred to Rivervale as Riverdale ? I mean, I could have sworen it was spelled with a D and not a V. Reading the post this morning, my first thought was : What the heck is RiverVale ? :P<br />
<br />
Its going to be corrected :)<br />
<br />
2. Feedback. <br />
Looks like Im going to have to re include the feedback functions in there again. Not quite sure of how im going to do this, I could :<br />
<br />
a) Add a new tab (would be visible all the time and perma make the mod a tag wider)<br />
<br />
b) Add the feedback window at the bottom of the last page. You would scroll down, for example, the succors tag, and after the succors further down the scroll you would have the feedback window. <br />
<br />
Both are equal in code, so thats not the issue really. Either option is fine by me. Any prefferences on your side ?<br />
<br />
3. Succors (EDIT : read Abscond if you're a wiz ;)<br />
OMFG Elpiper you are absolutely right, I purely and simply ZAPPED the Velious succors. I am really sorry about this. They will be added in today. The 2 succors that have been changed recently will also be corrected.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep on giving me your imput guys, this is great help to me, and also extremely motivating :)<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elpiper</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW as far as the /feedback functionality, I wouldn't want it in there.  As I am stuck at 1024x768, the less wide the window is, the better.<br />
<br />
If it's not complicated, maybe you could offer 2 versions - one with feedback and one without.<br />
<br />
Overall I love this mod.  I was using the other one which is available on this site, but it has some instability problems causing a crash to desktop once in a while, so I much prefer yours.  All I did was change all instances of the word &quot;succor&quot; to &quot;abscond&quot;.  What can I say?  Wizards don't succor.  :)  <br />
<br />
One question, if you know.  Once we open the window, can we then keep it onscreen in a minimized state?  Will that affect the game?  And will it still be there when we relog?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Budil Seeker</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would it be possible to have the feedback as one of the tabs. like you have a tab for kunark, luclin ,and feedback?? if you wish to leave feedback you just click on the feedback tab and type away and has the send in that tab section. Just an idea (wouldnt know where to begin to do this stuff) and my gratitude to everyone who shares there work with others..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you look at it, can you figure out what Reed did to make his Bard Spreedsheet in the feedback window?  He has left the feedback functionality and added the bard stuff as a tab below it.  Just thought you might be able to use his as a bit of a template? /shrug<br />

<br />
If so, WOW dont think i could type that fast<br />
<br />
Im lookin for a way to output formatted text to a window and for the life of me i cant figure it out.<br />
<br />
I tried reeds nice little tool for csv output but i keeps crashing on XP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atheenath Dawns</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the feedback fields<br />
<br />
3 options are available. I can either<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Add a tab<br />
<br />
* Good point : would be easier to access the feedback option<br />
* Bad point : would make the MOD wider by a tab.<br />
<br />
2) Put the feedback option at the bottom of one of the existing tabs (first or last one most prolly)<br />
<br />
* Good point : would keep the size of the mod unchanged<br />
* Bad point : you would need to scroll down till the end of the locs of that tab to access the Feedback fields.<br />
<br />
3) Make a Second version of the MOD including the Feedback tag and leave the actual version unchanged<br />
<br />
* Good point : it wouldnt change anything for the people that dont care about the feedback option. In this case though, I will add a tab to the 2nd mod version.<br />
* Bad point : I can allready SEE pple downloading the wrong version and spamming my email box :D<br />
<br />
I will wait untill tomorrow to see the answers that you guys will post on this thread, and whatever option the majority chooses I will go for. Whatever option is chosen, the according MOD(s) will of course also come with the updated succors for WK and CS and including the Velious succors that I .. erm... forgot to put in /blush<br />
<br />
So keep on posting your reactions, and I will just adapt the BETA 2.0 version(s)  accordingly :D<br />

<br />
I simply didnt put stonebrunt because there is only one zone leading to the warrens, no guilds or gem vendors or bank or druid/wiz ports there. Same goes with Kerra Island and Errud's Crossing (boat access only on top of it). <br />
<br />
I guess I could add 2 lines on Stonebrunt mountains if you think its worth it though, but there will basically only be the loc to the Warrens zone :).  Ill try to implement it for tomorrow's update. <br />

- Succors have been updated, Velious succors included<br />
- Stonebrunt Mountains has been added<br />
- A gem vendor has been added to Neriak Commons<br />

As far as the original feedback option of the window goes, I tried to make a compromise to follow the wishes of these who wanted the feedback option restored, as well as the ones who didnt want an additional tab added in there.<br />
<br />
After fighting with tabs and anchors for a couple hours, here is what I came up with.<br />
<br />
Would that agree with everyone ?<br />

<br />
The reason I didnt put the feedback fields at the top was to avoid pple pressing send or cancel by accident when selecting a tab :)<br />
<br />
Giving it a few more to ensure its ok for the pple that had posted on this thread and had a screen width problem and thus didnt want another tab. Its ready anyway, so as soon as I have confirmation that its ok for them, i will post the link to DL it.<br />

Keep up the great work, Atheenath :D <br />

<br />
I had tried your original one and EQ wouldn't load it (made me load the default UI) - tho this is probably because I'd messed with it a bit, changing a few things, like Succor to Abscond and a few of the locs in it.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to trying it out, my friend.  Thanks for the work you've put into this...</div></div><hr />

Its both on the &quot;Newest FIles&quot; or listed under &quot;Others&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT : if you DONT want the original &quot;Feedback to verant&quot; fields to appear on this window, there are detailed instructions in the readme file as to how to remove them :D<br />

As usual, try it out, and give me your imput/comments. Its the only way I have to make it better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elpiper</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the update!  Really appreciate it and really useful tool.<br />
<br />
One little request - is it possible to get the titles text in a color other than red?  For some reason it's hard for me to make out that color on my screen, and it's not as clear for me as it is on your screenshots.<br />
<br />
Can you advise what I would have to change in the .XML file to make this text green instead?<br />
<br />
Also, just looking through the file, I found a few minor spelling errors which you might consider correcting for your next version.  Check out the proper spelling for the following zone names and compare to your text entries:<br />
<br />
Feerrott<br />
Felwithe<br />
Jaggedpine Forest<br />
Lake of Ill Omen<br />
Rivervale (yes, there are still a few Riverdales in there)  :)<br />
Runnyeye<br />
Shadow Haven<br />
Timorous Deep<br />
Twilight Sea<br />
Warsliks Woods<br />
<br />
Like I said, this is a minor thing considering the number of entries you had to make on this awesome mod.  I corrected them in my own file, backing up the original in case my messing up all the tag lengths and what not made it stop working...   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atheenath Dawns</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. To change the label color from red to green. This is an example of what you have to look for :<br />
<br />
        &lt;Label item =&quot;Befallen&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Font&gt;4&lt;/Font&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;80&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;30&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;250&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;100&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;Text&gt;Befallen&lt;/Text&gt;<br />
		&lt;AlignLeft&gt;true&lt;/AlignLeft&gt;<br />
		&lt;TextColor&gt;<br />
				&lt;R&gt;255&lt;/R&gt;<br />
				&lt;G&gt;0&lt;/G&gt;<br />
				&lt;B&gt;0&lt;/B&gt;<br />
		&lt;/TextColor&gt;<br />
&lt;/Label&gt;		<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then you need to change the following to make labels green instead of red :<br />
<br />
Change this :<br />
<br />
&lt;TextColor&gt;<br />
	&lt;R&gt;255&lt;/R&gt;<br />
	&lt;G&gt;0&lt;/G&gt;<br />
	&lt;B&gt;0&lt;/B&gt;<br />
&lt;/TextColor&gt;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Into this :<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;TextColor&gt;<br />
	&lt;R&gt;0&lt;/R&gt;<br />
	&lt;G&gt;255&lt;/G&gt;<br />
	&lt;B&gt;0&lt;/B&gt;<br />
&lt;/TextColor&gt;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
And im afraid you have to do that for each and every title...<br />
<br />
If I get more feedback from pple that have a hard time seeing labels in red, i might as well change it for next version, we shall see.<br />
<br />
As far as RiverDale is concerned, well what can I say, old habbits are hard to loose :D<br />
<br />
I will make the changes for BETA 3.0 :)<br />
<br />

Apparently, depending on your Winzip program version this might happend. So basically, either download a more recent version of Unzip, or unzip it to your desktop first, and THEN moove it to the UI custom folder you want it in.<br />

<br />
Is there anyway to change it from the friends button to the pet button? <br />
Since pets do not zone with us and sometimes during PvP battles things take place at zones. Really need that right clicky window to stay up at all times. It's probably not as easy as changing the name of the files to there opposites so figured i would ask. Read somewhere that wont be able to keep the friends open.<br />
<br />
Sorry for going way off the track i couldnt find the post for the right clicky again. &lt;bows&gt;</div></div><hr />

Your mod looks like just the thing I needed, but for some strange reasons it errors out when loading, after putting your mod in the dir. Drakah doesnt use custom of the feedback window himself, and I have tried unpackin it with two zip programs with the same error.<br />

<br />
When you install the LocWizard on a customUI folder alone, does it work ?<br />

<br />

<br />
Installing it into the default directory. <br />
<br />
It has to go in your custom directory and when you get in game you have to type /loadskin(space)NameOfYourCustomFolder(space)1</div></div><hr />

<br />
You answered your own question. The patcher scans and overwrites the Default directory every time you start EQ. <br />
<br />
To use any mod at all you need to create a new folder in the UIFiles. Something simple like Mods works well. <br />
<br />
Unzip the file to the new folder. Start EQ and logg your character. <br />
<br />
Type /load &lt;folder&gt; 1 (DOn't forget the 1 or you'll have to redo all your window preferences)<br />
<br />
After a few secs and what looks like a zone, you will have the new files loaded. <br />
<br />
You'll need to load the mod for each character the first time you log them on.</div></div><hr />

Hehe obviously you have a better sense of direction than I do! I could get lost in an empty room. :) Thank you for posting those locs Croso, and Atheenath for so kindly helping us directionally impaired people!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wink</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im not using Athee's loc wizard atm but ive run into the same problems using Keizloc2 all loc listing are fine about 3/4 the way down than its turned the rest of my list into a one line blurry mumbo jumbo of supposed to be loc listings since the 2/6 patch, im thinking that whatever they messed up to cause the migrating windows/guages its affecting this is similar ways. ATM im hoping verant comes up with a fix for there migrating windows problem and in turn will fix this. A reinstallation of the mod AFTER VI fixes migrating windows(if they do) should cure this problem, if not i pray for updates as these loc mods are GODLY at times :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greywain</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I seem to be having the same problem,  with the loc wizard and my Tradeskill companion add-on as well.  The data appears fine on the upper 3/4 of the screen however when you scroll down the remainder of the data is wrapped all together at the bottom.  I Have noticed that the amount that you can scroll down has been restricted in some way.  My right hand scroll bar use to be tiny and now it is large.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starshelle</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the exact same problem on both computers that I have the mod installed. I hope it gets fixed soon, I had so much trouble finding the entrance to Seb last night that I had to window out of EQ and look it up in EQAtlas. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atheenath Dawns</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will have to look into this. If verant fixed a scroll down limit, which Im enclined to think if this happens in other mods as well, I might have to add another intermediary alphabetical tab so that the list to scroll down is shorter.<br />
<br />
I will see. Might want to wait for a week though, in case they have the great idea of correcting their f00kups :D<br />
<br />
In any case, I will be looking into this during the week end, so hang on with me there guys and gals :)<br />
