<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winterwind</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an idea in mind for a mod I'd like to make for my necro.  I have no idea what files I need to edit, though I have some small experience in editing files so far with good results.  <br />
<br />
I thought I'd get some feedback/advice from you guys here.  I'm wanting to make one long window that is moveable without click and drag.  I'd like to keep it the width of the original player window.<br />
<br />
This is what I had in mind:<br />
<br />
<br />
Player name  <br />
health gauge<br />
mana gauge<br />
stamina gauge<br />
<br />
Petname      Getlost(hotkey)<br />
pet health gauge<br />
taunt            guard<br />
back off         follow<br />
attack           sit down<br />
<br />
spellgem   spelldescription with wrapping text<br />
......&quot;...................&quot;<br />
......&quot;...................&quot;<br />
......&quot;...................&quot;<br />
......&quot;...................&quot;<br />
......&quot;...................&quot;<br />
......&quot;...................&quot;<br />
......&quot;...................&quot;<br />
<br />
group member 1 health gauge<br />
group member 2 health gauge<br />
group member 3 health gauge<br />
group member 4 health gauge<br />
group member 5 health gauge<br />
<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me an idea about:<br />
<br />
which window I should use to be this window (player window?); <br />
<br />
which xml files I will need to delete items from, <br />
<br />
or if I need to set some things to 0,0 <br />
<br />
or have a message saying pretty much &quot;directing this file to the other file&quot; if there is such a thing?<br />
<br />
And if you think I'm being too ambitious just say so. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take a close look at the file names. Your answers are all there, except maybe the spell gems. VI insisted to use CastSpellWnd.xml. Why not SpellWindow or SpellGems is beyond me.<br />
<br />
Player: PlayerWindow.xml<br />
Group: GroupWindow.xml<br />
Pet: PetWindow.xml<br />
SpellGems: CastSpellWnd.xml<br />
<br />
What to remove, move around, etc varies on what you want to do.<br />
<br />
I would suggest this: Take everything from PlayerWindow and CastSpellWnd and put it into GroupWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Reason: When you move the Pet_HP(call it) from someplace outside it's original window, it will not vanish.<br />
It's better to have your perm pet HP bar up than 6 group member perm HP bars.<br />
<br />
Also, remember there are restrictions that must be followed:<br />
<br />
&amp;middot; Can't move buttons (sorry mate, unable to move the PetWindow buttons outside of that window)<br />
&amp;middot; Can't remove Pet_HP (doesn't mean you can't make a new one)<br />
<br />
And, keep an eye on your UIError.txt file located in your EverQuest directory, it's a big big big help when trying to debug errors.</div></div><hr />

Your best bet would be to use all the actual windows, but skin them so they look like one window I'd think.<br />

<br />
Atleast I know I've seen Hotkey Box mods that have done that.</div></div><hr />
