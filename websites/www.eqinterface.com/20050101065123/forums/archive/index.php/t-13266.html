<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmaxx</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using the T.King UI dated 2/12 since it came out. No error messages. After the 3/25 download every time I sign on, in my chat window it says something about an XML error and UI files might not work correctly. Why is that and do I need to do something to make it stop saying that. <br />

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are the two relevant error messages.  The first one can be resolved by following the instructions in this post:<br />
<br />
www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13239 (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13239)<br />
<br />
As for the second error message, can't tell at first glance what is causing that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmaxx</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">when I click on the link you posted it says page can not be displayed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, formatting error when I entered the URL tag.  It works now.<br />
<br />
To clarify further, the problem is with a change in the EQUI_Options.xml file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmaxx</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When posting that in my files, do I delete whats already there, copy over them?<br />
I tried to add them and nothing happens. I'm under EQUI_Optionswindow.xml (program files) is this correct. <br />
If not, please walk me thru how to get where I need to be. <br />
Thanks in advance for all the help.</div></div><hr />
