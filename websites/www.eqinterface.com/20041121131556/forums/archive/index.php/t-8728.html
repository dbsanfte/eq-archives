** Experience System Change - Grouping ** <br />
<br />
We`ve made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in all of EverQuest. At its core, the idea is to positively reinforce grouping. There should never be any penalty to adding &quot;that sixth person over there,&quot; whatever class they may be, into your group. That is exactly the type of behavior that should be rewarded. <br />
<br />
In a massively multi-player game, any mechanic that penalizes those who group is one that we need to take a serious look at. While there are definite benefits to forming &quot;well balanced&quot; groups in terms of damage, tanking, healing, and support, there shouldn`t be an active penalty to those who cannot find groups of &quot;optimal&quot; balance. <br />
<br />
As it stands in EverQuest, groups gain a 2% to 20% experience bonus, which we refer to as the &quot;group bonus&quot;, for having two to six members. In practice, however, this has never been much of a bonus, even in the case of a full group, given that the experience was already being divided six ways. <br />
<br />
In the past, we had also attempted to reward people for adventuring in the more challenging Planes of Power zones by making those zones give a better rate of experience. <br />
<br />
As of this update, groups now gain 20% to 80% &quot;group bonus&quot; experience for having two to five members. <br />
<br />
Full, six-person, groups now see an additional bonus. Their experience is only divided five ways, yet they still gain the 80% &quot;group bonus.&quot; For those who think in terms of pie charts, it amounts to a larger piece of a larger pie. <br />
<br />
Accordingly, the bonus inherent to Planes of Power zones will be decreased slightly. However, as long as person is grouped with at least one other, they will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system. The one down side to the new system is that there will be a slight decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones. <br />
<br />
We realize that we are, essentially, &quot;manufacturing&quot; a new type of experience after a kill. As players, we also understand it is the people who spend time in full groups who have to deal with the most interruptions and setup time caused by organizing the extra people. It simply makes sense to reward that extra time, especially if it means bringing more people together. After all, that`s the whole point. <br />
<br />
We look forward to seeing how these changes play out on Test Server. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Experience System Change - Level 60+ ** <br />
<br />
In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC levels that give a person experience after they reach level 60. The &quot;blue to 65&quot; range has been increased as far as level 50, with the &quot;light blue&quot; range extending to level 45. The best benefits, however, are still for fighting things around and above your level. <br />
<br />
The world of EverQuest, at this point in its history, is truly immense and full of the best and most interesting content and visuals out there. Ideally, when a person logs on they should have a wide array of places in which to adventure. The addition of new content shouldn`t entirely obsolete what already exists. Hopefully these changes will once again make that the case.</div></div><hr />
