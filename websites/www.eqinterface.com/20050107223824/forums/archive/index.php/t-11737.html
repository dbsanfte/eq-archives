<br />
As some of you know, the ATI 9600's have been lacking with the 3D-Target Rings. I'm not sure if the 9800's had the problem or not, but supposedly the patch fixed it. Well it didn't. However it does work on test. SoE forgot to bring the EQGfx_Dx8.DLL from test over to Live. So what you can do in the mean time, if you are hard up for target rings, is to patch to test. After patch is done, you can exit the patcher. Go into you EQ folder and copy EQGfx_Dx8.DLL to a safe place. Now go ahead and patch EQ Live, before you hit the play button, copy the &quot;safe&quot; EQGfx_Dx8.DLL into your EQ folder and POOF you have target rings.<br />

Special thanks to Lithale of Eqbeastlords for this fix, it really does work</div></div><hr />

<br />
How does one connect to the test server?  I see people mention it all the time, but I dont see anything called &quot;test&quot; in my list of possible servers to connect to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OneDeadlyBum</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go into your EQ directory and look for TestEverQuest.exe, it'll patch up your game for the test server, then hit play and you'll see a list of servers (Currently only discord and test with testeqgame).<br />
<br />
Just follow the instructions in the post.</div></div><hr />

ati 9600 pro here</div></div><hr />

<br />
I copied the file over BEFORE I ran the regular patcher again and it overwrote the test file.  You have to turn off the autoplay feature and then copy the file over after it patches but before you press play (like the directions say).<br />
<br />
Works for me now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trystlore</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i appreciate all the help with ATI cards , i have tried all the tricks that i can find posted (radion 7000 here ) and none have them have worked for me. Now i realize the mobility chipsets aren't working but mine is the regular 7000, i have yet to ever get the 3d target ring, (whick is cool , thanks SOE, if it would just work LOL) anyways i digress if any no if my chipset is just not compatable or if they no a trick to make it work information either way would be appreciated . Thank you in advance =) PS DX9 win xp newestati drivers available as referenced today. tried force TnL with 3d analizer (prolly not doing it right) still no luck it just has me bugged for the fact i dont see any other 7000 series users posting<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heel Promo</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taken from THIS (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/049581.html) thread on the Tech Help board on eqlive:<br />
<br />
1)Patch Test (testeverquest.exe in your Everquest folder)<br />
2)Rename EQGfx_DX8.dll to EQGfx_DX8test.dll<br />
3)Open your eqclient.ini file and add and/or edit your UseGfxDLL line to read: UseGfxDLL=EQGfx_Dx8Test.DLL and save the file. (If that line does not exist in your ini file, add it)<br />
4)Run the regular patcher and log in and rejoice.<br />
<br />
<br />
*EDIT* FYI I have an ATI Radeon 9200 and this fix worked flawlessly for me</div></div><hr />
