I think they just take up space and I wouldn't use them to justify when Im going to cast my next spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really important but some people just like to see the numbers :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, I prefer the Number %s over the bars.<br />
<br />
%s give you the most accurate information, so you can make more clear judgements..<br />
<br />
Bubbles cause inaccuracies. Maybe I'm a detailed person, but I prefer seeing 24% than guess 25(ish)%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also prefer the numbers, particularly for my higher lvl healers.... I know when the bubble is almost empty, I might be able to get one last heal in.... but now I know that when it says 9% mana, I can wait till 11% to cast the next heal rather than hitting my hotkey over and over and over and getting the message &quot;insufficient mana&quot; while that tiny little, unnoticable-via-bubble, 2% builds back up.  That's a waste of time and text, imo.<br />
<br />
Also, for my characters that need to summon (my wizzie with no conjure skill)... she can sit until x% and continue medding rather than standing up frequently to see if that bubble is quite full enough - whether or not it's moved, so she can get her new familiar and get going again.  The standing slows the medding time - again a waste.<br />
<br />
But anyhow - it's all up to the user.  Some people would prefer to just use the bars and not take up the space the numbers need.  I, on the other hand, play too many caster-types to wish it that way.  :)<br />

Doing a quick look at a bar in the middle of a heated battle could give me the wrong idea as to what mana I actually have left. Seeing a percentage gives me a dead on amount.<br />
<br />
I would rather have just a percent listed without the bars than bars without the percentage.<br />
<br />
But just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mindmaster</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a matter of personal preference.  In my case, I have gotten so conditioned to seeing the bars and guessing how much mana I have for instance, that not seeing the bars would be quite unnerving.  However, I do like to know exactly (within 1%) what resources I do have available.  Therefore, for everywhere that I can use a bar, I also use a %.  Having more information than needed is MUCH more preferable than not having enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arantius</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With percentages, I can know that (barring resists) I will do so many percent damage with another nuke, and know that it will take so many percent mana, and deal with adverse situations much more efficiently.  Complete heal timing is tweaked.  Tons of things work much better with better efficiency because of precision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loral</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bars give you the advantage of a quick visual cue as to where things stand.  Having bars for group health helps you see very quickly with little brain power that things are great or lousy.  Without even really looking at it you can see where your mana is and your own health.<br />
<br />
The percentages give you really accurate information.  Knowing that a tank has 5000 hps and that he is down to 20 percent on the nose lets you calculate exactly when you should start a complete heal.  You can get a lot more accuracy with the percentages but you have to be activly looking at them and running calculations in your head.<br />
<br />
Based on these two different principles we can determine what info we need and put percentages and bars where appropriate.<br />
<br />
In my own ui, I removed bars for stamina, exp, aaxp because I just didn't need that visual reference like you do with player and group health.<br />
<br />
You can take a look at mine at http://loralciriclight.com/ui.html<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mostly I play a ranger, so the percentages aren't always useful to me.  However, having them alongside or imposed over a bar is useful for when mana is low and I really need to get a snare off ASAP, or perhaps a jolt, for example.<br />
<br />
I like having the information available for use for those who will use it, so I prefer to include it in my mods.  I try to make the mods as universally usable as possible, with the skins making the difference between classes (I recently turned the bars into arrows for my ranger skin I am working on).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anathae</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking as a pilot, a &quot;guage&quot; is more intuitive than a numeric readout.  Night and instrument flying requires that you have a sweep second hand watch exactly for this reason.<br />
<br />
Anathae (having both is the best in my opinion)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dregor</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i guess it depends on how you think about things... if your thought process is &quot;me see small red, me almost dead&quot; or &quot;me see large red, me good to go&quot; then you should probally stick with the bars. personally i automatically switch it into percentages in my mind... have always done so since i started playing. so its more natural for me to see a percentage than a bar. although for simplicity/usability i leave the bars there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As stated before .. Bars are good for glances, but percentages are what matter.<br />
<br />
Think about it:<br />
A_monk tells guild, &quot;Mana ChecK&quot;<br />
A_cleric tells guild, &quot;CLR 43&quot;<br />
<br />
Or do you say: &quot;CLR 2bubbles&quot;<br />
