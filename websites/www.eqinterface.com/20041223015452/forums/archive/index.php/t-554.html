<br />
Well first let me say this new ui is more fun than a barell of monkeys.<br />
<br />
I have a few questions for you XML people out there. I am very fond of the Quartz skin . i think its a great indication of where this new UI can go , however its a little too busy for me . Some pieces of it are excelent tho. I really like this little window<br />

<br />
The player info window is also awsome, my question is is it possible to extract just this piece? i have been trying to mess with it some but as my XML skills are non existant , I havent been having a lot of luck. I saw the link to the player window that someone put up and have been able to get that to work but i have had zero success trying to pull out this weapons equip window out on my own.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help you gurus can come up with</div></div><hr />
