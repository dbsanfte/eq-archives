Like how aa exp &amp;normal exp is shown in inventory window and else where<br />
<br />
I tried to integrate a player info window into I believe it w/ the gems window ...and I got huge error for doing it.. Is it possible?<br />
<br />
Anyone have a link or list <br />
of what each component in the .xml do...like <br />
	&lt;Button item = &quot;GW_DisbandButton&quot;&gt;  which button that works for etc.....Thought I remember seeing a link but the one I thought it was is broken(below).....(&amp; graphic windows --though these are pretty easy ..to just open on Adobe)<br />
If these don't I may just put together a UI 101 ..file w/ this stuff in it if people are willing to help.<br />
<br />
Is it still not possible to add auto loot to another window or have it in more than one window*? Asking since now you can move the buff window out of the pet window.<br />
<br />
UI mods can't do at all any action in the game. Anything the user can do , the UI mod can't do, not repeatedly , not even once ....   from http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2267<br />
<br />
On an similar note anyone know of a auto-equip built into inventory window but on all the time..?(like formatted in?)</div></div><hr />
