<br />
<br />
<br />
I worked on that for some time, trying to create a simple, generic set of windows that is very usable by any class (and indeed helpful to any class).<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=711 <br />
<br />
I am definitely open for tweaks, etc, for version 4.x and ultimately version 5.0 of my window set.  Just wondering what you think...<br />
<br />
Briefly, let me explain my rationale behind these three setups.<br />
<br />
First, all three of these windows are displayed at once-- these are not 3 different &quot;versions&quot; of one window.  The above windows are the player, group, and target window collectively.  I wanted to create a simple set of these three that can be moved around to be placed exactly where it best fits each player.<br />
<br />
I added the large hit points (inspired by AYA's sets) so no matter what's happening, you can get a FAST view of your current state of health (and also get an indicator when certain HP buffs wear off).  I inserted this large HP view in both the target window AND the group window so that ANY player would have quick access to it... clerics I imagine focus on the group window, but need to know when to hit that hot key saying they're being wacked on.  :P  Warriors don't really care about their groupies (lol!) but need to know their own HPs when they're targeting their mob....<br />
<br />
Anyway, let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />

I would definitely use your windows / code / ideas - whatever you want to call it, with some graphics of my own.   ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuririnsama</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any chance that you might switch the target and player windows back, so that the player information is in the player window?  I've got a target window already that I'm used to using, but I think the window you have with all the stats is fantastic.  I never really liked the red flashing around the target window anyway, hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fryfrog</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the image link isn't working for me, but i assume this is your v4 group/player/target windows.  i  use them and really like them, BUT the only thing i don't like is their size.<br />
<br />
i might look into it myself, but my suggestion would be to remove most of the stats from the player window and make the target windows little globe thing smaller.  the goal would be to make each window half the size of the group window, then they could fit together very well.<br />
<br />
if possible, you could have some well place comments to allow certain generic classes to have their pertinent info on the screen.<br />
<br />
like, warriors prolly only need their str/sta (dropping wis, int, cha), hybrid casters only need str/sta/wis or int, int casters probably only need int, wis casters only wis... etc...<br />
<br />
also, i sorta like having resists on the screen, but dropping them would shrink the size a bit and it probably would not effect the window much.<br />
<br />
atk and wt aren't exactly what i would call super needed into either :)</div></div><hr />
