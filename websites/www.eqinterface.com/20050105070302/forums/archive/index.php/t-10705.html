I noticed that with LDoN that a few Augments and the bag of Abu-kar look like necklaces, the reason for this I beleive is in the animations file. in the default it list up to dragitem_27 and in Delta is does not. i spent 6 hours (/cries) to try and fix it, but i couldn't place it successfully into Delta 2's animations file. Next is the Pet Window. Can't make the buff windo for pets. so if someone could fix that as well. it would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
