<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emil</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This UI was made with conservation of space in mind.  Also, I'm extremely 'nit pickey' about things being symmetrical, hehe..<br />
<br />
Works in 1280 and 1024 resolutions.  (I personally run in 1280x720, windowed)<br />
<br />
Has 2 player info mods included, for mana users, and non-mana users.<br />
<br />
I used alot of parts from various UI's available; however, I did wind up rewriting the player, group, stats, pet windows - so I don't know if this qualifies as a mix &amp; match or not..<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure it's bug-free,<br />
<br />
Anyway, enjoy --<br />
<br />
(hmm file too big to attach, what to do?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
To upload it, go to the eqinterface homepage and to the left under downloads click complete sets. On the complete sets page click upload skin and follow the directions there.<br />
<br />
I've been looking for an interface like this - one thats all lined up perfectly. Instead, *most*(not all) I see seem like they just put the windows in randomly whereever they fit(Maybe they fit well for the creater, I dunno). Anyway, good job. <br />
<br />
There's only one problem I have with it, but I can fix that myself. I like to have the hp percentage of my group members. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, what zone are you in in that screenshot? I haven't raided much, that place looks pretty interesting. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dinian</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is scary how similar your UI is to the one I use.<br />
<br />
I think I'll upload mine soon so you can compare :D<br />
<br />
Mine uses slightly more space though since I prefer to full screen EQ and I'm not so vertically constrained. However, I agree that symmetry is the win ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velorek</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like this UI because it's treamlined to use as little vertical space as possible, yet has all the important info I'm looking for. However, there is an issue with that I can't seem to figure out. It seems to load fine but I still get the following red error message:<br />
<br />
&quot;Your XML files are not compatible with current EverQuest files, certain windows may not perform correctly. Use /loadskin Default 1 to load the EverQuest default skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Any idea what's wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emil</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think its because i removed the buttons from the grp window (invite/lfg/disband).<br />
<br />
It still works, even with the error message.<br />
<br />
I got alot of feedback and am gonna clean up a few things over the next week, and release a more polished version.<br />
<br />
I made this UI for me (monk, melee).. im now working thru caster-type requests to make it a bit more caster/hybrid friendly.<br />
<br />
-- and pet info is F1, i removed it from the playerinfo window<br />
<br />
for instance, heres a bit more caster friendly player window.<br />
<br />
- thickened mana bar<br />
- made casting bar more visible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velorek</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, thanks for the response. I also play a Monk as well and would like to give you some feedback. These are, of course, based just off my own personal preferences. =)<br />
<br />
Things I'd like to see added or changed:<br />
<br />
- Add buttons to the group window. I've come to rely on them being there. Plus, I hate error messages. =)<br />
- Add Page buttons to the Hot Buttons window. I don't use alot of keyboard shortcuts so having them would help.<br />
- Add book icon to the spellbar (for my caster alts).<br />
- Modify the weight location. With numbers over 100, it just doesn't seem to fit.<br />
<br />
Other changes that I've already done myself:<br />
<br />
- Moved AC and ATK to the Target window along with the other stats. <br />
- Modified the HP label to be Type=70 instead of 3 separate labels for current, slash and max.<br />
- Increased the font size of the HPs to Font=5 so as to be easier for my eyes to pick up.<br />
- Replaced the Window Selector file with one from another UI (Drakah's).<br />
<br />
Attached is a screenshot of what I've done to better illustrate (in 1280X1024).<br />
<br />
Again, nice work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velorek</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple other ideas I forgot to mention... <br />
<br />
You'll notice that underneath the HPs in the Player window in that screenshot I posted, there is some &quot;dead&quot; space to use now. You could potentially use that for other info like player name,  surname, class, title, level, AA points or anything like that. I wouldn't want to make it too cluttered but if there's enough room, might as well try and utilize it. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can that space be used to pet bar?<br />
<br />
Btw could you post the player window Velorek?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emil</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok this is where i'm headed:<br />
<br />
- compressed it down<br />
- removed the clickies from hotbox (i never used them)<br />
- moved AAexp / Exp to the stats box<br />
- shrank player window<br />
- shrank grp window<br />
- added % to grp members<br />
- managed to fit the compass in there<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
will work out a better compass image soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emil</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and the caster one:<br />
<br />
- same changes<br />
<br />
and..<br />
<br />
- made the spell gem bar fit in with everything else...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koreclaan</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i can't see target window i am currently running at 1200x750</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice changes there :)<br />
Post if you can<br />
The target is over the health bar. Not showing on picture</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stavesoffury</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like this ui..only problem ( and this is a personal preferance) is i like my taget and plaer window to be seperate...i was thinking maybe turn the window selector into the side stat bar and change that back to target, then edit the target part out of the player window ( again this is just a personal preferance):D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">really nice UI, this is the one i use now with some modifications though<br />
- background textures, and buttons modified<br />
- bank and merchant modified<br />
- using caster version but i took off the % mana (i'm a warrior, i just need the casting gauge)<br />
- changed the different clickies to fit my needs<br />
<br />
now i'd like to get your new group window, where could we get it ? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daisy</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont know if this was in your code, or something that I did while modifying, noticed it after I did some stuff. But the PR was taking the value off of the INT..like they were the same and was reading the INT number. Just a headsup to check out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velorek</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the latest changes. However, may I suggest adding an &quot;options&quot; folder that includes the following:<br />
<br />
- alternate HB window with Right-Clicks to the right of the Inventory clicks and small paging buttons for the hot-keys at the top.<br />
- alternate Group window with &quot;Invite&quot;, &quot;Disband&quot; and &quot;LFG&quot; buttons included. <br />
<br />
The rationale is this...a UI can be designed perfectly but if it isn't convenient to use, players may not use it for very long. The suggestions above sound like personal preferences for me but I think most people use them. The only evidence I have to support that claim is browsing through the majority of UIs out there. Most are designed with these features so clearly, folks seem to be asking for them. Plus, with no grouping buttons and the lack of an Actions window (I don't see it but if it's there, forgive me), I'm not even sure how you even join or start a group.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I understand that this is your UI and you're designing it around your playstyle. If you're posting it with the idea that it is what it is and if others like it, they're free to use it. If so, then ignore my suggestions and post away. On the other hand, if the idea is to create something for both you and others to use and enjoy, then you may want to consider including an additional options folder with the suggestions above, giving players the choice to use what they like best. <br />
<br />
Again, I like your approach to the design. I'm personally always looking for ways to keep my UI footprint low to the ground yet contain the information I need or want. Yours is very close to what I'm looking for so that's why the feedback. <br />
<br />
Again, keep up the great work! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emil</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ctrl i = Invite, or accept a grp.<br />
<br />
Ctrl d = disband!<br />
<br />
hehe..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/inv - invite or accept invite<br />
/disb - disband<br />
/lfg - LFG window<br />
<br />
Honestly... buttons? Who needs 'em.<br />
<br />
Enok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velorek</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I said several times, it's for convenience.<br />
<br />
Not saying Emil should add them or that he needs to add them. I suggested he consider adding them or creating an alternate file with them included for folks who have grown accustomed to using them. <br />
<br />
Clear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emil</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1963<br />
<br />
Ignore the EmilUI2melee.zip -- it has an error in it... and just DL this one (error free i hope!)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cinae</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this UI and have greedily used it since you put it up!!! Compact and yet still informative. Next best thing to playing with no UI showing at all! <br />
I like watching the graphics of the zone I'm in. Plus targeting is a cinch without any &quot;fluff&quot; in the way!<br />
<br />
Great Job!<br />
<br />
I do have one teensy problem..   :(  I play in the new LoY zones alot. I have noticed that occasionally, items will give me the old &quot;looks like a pearl necklace&quot; error. <br />
<br />
I have checked the &quot;help&quot; board to make sure there weren't any easy fixes but the UI seems tight and already has the fix described for this problem. <br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

but... compass seems &quot;broken&quot; <br />
