<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mckenna</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the last full patch. I have been having my skill window not come up on a few different UI's. I can see the &quot;skills&quot; button on my inventory screen, push it and nothing happens. It's happened on more then one computer and oddly the same UI on a different character, the skill window will work for (/boggle). It's also happened on completely different UI's. Only the skill window seems to not function.<br />
<br />
Any Idea's?<br />

Guildies who use just the default w/o mods ever have the same problem also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure the window is within screen limits. Or it may be up you just cant see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarsippius</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is a similar error to the confirmation box error people are experiencing and are probably linked.  either way this is a server side bug that only affects some people for one reason or another and the best thing to do is /bug and /report it til they can find and fix it.  there was another post on the confirmation box error that said they had success with a full reinstall of EQ to fix it as well as a detailed list of 5 or 6 specific files to delete and force a thorough file check with some minor inconveniences such as losing your friends/ignore list that also seems to have worked for others and I would bet it works the same for the skills window problem.<br />
<br />
Wish it was in our power to fix<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">neonod</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue seems to be a change that was done to some people's ini's yet not to all. (It happened on one of my pcs yet not the other for the same character). <br />
<br />
Edit your characters INI file (ui_character_server.ini), do a search for &quot;SkillsWindow&quot;, change the values for the width/height. (example below)<br />
<br />
Width1280x1024=0<br />
Height1280x1024=0<br />
change to.....<br />
<br />
Width1280x1024=300<br />
Height1280x1024=240</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fandrel</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That solved it.   Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">afferon</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aanamienae make sure your in the UI_character.ini. There are now two Ini files for your character. one is the usual one for your server and the other is the UI ini file usually found at the bottom of the files list. If that was missing you probably were in the wrong ini file</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mckenna</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Odd, I had those values in there already. I've been on vacation so I'll have to peek at it again to see what the differences are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sedasi</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried changing my &quot;Skillswindow&quot; values like suggested and I still cannot see my skill window.  Any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">haledce</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok I had this problem myself. The way I fixed it was to edit the UI_charname_servername.ini file.<br />

Find the section SkillsWindow and you should see something like this:<br />
<br />
[SkillsWindow]<br />
XPos1024x768=300<br />
YPos1024x768=300<br />
Width1024x768=400<br />
Height1024x768=300<br />
BGTint.red=255<br />
BGTint.green=255<br />
BGTint.blue=255<br />
BGType=1<br />
Fades=true<br />
Delay=2000<br />
Duration=500<br />
Alpha=255<br />
FadeToAlpha=255<br />
Locked=false<br />
XPos1280x1024=300<br />
YPos1280x1024=300<br />
Width1280x1024=374<br />
Height1280x1024=414<br />
<br />
You need to make sure that the position and size values are not zero for the resolution that you are using (mine was before I changed em). Set these to sensible values and the window should display again.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
