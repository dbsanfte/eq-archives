<br />
Remember:<br />
<br />
chose the &quot;upload file&quot; from the section your mod goes in. That is how the upload portal knows what section to put it in.<br />
<br />
Complete Sets are for original mods, and we have determined that means at least 60% of it must be originally created by you. <br />
<br />
Mix-n-Match are for modified versions of other peoples UIs.. If less than 60% of the XMLs TGAs or other files were created/editted by you. they should be here. and proper credit to the orginal author given. (IE. all you did was move the objects around or add another inventory or spell book this is the section for you.)<br />
<br />
Any files that are in the wrong section, OR do not have a description will be deleted, we get files with no discriptions when the upload fails, So please make sure to fill in a description. <br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
