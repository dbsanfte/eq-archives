I need someone who is better at XML than my 6 yr. old (since he can most likely do it better than me) to see if this can be done.  I have found the T.King Spellbook, and grabbed the Beastlord mod for the book and it looks great.  I like Mafoos player window that came out a bit ago, and I am looking for a Pet window that really takes the cake.<br />
<br />
The pet window I saw was nice.  It had the features of looking at your inventory on a tab.  I was wondering if it can be modified to show the percent of your pets health, and maybe add a key to act like the /pet report button to see what buffs are still on and so forth.  I dont know about all of you, but I do find these features useful still.  =)<br />
<br />
If anyone can help me, I would think the best of ya.  There are alot of great skinners and XML people here, so I figured I would ask and see what I got.<br />
<br />
Thanks all<br />
