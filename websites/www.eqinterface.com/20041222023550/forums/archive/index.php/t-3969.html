<br />
I currently have AT&amp;T Broadband for my internet connection... <br />
<br />
Recently, I started having problems with them.  I got fed up one night, and called a local DSL service provider and ordered their service.<br />
<br />
Well, between the time I placed that call and the time I actually got the DSL service installed, AT&amp;T came out and replaced my modem.... and guess what?  The cable modem service works GREAT.  It's back up just as fast as before (I get speeds up to 1.8MB download)...<br />
<br />
But now I also have my DSL service setup.  I need to decide on one to CANCEL.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?  And please include reasons for your answers, not just a &quot;Get DSL 'cause AT&amp;T stinks!&quot;   I have had good service from BOTH, and I am looking to get some solid input here....<br />
<br />
As a note, I am currently BIASED toward keeping AT&amp;T for the simple fact that I have my email address and web pages already setup through them, and it'll be a pain in the butt to transfer everything over to my new DSL (not to mention the DSL provider doesn't offer as much free web space)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completely support the Cable Internet industry. First off, cable is a thick cord so larger bandwidth can be carried at lower frequency resulting in less corrupted data, also quality of phone lines can affect DSL service. DSL I believe maxes at 728 kilobaud while Cable can reach much higher speeds.<br />

<br />
My Cablem Modem:<br />
Download 400- 600kps ( i have hit 700 on mine)<br />
Upload 160-200kps (depending on provider)<br />
<br />
Earthlink DLS: <br />
&quot;The maximum speed you can get with EarthLink DSL is 1.5Mbps (768Kbps in certain areas) in the &quot;downstream&quot; direction (information coming to you, such as Web pages or downloaded files) and 128Kbps in the &quot;upstream&quot; direction&quot; <br />
<br />
Download 768 (if availble and you pay max fee)<br />
Upload 128 max<br />
<br />
I went cable modem.. just based on speed and reliabilty.. I also have 4 computers running off of a network hub.. sooo i wanted toe speed an stability</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my area, they offer high speed DSL ( 768 apprently, not 728 kilobaud ) which two friends of mine have, they can get a max of 150 KB a sec download speed but average 80 or so. Me and another friend have Adelphia Cable Internet and we have both maxed at about 200 to 220 KB a sec download but average 100 or so. This is tests done downloading big files from fast servers. I'm not sure what speed the kilobaud rating is supposed to compare to for downloading of kilobytes per second, I just know our cable internet beats their DSL.<br />

DSL Reports (http://www.dslreports.com) has a good speed test (http://www.dslreports.com/stest).<br />
<br />

<br />
My stats are the ones in red.<br />
<br />
I find that cable in most areas is faster then DSL service. A couple of Family Members have Americtech DSL and there top download speed is 500kish and there upload is around 150kish.<br />
<br />
However it really depends on your area. If your in an area with a lot of storms I know cable is more then likely to go out then your phone line. The phone co. normaly has more money to keep up there service. Also when there are downed poles the electric co has first dibs for repair, then the phone co, then cable.</div></div><hr />

I think that you should stay with your cable provider because of what you're using it for.  I think that you will be able to perform your webhosting and such much better from a cable based ISP.  The only time I would recommend DSL is if you were playing Counter-Strike and you lived in the middle of nowhere.  Ok, thanks for your time.<br />
