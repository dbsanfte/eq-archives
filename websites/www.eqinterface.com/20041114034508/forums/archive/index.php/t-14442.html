Well, here it is again, updated for the latest patch on July 14.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can't figure out is why the total mana number shows up in green.  I've used the same TextColor values from the total HP number, but this one doesn't want to behave.  I haven't done enough research, and I'm not an XML guru like some of you out there.<br />
<br />
For what its worth,<br />

<br />
If there is some kind of benefit (ex Mana Regen) affecting the mana pool then the max mana will show green.  If some kind of debuff is affecting it, it will show red.  I believe these colors are hard coded and can't be changed.<br />

Because it was way too obvious.... :p <br />
<br />
Someone who's smart enough to mod the xml code for a ui window is very likely predisposed to think everything has complicated answer....<br />
