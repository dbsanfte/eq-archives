But don't know if I'll be attending the Fan Fair events. Last year the only event I went to was sign-in and the dinner, not worth the 89$. :(<br />
<br />
omg, they raised the price to $100 this year! Yeah, I'm definatly not going to register. :eek:</div></div><hr />

From what I read it looks like there is a monorail that you can take for $3 that connects to the Hilton, Ballys, MGM, and some other places.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I saw the construction of it when I was at the LV FanFair last year. Sounds like they finally completed it. I expect I'll be on that monorail a bit. One reason Rahjeir and myself choose Ballies is the Monorail and it's location on the strip. Plus, rooms $200 cheeper than the Hilton.</div></div><hr />

They were the only ones that had rooms left for the 1st when I was setting up my plans.</div></div><hr />
