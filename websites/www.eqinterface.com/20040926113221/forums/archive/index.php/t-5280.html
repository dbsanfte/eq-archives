I'm just very very stupid, I know how to play video games, but I'm just very  very stupid and I can't do XML to try it for myself...</div></div><hr />

there is no way to show pet stats or equipment at all. You can make a button to say /pet report health<br />
which shows percent life and buffs on it, but this is not a UI features but a command.<br />
