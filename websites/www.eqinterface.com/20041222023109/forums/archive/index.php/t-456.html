<br />
http://personalpages.tds.net/~andrie2/hotbuttonwindow.jpg <br />
<br />
As you can see I moved the Destroy button to above the Inventory Slots. The only Problem I am haveing now is that it does not work. It Has the Animation of pushing in, but does not destroy the item. What am I doing wrong? Or is it even Possible to move the Destroy button?<br />
<br />
Also I want to make the Secondary Slot at the bottom right into the Arms slots, but they are labled different in this box than they are in the origanl inventory.<br />
<br />
Any Help is grateful</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanus</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the Heads up. That is kinda what I was figuring since no one had moved it yet. <br />
<br />
As for the Changing the Secondary for the Arms slot do you know how to do that? I am using the Hot Buttons &amp; Inventory from the Main page here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, first you need to locate the EQType of it. Either from a website posted here or from teh EQUI_Invetory.<br />
<br />
Then, locate the secondary melee slot on your Hotkeys. And change it's EQType Number.<br />
<br />
That should be it. INV spaces are the same size as the Equip spaces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanus</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See thats the thing, the Hot buttons &amp; Inventory Bar Numbers are totaly Different than the numbers in the Normal Inventory. If you take a look at them you will see what I mean. In the Normal Inventory the numbers are 1 - 21 for Armor Items. Well in the Hotbox I can't find any of those numbers in the inventory slot. So if you can find it &amp; help me out have at it :).</div></div><hr />
