I noticed we both used a &quot;3d pipe&quot; bar for gauges (though some of yours are longer, heheh).. guess great minds think alike!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarsippius</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I love the icons ninjaa!  Great work - I even host them and offer them as a recommended download to compliment sars 4 on my site.  I used to use the Warcraft icon set, but I shrink my icons to 20x20 and at that resolution they lose clarity and you can't make out what they represent.  Your icons fit perfect and I am far too lazy and busy to even think of designing my own =)<br />
<br />
Great minds should be featured, Kudane!   =D<br />
<br />
After finally finishing Sars 4 (Final) I am taking a small break from computers in general, but starting this weekend I will be adding a ton of alternate layout windows so my users can mix and match and customize even more to their own likings as well as submit ideas for layouts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sthikik</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah Finally a UI I like that leaves most of the screen open... now to see how much more lag I get from it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sthikik</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this I have the entire center of my screen clean, the main box in the upper right corner, the buff/song bars below that, the chat centered bottom, Inventory up and to the Left bottom, Lower right secondary chat...<br />
<br />
Problem... I can't move the dang Pet Window, being a shaman, and loving my Wolf, I love my wolf... but I don't 'love' my wolf, the bar floats off in the middle of no where on the right hand side half way down sticking out... I've tried &quot;clipping &quot; the edge and dragging it, but can't get it to move (the + just don't appear)<br />
<br />
Can I go into the UI.ini file and tell it where to go, and how?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grys</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sars is one nice looking UI.<br />
<br />
The fact that it's totally convenient is icing on the cake.  It sure was worth the wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fafpunch</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I modified sars4 to work with the new patch.<br />
<br />
Please note that this is what fixed it for me, and it may not work for you, and it may make things worse. I doubt it will do this but if it does please do not blame me.<br />
<br />
Just unzip it all to the sars4 folder.<br />
<br />
DOWNLOAD: sars4 - 8/26 patch (http://hyncheq.homestead.com/files/sars4_fixed.zip)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fizboz16</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">is there anyway for me to just use the sars4 group window with the caster bar connected to it i really like the target window but cant get it to work with my ui</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarsippius</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have trouble moving a window - rule of thumb is a 5 pixel border below all graphic windows in which you can position the window.  If you cannot get that window to move, try right-clicking to make sure that window is not locked.  If it is locked, unlock it and try to move it again.<br />
<br />
Feel free to use my group window, but you will need to add a lot of other files as well as modify a lot of XML to make it work.  I suppose I could recode my UI to make it work more with other UI's but that is a ton of extra work and I basicly keep adding on to my UI since the first version.  I doubt I will ever get to recoding my UI, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Patches and alternate downloads will be available through both my webpage at Sars.Has.It and through the Featured UI download page here at EQInterface.com.  If the patch completely breaks my UI, I promise it will be patched immediately.  Else I will get the patches out as time permits.  My mini-vacation ends Monday and I will start getting the alternate layout windows posted right after I get back.  Thanks again for all the comments, and thanks to EQinterface for featuring my work =)</div></div><hr />

The timer bars and XP bard do not show except on the hotkey window *If you've seen Sars UI you know what I mean* The disc/Leadership/AA Timer/XP do not come up. Was wondering if anyone had any input. No matter what I fiddle with it just doesn't want to work.<br />

Thanks for the hard work that I am sure went into this UI skin - it really shows an exceptionally talented person):)</div></div><hr />

Is anyone going to take over fixing it, I read alot of info on how to do it and I am now more lost on how to fix one then I was before I started reading about fixing UI's.</div></div><hr />
