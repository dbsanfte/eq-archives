<br />
FIRST <br />
This is a beta release as such it only has the files that have changed from Vert 2.5a to Solaria v.90<br />
<br />
SECOND<br />
We are not taking request for customization YET!! we want to check lag issues, and look before release..<br />
<br />
THIRD<br />
This beta release is only in ONE color.. Neptune. if you patch it into other colors, please remember that its going to be different<br />
<br />
<br />
Instructions:<br />
<br />
For Vert 2.5a users<br />
Make a Copy of your Vert folder... copy the files in this zip into your new Folder.. load in game as usual<br />
<br />
For NON-Vert 2.5a Users<br />
Download Neptune 2.4a and install<br />
Download Vert 2.5a Universal Patch and install the Neptune patch<br />
Copy the enclosed files into the folder<br />
<br />
Below is a screenshot of two of the most dramatically differerent windows.. note the casting gauge is the purple bar around &quot;spell book&quot; . Also there is a new &quot;gauge&quot; for all XP, HP, Mana bars.. these no longer have bubbles.. but tick marks.. (these are my favorite change)<br />
<br />
Please give feed back on function, lag, and reliability..<br />
<br />
http://www.technosapien.net/images/Shot.jpg<br />
<br />
the group window now has a small seperate bar for pets so that you may see them and target them quickly. the two numbers are player percentage and pet percentage.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Had the wrong animations file, fixed now. -Sokol</div></div><hr />

And i don't really like the casting window, although it's a good idea, and maybe is it becoz i am not skilled with it at the moment :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those are the EXACT same buttons from Vert... and the two blank ones on the right, will say INVITE/FOLLOW or DISBAND/DECLINE <br />
<br />
they are blank in screenshot because Sokol didnt group while testing it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">03-26-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far my only thought is to make the Spell Book text on the spell gem window to be the same size as the spell text size, maybe put a nine next to it and suggest that people bind alt 9 to open the spell book, just so it all matches up. I have this thing about having everything look the same.<br />
<br />
The mouse cursor is ok, I just designed a &quot;vert-ish&quot; looking cursor for my own UI that's basically just a big triangle (whereas you have two smaller overlapping ones). But I think people will get used to it, or go insane.<br />
<br />
Other than that, looking good.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nwinn</div><div class="date">03-26-2003, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks nice so far!<br />
<br />
One thing I never liked about the later vert mods was that extra graphic along the side of the group window and I see that you've done that as well.   But, who knows how it'll end up. ;)<br />
<br />
The other thing about your SS, haven't tried it yet for myself, is that it doesn't look like your spell gems have that background color that tells you what type of spell it is... I really like a little border around the spell icon or perhaps around the spell's name?, not just the dot of color that was on the latest vert gems. :\<br />
<br />
Anyway, looks good! :D</div></div><hr />

First impressions of Solaria-<br />
<br />
Seems to work ok, no lag that I noticed, no unexpected glitches.<br />
<br />
The casting guage needs...something. At times it's just too hard to see if you have successfully started casting a spell. Maybe have a seperate casting globe ala TKing or the casting bar in the chat window border, or a casting bar under the book icon.<br />
<br />
The new guages are nice but I find it even harder than before to make out the red hp bar and found myself relying on the numerical numder instead. Could the bars be made &quot;brighter&quot; so they stand out better against the black background?<br />
<br />
The group window is not the same size as the player window (I stack the player window on top of the group window) but perhaps you haven't modded the player window yet...perhaps.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the new buffs window is great just what I've been trying to do using Remellio's big buff window, but lately I gotten used to the horizontal buff window across the top of the screen...could both types be included as an option?<br />
<br />
All told tho a very nice first version. Keep up the good work:)<br />
Regards,<br />
Feebb<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot to mention- a right justified buff # bar would seem to make more sense than having the bar on the left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nizien</div><div class="date">03-27-2003, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking good so far. I have had no issues with lag and such. I have to agree though with the post feeb made. <br />
group window/player window not lining up<br />
group stats kinda hard to see<br />
great idea on the bast bar, but hard to see.<br />
<br />
I use vert stuff and am really excited to see some more vert stuff come out. Keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">03-27-2003, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we havent done the player window or the target window (these three can stack nicely)<br />
<br />
I agree that the cast bar looks cool, but is hard to see.. we are exploring some options..<br />
<br />
We will look into the spell color border.. it might be able to be made brighter or at least larger..<br />
<br />
I am personal finding some issues with names not having enough room to wrap on the spell bar, even given we made the damn thing longer.. sooo that is being examined.<br />
<br />
One Question what do you think of the new &quot;bar&quot; that we made for your HP bar, Stam, bar Target bar..etc (group bar)... that  was my favorite add on for Solaria...<br />
<br />
and the new animation at character select... little more smooth??</div></div><hr />

I was testing this on my second pc and loaded it and started moving.  MY FPS musta been down to like 1 frame per minute or something.  Loaded default and smooth as anything.<br />
<br />
I love the UI I just wish I could run it.  I've tested a few other UI's (drakah etc) on this pc and didn't have that problem.  Nor do I with Vert 2.4a.</div></div><hr />

make sure you using 2.5a patch...<br />
<br />
we have not released a complete set yet.. our goal was to have solaria out about 2 weeks ago :(<br />
<br />
Also if your going off the numbers by your lag meter, that is not frame rate... its data sent and recieved rate..</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) like previous posts the lining u issue for group player etc<br />
2) In most mods Ive ever used/made I love he ability to tint the background black, the light grey of some of the windows cant be changed in some of the windows . could this be fixed?<br />
3) the character select thing is &quot;pretty&quot; but i cant tell you how close i came to deleting a toon because of the different button layout. does this have to be moded?<br />
4) any way to make the labels/names/numbers larger for larger resolutions? <br />
<br />
Congrats on a great start for the next generation of one of the most popular UI mods around.  :nana:</div></div><hr />

It won't even run if you haven't patched it totally (go me not reading the instructions at first) so its impossible not to be up to date.<br />
<br />
I know you sort have to assume the lowest common demoninator for user knowledge - but I'm NOT that.  I had perfect throughput and ping.  I tried to turn/move and it took forever and the graphics were choppy.  <br />
<br />
I know the difference between lag and fps, it was the UI doing it.  Otherwise, loadskinning to default wouldn't fix it.<br />
<br />
Also, this did not happen over time like some of the UI issues I've heard about (that sounded like leaks somewhere) this is immediate performance degradation the second loading the UI.</div></div><hr />

Answer to 2<br />
We are reducing the lag by making the image one piece, the group window is one graphic loading instead of 20.. *YES* Vert had over 20 graphic images loading in just the group window.. we are trying to reduce this and keep a sharp clean look to see if this was the lag issue some people are reporting.<br />
<br />
Answer to 3<br />
This has not changed from Vert 2.0, we have changed some of the text, and we update the version number.. but we have not moved any of the buttons.. my guess is you need to go into your EQCLIENT.INI file and change UISkin=Default to UISkin=Solaria (or what ever folder is named) this way it loads the character select window at start up.. There are some specific reasons we have this in there, and its all &quot;back-end&quot; stuff ..</div></div><hr />

Skin loads fine, but there is a transparent spot by the minimize buttons on the chat windows, and the bottom border is half transparent.  I will post a SS when I get home.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you have included this but if you have not please  do.As a pure melee who does have a few click items as well as potions I like to see how long till the spell is cast just as much as anyone else.<br />
<br />
The last vert ui the 2.5 that I have included a little pink casting bar that I could place nicely over the absent mana bar in the player window.This is something that pleases me a lot.<br />

Perhaps if you have not done this yet or whatever you could toss around the idea of using the absent man bar on a pure melee player window as a spell casting bar ..That would be pretty nice of you guys =)</div></div><hr />

I am sorry to have wasted your time by asking a question before trying it instead of just trying it.I saw other people make suggestions thought I would make one myself as it is an option that is often over looked in the develepoment of ui's and it is in fact quite important.<br />

I do love the new gauges!  And, now having loaded it up, I see that there is some color around the title of the spell on the gem window, looks great to me!  I can see how the spell casting gauge is a little too subtle as is.  But, it was a neat idea. ;)  Also, my main char being a bard, there really isn't much room for song names that are 3 lines long... not sure how that could be fixed/adjusted and still be compact for other classes that were blessed with short spell names! :|  Too bad you can't make it scroll on hover or something, he he. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bane of my existence is Spell names, most especial from long winded Bards! :) J/K Any way I can clip the names so they fit, but short of making the spell cast window alot longer, Well still have to live with pressing ALT to see the whole name, or hope the first few parts showing let us know what spell it is.<br />

<br />
 I just wanted to throw my 2 cents in on what looks to be a great group/cast window. <br />
<br />
 As a Cleric/Necro/Shammy/Druid I can't emphasize how GREAT it is to have easily targetable group members along with pets, and close to the spell gems. When things get hot-n-heavy I personally work better using my mouse to target rather then the F-Keys. The proximity of this group members to the spell gems saves lives, at least for me, and is something that is of primary importance to my custom UIs. <br />
<br />
The only thing I would change if I knew how would be to have a large &quot;current target&quot; bar under the group bars in what looks to be an empty space. Maybe that IS a target area.. not sure, read the PS.<br />
<br />
 Ok, that's Miss Technical's 2 cents.. thanks. :)<br />
<br />
P.S. - I havn't tried this UI yet, but I saw it and some of the thread posts and had to comment :) Hope this makes sense!!</div></div><hr />

Under the player bar is their pet health bar, so you can target pets easier, and see their life easier. <br />

Chuckle. Actualy the purple was for the original solaria which was 100% custom. and the theme color was purple, hence the reason that is. I'll be changing it in the next version. With the whole purple theme it looked good :)<br />

Thats most likely because we added the group member names from the EQ type, and offset the name that is generated WITH the players health bar. To be honest I forget why I did this, but I know it caused some issues :P I'll look at it for the next version.<br />

Please remember that some of us have the keys set up where group member 1 is F1 and member 5 is F5.  If you set it up would you please make it so we could change it?<br />

A simple yes there is one or no there isn't one won't be or it is being included would have been sufficient.Thanks for making an example of me.  <br />
<br />
I am sorry Surlok, I went out on a limb and assumed that you would realize that your first post was asking for a bunch of customization. WHICH I had clearly stated we were not taking request for when i RE-POSTED that we were not taking request yet..<br />
<br />
BUT since you felt that I made an example of you. then maybe you can tell others when they request modifications, customizations, and tweaks..<br />
<br />
This is a beta release, no request for &quot;tweaks&quot; or &quot;customizing&quot; are being accepted at this time<br />
<br />
That way you will feel more rewarded instead of punished.. for me answering your question with a quote from my original post.<br />
<br />
again, I apollogize for assuming that you would have read the entire first post before posting request.</div></div><hr />

The one thing, I don't know if it is a bug or by design but when you zone or die in the group window box it no longer shows the names of your group members.  <br />
<br />
Sorry if this sounds like a request, just wanted to point it out because I wasn't sure if it was a bug or not.<br />

There where some things I did not like (name of the spells in the spell gem being on the left side bothered me because it pushed the box out to far into my view) but you are not at the stage to deal with customizing so I will leave those for later.<br />

<br />
I would like to see the f2-f6 back in the group window though, as well as the name staying there upon death (for pick up groups it helps alot to talk to those that died or what not) Also, one that that REALLY bugs me is that the group window is not the same width as the old target bar and player window from the vert mod, I am a neat freak with my UI's and I would really love to see it to be the same size so it all lines up again. Also, thank you for putting the Invite and Disband buttons in there where you can see them better in higher reso's.<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all it is a great improvment in the vert mod, and I have had no lag issuse with it what so ever.</div></div><hr />

We are working on the size to fix it back to the same width as the old group window.. also the F2-F6 are going to be added back in... <br />
<br />
We may are also looking at the cast bar, the current one is nice.. but we want to make it a little easier to see.. (we have a couple of options we are testing)<br />
<br />
thank you all for the feed back sorry things have been slow in coming out, both Sokol and I have been up to our ears in RL work.. but things should calm down for me in the next 2 weeks, and Sokol expects a slow down in the next 3 weeks..<br />
