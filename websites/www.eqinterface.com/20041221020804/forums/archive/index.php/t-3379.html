<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelric</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've moved the Patch Message for 10/16/02 and Fixes (http://pub32.ezboard.com/fsolusfrm38.showMessage?topicID=7.topic) related to it to their own thread, as things seem to have stabilized for the most part. As anything new comes to light, it will appear here first.<br />
<br />
Both EQUI.xml and EQUI_Animations.xml were changed in the 10/21 patch; Cormanth and Marcin have posted the changes to the EQUI_Animations.xml file here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3182), and here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3192). Both threads provide the details from updating your file manually. Cormanth has also include the 1-line change to EQUI.xml in his post (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3182).<br />

News - 10/25<br />
<br />
Thomus King (http://pub10.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=74.topic) has made the Black Marble background (used in the new Celtic Inventory) available for download; in addition, the artwork for the Celtic Inventory has been &quot;tweaked&quot; a bit.<br />
<br />
Garryck has released a new program: INI Copier (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=471), a &quot;graphical utility to help you copy the contents of one of your character's INI files to another character's&quot;. This should help folks wanting to use the same UI setup for multiple characters do so, without doing a lot of manual changes.<br />
<br />
Earthscum has created the PacMan Mana Muncher (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=474)... &quot;Yes, now you can watch Pac-Man chomping your mana up!&quot;<br />
The News Ranger will refrain from comment... as he doesn't want his mana eaten...<br />
<br />
Xymarra has released UI v2.1 (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3343), a viewport mod with very nice original artwork.<br />
You can download the UI via attachments in the thread linked above.<br />
<br />
Sokol has uploaded the final Vert 2.2 Animations fix (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=468); this should repair all issues related to the 10/21 patch.</div></div><hr />
