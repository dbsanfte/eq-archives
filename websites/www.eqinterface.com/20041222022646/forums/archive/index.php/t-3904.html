<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found this in my mailbox:<br />
<br />
One day, Pinocchio and his girlfriend were in bed doing what<br />
girls and wooden boys do. As they were cuddling later, Pinocchio<br />
could tell that something was bothering his girlfriend. So, he<br />
asked her, &quot;What's the matter, baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pinocchio's girlfriend gave a big sigh and replied, &quot;You're<br />
probably the best guy I've ever met, but every time we make love<br />
you give me splinters.&quot;<br />
<br />
This remark bothered Pinocchio a great deal, so the next day he<br />
went to seek some advice form his creator, Gepetto. When<br />
Pinocchio arrived, Gepetto could tell something was bothering<br />
Pinocchio, and asked him what was the matter. Pinocchio revealed<br />
his dilemma to Gepetto.<br />
<br />
Gepetto searched up and down for a solution. Eventually, he<br />
suggested that sandpaper might be able to &quot;smooth&quot; out<br />
Pinocchio's relationship with his girlfriend. Pinocchio<br />
graciously thanked Gepetto and went on his way.<br />
<br />
Gepetto had not heard from Pinocchio for a while and therefore<br />
assumed that the sandpaper had solved all of Pinocchio's<br />
problems. A couple weeks later, Gepetto was in town to have some<br />
blades sharpened at the hardware store when he ran into<br />
Pinocchio. When he saw Pinocchio buying all the packs of<br />
sandpaper the store had in stock, Gepetto remarked, &quot;So,<br />
Pinocchio, things must be going pretty damn good with the girls,<br />
eh?&quot; and Pinocchio replied:<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, who needs girls?!?!?!?!?!?!?&quot;</div></div><hr />
