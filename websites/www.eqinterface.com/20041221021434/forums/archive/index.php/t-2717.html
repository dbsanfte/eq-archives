<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ixnaay</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like your UI narwael, and have used it exclusively since i first tried it out. looks clean and druidish, if thats a word. <br />
I do have one request, and its prolly something i could do on my own, but i am clueless about these things-<br />
On the character info part, where it shows your health, etc. It also shows your % xp. It would be real convenient for me if you could also show the AA % in the same spot.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that makes sense,<br />
<br />
If anyone knows how i can do this on my own, please post here. Otherwise, maybe in your next update you can change that.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the great UI narwael<br />

<br />
I know that dear, and i just can say : I try to add some mode those are Nice or helpfull, in that case i prefer this mode cause i don t collect AA points atm ( i m just 56 :(  )<br />
<br />
(hmmm like i try to speak corrctly English  lol )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JGC84</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">alright in my opinion i've about had it w/ all the damn leaves in the &quot;druid&quot; UIs.  so our epic happens to be a leaf blower, and we can turn into trees, and wolves, and have mini bears as pets, but i'm sick of the whole nature theme for our UIs derm it!  i would make my own, but i don't know how to do the skinning and what not.  Personaly i used the wisdom/pet caster mod of Vert 1.0  was great, no crappy tree theme, had my wis/hp/exp/mana/resists easy to read without having to opening inventory, it had my clickies ('cause lord knows druids get a ton of clicks since we have crap for mana regen) right on my hotkeys so i didn't have to open my inventory for that either.  But now varent went and broke my UI, damn them, and i just can't find any others i like, that work. <br />

/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klabs44</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I absolutely love this UI, but I was wondering if there was anyway you could put spell names next to the spell gems like in drakah's UI?  Thanks for such a wonderful UI, keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">narwael</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I m sorry dear but atm i can t work on this UI, the EQUI_Animation.xml file is wrong cause 31/10 patch .<br />
<br />
But if you can updated it for ya , i m sure ya can find the way to change the normal cast spell window by Drakah's one (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=438) .<br />
<br />
GL and Cya soon with a new whole new Mix match UI :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snarling</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I installed your UI, it was cool, but once i zoned it went LD, and kept going LD on the login..<br />
<br />
so i deleted the folder and now EQ works normally again, perhaps my crappy 2 year old comp can't take it. Anyway, are there any less intensive UI's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ixnaay</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked this UI also, but it hasn't been updated for quite a few patchs, and isn't going to work for you without some serious updating on your own. Since I am too lazy to do that myself, I just looked for a more recent UI, and found this one:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=634<br />
<br />
Been using this one for almost a month now and am a big fan, give it a shot :)<br />
<br />
edit. The thing with that one is the pet window is replaced by a timer...which for most druids isn't good...just copy the default pet window file into the installed folder and you will get a normal pet window, or you could search out a cool pet window...but again, the laziness factor :)</div></div><hr />
