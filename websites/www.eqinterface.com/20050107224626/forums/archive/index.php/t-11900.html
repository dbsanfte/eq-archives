<br />
You start as a warrior, work your way to at least level 20, any time after that you pick up your class charm from your guildmaster and turn it in to a new guild.<br />
<br />
You are now a rogue.  You are a level 20 warrior/level 1 rogue.  You now retain the hp, Ac of the warrior, but have only the skills of a level 1 rogue.  When you reach level 20 rogue you gain back all of the skills you built up as a level 20 warrior.  From then on you may progress as far as you wish as a rogue, but you are frozen in time as the level 20 warrior.  All AA skills must be in the 2nd and new profession.  If you choose a 3 profession, it must be chosen at or above the level you switched the first time and you then lose all of the skills of the very first profession.<br />
<br />
Restrict to all non-hybrid classes:<br />
<br />
combos:<br />
<br />
Warrior/cleric<br />
warrior/rogue<br />
warrior/wizard<br />
warrior/mage<br />
warrior/druid<br />
 and so on....<br />
<br />
Well, what do you think? and yes I did steal the idea from rpg D&amp;D.<br />

You can switch jobs any time you want but when you get a job to 18 you can give it a sub-job of your choice. Once you turn 18 on any job you can mix any job as you please regardless of their level. The second job is only half the level of the main so you could make a 4 black mage mixed with a level 2 white mage. <br />
<br />
But you can mix the hybrid jobs as well which i havent heard anyone do but you could be a lvl 30 dark knight with level 15 paladin. I think the sysytem is great but i wont think its perfect until they let you mix monks with rangers to where they can two-fist pistols heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jentraal</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to say this (because it's a Mcrosoft product) but Asheron's Call 2 handles this kind of thing very well.  You can train and untrain skills any time you want.  That is a very cool thing.  You should see my very first character I created on EQ.  He's a druid with ALL the wrong stats. hehe... it's pretty funny, yet sad at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EricLongsten</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might take a look at Rubies of Eventide.  Totally skill based, get points with your xp and spend them where ever you like, classes are just a template that let you train certain skills cheaper than others.  If you wanted to you could have a &quot;sorcerer&quot; wearing heavy plate, wielding a sword and next to no magic, it would just be spendy in terms of points because the sorcerer class has their bonuses in the magic arts and the corisponding penalties are in the martial skills.  I played it for a while a couple months ago, liked the concept but there was just not enough content at the time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Genghiz Cohen</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been having similar thoughts... and thats also why I'm giving Horizons a try... so far it delivers very well with only a few annoyances... <br />
<br />
the problem is, as always, the mighty &quot;balancing&quot; issue... but as an idea I'm all for it... if nothing else because it leaves the customization to the player to a greater extent... <br />
<br />
AA abilities are all fine and dandy, but take 2 level 65 [insert class here] with equal amounts of AA points and you're bound to have 2 very similar characters in terms of skills and whatnot... admittedly, gear might differ and in the high end game gear gets sorta important (since skills and abilities are pretty much static regardless of gear)... but still... multiclassing would allow for example 2 warriors to be good at very different things while still being warriors... one might have, after lots of labour, aquired the Ensnare spell (THE most important spell in the game, if you ask me hehe) while the other has gained the ability to pacify mobs... or whatever... I know, I know.. rangers and pallies... hehe... work with me here...<br />
<br />
it wouldn't surprise me if this sort of thing was implemented in EQ1 eventually... with the dawn of EQ2 they will need some pretty refreshing ideas to keep their customers from stampeding off to EQ2 (assuming it delivers so well that people are content to migrate and stay there)... in the end, new classes and AA's won't cut it, methinks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently playing FFXI. The multiclass option is very useful...its Primary/Subclass(e.g. Lvl a thief up to lvl.30, preform subclass quest, switch to new class(e.g. Dragoon)  and sub thief. This allows you to be a full fledged dragoon with some thief abilities, but the thief abilities are scaled down for your primary lvl.), allowing for a multiple of choices, since you can switch classes at anytime. If EQ did something like this, it would be great.</div></div><hr />
