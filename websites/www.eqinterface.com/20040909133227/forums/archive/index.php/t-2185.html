The deal with Target and Player windows:<br />
<br />
&quot;Important data during combat: <br />
-Target life <br />
-Your life <br />
So this window has both.  I place my windows such that this window is most central.  The red box around the player window is nice feedback to know when you're attacking, so I've used that window as a base for this new target window replacement.  This left no window to use for the normal player window guts, so I placed those guts in the target window.  Thus the player window is now the target window, and what was the target window is now in the player window.  Yes, this is confusing, so just know this: replace both the Player window and Target window with my files, or replace neither. <br />
The end result is when attacking, the target window will have a flashing red border. &quot;<br />
<br />
I personally use these two, and find them invaluable. The placement of health and such information took some getting used to, but it has turned out to be invaluable. Great mod, thats why I posted it.</div></div><hr />
