<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marcin</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is just a ghetto fix so I'm not going to post this to downloads or anything.  That great 14th patch added the annoying feature of pet window automatically popping up when a pet is generated and automatically closing when a pet dies/despawns/gets lost/loses charm.<br />
<br />
Some classes probably find functionality in using a pet window and may not like it.  As a wizard, having that ugly thing pop up in my face every time I zone (familiar) or every time I cast sword of xuzl is annoying to no end.  Originally my pet window was where I had my timers but this new &quot;feature&quot; would always be closing them on me forcing me to reopen them so I switched.<br />
<br />
Basically I'm just uploading my fix to the annoying pet window situation.  All I did was make the pet window invisible via killing the height/width and positioning, and therefore making the window non-existant in a virtual sense and with no functionality.</div></div><hr />

It's something Sony did to the code during the May 14th patch that caused this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah my solution was really for wizards who don't want it to pop up for familiar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many have they dont that have stayed changed?<br />
<br />
I remember when they made it where if any part of your Ui went off the screen it would move it automatically.  That was annoying, as is this.<br />
<br />
Still waiting for the connection gauges to be put into a window.  I like having them on to see, but I have the way they invade my screen.  Would be nice to integrate them into my UI.</div></div><hr />
