<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnosis</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any thoughts of ever modifying this to fit standard resolutions such as 1280x1024 (hint hint) or 1024x768 ?<br />
<br />
Looks pretty sweet, but everything just doesn't quite fit together right at my resolution and my monitor goes into a wierd refresh rate when I move to a non-standard resolution...<br />
<br />
Done a good job...<br />
<br />
Thanks and take care...<br />
<br />
**edit**<br />
I actually modified it to work in my resolution and it looks pretty darned close to what you have. Took a little resizing and some covering up, but I finally got it... Thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drestin</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great. Glad you got it to work. Maybe you could Email me a zip file so I could post it here.... My monitor wont go up to 1280x1024 or thats the resolution I would be using. And I did try it in 1024x768 needless to say the pics were just to damn tall. Think I'll retackle it and make it work. Thats a common resolution.<br />

I've never done it before so...call me newb if you like. I guess I will just have to be patient because some of the cool animated things I have are saved onto the school server instead of at home. Any input would be great! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwynafear</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if there had been any progress on a 1024x768 version of this UI? It looks wonderful and I would love to use it, but my monitor is a flatscreen that will not do any reso higher than that. Please tell me there is a version for that resolution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eaeaden</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the only beef with my flat panel is the 1024x768 requirement.  Guess I should just quit being a cheap ass and buy a 17&quot; one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Langree</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the UI, been looking for a good rogue UI for awhile.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MavicMage</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting that incompatability error when zoning, can't seem to locate the error in the log, and yes the CD player dont work.  Very cool UI for rogues!  simple melee setup, I dont mind the rez, its better then 1280x1024 for me to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byzier</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get that same message. I think it has to do with maybe the price options in bazaar ? or musicplayer.. if it gets updated i will surely download it again. Still the one and only UI i use .. PERIOD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byzier</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was wondering if you had any plans on updateing this in the future, near future I hope. WIth the new patch of Jan 9th I am worried that I wont be able to use the UI that I came to love. Please reply :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thoth93</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed. This is my favorite UI... in fact it is the only UI I have found that I actually like. But there has been no patch for the caster version since PoP...<br />
<br />
Drestin? Any patches coming? Please.</div></div><hr />
