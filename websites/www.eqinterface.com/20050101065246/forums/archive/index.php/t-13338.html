I recently got a nice long name targetting window and since the last patch the casting bar has been altered slightly.<br />
Before the patch it was a nice solid custom block, but after the patch that was shunk to about a 1 pixel thick line. I've played around and checked the forums and i've managed to get some functionality, however what i noticed is that instead of it being the nice custom cast bar, it's now the default bar, streched to fit; Which, as you can imagine, looks pretty **** :p<br />
<br />
I've uploaded my edited file <br />
Here (http://members.optushome.com.au/keithlmc/EQUI_TargetWindow.xml)  and the full original pack i recieved is here (http://members.optushome.com.au/keithlmc/targetwindow.zip) . The only changes i have done is to make the window slightly larger, and to enlarge the casting bar size.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated :) thanks</div></div><hr />
