<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found on EQInterface something I'd been begging for from the moment I loaded up that oversized, in-my-way, new UI - a horizontal spellbar.  Which is Terrific!  The only question I have: is there a way to edit the tooltips so that they are vertical rather than horizonal and running over one another when you hit alt?  <br />
<br />
I have several caster-types, but the important ones for me are my bard and chanter as I don't want to accidently nuke a NPC I'm trying to make friendly.  I hit alt to verify I haven't moved my spells from where I think they're supposed to be.  I know for my chanter it says &quot;you begin casting ___&quot;, but that doesn't work for my bard.  And with the horizontal bar, the only one you can read is the spell in slot 8.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't care if the text was vertical or horizontal(ish), just as long as it didn't overlap.  <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

It's pretty much written in stone that the tooltip will appear horizontally, so you'll just have to be creative in placing those spell gems. :/<br />
