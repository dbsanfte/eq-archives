<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Ebb</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I became very frustrated with editing and having to stop and restart EQ it is very mind numbing.  So I had and Idea...  I have a few comps and one is a laptop this became my test box.<br />
<br />
I loaded EQ on the laptop and fired it up connected to my lan with the EQ directory shared and password protected.  I then mapped the new share to my main machine.  Once I have logged in and previewed my work I camp to the character select screen and leave it there.  Then the tweaking begins to get it just right.  On my primary machine I open the desired files from the mapped drive and I make the tweaks I need, saving the work to the UI sub folder I am working in and log right back in.  Viola the changes are picked right up with time saved and most of my frustrations gone. :cool: :D ;) <br />
<br />
I hope this helps those who have a separate machine to work with.  This might work with that app the runs EQ in a window but I personally will not run it.<br />

**Update**<br />
<br />
While typing this a big &quot;well duh&quot; occured to me, so I tryed it and you can do the same as above and simply reload the skin if your just tweaking the XML files and you just have to zone to load a edited .tga files... saves even more time.</div></div><hr />
