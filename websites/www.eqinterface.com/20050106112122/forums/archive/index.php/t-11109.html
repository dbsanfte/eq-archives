<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brimstone</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The latest patch has introduced the ability for users to changed the viewable font on their UI. This is fantastic as the default Ariel font makes distinguishing between &quot;i&quot; and &quot;l&quot; very difficult on many peoples monitors. My new font of choice, Verdana, eliminates this issue completly and is very pleasing on the eye to as well. My one issue with Verdana is that quantity boxes in the inventory are not quite wide enough, so that for example, a quantity of 20 iron rations in a backpack will be displayed as 2. There are also some minor issues with the width of hot key boxes and the look of the &quot;%&quot; in the mana and health bars. If you changed your font over to Verdana you will see what I am talking about (/font verdana). Remember the default font is Ariel if you don't like Verdana. So to summerise, my request is this:<br />
May we please have a variation on existing UI's where the various boxes are slightly wider to accomodate new fonts.</div></div><hr />
