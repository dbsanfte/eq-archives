<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bitton</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">good story. I have seen it floating through a number of boards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfhugger</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love reading that whenever it gets posted. Especially: <br />
<br />
&quot;Magician gates. <br />
Necromancer gates.&quot;<br />
<br />
For some reason, those 2 lines crack me up, along with:<br />
<br />
&quot;Ranger nukes A Carebear Wizard for an ungodly pathetic amount of damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a guild filled with rangers (and having one), it should make me cringe. Yet I almost howl with that line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always loved this line:<br />
<br />
&quot;Beastlord Pet hits An Orb of Water for a psychotic amount of damage. &quot;<br />
<br />
And now, with the latest patch/bug for beastlords, it's even funnier, as it was off-base, and now moreso :D</div></div><hr />
