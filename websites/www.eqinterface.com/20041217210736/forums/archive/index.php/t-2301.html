<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could post some long, boring story about how I lost the ability to watch cable/satellite (need to get a job /sigh)<br />
<br />
Or how Farscape did the first 3 seasons when I was overseas with the Army, and never saw the show until I came back to the states (and my friends were constantly telling me how good the show was, but I had to kinda warm up to it)<br />
<br />
But in the end, I kinda like that show.  Shocked that Sci-Fi would cancel it like that, as they are frequently the ones to try and fan the flames, to keep a show going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">haijak</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This happens during every Farscape hiatus.  Canalization rumors.<br />
<br />
I always do research into them and as usual I can find nothing official any where confirming this. <br />
<br />
Also Sci-Fi purchased season 5 along with 4 why would they cancel a season they already paid for?<br />
<br />
Third Farscape is the largest profit producing show, The channel has ever had it would be Stupid for anybody to drop it like this. <br />
<br />
Trust me Farscape Is doing fine.<br />
<br />
P.S. <br />
The most recent season four finally isn’t. <br />
Sci-fi called it that because they would be putting it on hiatus until January. <br />
Season 4 is 22 eps just like all the others not 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to watch Farscape all the time, but after a while my RL situation made it impossible, then I just kinda forgot about it, and even though I could start watching again now if I wanted to, I just missed out on too much and have pretty much lost interest, so they are going to cancel it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfhugger</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I lost interest when Crighton became copied. It was a good idea on paper I am sure, but it lost me in the execution.<br />
<br />
Sci-Fi must have gotten requests for more episodes with Talon but since Crighton is the main character he had to be in the episodes too. So they made a duplicate and BAM! now 2 story lines to follow. After 2 or 3 episodes, it got turned off and I came back to see season 4. The acting got worse and the stories even more so.<br />
<br />
Bye Farscape. It was fun while it lasted.<br />
<br />
Next up for the chopping block: TNT's WitchBlade. What the writers were thinking, I have no idea. So many loose ends from the first season that could have been woven in. Almost none of it was resolved, and Sarah suddenly masters the Blade in the season's finale. Bleh...</div></div><hr />
