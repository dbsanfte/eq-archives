<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daellig</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First I want to say that T.King's artwork is absolutely incredable. I have been away from EQ for about 18 months and came back because of him. :-)<br />
<br />
Now for the info about the GUI I am developing. I am a newbie skinner so this is taking longer than I think it should, but I am not a programmer, nor am I a graphic artist.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I have created the gui as it is so far based almost entirely off of hacked peices of T. Kings original inventory screen and celtic cast bar.<br />
<br />
There are a couple things to know about it.<br />
<br />
1. I need to resolve some layering problems (if I even can) that cause the group box to load ontop of all of the other windows, this prevents you from accessing them. (Includes buff bar, chat boxes, hotbutton box, stat box) I would like to a.) change the z-order somehow so they are on top, or b.) use Includes to embed the bulk of their logic into the group window.<br />
<br />
2. Several of the &quot;utility windows&quot; like help, pet, and selector have been hijacked to create the border around the view port.<br />
The top border was originally intened to be a very enhanced frame on the compass, but it appears that there may be some limit as to the size of a border that can be made. (I have a post under the XML\Graphics issues on it with code)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. The friends window is still available for use. However, my intent is to turn it into a timer window.<br />
<br />
4. ALL of these windows are created using backgrounds, I have in no way modified the default borders used by EQ.....at least not yet. ;-)<br />
<br />
5. I am also working on an 80 slot merchant window, 30 slot loot window, bank, backpack, and inspect windows to match.<br />
<br />
6. and finally...I also intend to mod the MP3 Player to fit exactly in the same spot as the stat window, so if you want you can have it up as a replacement for the stat window...though I may try and make one that surrounds the compass like the casting bar does around the target window.<br />
<br />
It is important to note that in order to gain access to your covered windows, you will need to close them and re-open them using keystrokes. This places them ontop of the group window. Unfortuanatly there is no keystroke to open/close the chat windows, so you can only page up using the keyboard.<br />
<br />
This ONLY for 1600x1200, however once I have it done, I will be able to create smaller resolution versions.<br />
<br />
Any and all feedback welcome.<br />

It is very hard to get mods based on that resolution, and I thank you!<br />
<br />
You should but your ui.ini file available in your download file, this way we can use that after you set everything up. This should fix your problem. If not, we have a slew of people in this forum that could probally work it out. In any case make it available for download, so we can fiddle:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daellig</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the compliments!<br />
<br />
I have been sick the last couple of days so I haven't goten as much work done on it as I had hoped.<br />
<br />
In any case, here is whats currently happening:<br />
<br />
1. I have COMPLETELY redone all of the graphics based on t.kings Celtic Inventory. The reason is, I had a brainstorm the other night on how I could do some window positioning that would alleviate most of the issues I have had with the window layering. In order to do so, I have Integrated the Music player directly into the interface as a permanent feature. This freed me up a window that I am then using to &quot;fix&quot; the layer problems. The downside to doing this was that I was going to have to redo all of the graphics, so I decided to do it based on his Celtic graphics.<br />
<br />
The plus side is I have learned alot from the 1st go round with the standard inventory graphics so this is going a LOT faster. I am hoping to have a screenshot available either late tonight, or tomorrow evening. Worst case it will be the weekend, due to work Holiday parties etc.<br />
<br />
A couple points of clarification as well. I have left the action window as well as the friends window intact in both the caster and melee version. I would gladly replace the pet window (which I am using for a border) with the friends window if someone could tell me how to get it to stay loaded when I log off and on from EQ. Every time I log out it goes away, regardless of what I have it set to do in the ini file. That is why I used the pet one in the first place. A seperate workaround will be to fix the border issue that I have with the compass. I haven't yet tried with the new graphics, but in the old version I had to resort to using the help window to be the border and make the compass &quot;connected&quot; to it graphicly. If I can free the help window back up, then I can use it for the border the Pet window currently makes.<br />
<br />
I also wanted to mention, this new version has every graphic file broken down into 256x256 pixel chunks to help those on lower end graphics cards. The old one didn't.<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention that the Music player is now tabbed. One tab contains stat information like you see on the old screen shots, the other tab contains the music player. I can easily add timers (up to 7 fit) to this window as well. If I can move the Music player parts out of thir window, then I could use trhe pet window to contain the music player instead.<br />
<br />

  I'm not a big fan of the celtic looks very much, unless someone does a spectacular job with them as I hope you might.  So, I was wondering if it would be ok to post the file of the screenshot you had provided us that was really incredible.  You know, the first post you made on this topic?  I really like that look, so if it is possible, I would like a .zip folder of that UI.  Looks good though and I will be waiting for your Celtic mod.  I will check out some more graphics when I get home because I don't have the website with me at the moment, and don't really have time to search.  So just let me know what you think about my request and others may like the idea too :D <br />

Can't wait for you to finish and size it down to 1200.  Two suggestions tho, as a meele I'd rather see name of buffs than icons.  You don't have a buff up so can't see what is displayed but it looks like it's set up for icons.  As a necro, a pet window is a must, far more important than mp3 player.  Great work and I hope you feel better soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daellig</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lanys.Neoconker, I fully intend to have both versions available. Celtic and standard. :-) Once I finish one, the other is MUCH easier.<br />
<br />
As for the pet window over the MP3 player, well I agree the pet window is more important, However due to functionality and the need for windows I didn't realy have a choice. I needed to use the player window where I did. The real trick is, as I mentioned above, is:<br />
<br />
A. Fixing the compass to use a large border (works with small ones) so I can free up a window. (see original post for details and link)<br />
<br />
B. Determining if the MP3 Player components can exist inside a tab in the pet window. (Kinda doubt it)<br />
<br />
C. Force the Friends window to always stay up even after log off and on, thus freeing it up to hold the border that the pet window currently uses. (I have no idea why this closes on its own)<br />
<br />
D. Was thinking about this one the other night. There is an alarm window. I do not know how to access it once its been closed and it won't pop back up if I set it to Show in the ini. If I can figure that out, I may be able to hijack it. (Do folks use this, or do they use the timer mods?) (Help making it load appreciated) :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to help or knows of a mod that overcomes any these issues, that I can look at, then please let me know.<br />

<br />
Sorry I missed my weekend goal. I am almost ready to post the Celtic version up. All layering issues have been resolved by creative window placement. :-) (except for the buff window, which saddly HAS to turned off and on to be accessable - Use Alt-B twice in a row to do it).<br />
<br />
However...the Compass frame is still plagueing me. Does anyone know if the compass can happily live in a subscreen or a tab? If it can (and someone has some example code) then I can easily fix it. If not and there is indeed a limit to the size/width/pixel depth etc a frame can have then I will have to abandon the entire upper frame around the viewport. It just looks bad without having the top border and just the 2 sides, with a compass floating up there.<br />
<br />
On the plus side..If I am forced to remove the viewport border totally, then the pet and selector windows will be back and available.  The help window can't be used (doh!), because if you press ESC twice in a row in game...it closes and since the selector window was part of the frame with no buttons, you couldn't get it back. :-(<br />
<br />
I will check here tomorrow to see if anyone has any leads on the Compass Frame issues as listed in the original and linked post.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daellig</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am going to try and explain the problem a little clearer to see if it helps.<br />
<br />
Pictured below you see a Window Screen with a Border.<br />
The Border is broken up into 12 separate pieces.<br />
<br />
In order you have the TopLeft (TL), Top (TT), TopRight (TR), LeftTop (LT), RightTop (RT), Left (LL), Right (RR), LeftBottom (LB), RightBottom (RB), BottomLeft (BL), Bottom (BB), and BottomRight (BR). The interior area is the Screen (SS). This is the Main Window area we see.<br />
<br />
TL  TTTTTT TR<br />
LT SSSSSS RT<br />
LL SSSSSS RR<br />
LB SSSSSS RB<br />
BL BBBBBB BR<br />
<br />
Now in the compass I am using, I am attempting to make all of the left and right pieces of the Border 751 pixels wide, while leaving the screen, top, and bottom portions 98 pixels wide.<br />
<br />
This works for the TL, TR, BL, and BR pieces. However if I make LT, RT, LL, RR, LB, or RB greater than 20 pixels wide the entire compass disappears in game.<br />
<br />
If I set them to 20 or less, the Screen portion of the Compass is positioned to exactly what LL is set to (not LT). This makes sense. But why can’t I increase the side pieces past 20 to 751 like I want? (After all, the corner pieces TL, TR, BL, and BR all work at 751 pixels wide)<br />
<br />
A couple of theories I have are:<br />
<br />
A.	The total memory allocated to a Screen Border is limited.<br />
B.	There is some internal limit to width a side piece of a border can be.<br />
C.	There is a limit to the bit level that a border can have.<br />
<br />
If you look at the compass in Xymarra’s UI, you will see that she is doing exactly what I am attempting. The only difference is that in hers, she is using a 0,0 sized image for LT, RT, LB, and RB. I have tried this and it makes no difference for mine.<br />
<br />
The other thing to keep in mind is that TT, LL, RR, and BB are all stretched to fill the area along side the screen (SS). My goal (due to the graphics used) is to make them large enough that stretching is not necessary.<br />
<br />
In reference to theory A.: If you add up the pixels used in Xymarra’s UI you see that her total pixels used are 21,168. If you limit mine to using 20 pixel wide sides (which is useless for me) it totals to 26,560 pixels. Increasing the sides to 21 blanks the compass out. So maybe there is a memory limitation that a border can not contain more than roughly 26,560 pixels (or whatever that translates to in memory). Or is it the way EQ works with borders with my graphics card. (nVidia GeForce 2 Ultra 128, not the best, but it works fine for everything else). (Excel spreadsheet attached in Zip file with the compass.)<br />
<br />
That is about as good as I can explain the problem.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daellig</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried (once again) to embed the compass in a subframe (tab) and a subscreen. It didn't work.<br />
<br />
I am attaching 3 samples, all from the Celtic GUI.<br />
<br />
The 1st sample is CompassScreen. In it you will see how I embedded the compass as a subscreen. In game, the compass looks perfect, except for the fact that it doesn't move. :(<br />
<br />
The 2nd sample is CompassFrame. In it you will see how I embedded the compass as a tab. In game, the compass looks perfect, except for the fact that it doesn't move...again. :(<br />
<br />
The 3rd sample is called CompassBorder. In it you will see how I used a Border to draw the background art for the Compass. I have deliberatly limited the side border pieces to 20 pixels wide so I can at least see it in game. ALL of the artwork EXCEPT the sides looks perfect (because they are 20 not 751 wide), and the compass actually moves like it is supposed to. :confused: <br />
<br />
So, given these 3 examples and my description of the problem above I hope we can figure something out. I hate to lose the entire viewport border if I don't have to. It just won't look the same.<br />
<br />
Btw, for ease of viewing the samples the background pictures are not chopped into 256x256 size chunks, so your graphics card will need to be able to read larger textures to look at them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daellig</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The compass window is 1600x40 in size, because it is a top border to the viewport. If I just use a background image, the Compass itself ends up in the upper left corner and shows the entire overlay strip which is 180 pixels wide and 24 high. It becomes totally useless in that manner. So the trick is to put the compass into a container that is the correct size and then put the container onto the background image. However the compass does not seem to work if in a container. (like a sub screen or a tab). So I am left with making a HUGE border for it to have the same effect. The border in theory should work great...but it isn't. Hence my frustration.<br />

I know NO XML OR STUFF LIKE THAT WHAT SO EVER!  Plus, I don't get home till around 6 every night, then homework and eat and shower then bed, then do it again the next day.  So, I have NO TIME WHAT SO EVER as well.  I am doing this at school right now because my computer class is boring as hell (I'm already done with everything cuz most of these people here type 20-30 WPM....Sad...)  But who knows?  I may be able to help you a little.  I'll look more onto this when I get home tonight.  Lata!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was thinking that maybe you can just make a slot for the compass and let the user just put it there themself, that way if it's the only thing holding you back, you can release it.  Seems a lot of people want this UI.  Just some food for thought.<br />
<br />
I was also wondering if Verant is in any way willing to help with coding problems like this get resolved or not.  They seem to allow the player mods, so I was not sure if they would also support any coding issues.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daellig</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xymarra posted some information on the compass she made in my compass thread.(:)Thank you!!!:)) Using that info, I have managed to build a &quot;working&quot; version of the compass. The problem is that for it to work, I had to add a HUGE and I mean HUUUUUGE transparent area below the compass which covers most of the viewport. Tonight I am going to see exactly (to the pixel) how small of an area it has to be before the compass breaks again.<br />
<br />
The wider I make the transparent areas on the side borders, the less I need to use for the top border (so the side borders may &quot;look&quot; skinny but really aren't). I am trying to avoid having the viewport useless because you can see through it fine, but can't click on anything you see. (You can't click on anything through a window except for the chat windows).<br />

I currently use your mod for my druid, and I love it.  Now, and hopefully Daelling will get it done very soon, we'll be able to use his mods.  Thank you Xym!  And Daelling, get to work! ;) Yay!!:nana: :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daellig</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Compass totally fixed and working!<br />
<br />
Thank you Xymarra! Your tip not only allowed me to get the compass working, but I have deciphered exactly what the rules are for creating borders in Verants warped XML schema.<br />
<br />
To explain using algebra:<br />
<br />
A windows Height = Tobleft Border Height + BottomLeft Border Height + LeftTop Border Height + LeftBottom Border Height + Left Border Height<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
A windows Height must be greater than or equal to the sum of the Left Border Width plus the Right Border Width. Notice that you DO NOT ADD the width of the Top(Middle) border!<br />
<br />
Knowing these 2 things you can make a border of ANY size IF you use blank space (transparent) beyond your visible border to make sure that the above equations hold true. It also does not matter if you put all or some of the transparent space on only 1 side of the border. For me, I put ALL of it above the compass (1388 pixels high worth!) Having done that, the bottom of the compass becomes the true bottom of the window.<br />
<br />
Yes..I know this is confusing...sorry. ;)<br />
<br />
In any case YAY!<br />
<br />
I am creating the text file for the GUI so I can upload Beta 1 as soon as I finish this. :cool: <br />

Oh, here is a screenshot of whats coming. This is my monk so you can't see the spellbook or spell bar. Both of which are t.kings just modifed by me.</div></div><hr />

  /cheer Xymarra!!  Thank you!  Hope this comes out tonight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trititan</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">now all you need to do is make it slightly smaller like 1280 1024!<br />
that would be a good size right?<br />
i just love your UI just wish my moniter could go to that resolution</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there anyway this will get down to 1024 x 768?  I know everyone with the high end machines can run higher res, but alot of us just cannot play the game at anything above 1024.<br />
<br />
This is such a great looking UI !  And I know how much work has been done here.    I just hope to get a chance to use it.<br />
<br />
Again, VERY NICE</div></div><hr />

As for lower resolutions, they are on my goal list. As I like to say...<br />

I am glad I could help.  I had seen your problem here but hadn't noticed my name mentioned when I posted on your compass problem thread.  I was embarrassed to have posted that demo image when you were already aware of it. ;)</div></div><hr />
