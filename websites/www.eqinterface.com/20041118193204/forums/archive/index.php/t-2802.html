<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mallus</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After spending several hours last night wondering why the new custom gauge I'm trying to make wasn't working right, I finally came here and found the answer. First, I wasn't sizing the tga correctly (dimensions weren't powers of 2), and secondly the editor I'm using (MS Paint... /blush) doesn't support alpha channels.<br />
<br />
So... I'm looking for a shareware/freeware image editor that supports targa and alpha channels.<br />
<br />
Any recommendations?</div></div><hr />

Only problem I seen with it is if you try to close a window of a modified graphic file, it will crash.  Other then that I like it.  It does alot of graphics format and deals with layes, color channels, path masking, and alot of other dodads.</div></div><hr />

Helped me.  (I had it, updated when I reformatted and it was all better.)</div></div><hr />
