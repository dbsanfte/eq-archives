<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eggborn</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a 65 Shadowknight, that yes, sadly has never used anything but default.<br />
<br />
I am so overwhelmed when I try to find something different and just don't know where to begin.<br />
<br />
I would like something that allows me to always have my inventory up and makes my buff slots look smaller, yet includes all other things the default does.  I need to be able to move my options around.<br />
<br />
I don't care about look.  I need to have it look similiar to what I have now, so I dont get confused.<br />
<br />
One thing I do miss from the orginal interface was the live picture of my character.  It had what was going on behind me at all times.  I play in first person 99.9% of the time and used it as a rearview mirror.  Whenever I switch out of first person, I tend to stear my character the opposite way in which I intended.<br />
<br />
Simplicity is the key here, but a rear view mirror would be nice if that is out there.<br />
<br />
Anyone know where to begin?  I dont even know how to down load them let alone find them hehe.  I can find the info on installing though... just WHAT is out there, and WHERE can I find it, in a short amount of time.  A link would be great of one or two that have at least one of the options I listed above.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help you can provide.<br />

complete sets (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/index.php?cid=22&amp;dp=0&amp;sh=full&amp;so=desc&amp;sb=lastupdate)minimalist (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/index.php?cid=66&amp;dp=0&amp;sh=full&amp;so=desc&amp;sb=lastupdate)Yureks Complete UI Set (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3377) this is mine of course  :) <br />
Any of these are a good way to get a complete UI at one time, and no a rear view window is no longer an option that I know of..</div></div><hr />
