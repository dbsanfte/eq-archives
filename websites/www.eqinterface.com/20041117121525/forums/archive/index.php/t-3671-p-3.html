That is a feature, not a bug. ;)<br />
<br />
You can move the containers, but you need to grab them by the upper corners, as shown in pink in this picture (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1779).  They were designed this way so that they would not be prone to accidental movement when you are doing trade skills.<br />
<br />
If you hate the sticky containers, you can replace them with my movable containers (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2360) or with any other container mod.  You can also remove or rename the EQUI_Container.xml from your UI directory to get the default containers.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I tested that.<br />
<br />
seem to be having a small problem<br />
I don't have a custom LFG window, raid window, or options window, so those errors are coming from somewhere else.  If you have previously copied files from the default into your xym directory or if you have installed mods for those windows from other people, that would cause those errors.  I would suggest you create a clean install.<br />
<br />
1) Rename your current UI directory (i.e. xym to xym_backup) so that you will still have it in case you have trouble.<br />
2) Unzip the latest version of my UI (version 3.5) into a new directory with the same name as your old UI directory (i.e. xym).<br />
3) Unzip the patch into that directory.<br />
4) Try to play EQ.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, please let me know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what would be the problem.  Both of those turned up with no errors when I tried it.  In order, try these changes:<br />
<br />
1) Make sure you don't have xml files for those windows or EQUI.xml in your UI directory.<br />
2) Try deleting any window placement information for those windows in your UI_qeldrom_eci.ini file.<br />
3) Try reinstalling the whole UI and patch to a fresh directory and starting up with &quot;/load xym 0&quot; to reset window positions.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the borders on the sides are one pixel wide.  You can't drag them into position, but you can resize them into position.<br />
<br />
I noticed with this last patch that the flashing red box around the target window that indicates you have your melee attack on is no longer there. <br />
Um oops.  Sorry, I am an enchanter, so I didn't even notice. :(  I think I know what I did.  I think the way to fix it would be to remove all references to the attack indicator in the player window.  I was planning on adding a real attack indicator in that pane, but I am stuck at work this weekend, so I haven't had a chance to work on it.</div></div><hr />

I love this interface and have been using it for a while. Is there any way to add a bar underneath the health bars to group mates to keep an eye on their mana?  It would be a nice addition to everyone in my group to be able to see at a glance the mana status of each other.  Thanks again for all you do with this UI.  It is a lot of work but much appreciated.<br />

I keep thinking of freeing up some windows by using fixed place panels, but then you couldn't do things like that. ;)  Thank you for the positive feedback.  It's fun to see people doing different things with my UI elements. :)<br />
<br />
The gemgauges are nice, but i like the swirls gauges better. How would I go about getting those back?<br />
Well, if you have access to a decent paint program, you could do what I am planning to do ... some day when I have time. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I am going to make a copy of the gem gauges image, but replace the gem gauge pieces with the swirly gauge pieces.  This will let people globally replace the gem gauges with the swirly gauges by replacing just that image.<br />
<br />
I upgraded to a newer version of Fractal Painter (went from 4 to 8) and I haven't gotten used to the changes, so doing new artwork is a bit of a trial.  I will get to it some time though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so here i go!<br />
<br />
I love this UI you've made ... nice! (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1367).  <br />
<br />
1. the only thing, i agree with previously said, that i don't like the sit/run icons.  was wondering if you can post a pic of the fix for that, that you provided the download for (just like to see it) ... or, just let me know, does it have pretty border like the rest of the ui, or is it just the plain default look?<br />
<br />
2.  i would prefer the spellbar that has a clear background so i can see through the swirly bars, but i am not sure if/how i can add this into the gui, so it will be that one instead?<br />
<br />
3. i either 1. want stats to say name instead of icon, but 2. prefer not even to have that window.  is it possible to just not have that on there?<br />
<br />
4. also (casue this is all new to me, though going to try to download when i get home monday) do these windows still have the fade option that the default do?<br />
<br />
5. i understand i won't be able to move the windows manually, but rather have to change the size ... you mentioned that when you talk to quest npc's, you resize the windows ... how do you do that?  just drag it larger?<br />
<br />
again **apologies*, this is all new to me, but hopefully my questions aren't too difficult to answer.<br />
<br />
ok, couple more:<br />
<br />
6. do you have a horizontal pretty spell bar?<br />
<br />
7. what, if any, spell gems are included with this UI, or will it remain default?<br />
<br />
8. and if i want to add different spell gems, how do i do that (guess this is just repeating prevous question, about how to mis&amp;match things)?<br />
<br />
ok, truly last question: does this include a pretty tracking window, it pops up, right?  i remember reading that there was a tracking window in the user files.  do u have a tracking window specially for druids ... i.e. without the sort, and things druids cannot use?  and what about a pop-up pet window?<br />
<br />
this really is a beautiful UI :)!!!<br />
<br />
**bah, whys it say im a bat???**</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. the only thing, i agree with previously said, that i don't like the sit/run icons. was wondering if you can post a pic of the fix for that, that you provided the download for (just like to see it) ... or, just let me know, does it have pretty border like the rest of the ui, or is it just the plain default look?<br />
<br />
This is in the Actions window.  You can remove or rename the file for that window: EQUI_ActionsWindow.xml, which will give you the default actions window.  It will inherit the default green and gold look, but won't have the curved background panel like my custom window.<br />
<br />
I don't have an alternative window without those buttons.  You could try to edit the xml to make the main panel match the default one.  I will put that on my to-do list.<br />
<br />
2. i would prefer the spellbar that has a clear background so i can see through the swirly bars, but i am not sure if/how i can add this into the gui, so it will be that one instead?<br />
<br />
Gold spell bar with transparent background (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1545) <br />
<br />
3. i either 1. want stats to say name instead of icon, but 2. prefer not even to have that window. is it possible to just not have that on there?<br />
<br />
Shadowphoenix made such a mod.  Check the first post in this thread for a link.<br />
<br />
That window is the player window.  You can turn it off through the selector window or with the hot key for the player window (which I can't recall at the moment ... perhaps Alt-Y ?).  You can get the default player window or download a new one.  Before trying any mix-and-match mod, make sure the default works.  That will save you some grief later if things fail.<br />
<br />
4. also (casue this is all new to me, though going to try to download when i get home monday) do these windows still have the fade option that the default do?<br />
<br />
If you use the included .ini file, all the fade options will be changed to my settings.  You can reset them globally with the options window or individually by right clicking the windows.  Make sure the context menus are turned on if you want to do that.<br />
<br />
5. i understand i won't be able to move the windows manually, but rather have to change the size ... you mentioned that when you talk to quest npc's, you resize the windows ... how do you do that? just drag it larger?<br />
<br />
The only way to move a resizable window without resizing it is to grab the title bar.  Chat windows in my UI, and a few others, have no title bar.  To move a chat window, you need to resize it into place.  The chat window border is two pixels wide, so it can be a little hard to grab the edges, but it is doable.<br />
<br />
Most windows can be moved by grabbing the gold decorations or borders.  The only window that can't currently be moved with the mouse is the pet window (tick timer).  This has been unmovable since I added pet buffs to it.  I view this as a bug and will try to find a way to fix it.<br />
<br />
6. do you have a horizontal pretty spell bar?<br />
<br />
Sorry, no, and I do not have plans to make one.  Horizontal spell bars seem pretty useless to me, since I can't see the spell names.  It would require all new art, which I don't have time for right now.<br />
<br />
7. what, if any, spell gems are included with this UI, or will it remain default?<br />
8. and if i want to add different spell gems, how do i do that (guess this is just repeating prevous question, about how to mis&amp;match things)?<br />
<br />
Actually, I think the now-obsolete TKing spell gems are still in the download.  I should remove them since there are now new spell icons that are not in those images.  You can remove the spells0*.tga and gemicons0*.tga files to get the default or install any spell gems of your choice.  Such mods are completely &quot;safe&quot; since they don't include any xml changes.  Just unzip the spell gems into your xym directory.<br />
<br />
9. Does this include a pretty tracking window, it pops up, right? i remember reading that there was a tracking window in the user files. do u have a tracking window specially for druids ... i.e. without the sort, and things druids cannot use? and what about a pop-up pet window?<br />
<br />
I think the tracking window is pretty. ;)  It pops up when you track and vanishes when you hit Cancel or the Esc key.  One of my most played characters is a ranger.  Another is a druid.  The window has very large Track and Cancel buttons, to make the mousing easier.  The filters are much smaller than the default window.  It has no title bar, so it needs to be resized into place like the chat windows.  If  you look in my skins, you will find a druid/bard tracking window that does not have the ranger filters, but it doesn't use the pretty gold labels and I haven't checked it in over a year.<br />
<br />
The pet window is currently in use as the tick timer.  If you want a pet window with buttons, you can download the one in my skins or any other pet window you like, or you can delete or rename the EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml file to get the default.  There is also a friends window timer that you can use in place of the pet window timer if you need a tick timer.  The property of popping up or not is governed by a toggle in the options window.<br />
<br />
**bah, whys it say im a bat???**<br />
<br />

<br />
I have a problem with the pet window,<br />
it is higher than a normal pet window, the one you have to download so that you can use the pet buttons.<br />
<br />
Its the best UI i have seen so far, but i wont use it as it is now cus i cant use my pet. The window is to high and i cant make it smaller.<br />
<br />
I dont know if it has anything to do with 1600x1200 patch that i<br />
also installed <br />
<br />
Can you please look at this problem</div></div><hr />

I assume you mean the window is too tall, not too high.  The pet window is hard coded to be resized only horizontally, not vertically.  So, to resize it, you will probably have to edit your .ini file:<br />
<br />
How to resize the pet window vertically<br />
<br />
Open up your UI_character_server.ini file in a text editor (e.g. UI_Xymarra_eci.ini).  You have to do this when you are not logged in as that character.<br />
<br />
Search for the pet info section.  <br />
<br />
In that section, find the Height tag.  There will be one for every resolution you have used with that character (e.g. Height1280x1024)<br />
<br />
Either change the height to your desired window height in pixels or delete the line completely to get the window's default height.<br />
<br />
Save the file.<br />
<br />
Log in as that character and check the new window size.  If you like the layout, you can copy the .ini file for any other characters that need the same layout to save yourself going through these steps again.<br />
<br />
I will also check the included .ini file and change the default height to a reasonable value to prevent this issue in the future.</div></div><hr />

Your XML files are not compatible with current EverQuest files, certain windows may not perform correctly.  Use &quot;/loadskin Default 1&quot; to load the EverQuest default skin.<br />
<br />
Here's what I did when I installed.  Downloaded UI.  Made a new folder into C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest\uifiles ... new folder name was XYM_skin ... and then copied all of the files directly into this new folder.  I used the original download (1280 x 1024), and just adjusted my EQ resolution to match prior to logging in.<br />

Everything was easy, and i have not experienced any problems.  The only thing is now the Magelo Updater will not work.<br />

I don't think magelo updater should have anything to do with the UI, but I don't use it myself, so I am not certain.<br />

You could try loading the default UI for a moment to save your inventory.  If magelo works with the default UI and not with mine, please let me know.  I am not sure what I can do to fix it though, since I don't subscribe to magelo to test it.</div></div><hr />

This is the best UI eva!  I like everything about the melee version and would change nothing!  umm, except, just a very minor thing...  In the left-hand panel where you sub inventory for spells, is there a way to remove the WT text?  I keep that panel at zero visibility faded but that WT keeps staring at me!  WT is in the bottom right-hand corner anyway... =)  Thank you!<br />

Hm, that should work when you click the Skills button in inventory.  I could believe that it is broken though, since I never hit that button.  I will test it when I get home tonight.</div></div><hr />

First off, love the UI.  I use it with all my characters (with appropriate switches to the melee version where necessary)<br />

I've made some changes to suite my tastes but that was just adding some more chat windows.  (I will post a pic later.)<br />

<br />
I wanted to ask you ask about the recent change to the target window in the default.  How it flashes specificaly.  You mentioned that you were working on includeing this function.  <br />
Also the AA page doesnt include GoD AA's for me in the melee version.  The window adjusts width wise.  They just dont come up.<br />

Might changes to address these be still in the works?<br />

<br />
 Fix the height of the pet info window in the ini file to be the same as my pet window with buttons.  People who download another pet info window or who delete mine to use the default will still have to go through the ini file editing process (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=68370#post68370) to fix the height.  I will also add those instructions to my pet window mod.<br />
 Remove the WT labels from the mel&amp;eacute;e inventory window since they are redundant with the corner panel and don't fade.<br />
 Add a flashing icon in the player window for mel&amp;eacute;e mode.  The player window is the lower right corner panel, so it will be a red sword icon between the top two icons in that window.<br />
 Remove the spell icon set from the zip.  It is an incomplete set now and I have not decided what I am going to do about it yet.  The old TKing icons don't have the new spells and the new icons have inconsistencies that annoy me.<br />
<br />
I will try to get the alternative windows done as well:<br />
 Actions window with text labeled buttons instead of the big gold gems with pictures.<br />
 Player window with text labels for stats instead of the images.<br />
 Swirly gauge patch.<br />
<br />
Also the AA page doesnt include GoD AA's for me in the mel&amp;eacute;e version.<br />
The mel&amp;eacute;e version doesn't touch the AA window.  You need to apply the GoD update to both your regular and mel&amp;eacute;e UIs.<br />
<br />
(I know it is neurotic of me to put the accent in mel&amp;eacute;e all the time ... I have a friend who learned the word from old D&amp;D books and pronounces it &quot;meh-LEE&quot;, which drives me up the wall.  The correct pronunciation is &quot;may-LAY&quot;, which the accent tells you. ;))<br />
<br />
Sorry if I have missed this in the replies but I cant seem to bring up my skills in this UI. What do I need to modify to do so? <br />
There are two skills windows.  The one that displays all your skills with current values comes up when you hit the Skills button in your inventory.  That one is called EQUI_SkillsWindow.xml and is modified in my UI.  I looked at it last night and it worked fine.  If it gives you trouble, just delete the file to get the default.<br />
<br />
The other one allows you to select a skill for a hot button.  It comes up when you right click a skill button in your actions window or hot button window.  That file is called EQUI_SkillsSelectWindow.xml and is not modified by me.  If that file appears in your custom UI directory, please delete it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was an error with the skills window, but I fixed it.<br />
<br />
The pet window height should now be reasonable.<br />

There is a red sword icon in the player/stats window to indicate auto-attack now.  For some reason, it seems to flash at an excessively high frequency regardless of what kind of duration information I give it.<br />

I took the spell icons out of my UI download since I am no longer using modified icons.  The set shown in my screenshots is Thomus King's Version G2.5 Gold Filigree spell icons (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2056).  Spell icons are simple images, so you should be able to unzip those into your UI directory, or choose a different set if you like, with no conflicts.  The icon set I was using previously was incomplete since new spell icons were added with GoD.<br />
<br />
Any chance of someone making a standalone of the compass used in Xym UI (with all the ornate gold stuff)<br />
Yes, I intend to do that some day.  Currently that compass shares an image file with some other stuff.  I would like to move it off into its own file so that people can use it standalone.  I will also provide the ivy border option when I do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll be anxiously awaiting a 3.5c 16x12 patch since my LCD monitor won't really display anything else correctly. <br />
I have a good friend in that situation who pokes me whenever I break his setup. ;)  I will try to get that patched tonight.</div></div><hr />

Feel free to use my code or artwork in your own UI.  I would like credit if you use anything unique to my UI. ;)<br />

If you want to make a UI based on TKing artwork, you might find Cairenn's viewport UI a better starting point.  That artwork is much bulkier than mine and she has put a lot of work into making it hang together.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I have figured out the problem.  To allow people to have many yes/no dialogs up at once, they added new categories in the UI_character_server.ini file for popup dialogs.  The first time you brought up a dialog after the change, it was called PopDialog0.  If you bring up more dialogs, they are called PopDialog1, etc..  Each one is given the Width and Height tags of the dialog in the UI you are using at the time.  The next time you get a popup dialog, it uses the size from your ini file instead of the size of the window, despite the fact that the confirmation dialog is not resizable.  This is obviously a bug.<br />
<br />
So, the fix for this is to find the headings [PopDialog*] in your ini file and delete the Width and Height settings in all of them, or just delete those categories completely - it won't hurt anything.  The next time you generate a dialog, it will save the default settings for the UI you are using when you generate it.<br />
<br />
The default UI uses a much larger confirmation box than mine, so if you want to use the default UI sometimes and my UI sometimes, you will need to get a bunch of confirmation dialogs set up with the default box size.  Do this by:<br />
<br />
 First clear out the PopDialog settings from your .ini file.  You can't be logged on as that character while you edit the .ini file or it will just be overwritten by EQ.<br />
 Load the default UI.<br />
 Turn on confirm-on-drop.<br />
 Pick up an item from your inventory.<br />
 Click on the ground a bunch of times.<br />
This should generate a lot of PopDialog settings in your .ini file with the larger window size.<br />
<br />
In game workaround to the confirmation dialog problem:<br />
Before the rez is cast or before you try to loot the no drop item, generate a few confirm boxes as above.  Then the one you want will be created with the default window size for your UI because it will create a new PopDialog section.  You have to get the new box created before your first filler box fades or it will just go back to PopDialog0 settings.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I searched my computer for .ini files and can not find dialog box. Is it named something else or in a specific file folder? HELP!!=) <br />
The file you need is the one that describes how your UI is laid out for your character.  It is in the EverQuest directory, not the UI directory.  The name of the file is UI_character_server.ini.  For example, mine is UI_Xymarra_eci.ini.<br />
<br />
Open that file with a text editor, such as Notepad.  It is a good idea to make a backup of any file before you start editing it.  You must not be logged in as that character when you edit the .ini file, or EQ will overwrite the file and lose your changes.  You will need to edit the file for every character.  I usually get one character's UI set up the way I like it and then copy it to all the others.<br />
<br />
Search for the heading [PopDialog0].  Everything between that line and the next line in square brackets pertains to the first popup dialog.  Remove height and width tags from the lines below that heading, or remove that entire section.  Missing sections will be created automatically the first time you bring up the window.  Then search for further instances of PopDialog and remove or fix them.<br />
<br />
You can also rename and copy the .ini file I provided with the UI download if you like my default layout - check the Readme.txt file for instructions.  I will run through them all now and make sure they don't have PopDialog sections.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ok, I just removed PopDialog sections from the .ini files for all my current UI mods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I then &quot;overwrote&quot; the original with the &quot;lefty&quot; patch...  skin would not load..  I had to delete the file and start over at square one.   I tried to do this 4 times.. and then gave up and went on to totally kill your beautiful new skin....<br />

I read the readme file and proceeded to delete and install the files for the changes I needed......  I wanted the pet window with the buttons and the player stats with text instead of the icons....  I ended up with no stats windows.. just default player window.. and pet window was not in &quot;full size&quot; and could only be re-sized horizonally. Needless to say... I had to start over again.... after doing this for several hours yesterday I finally gave up in defeat...    <br />

<br />
The current default pet window is a horizontal window with no health bar.  It just doesn't have buttons. ; )<br />
<br />
I could add a strip of buttons to the existing pet window.  You would probably need to move it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muscular Beaver</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only get the timer as default pet info. The optional ones in the zip file are the one with gauge, buttons and buffs and the other one is just a gauge without anything. am I doing something wrong?<br />
anyway what I would like to have is just the buttons and buffs because its not possible to chain cast pets with the hot buttons, since they cant be pressed while casting.<br />
If you migh want to look at this: http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=2117<br />
its exactly what I mean minus the pet health bar and plus your nice style :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the default pet window is just a timer and pet buffs.  If you take out the health bar and buttons, all you are left with is the buffs.  I was being silly.<br />
<br />
So, what you want is a single row of buttons and buffs with no health bar.  That would not be too hard to do.  I will put it together when I have time.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, have you tried using that pet bar that you linked?  It will pick up the green background and glass buttons from my UI.</div></div><hr />

It is very easy.  Only four files are modified for the lefty version.  You could perform the conversion on any resolution or the mel&amp;eacute;e mod.<br />
<br />
Open up EQUI_BuffWindow.xml.  Near the end of the file:<br />
<br />
Replace:<br />
	&lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;640&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;480&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
with<br />
	&lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;480&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
<br />
and<br />
	&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Right&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
with<br />
	&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Left&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
Open up EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml.  Near the end of the file:<br />
<br />
Replace:<br />
	&lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;480&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
with<br />
	&lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;640&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;480&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
<br />
and<br />
	&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Left&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
with<br />
	&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Right&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
Open up EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml.  Near the beginning of the file:<br />
<br />
Replace:<br />
	&lt;Animation&gt;Panel_BottomLeft&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
with<br />
	&lt;Animation&gt;Panel_BottomRight&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
<br />
In the HB_ButtonBox screen near the end of the file, <br />
<br />
Replace:<br />
	&lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;25&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
with<br />
	&lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;4&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;25&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
<br />
Near the end of the file,<br />
<br />
Replace:<br />
	&lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;480&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
with<br />
	&lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;640&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;480&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
<br />
Open up EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml.  Near the beginning of the file:<br />
<br />
Replace:<br />
	&lt;Animation&gt;Panel_BottomRight&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
with<br />
	&lt;Animation&gt;Panel_BottomLeft&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
and<br />
	&lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;640&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;480&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
with<br />
	&lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;480&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: The only important changes are the appearance changes.  WDT_Left and WDT_Right are window templates that add the gold curly things to the sides of the hot button and casting bar windows.  Panel_BottomLeft and Panel_BottomRight are background animations that create the green curved panels with gold borders.  The location changes make the windows appear on the correct side of the screen when  you load them with default positions.  The hot button location change centers the buttons within the green part of the panel, because they are a pretty tight fit.</div></div><hr />

What is probably happening is that other windows are hiding the sides.  Try clicking on the chat window to bring it to the top.  Then you should be able to adjust it on all sides.</div></div><hr />

I loaded your new just button pet window, that didn't work so great :(   I can't seem to change it's vertical size, the horizontial is fine, but the vertical size is the same siaze as my inventory window.  What can be done about this, makes this version unuseable at this resolution.  Also just curious is it possible to change the font size in the chat windows, I like font size on all the other window, but in chat it's just a little small.  Thanks in advance for your time helping me get this wonderful UI just the way I want it, been a loyal user of your 1280 by 1024 version for 8 months now, got a new monitor and hoping to get the 1600 by 1200 to work just as well :) * just an update, after reading most of the old posts I found out how to fix the pet window issue. On another note the melee version doesn't size right for 1600 by 1200.  I adjusted the coding to make the border and background the same size as the buff window, but the info isn't centered in the window, leaves a large blank space at the bottom of the window. Can you help?</div></div><hr />

The pet window is hard coded to be resizable only horizontally.  If you want to change the vertical size, you will have to edit your UI_character_server.ini file.  Look for the heading PetInfoWindow.  In that section, either remove the line Height1600x1200=X, which will cause the pet window to reset to its proper height next time you load it, or change the value of X to whatever height you want the window to have.<br />
<br />
Also just curious is it possible to change the font size in the chat windows<br />
You can change the font size in any window by clicking in that window and typing &quot;/chatfontsize 4&quot;.  I think the valid sizes are 1-6.  Mine are all 2 or 3.<br />
<br />
This will only change the size of text that is printed in the window.  If you want to change the size of text that you see as you type it, you will have to edit EQUI_ChatWindow.xml.  Search for Editbox item = &quot;CW_ChatInput&quot;.  In that section change the font from 3 to 4.<br />
<br />
The mel&amp;eacute;e version doesn't size right for 1600 by 1200.<br />
Sorry, I know that.  I don't have time to maintain the mel&amp;eacute;e version for all resolutions.</div></div><hr />

Well, it can only appear in the target window, which is the lower right corner panel in my UI.  It shows up as a flashing red sword at the top of that panel.  If it does not show up for you, please post which resolution you are using and I will try to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mana numbers will be added to the stats panel when I have time ... probably on Monday.<br />
<br />
Tribute should be unaffected, since I have not modified those windows.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what the aug change is for the container.  I didn't see any obvious changes when I tried looking at a container on Test.  You will need to switch to the default UI to use those changes until I can get it fixed.<br />
<br />
With the patch, there is now a buff timer when you mouse over them. Will the pet window (ala tick timer) still remain? Or is it still useful? <br />
<br />
The tick timer will still fill its role for mezzes, CH chains, and decorating the window. ;)<br />
<br />
Shame T.King is no longer working on the spell icons... <br />
<br />
Kuvasie is maintaining all his stuff and even makes new spell icons as necessary.  I just took the files out of my UI download since I decided not to alter them any more.  You can still use TKing icons or any other icon set with this UI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haven't seen your posts in a while, wondering if we need to go to a new UI with the increased spells and buff slots being added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not been playing much lately, so I am afraid the UI has been suffering a lack of attention.  The regular 1280x1024 version should be up to date, but the other resolutions and mods may not be.<br />
<br />
However, if new spell and buff slots are added, you can be sure I will get those in ASAP. :)<br />
<br />
Somehow my beta application for EQ2 got misplaced, so I am not in that, and thus not doing any UI work for it.<br />
<br />
I am also not in the OoW beta, so I won't have a headstart on UI changes for that unless they show up on the test server when I have time to anticipate them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkspell</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I did in spellcastwnd is copied and paste the gem 6 info on the end of that section (one after the 7th) and rename the parts from 6 to 8.<br />
<br />
Then you have to look at the Y interval of all of them and adjust your last one past the 7th y value accordingly. On mine it looks like :<br />
<br />
              &lt;SpellGem item = &quot;CSPW_Spell8&quot;&gt;<br />

Bah.. formatting did not work.. but.. you get the idea<br />
It overlays the scroll.. but I was too lazy to look at that to fix it.</div></div><hr />

I have used XYM UI for a long time now and religiously update each time there is a patch.

<br />
Thanks a lot for the time you put in Xymarra!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Find your castspellwindow file in uifiles. And then:<br />
<br />
Find : <br />
<br />
&lt;SpellGem item = &quot;CSPW_Spell7&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;CSPW_Spell7&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;301&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;&lt;CX&gt;40&lt;/CX&gt;&lt;CY&gt;32&lt;/CY&gt;&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;SpellGemDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
			&lt;Highlight&gt;A_SpellGemHighlight&lt;/Highlight&gt;<br />
			&lt;Background&gt;A_SpellGemBackground&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
			&lt;Holder&gt;A_SpellGemHolder&lt;/Holder&gt;<br />
		&lt;/SpellGemDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
		&lt;SpellIconOffsetX&gt;8&lt;/SpellIconOffsetX&gt;<br />
		&lt;SpellIconOffsetY&gt;4&lt;/SpellIconOffsetY&gt;<br />
	&lt;/SpellGem&gt;<br />
<br />
UNDER that put in THIS:<br />
<br />
&lt;SpellGem item = &quot;CSPW_Spell8&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;CSPW_Spell8&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;14&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;341&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;&lt;CX&gt;40&lt;/CX&gt;&lt;CY&gt;32&lt;/CY&gt;&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;SpellGemDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
			&lt;Highlight&gt;A_SpellGemHighlight&lt;/Highlight&gt;<br />
			&lt;Background&gt;A_SpellGemBackground&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
			&lt;Holder&gt;A_SpellGemHolder&lt;/Holder&gt;<br />
		&lt;/SpellGemDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
		&lt;SpellIconOffsetX&gt;8&lt;/SpellIconOffsetX&gt;<br />
		&lt;SpellIconOffsetY&gt;4&lt;/SpellIconOffsetY&gt;<br />
	&lt;/SpellGem&gt;<br />
<br />
NOW , Find this:<br />
<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;CSPW_Spell7&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
And add this beneath it:<br />
<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;CSPW_Spell8&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
It should work, it does on mine. i use the 1280  x 1024 version. i pasted mine exactly like how it is in MY file, for the 1024 one you need to use this one too. MAKE SURE YOU ADD the &lt;pieces&gt; part it will not work without it. <br />
<br />
Hope i helped, PM me if you have any questions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AA's aren't visible because the UI doesnt have a seperate tab for them ;)<br />
<br />
u can just delete the AA window folder like someone else suggestion.  the Find button though?  Do you mean for the Bazaar?  That Should be there.</div></div><hr />

  Tried the other didn't work was missing the pieces part. Anyone got the code for the buff window so the red text will stop on start up. Looking at the error file it's missing buff 15- 19 child window. Could just add them like the spell gem but would probably need to resize the actual window to add them also. I use 1024x768 so dont have all that much room anyway guess will have to make wider or somehow the buff icons smaller.<br />
<br />
Edit ok got the red text error message to stop using similiar method to spell gem<br />
dont know how it will work if i actually had the buff aa tho probably put the items off the buff window cause i do not have anything to line them up with. Here is the whole code the formating dosnt work but the main parts you add 15-19 in button and  label and pieces.<br />

I commented them out for the moment.  The cast bar is now 80 pixels taller, so it was overlapping the top slots.  I will probably be able to fit four slots back in under the longer casting bar.<br />
<br />
I couldn't add just one gem slot without creating new artwork, so the book button now lives in the tenth gem slot.<br />
<br />
If someone who has purchased the 9th spell slot AA could test the window, I would appreciate it.  All I see now is a hole in the casting bar where a ninth gem would go.  It might take me a while to get those three AA points. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I updated the newest version, the one you posted yesterday and it didn't load up, at first. so i went in and the coding for the inventory under spell gems was missing a &quot; . SO i added that in, and it loaded up, BUT, now it has all these black edges around it. I tried to do the /timeport 0 0 1280 1024 and it didn't fix it. I don't know what else to try, so if you can think of anything that could be happening let me know. <br />
<br />
Also, i wondered, if instead of the secondary slot, you could show me how to have that mini inventory slot as another slot, say shoulders. My secondary does not have a clickable spell on it, however other things do. How do i go bout changing that?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
P.S: That 9th slot on mine, is fine, however the spellbook, beneath it, looks like it is SITTING in a spell gem slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Open EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml<br />
<br />
Search down for &lt;!-- Inventory Slots --&gt;<br />
<br />
All you need to do is change the &lt;EQType&gt;x&lt;/EQType&gt; to whatever slot number you want. I also change the &lt;Background&gt; to A_RecessedBox so there is not the background of a primary on some other item. It also makes them easier to see. The codes are:<br />
<br />
0 - Charm<br />
1 - Left ear<br />
2 - Head<br />
3 - Face<br />
4 - Right ear<br />
5 - Neck<br />
6 - Shoulders<br />
7 - Arms<br />
8 - Back<br />
9 - Left wrist<br />
10 - Right wrist<br />
11 - Range<br />
12 - Hands<br />
13 - Primary<br />
14 - Secondary<br />
15 - Left fingers<br />
16 - Right fingers<br />
17 - Chest<br />

19 - Feet<br />
20 - Waist<br />

I realize there is less room but seems to be more than enough for the primary/secondary and 2-4 inventory slots. this would be a great help especially for clerics. I have to change quite a bit between my clicky and weapon. Also having inventory available for invis or mod rod is esential in OoW and GoD. I hope this is part of the updates you are working on. Other than that it is working fine. Keep up the good work. I have tried others and am just lost without yours. Looking foreward to update.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will return a few inventory slots to the bottom of the cast bar, although I don't think there is room for all of them.<br />
<br />
I will fix the text labeled stats window.<br />
<br />
Went to remove an augment from an old item and place it on a new one, when I opened the birdbath there was no place to place the item or augment, there was only 1 large button that said combine on it. I had to change to the default UI to make the exchange, just curious if this was a bug on me or the UI causing this problem.I am not entirely satisfied with the augment box code.  The problem is that, instead of making a new window for augments, they reused the container code adding a few elements used only for augments.<br />
<br />
The sticky container code is very fussy.  In order to keep the container from accidentally moving, the slots have to be aligned with the stretch templates and an extra panel has to be added to cover the back.  If there is even a one pixel error, it is possible to click on a background pixel accidentally, bringing that panel to the front where it covers the slots and buttons.  If that happens when you have no drop items in a world container, you are stuck and have to petition to get them back out.<br />
<br />
I have tested the new code as thoroughly as I could and I do not think it is possible to get stuck in that fashion.  However, these constraints severely limit my ability to arrange the augment window components.<br />
<br />
If anyone else is having trouble adding or removing augments, PLEASE let me know about it.  A simple solution is to remove or rename the EQUI_Container.xml file and use default containers all around.<br />
<br />
it loaded up, BUT, now it has all these black edges around it. I tried to do the /timeport 0 0 1280 1024 and it didn't fix itThe command is /viewport, not /timeport, and you can use &quot;/viewport reset&quot; to fill the whole window.<br />
<br />
That 9th slot on mine, is fine, however the spellbook, beneath it, looks like it is SITTING in a spell gem slot.Yes, that's what I meant when I said the book button now lives in the tenth gem slot.  The gold curly background stuff has a middle element that brackets two spell gem slots.  I inserted one more copy of that image in the bar, which added slots nine and ten.  Nine is the new spell slot, ten holds the spell book to keep it from looking silly.<br />
<br />
I am considering making a separate old style spell bar window with eight slots and buff window with 15 buff slots for characters (like most of mine) that do not have the AAs.  If this would interest you, please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">10-03-2004, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The lefty, 1600 and 1024 versions are now up to date with OoW.  The melee version didn't need a patch.  The mini UI is up to date, although it is still of limited utility.<br />
<br />
The buff window in the 1024 window was too crowded and unreadable with 20 buffs, so I removed labels in that version.  If that is not satisfactory, I am open to suggestions.<br />
<br />
The spell cast window has some inventory slots in it again.<br />
<br />
In the Options directory, there should be alternative buff and cast windows with the pre-AA button counts for the 1280 version.  The text stat window also works properly for that version and displays numeric mana and endurance.<br />
<br />
The augment window works for me.  I made the Insert button look a bit better.  I tested it with an item and augment that I could afford to lose and was unable to break it, so I think it is safe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Xymarra updated the 1600 version (thanks bunches) and I also find the look of the book sitting in a spell slot a bit annoying. All I did was open EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml and commented out the following line under &lt;StaticAnimation item = &quot;CSPW_BookBackground&quot;&gt;:<br />
<br />
&lt;!--		&lt;Animation&gt;A_SpellGemHolder&lt;/Animation&gt;    --&gt;<br />

Leaves a plain black background and I think it looks just fine :)</div></div><hr />

I refuse to play EQ without Xymmara's UI, but I would really like the pet window back.  Any ETA on that?  Using the pet window option as it is right now still gives a pet window, just the buttons look kind of boofed up.  Thanks for maintaining a superlative UI.</div></div><hr />

It's only one file and that file has not changed lately.  I haven't marked it updated because I haven't tested it, but I would actually expect it to work.<br />
<br />
If it doesn't work, you can always delete the file to get the default or install some other custom pet window over it.<br />
<br />
Edit: I have tested some of the pet windows in the main zip and they seem fine.  Could your problem be that the window is the wrong height?  Try removing the PetInfoWindow section from your ini file to reset the window height.</div></div><hr />

Really functions the best for me out of all the ones I have tried.  One question though.  Where is the selector bar?? or how do you bring it up??<br />
Thanks much for all the work you have done on your UI.</div></div><hr />

In general, if you want to know what key toggles a particular window, you can find it in the options window (Alt-o to bring that up) under the keyboard settings.</div></div><hr />

The arguments for a full 1280x1024 window are &quot;/viewport 0 0 1280 1024&quot;.<br />

If that does not solve your problem, try deleting or renaming your UI_char_server.ini file while you are not logged in.  When you log back in, you should get the default UI and a full screen.  Then you can get back to the custom with /load, using the default locations and sizes.  I am not at home to check, but I think there is no viewport information stored in eqclient.ini.<br />

For tech support thoroughness, in case you still have black borders around your screen after trying the above ... Can you drag UI pieces into the black areas?  Is that the same resolution you use on your desktop?  If not, and if the black areas are completely inaccessible, it could be that you need to mess with horizontal or vertical alignment of your monitor using the buttons normally found on the front of the monitor.<br />

Please respond (here or in a PM) with what solved your problem, or ask again if these ideas don't help.</div></div><hr />
