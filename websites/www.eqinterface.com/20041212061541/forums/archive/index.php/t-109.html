<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NijK</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, when the buffs wear off, it leaves a lable next to where the buff was &quot;Unknown Spell&quot; or something like that. You get 10-15 buffs for a raid, all labled, then afterwards you're walking around with about 5 buffs, you've got &quot;Unknown Spell&quot; 5-10 times down the side of your screen heh (at least it did that when I tried it out)</div></div><hr />

Not sure which buff window your talking about , but if it is mine there is a reason for the no resize.  It will not be as readable should you resize it. <br />
<br />
The problem with it is :<br />
- the text needs a co-ordinate to print at, this is fixed and unmoving (unless you edit the XML)<br />
- the buff icons even though they have default placings are hardcoded to move as you adjust the size and shape of the window.<br />
<br />
This causes a problem for those who move their windows around.  If you have the position and shape of the window set and don't plan on reshaping it, this would be easy to do.<br />
<br />
Currently the buff window I made is wide enough to fit the largest spell name in the spdat.eff file while leaving the buff at a size that is remotely visible.  To shrink it further you could try reducing the size of the icon (even to 0), or shrinking the font to 1 (which might make it unreadable)</div></div><hr />
