<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have added a new mini UI (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2837), designed for two-boxing.  Most of the graphics were borrowed from my main UI, except for the health bars, which are a little knotwork design.  The thin bar that is woven through the health bar is mana.<br />
<br />
I've been putting this thing together for a while.  It was designed before the target con color indicator went in, so that will be added some time soon.  It's somewhat incomplete in other ways, since I haven't been using it as a serious primary UI.<br />
<br />

<br />
I welcome any comments and suggestions.  However, I am not promising to implement them and I am not promising to maintain this UI indefinitely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The patch in the next post fixes this error:<br />
<br />
If you are going to augment an item or do a quest combine, switch to the default UI before you open the container.<br />
<br />
The tiny sticky containers currently have a bug that can cause the background to come to the foreground covering the container slots.  When that happens, simply close and reopen the container.  This should not cause a major problem unless you have placed a no drop item in a world container.  If that does happen to you, don't reload the UI or close the container -- that would destroy the item.  Your only recourse would be to petition for a GM to come take the item out of the container and place it back in your inventory.<br />
<br />
I will try to fix this bug as soon as I can, but it might be a few days.</div></div><hr />
