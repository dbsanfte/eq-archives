I just started playing EQ again after about a year of not playing, so I'm still getting back into the &quot;groove&quot;. Anyways, if you could make some changes to that interface, I would have to say its the nicest looking UI. Here are the changes I would like to request....<br />
<br />
-Make two seperate windows...one for chat and one for combat<br />
-Make resolution specific .ini's for us. (mine is 1280x1024)<br />
<br />
Could you possibly make those changes? Thanks...</div></div><hr />
