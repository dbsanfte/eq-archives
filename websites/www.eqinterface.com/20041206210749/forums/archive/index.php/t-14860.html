Moved your post to the correct forum. :)<br />
<br />
Sorry no idea. I view this webpage with many different versions of IE and mozilla  over a wide variety of OS's and have yet to encounter a problem in not seeing the thumbnails. <br />
<br />
I hope your not running out of disk space from installing interfaces since they are only 100k - 6mb a piece. If you are really running out of disk space that may be the problem.<br />
<br />
Just to trouble shoot you could try and install the latest version of mozilla FireFox (http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) and see if that works for you.<br />
<br />
If you find a solution to your problem please stop back here and post your solution incase some one else ever has this problem.</div></div><hr />
