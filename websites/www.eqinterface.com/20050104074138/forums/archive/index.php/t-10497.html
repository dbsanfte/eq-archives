<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings,<br />
<br />
I would like to ask for someone's help in something I am trying to accomplish.<br />
<br />
<br />
If someone can create a custom Gauge, that is of a size of 1280 x16 would be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
I tried creating a gauge I made but for some reason does not expand the full 1280 when the size has been determined in the &lt;Gauge&gt; area. What I had to do to make it a full 1280, as per the graphic I made, I had to actually stretch it over 2000 to &quot;look&quot; like its 1280.<br />
<br />
The actual graphic used was size 1280 x 64.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to make a long gauge using several &quot;parts&quot; instead of making one huge graphic in that length?<br />
<br />
If someone can code this, and post the zip, I will add the due credit when the WoW interface becomes available. The XML and the graphics will wind up being spliced up and depicted, so dont worry about what Window to use, or a &quot;pretty bar&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks so much :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you mean the size of the Graphic File (tga, bmp) was <br />
1280 x 64<br />
<br />
If that is the case try changing the width of the tga to 2048...  Graphic files need to stay in powers of 2.. 8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096<br />
<br />
I believe most graphic cards nowadays can handle textures up to 4096x4096</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it possible to make a long gauge using several &quot;parts&quot; instead of making one huge graphic in that length?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes..  <br />
<br />
And it could be a better solution over all.. It would work on most older graphics card..  But there would be a little performance hit.. It would be 5 gauges each 256 long..<br />
<br />
It'll take me away from my UI work again but <br />
I'll make a cheesey example and attach it here.. It'll take me a little bit though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got 1/3 way done with new example and decided to look at <br />
at the screen shot (looks really awesome btw).. I'm not really 100% sure what you are trying to accomplish.. I think the first example is the fix to the problem and the second example I had in mind won't do you any good..Unless, you are trying to keep all textures at 256x256 and below..  <br />
<br />
<br />
If you are trying to keep all textures below 256x256 read on..<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't think of a good way to show you generically what I had in mind...(because I don't know how you put it all together).. But it would of been a variation of the color changing gauge technique without the color changes and on a very wide scale..<br />
<br />
If you still want the example or any help let me know.. I'm not gonna hammer at that now..  I think if you emailed me a copy of the Hotbutton window and graphics I could implement it in there quicker then the example and would be a much better demonstration :)<br />
<br />
Just let me know..</div></div><hr />

If you could please send me an email at drakah@shakahr.com so I can discuss exactly what I am trying to accomplish. Thanks again :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want it to be compatible with older video cards or if it doesn't matter...   The example I posted causes evil things on a voodoo3 card..<br />
<br />
I think there may be a way to do this with a minimum amount of gauges/animations and still be compatible with old card..<br />
<br />
Email sent btw..</div></div><hr />
