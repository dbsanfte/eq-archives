<br />
You have all seen plenty of mockups about what R3 might or might not look like but I have finally settled myself down onto a design that I feel captures the original essence while also incorporating more than a few of my (long overdue) design changes.<br />
<br />
The link below will take you to a dynamically updated screenshot which will be updated at each milestone I come up with.<br />
<br />
The image I am uploading here is a 'teaser' which just gives a few of the highlights to the upcoming version.<br />

<br />
Have you ever though about integrating the hp/mana bars into the bottom part of the interface? I know its an AC emulation, but it might look cool. I'm just used to having everything in the same region, if you keep it the same way it'll still rock :D</div></div><hr />

anyone else get depressed that you can't draw things like ACUI?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's an incredible recreation/arrangement.<br />
<br />
As a former player of AC2, as I mentioned before, I truly can appreciate something like this, as I really did like AC2's UI.<br />
<br />
Just have one thing for the record, and I'm not saying it to bash the UI; in fact, I'm impressed you were able to arrange the AC2 UI, with entirely different game mechanics, into an EQ1 usable UI. People, however, like Taleisin, may misunderstand... =P<br />
<br />
The graphics in this UI are from another MMORPG called Asheron's Call 2. The graphics themselves, besides any edits required to make it compatible with EQ1, are not Elez's creation.<br />
<br />
Are you going to make the spellbook look like AC2's skill tree?! =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Togras <br />

<br />
ummm Thats why she calls it ACUI. I dont think any one has a problem understanding that, lol. It still takes a great deal of hard work and custom work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well blah, how many people have heard of AC? One? Maybe two? And besides, I think I mentioned twice now that the amount of work to get the conversion to work as well as it does now is incredible enough to consider her a deity.<br />
<br />
Asheron's Call never was a popular series. =/ It's a shame, the first game was great, although the second one...<br />
<br />
Well anyway... for anyone who doesn't know what the full AC2 interface looks like, and wants an idea of what she's trying to eventually recreate, refer to the posted screenshot. I am quite excited to see how she pulls it off. <br />
<br />
So far, I already consider it a success, and while I don't think AC2's interface is appropriate for EQ1 due to the sheer amount of different windows EQ1 has, to see it have already come this far, it looks to be developing much more than just a graphics hack. When it's done, something tells me that it'll make us all go 'Holy ****' just like Quartz did during the pioneering days of the UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks great with the darker background :)<br />
<br />
One thing that jumps out as a potential problem (repeat from v1) is the hotbutton/window button layout. Haliken has/had a work-around (the &quot;uneven&quot; bar) that works great, though it does change the look slightly and increases the overall width of the bar.<br />
<br />
Anywho, Looking forward to v2. Sorry about your grandfather :( I hope that life stops throwing you curveballs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elezibeth</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Screenshot Updated!<br />
<br />
Now includes the bank window and money place holding images.<br />
<br />
Also, please note everyone, no text has been overlaid onto this image as of yet so you are getting a clean look at the image quality, there will be plenty of text labeling going around before it ever made it out into the wild.</div></div><hr />

I'm looking forward to seeing the spellbook and spell gems and such.  It looks very similar to the AC interface ss that was posted.  I've always like how the main feature doesn't take up too much space, so I can fill the bottom up with lots of chat windows and still plop the selector/hotbuttons on top of the windows.</div></div><hr />

Since i found it its the only Ui I use for my warrior. Beautiful. Simple low key yet gives all the info you need. My ONLY complaint is no xp bar with percentages. Maybe a loose extra xp bar maybe? Something that matches up to the Hp bar? If so GREAT if not ....Im still gonna use it. I really do believe this is the perfect warrior Ui.<br />

Thanks alot.</div></div><hr />

See second post for updated information regarding the new elements pictured in the design mockup.<br />
<br />
Also, an update, Enok is working on putting together a real base ingame sample for me to take a look at using the new graphics, I will post screenshots showing you the true ingame quality difference ASAP!</div></div><hr />

can't wait to try it out, any idea on a Alpha/Beta release?  :D</div></div><hr />

Afraid not yet, Enok said he'll have a base preview for me by Tomorrow (he's been really busy) so it is moving along.<br />
<br />
Bad thing is most of the elements (Anything not yet depicted) haven't been completed yet.  I fully intend to make this a true 'Complete Skin' and try to hit each and every element of the UI. :)<br />
<br />
I noticed the response rate to v2 has seriously dropped off, perhaps I need to start doing mini-screenshots linking to the big one...  :confused:  Either that or maybe people just have found a UI they like better, it is a competitive market out there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still using v1 and happy with it. One problem that I noticed is that the &quot;blue line&quot; that directs you to the dungeon entrance is not centered properly (i.e. it is not in the center of the compass when the dungeon is directly in front of you.) In any case, barring the release of v2 in the very near future, I would recommend that you or Enok patch all the applicable files such that they work properly following the patch Yesterday (and re-patch today) and post the patch. I patched my files, but not everyone is comfortable with editing the xml.<br />

Still waiting on v2 (and available for testing if you need beta testers :) )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guild Hot Button?  Guess that is another one I've missed since I'm not in any form of guild.  (Imagine that. ;))  Guess I haven't gotten the invite I've wanted yet.<br />
<br />
Regarding the XP Bar...<br />
<br />
ACUI was really never designed to have a visible XP Bar so to speak, the percentage indicator (which will be making it's comeback in v2) is a far more accurate way of measuring your experience gain and PTL (Points til Level).  That all being said, I highly doubt there will ever be an 'XP Bar' on the default ACUI Interface but it may be something for a 'Mod' in the future. :)<br />

<br />
The patches I met when I came back were a SERIOUS stab in the face.<br />
<br />
1) FBO not lasting permanently on charmed mobs makes sense, but still sucks.<br />
<br />
2) Not being able tor echarge items by selling them then buying them also &quot;makes sense&quot; but totally destroys some items (Locket of Escape).<br />
<br />
3) Plane of Mischief is now the sh**iest piece of sh** ever. I wanna cry.<br />
<br />
5) MP3 player closes when you hit ESC.<br />
<br />
4) But the WORST change, was my Acrylia Infused Robe, a robe that looked like a plate BP for the past 8 months and was supposed to, is now a freakin' dress. I about broke into tears when at the char select screen I was in a dress. I immediately destroyed it and pulled out my old Knotted Satin Shirt. I will now be hitting Noble Dojorn in PoSky every week from now 'til I get his chestplate.<br />
<br />
The good things were they fixed the LDoN focused water pets and made my eye of zomm white again (instead of the black it and evil eyes have been for like 3 years). Oh and I did an awesome thing with my pet windows pet buffs.<br />
<br />
On to ACUI. I will have something tomorrow afternoon for Elezibeth. You'll probably get screenshots from her tomorrow evening or night.<br />

Just to let you know, Enok didn't get to doing the majority yet (he's a busy guy ya know) but he did manage to work out the code necessary for the new imagery changes and implement the new cursor, I'll be posting a SS of that shortly! :)<br />

Much improvement since that first build I got from him however there is still a TON of work to be done on this one.<br />

Now my question is, do you look this concept layout better than the one shown in the first page of this thread?<br />

This was all born out of the fact I am loosing ideas on how to make ACUI 2.0 better than 1.0 due to the current layout, this will alleviate a few of those issues...<br />

question for people with icons that are similar ..<br />
possible to put NAMES on the spell icons ? and on the buffs ?<br />

I think the icons are too small to put names on unless you put them like this<br />
<br />
R<br />
e<br />
g<br />
r<br />
o<br />
w<br />
t<br />
h<br />
<br />
but that my be a bit of a programming feat...<br />
<br />
It really looks nice, the only thing that I do not like about it is that I like to have everything that I need to look at right next to each other...although this is not the point of this UI, that is what I look for in a UI...as far as that goes, I think making it so that the life bar is on the right of the chat window and the mana on the left side and number informations tucked in there as well would be neat but that is too much of a deviation from the original idea...<br />
<br />
I think you could make a vertical spell gems window and tuck it up against the left side of the screen with your rounded edges on the top and bottom  curving towards the left edge...should be easy to do since you have the grapics allready...<br />
<br />
I like your map window but I actually think it needs to be about 25% bigger...but, I bet this is at max resolution so when I use it on 1024x768 it should be fine for sizing...take care and keep up the good work...looks great!<br />

<br />
Took a trip to Rhode Island for almost a week. Came back to southern California and then it lit on fire. Lots of relatives in San Diego, had to help one evacuate. Luckily their house was ok. Mother's house had a fire about 3 miles away so was concerned about that too. Spent a lot of time driving places and telling people to calm down.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm sick. Didn't take care of myself I guess since I seem to have gotten a cold. All the smoke in the air probably didn't help.<br />
<br />
For UI stuff, getting the awesome new ACUI graphics fitted into the UI. The selector and hotbutton windows are almost done, or rather are basically done. Need to get all the other UI stuff upgraded, most importantly the player window.<br />
<br />
That's it for now. I should have time to work on it late tonight.<br />
<br />
Enok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elezibeth</div><div class="date">11-01-2003, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clear up a few things said already about the 2.1 preview...<br />
<br />
The spell icons you are seeing there are actually the effects you have on you, not the casting bar, that section hasn't been worked out yet but it will be vertical on the left side as is the norm for ACUI. :)  The window is portrayed under the player window right now just for 'cannonness' with the original UI this is designed from. :)  It will be moveable to all areas on the screen as in the current.<br />
<br />
Also, so you all know, all my mock-ups are done in real size (1024x768) so that what you see is what you will actually get when you install the UI on a 1024x768 character. :)<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
To Enok, take your time and get yourself better.  Depending on the continued reactions to 2.1 I might fire it off to you and let you play with it a bit also and do a direct update from the current 2.0 build to a 2.1 build.<br />
<br />
I find myself loving the newer design more and more since it has opened up a slew of new doors for me in my expanding on the original AC2 UI from which this is based. :)</div></div><hr />

Hey there Wolvig,<br />
<br />
The buttons on the Map window are going to be located below the actual Map Circle in that small box (Have a little expanding do do with the image to accommodate.)<br />
<br />
The spell book idea I have is a hint different than the norm and will preview it here in a bit. :)<br />
<br />
That actually isn't a bad idea on the MP3 player, I'll have to look at that idea here when I get my other windows done.  Thanks on that one. :)</div></div><hr />

Running with the the netstat bar open takes the spot you have for the player window (top left corner) and running multiple chat windows I place the hotbutton/window selector bar on top of the chat windows (opposite of the image you have) this is using v1.0 which is similair. Overall I like the new layout on the player window and really like the map window that you presented here.<br />

Id suggest instead of the skull and crossbones next to the hp and mana bar that you put in the same thing as the first and just the percentage numbers of ex and aa exp.<br />
<br />
Obviously in the final one have an option for that bar to be either hp mana or hp end ..or even have all 3 ?<br />
<br />
Now this is me personally so dont listen tooooo much on this. but make the chat windows not see through. i just couldnt find the colors to go with it and make all chat easily viewable. or maybe the option to not make them see through.<br />
<br />
Apart from that i think its just wicked i love it.<br />
<br />
One more request is make sure the hotbutton window works =p<br />
<br />
