&quot;All you have to do is overwrite(replace) UI_Yourplayername_yourservernumber.ini (located in your main everquest directory) with the file UI_Statix_31.ini...&quot;<br />
I can get the skin loaded on my screen, but it's all over the place, this seems to be why, cause I don't know how to do this one step, so I haven't yet, please help</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zoit</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, I'm gonna try stay calm this time, here's what I did, I downloaded the UI... Made a folder named Quartz and unzipped it in that folder which is in my uifiles folder... I went through all of the steps in the FAQ, made sure all the UISkin: True type stuff was all right, including putting Quartz by my character name in my characters UI file... I loaded up EQ, typed /loadskin Quartz true, I get all the boxes, or at least most of them, but they are scattered all over the screen... I did all it said in the read me of the download EXCEPT: Overwrite my UI file with the one that came with cause I don't know how.. If someone would just tell me how to do that one step, overwrite/replace my UI file with the one that came with, I bet it would work... Not sure, but I'm guessing that is it...<br />
If I missed any info at all on what I did or what you need to tell me what to do, tell me, cause I'm about ready to just give up... But I really like this skin :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XeroWing</div><div class="date">03-22-2003, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you look in your EQ directory there should be a file towards the bottom called UI_charname_servernumber, what you want to do either rename it (like what I do is put a exclamatio mark at the end of the file name) and then copy and paste or cut and paste the UI_Statix_31.ini file into the main EQ directory, and rename the file to your chars file, so the renaming looks identical to the file you just moved. So change UI_Statix_31.in to UI_Charname_Servernumber.ini, to whatever your charsname and servernumber maybe.</div></div><hr />

Of course now I'm mad at you so called Admin ppl, I post all the info you ask for, take every single step and you still don't answer me, XeroWing is now my favorite problem solver while you admin ppl are now nothing more than other chatters in the forums:mad:</div></div><hr />

Wow, I'm so very very sorry.  Please forgive us for daring to have a life other than this board and for not answering you immediately.  How dare we?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zoit</div><div class="date">03-22-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No no no, you don't understand, I wouldn't be mad, but... I posted this and all the other information, then about 10 minutes later someone else posts something, they can an answer right away, while I'm still trying to figure it out on my own, I checked if an admin was on or not, Doldy: Online, I spend 4 hours trying to figure it out on my own while the post 10 minutes after me is already answered, then finally, someone answers me, but not an admin.  I got a bit frustrated, maybe I should take that last post back, I mean imagine how you would feel if you spent all night trying to figure out how to get a UI to work, Sorry, I guess.. (Things just pop out when I get frustrated)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">03-22-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I can't speak for Dolby, as I am not he, but do you think that:<br />
<br />
a) perhaps he didn't know the answer to your question, so he just left it alone (for now) in the hopes that someone else would come along who did know and would answer it for you<br />
<br />
b) he just simply missed it completely? I mean, it's not like we don't get a ton of email plus private messages plus all the posts on all the forums, plus dealing with the actual hosting site for the message board, plus dealing with the actual background of keeping the site up and running (code work, adding new things to the site, clean up, etc etc etc) plus managing all the downloads on the front page, plus ...<br />
<br />
c) he was starting to go through the forum and just hadn't gotten to your post yet when something else diverted his attention and he didn't get a chance to get back here<br />
<br />
d) he, like me last night, simply wasn't at the top of his game? <br />
<br />
e)  shall I keep going?<br />
<br />
Speaking only for myself - I saw your post last night.  However, at the time I saw it, I was battling a migraine (losing, badly) and was so out of it between pain, meds and simple exhaustion that I just didn't even know where to begin so said to myself &quot;self, I'm sorry for those folks, but I just can't deal with this right now&quot; and walked away from it (figuratively speaking).  Even in that condition, I still came to this board and *tried* to do what I could, just as I'm back here again today, in no better shape, trying again to help.<br />
<br />
And before you decide to rip into us, also remember this little fact.  Not one of us gets paid to do this.  This isn't our job.  We are all &quot;volunteering&quot;, just like everyone else on this board that tries to help out.  To go beyond that, Kudane and Dolby are paying to have this site hosted out of their own pockets.  This isn't our job.  We do this because we want to.<br />
<br />
I understand being frustrated when something won't work.  Why do you think I'm here to begin with?  I've been where you were last night, as have many many others on this board, whether they have an &quot;admin&quot; type tag under their name or not.  But is it really fair to jump all over us because we didn't answer you right away?<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and make up your mind.  Either you were angry or you weren't:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">03-22-2003, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didnt know the answer. :(<br />
I'm a php / mysql and linux guy. I can only help people if there was an answer already given. Just look at the first line in my sig.<br />
<br />
I put up this forum so others can help others becuase we are not going to know everything. Why you think you have to have an admin or moderator help you is beyond me. There is plenty of smart people on this forum to help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zoit</div><div class="date">03-22-2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I'm not really sure why I was expecting an admin... I think I was just banging my head on my desk to much from trying to fix it myself before I got a responce the next day, heh.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">03-23-2003, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zoit taunts Cairenn.<br />
Cairenn has become ENRAGED!!<br />
Cairenn goes on a RAMPAGE!!<br />
Cairenn begins to cast a spell.<br />
Zoit is washed over by righteous fury.<br />
Zoit looks very sorry.<br />
<br />
Hehe, just a little humor there. ;)<br />
<br />
Frustration gets to us all sometimes, but try not to automatically take it out on administration - which is the first available target usually.  They do their best, and really do an excellent job here. I'm grateful they stepped up and developed this community - its the best resource that exists for UIs and help with them.  :) SoE's answer would be &quot;Use the Default Interface&quot;.<br />
