<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalahawk</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was using TKing's window_pieces04.tga compass mod, I had no problem patching it for LoY charm slot but I can't seem to get Paint Shop Pro 8 to preserve the alpha layer when I try to fix it for the GoD combat abilities button. So I thought I'd be clever and fix it by renaming TKing's window_pieces04.tga to compass.tga, and edit EQUI_Animations.xml to use compass.tga instead of window_pieces04.tga, that way I wouldn't have to worry about patching the compass again for future changes to window_pieces04.tga ... only when I log in to EQ, the compass comes up blank. Any idea why I can't seem to get the compass to use any file other than &quot;window_pieces04.tga&quot;? I looked in EQUI.xml and EQUI_CompassWnd.xml but I didn't see any reference to window_pieces04.tga in them ...</div></div><hr />

I added seperate graphics definions and placed them into the compass xml file, renaming them of course. Unless they change the compass, this should not break.  Wish I could say that about the rest of the UI ;)<br />

This was just a quick edit, I have not tested it in game.  Let me know if you have any problems.<br />

Turns out I had neglected to define the texture for compass. tga in EQUI_Animations.xml. Soon as Remelio suggested that it started working, and now my compass won't break the next time SoE patches something ... :)</div></div><hr />
