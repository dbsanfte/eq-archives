I tried to run Quartz's theme but couldnt move some of the items into place such as the socials window. I usually only have the main chat going but have been known to have 2 chat windows open for raids and such. I like to have all the windows down the bottom where i can see them easily, sort of like a dashboard in a car, as high as maybe 1/4 of the screen and around 80/80 invis. I also like the idea of horizontal spell bar and inv/hotkey ideas and those buff windows that tell you what buff it is you have on, not just an icon.<br />
I tried to understand xml, i went to www.xml.com and just found myself shaking my head after banging it on my monitor for 30 mins and still couldnt fathom it so i decided to come here and see if someone has a complete ui that could be what i have mentioned.<br />
I have come close by swapping and changing individual windows, mixing them till i come close but i cant mold them into how i see them in my head and hoping someone can or has done it already.<br />
