<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilavati</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using Cairenn's new UI http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=971<br />
and it seems to be working fine. However, I like the borders and such from this UI by Kuvasie <br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2112<br />
I have isolated the problem to the Chatwindow file. Cairenn's file doesn't allow for the borders, and Kuvasie's file, if I use it, puts the borders nicely on everything, but leaves ugly white patches in the corners of the screen. Modifying Kuvasie's file, as promised, crashes my UI. Can someone more competant than I tell me how to merge the two so that I get Cairenn's UI with Kuvasie's borders? Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sure, as you found out, just combining them will not work.  I will have to change Cairenn's graphics to make it work.  That is why I was thinking of a skin pack.<br />

It should work.  Good luck.<br />

I'd been working on it, but I had made a mistake with one of the .tgas and that was causing the white patches. If you like, I can post it (with credit of course) later on.</div></div><hr />

After all, we all work together on the rest of the t.king stuff ... <br />
<br />
Remmy has made adjustments to things I've done, I've helped out with stuff he's done, you've started something that one or another of us updated as necessary, etc.<br />
<br />
And when it comes right down to it ... the only thing that is &quot;mine&quot; in that UI is the layout.  The original graphics and coding all came from Tom and Remmy.  We're a team, the whole crew of us. :)<br />
<br />
Or in fewer words ... Yes.  ;)<br />
<br />
*Hugs Kuv*<br />
<br />
And Lilavati, I'd love to see a screen shot as well.</div></div><hr />
