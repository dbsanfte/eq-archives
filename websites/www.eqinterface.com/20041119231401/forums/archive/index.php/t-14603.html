Have you tried searching at download.com?  They might have something that will work for you.  I have also heard people talk about The GIMP.  I haven't tried it but I believe it is an open source graphics program like Photoshop.</div></div><hr />

If you are new to graphics you may want to stick with a free version until you can learn how to make the most of a full cost version.</div></div><hr />
