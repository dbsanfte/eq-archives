<br />
My bet is that the same error has resurfaced with a new windowpieces_&lt;number goes here&gt;.tga -or- the UI you are using was never patched to correct the problem discussed in that thread.<br />

<br />
This endless loop is caused anytime any graphic is not being found, not just the one in that thread.<br />
<br />
Unfortunaly it is not an easy find.  You best bet is to take a copy of the last working version of your UI, and one by one add in the windows that are being changed until you get this error again.</div></div><hr />
