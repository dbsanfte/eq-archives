<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalink</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, Props to Statix Cinderblade for this excellent mod!!<br />
<br />
Ok, after using the Quartz theme for some time now, I thoroughly enjoy it. However the Inventory seemed out of place, and extremely redundant. <br />
<br />
Seeing that most of the Inventory items are already included in the current Quartz layout, I simply put the missing Inventory slots into the &quot;Friends&quot; window and Hot-keyed it much the same way Inventory is Hot-keyed to &quot;I&quot;. I then overlayed it on one of the two Hitzmode windows at the bottom of my screen. This placed these inventory items right next to the rest of the inventory items already included in quartz.  I liked it!<br />
<br />
Now I had a pretty useless inventory window, right? Nope.. I made it into a window that can always stay open Purely for AutoEquiping!! I also included the other buttons that could only be in the Inventory window all nicely laid out over the main chat window in a non obtrusive manner.. <br />
<br />
And here is a Ss of my efforts. Whatcha think?  <br />
<br />

<br />
BTW, this is completely unofficial as I've yet to be able to get ahold of Statix.<br />
<br />
Now, two questions.. <br />
<br />
1. is there any way to keep the autoeauip box from fading?<br />
<br />
2. is there any way to make the ui keep the Inventory open everytime the UI opens up?  <br />
<br />
Hope I can get some answers. :nana:</div></div><hr />

try making the immage of the auto equip area and the background immage the same, so that when the auto equip area fades it will fade to the same thing and should not be noticable, as for the automaticaly opening the invintory i think that is hard coded into everquest also note that the invintory mod would go away when you press escape too many times closing bags or trade windows ect...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have made 2 mods to it, that others may find useful, one is a different spellbook (scroll instead of book) that I submitted to this board. Waiting on it to post.<br />
<br />
I also modified the Inventory window. It has slots for all of the inventory, + class Icon and Auto Equip, money, etc.<br />
<br />
It is slim and fits on the Right side of the screen (is 96 wide x 750 height.)<br />
<br />
As soon as I can get a good pic of It, I will post it here for all to see.<br />

You will need to delete the old quartz directory and make a fresh copy from your default folder as most of the files have been updated in the last few patches.. Then install the newer quartz1.3.  There is no patch out currently so you gota redo it all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using the Quartz mod in 1280x1024 gives barely the minimum chat size windows I can stand.  And thats after changing the chat1 height so the chat box of that window goes off the bottom of the screen to gives me more space.  After all, whats the point of putting a chat box on every chat window. There should be a way to turn them off...</div></div><hr />
