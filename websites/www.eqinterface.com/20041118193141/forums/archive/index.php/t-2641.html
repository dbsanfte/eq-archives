<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmb0702</div><div class="date">10-03-2002, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been having trouble seeing my hands in front of my face since I have installed my new Apollo 3D Thrill SIS 315 card. I posted up on te EQ forums and was told to down load updated drivers and such from SIS. I went to their site and didn't see any mention of new drivers but I downloaded them anyways. Then was told to download some updated mini something or other and that didn't work either. If anyone could help me it would be appreciated. I will supply whatever is needed so that you could take a look at my competer settings.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Install just standard vga driver for video card.<br />
2) Install DiiretX 8.1x drivers again. This will update the system for Video options in DirectX that corispond with the Video card it sees.<br />
3) Now install your latest Sound card and video card drivers and it should update all your settings and straiten out the video problems. I hope hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Worked on my nVidia card when I first installed my new GeForce.<br />
<br />
Also make sure you run options in EQ after reinstalling the drivers, turn on Mipmapping also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) make sure all windows settings for the card are set correctly. Like not disabling Fog tables, not turning off mip mapping, etc.<br />
<br />
2) Depending on system, turn on mip mapping or turn off mip mapping in on already in options before logging into your EQ Account. <br />
<br />
3) Its possible with your card that it just can't render layers and fog tables well together. If this is the case like it is on my Laptop then you may always have issues rendering transparent graphics and layers. its hard to accept, but i have to on my laptop. In fact the laptop renders so strange that spell effects are only visable againt the sky layers and not the ground graphics. this due to transparencies and fog tables.</div></div><hr />
