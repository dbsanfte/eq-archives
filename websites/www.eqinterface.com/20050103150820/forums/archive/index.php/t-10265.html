<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatekei</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today i woke up to find out New Rock Radio 104.1 WMRQ, is off the air.  No more can i turn on the radio and be confident something actually good  will be on, This radio station was the pinnacle of music on the airwaves! It has been replaced by, Power 104.1, todays hit music. &quot;Hit music&quot; as they say it, is Rap and Pop, not only the worst genre of music on the face of this earth, but something everywhere now.  I have been with New Rock Radio 104 since they signed on in 1994 (i was only 8 years old) and i am deeply angered to see this radio station go.  The world is no longer a place where the punk rocker or alternative rocker can go, you now must go &quot;underground&quot; which angers me almost to the point of snapping.  I would like to hope everyone emails the radio stations owner Todd Thomas by visiting radio 104.com and finding his email address.  I will drive to the headquarters next week and protest this attrocity.  Connecticut is now the worst place to be residence if you wish to be isolated from the rap/pop culture.  I beg of everyone, please protest this to the stations owner! I hope that every rapper and pop artist gets shot and the genre just dies completely. Nirvana, Porcupine Tree, Pink Floyd, The Misfits, Fountains of Wayne, Blink 182, Third Eye blind, Staind, Trapt, Hoobastank, all these bands will never be heard in the airwaves of connecticut with regularity.  I say no more shall my neighborhood be slave to Pop/Rap.  I am going home today, cranking the stereo to max and playing Red Hot Chili peppers and Porcupine Tree.  I IMPLORE YOU ALL, CEASE BUYHING RAP RECORDS AND DONT LISTEN TO THE RADIO!</div></div><hr />

And before you know it you'll be listening to it with regularity, until it gets bought out for talk, spanish, or an 'Alternative' station. Good stations are getting harder and harder to find, so thats why I have changed venues and installed an MP3 player in my car so I can download all the great tunes I WANT to listen to, instead of the tripe they force down my throat. Good luck to you and your crusade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this last trip to vegas we discovered a new set of stations (two stations that broadcast the same thing, because you wont get both at same time mostly) <br />
<br />
They called it &quot;Highway Rock&quot; it was 96.9 close to LA and 94.9 close to vegas, and they played DAMN good music! thier tag line &quot;The long ass drive to Vegas just got shorter&quot;<br />
<br />
hehehe<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about your radio sation..<br />
<br />
but in LA they tend to become Tejano stations... sooo at least you don't have to deal with it in a different language.</div></div><hr />

Even tho I'm 40 I realise rock music progresses and I even enjoy some of the tunage you do ...  What ive found out is some of the internet webstreams might be the solution for you. Some are basicaly radio station feeds but others are feeds geared to the music you<br />
like. Maybe they can provide you with the tunage requirements you need.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neori</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Years ago we had one that had nice DJs that played good alternative and alternative rock.  Then some company bought out the station and turned into a rap/hip hop station.  Thankfully most of the DJs from that station moved over to another one, one that plays much of the same as they did from their former one.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it's about the only station around here that does play anything good.  We have a somewhat decent rock/classic rock station, but chances are very high that whenever you turn it on you'll hear Nirvana, AC/DC, or Guns n Roses.. and they play those TO DEATH.<br />
<br />
Watch out in your areas for a company called &quot;Clear Channel' -- they are nationwide, and they try to buy up all the stations they can get their hands on (I think I read somewhere they own about half the stations in the country now).  Once they buy a station, they turn it into a &quot;hits radio&quot; that is just like every other &quot;hits radio&quot; station they already own, where they choose what you will like to listen to.  Turning everything into the same vanilla as everything else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I grew up with the music you describe as &quot;punk&quot;, however where I live we call it &quot;alternative rock&quot;, I've been through 2 stations ditching their entire music selection for a completely different set, and I too found it quite disheartening, the reasons at the time (I believe) had to do with either poor management, and/or it was difficult for them to get sponsors with the type of music they played, maybe they conducted a survey on the internet or something at the time I don't really know, but bottom line is that it's all business -- and they need money to operate, people don't usually find out about such things until it's too late, the sad reality is that people are widely complacent in regards to music radio these days with MP3 players able to hold 2+ hours of someones favorite songs, heck you can even get a cartridge for a GBA that holds 30 minutes of music, I remember back in the 80's (cringe) and 90's where people were really into radio events, gone are those days -- where I live anyway.</div></div><hr />

The only radio event around here is held at county fairs, car dealerships and the occassional grocery store function. Weeeee what fun. Let's just say that nothing big happens at those function. Radio is slowly becoming that background noise that Queen was talking about in &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I live/grew up in Slough in the United Kingdom and long gone are the days when you could turn on the radio to the sound of Guns and roses Sweet child of mine. Now just about every radio station around here turns out pop/dance music non stop. <br />
I think it is safe to say that we are just getting old and modern music is just not our taste <br />

Those two are the only rock stations around here.  The rest are rap/pop, oldy, bad rock, or jazz/light stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Live in flint michigan myself. I listen to 2 different stations, one plays classic rock, nothing younger then the stuff in the 90's and a hard rock station that plays stuff all the way up to metal. This basically lets me listen to any rock I want which seems fortunate. Problem is their popular enough to exist but the reception can get very bad and either have to turn off the radio or resort to the &quot;pop&quot; station which is basically TRL+Crap, or crap+crap if you dont know what TRL is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny yet sad story...<br />
<br />
I'm just north of Washington DC, and back in the early nineties the radio station to listen to was 105.1 WAVA... they played all the right music, and had the best morning show (Don and Mike in the morning, who I believe are now on an AM station). In the mid nineties they were bought out... were changing over to a &quot;top 40&quot; station, which in this case meant Kenny G and music like that (how in the world that equates to &quot;top 40&quot; I don't know). <br />
The funny part of the story is that on the day they made the change-over, for 24 hours straight the station played John Denver's Thank God I'm a Country Boy. No commercials, no talking... just the song. Back to back to back... for 24 hours. It was like the old management's last revenge before they had to pack up and leave.<br />
I miss that station. I have been able to find things I like and appreciate in almost ALL genres of music... but a lot of radio stations now a'days seem to be extremely good at finding the music in every genre with absolutely no merit and playing that all the time. =(<br />
We still have three good stations... and I hope they never go away. <br />
97.9 (98 rock)<br />
99.1 (HFS)<br />
101.1 (DC 101)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only two stations around here that still hold on the old addage that 'Classic is better' is...<br />
<br />
The Loop 97.9<br />
WIIL Rock 95 (and even they are slowly dying... absorbing into the mediocrity of late 90's and 2K music scene - feh!)</div></div><hr />
