It is the first stop from freeport.  Kill the non named sisters of erollis till 20 or so then take the dwarfs till 24 then finish to 34 with the ststers near the dock.  I was pulling 30pp in plat and 40pp in belts which I sold to the vendor in less than an hour.  EXP is also awsome, just remember not to pull stupid, because there is no where to run.  The water line near most spawns is a safe spot to rest.  Doing this will kill faction with faydwers chapions and most of the woodelf/high elf factions, but it will increase faction with crushbone orcs which makes it easier to increase indigo brotherhood faction.<br />

I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

The best way to raise dark elf faction is to do the red wine quest in neriak 3rd gate.  All you have to do it go in there invised with several bags of red wine and give them to a guy in the library in the room to the right as you walk in.  That is how I got my Iksar necro non KOS in neriak..just fyi this does not change darkelf cleric faction, so you will still be KOS.  As of right now I have not figured out a way to fix this.</div></div><hr />
