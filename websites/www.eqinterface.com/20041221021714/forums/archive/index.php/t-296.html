<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gathe</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here is my issue.  I play on FV....where roleplay is preferred.  My beastlord has hotbuttons set up for <br />
Attack<br />
:::: Dawg %t has angered your master..... git em::::<br />
::::/pet attack::::<br />
Follow<br />
:::: Dawg to your master NOW!!!::::<br />
::::/pet follow::::<br />
<br />
so forth and so on.... The people I group with get a kick outta it.<br />
I love the new UI.  But have noticed that I can't edit the command buttons on there.  How would I (someone who knows nothing about coding) be able to edit said buttons to reflect the way that I play?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're referring to the command buttons on the pet interface window, you can't edit them.. but why would you want to use those things??  Trust me.  Close the pet window, and NEVER bring it up again!!!<br />
<br />
OK.. I'm calm now.<br />
<br />
Since mods to the player info window that have your pet's health bar appear right below yours are readily available, there is no need at all for your pet info window.<br />
<br />
However, you can define social hotkeys to get your pet to attack... much as you've already done.  Just have the appropriate slash command for the pet and whatever message you want to be shouted out to those around you appear in the same social hotkey.<br />
<br />
BTW, have I mentioned how useless the Pet info window in the new UI is??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kencecil</div><div class="date">09-10-2002, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have actually found the pet window to be very useful.  It only takes up a small space and seeing I am a 58 necro and I kite lvl 55 mobs, it is very helpful (all the buttons except for the /pet go away button).  I use this window when I aggro a lvl 55 mob and I just want my pet to tag behind him and beat him up while I keep the aggro (extra dot).  With the pet taunting, I take the chance of losing my pet due to him ticking off the mob.  When I go out to pull and if my pet is low on HP, I am also able to hit the pet sit, pet guard here button.  If someone decides to train in my area, I readily have the pet follow button accessible, so I don't collect the aggro and lose my pet due to someone's ignorance of not looking around for others.  So IMO, the idea of having all the hot buttons in one area is a good idea.. I don't have to constantly rely on changing hot button pages.</div></div><hr />
