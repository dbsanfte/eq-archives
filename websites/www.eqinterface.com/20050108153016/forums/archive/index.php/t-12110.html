<br />
Tired of all the clicking and dragging needed just to make a type 1 wood arrow? We know that the current tradeskill interface is cumbersome, so the UI guys have come up with some new ideas.<br />
<br />
Opening a tradeskill container will now open a new user interface. In the window you will find an area that has all recipes that are currently available to you. This includes recipes that are at your skill level as well as some above it. Clicking on a recipe will display what items are necessary for its completion. Clicking the &quot;combine&quot; button will extract those required items from the player's inventory, and perform the recipe combine, placing the results on the player's cursor. The new system is nice and neat, with no dragging and dropping unless you want to try a combine that is way out of your league, which uses the old style of combination.<br />
These are just a few of the things slated to come out of the EQ Live laboratory. Watch for other exciting announcements in the weeks ahead.<br />
<br />
So I have been thinking about this since they announced it.  They say that the &quot;UI guys&quot; have been working on it.  This makes me think that there is going to be a whole world of new windows ripe and ready for the modding.<br />
<br />
Either way I'm looking forward to seeing it.<br />

The new &quot;interface&quot; is on the test server now.  Not nearly as impressive as I thought, only one window, But still really cool.<br />
<br />
Calling All Tradesmen, err Tradespeople..Trade Skillers?<br />
<br />
Log onto the Test server and try the new tradeskill UI.  You will need to log in using the testeverquest.exe file which you can find in your EverQuest directory.  Make sure you send in your thoughts on the new UI using the /feedback command in-game.<br />
