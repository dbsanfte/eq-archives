<br />
I recently downloaded Aya's UI 650R3. When I tried to manually /load AYA 1 in game it crashes to desktop. So I manually edited the eqclient file to force it to load that UI. After character selection I crash to desktop with a message saying there is an error in the GUI XML files.<br />
<br />
The uierrors.txt message is...<br />
<br />
&quot;[Line:9322 Source:UIFiles\AYA\EQUI_Animations.xml] End tag doesn't equal start tag &lt;CX&gt; &lt;/&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
Then it continues with a couple of lines about attempting to load default skin.<br />
<br />
Also after trying several times, and checking the UI errors text every time, the basic message is the same (always involving Animations and end tag not equalliing start tag) but the line number and &lt;CY&gt; vs. &lt;CX&gt; will change. I loaded up Dreamweaver and checked the line numbers and the start and end tags were the same. I do basic html, not anything advanced or any xml, so that was about the extent of my troubleshooting knowledge. There didn't seem to be any coding errors or anything at a glance.<br />
<br />
I didn't think to make a note of all the lines listed (silly me) but the two that I did notice were 9322 and 8658. 9322 listed &lt;CX&gt;, and 8658 listed &lt;CY&gt;.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.<br />
