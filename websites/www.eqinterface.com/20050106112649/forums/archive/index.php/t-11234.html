Go to Innothule spamp and target one of the little shroom guys.  You see hardly any ring at all.<br />
I was going to make a ring that was smaller than the default, but then realised that it may not show on smaller mobs.<br />
<br />
If I remember I'll try to take and post some screenshots of the same ring around a dragon and a rat.</div></div><hr />

Spiders are a good example of this, short but wide, they've got a small melee range and a small indicator ring. :\</div></div><hr />

<br />
with all the spiders we had coming at us (we didn't have Uber DPS, just a really Bad assed Paladin... Gimme a pally tank ANYDAY since I had to heal him) it was hard to know if I had the right one targetted to debuff or if my debuffs we being eatten by the same mob 2x or more asnd btw I got the Back piece for casters from the raid... was a late night otherwise I'd have better description of it... and someone else got a Hammer (had a nice proc on it)</div></div><hr />

So the larger the melee range the target has the bigger the ring is goin to be... I'll have to test it out to be certain, but that is what I thought.</div></div><hr />
