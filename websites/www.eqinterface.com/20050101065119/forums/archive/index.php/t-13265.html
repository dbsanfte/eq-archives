<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cromyr</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are all the files in the UIFiles\Andrin\ folder or in a sub folder eg. UIFiles\Andrin\custom?<br />
<br />
If the files are in a subfolder, you need to move the to the UIFiles\Andrin\ folder and remove the subfolder.<br />
<br />
Let me know if this helps</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The contents of your uierrors.txt tell me that Everquest cant find your custom interface files.<br />
<br />
This could be only due to 4 reasons.<br />
<br />
1. You didn't follow the directions in either the readme.txt that came with the mod or the directions found at http://faq.eqinterface.com.<br />
<br />
It sounds like your installing it correctly so you can ignore this. Only put the above incase others search on the same problem.<br />
<br />
2. The files are inside a folder inside another folder in your custom ui folder explained by cromyr above. <br />
<br />
Again it sounds like your checked this and the files are in the correct spot.<br />
<br />
3. You have a space in the custom folder name.<br />
<br />
Doesn't look to be the case here.<br />
<br />
4. You have 2 or more Everquest directories because of a poorly written expansion install program. To make sure you are putting the ui files in your &quot;active&quot; everquest folder you need to right click on your Everquest Icon and select properties. The Target: field will tell you where your active everquest directory is located.<br />
<br />
This sounds like the culprit. You can confirm this if you type /load and when the window pops up it doesnt show your new custom folder and only the default folder.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. :)</div></div><hr />

According to your log, you are trying to load a UI from a directory named &quot;Andrin&quot;.  If the directory is actually named &quot;CustomEQ&quot;, you should try loading from that directory instead.  The directory name should look something like:<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\EverQuest\uifiles\CustomEQ<br />
<br />
and all your UI files should be in that directory, not a subdirectory of it.<br />
<br />
In game, type &quot;/load CustomEQ&quot; to get that UI.</div></div><hr />
