<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobynnMerrilin</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NOTE: This mod is no longer going to be updated.  If it finally does break, hopefully someone will let me know.  Files are still available at my website.  I've taken the screenshots down, though, but you can still see them here, in the download area, or in the zip files on my site.<br />
<br />
Last update: 02/10/2004<br />
<br />
More detailed information and download links available at my UI site (http://members.cox.net/katy-w/ui.html).<br />
Download from here by clicking the link to my downloads on the left under my name.<br />
<br />
A brief description:<br />
This is a no frills, xml only mod, fully compatible with any graphics only mod.  Does not use EQUI.xml or EQUI_Animations.xml at all!  <br />
<br />
Runs fine in most resolutions.  I haven't tested with extremely low ones.<br />
<br />
A number of windows have had their title bars disabled.  Hotkey bank includes all bag inventory slots plus the main and secondary hand slots by default, but a no inventory option is included as well.  Two tracking options are included, ranger options or non-ranger options.  Uses a classic style inventory.  And finally, there are 12 different player windows to choose from.   <br />
<br />
Several of the custom windows are also standalone mods in the downloads section.  Click the link to my downloads on the left under my name to see which ones are available.<br />
<br />
In addition, I've revived the old Vert 1.1 graphics and made it default animations compatible.  The package, and update information on it, is available both here and at my website.<br />
<br />
FAQ:  Can you use this with TKing spellbooks?  Yes, install this mod first, then install a TKing spellbook.  You may need to use a modified Animations file. <br />
<br />
Please don't hesitate to contact me if there is a problem with the mod or if you have a request for something specific to do with my mod.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobynnMerrilin</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I updated the default target window to use the new con-colored background thing.  The old one (without the background) is now an optional file.<br />
<br />
The included ini file has been fixed, so the loot window dimensions are correct and the ui directory is correct (heh, oops).<br />
<br />
I'm also going to upload the default graphics with vert bars that I have at my website finally.<br />
<br />
All available when the downloads are approved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I created some usable with the default xml files using the template buttons in the file you have on your site.<br />
<br />
Someone might find them useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobynnMerrilin</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is definately useful.  I wasn't making new graphics for it, just making sure that the ones that existed still worked.</div></div><hr />

(EDIT: holy crap is my sig out of date)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't make any promises about the numbering, as I wasn't working on that.  The current graphics file has what he gave me in it. <br />
<br />
Also, see my note on the top post ... I don't play EQ anymore, so I'm not updating.  I'll leave the zips up on my site, though.  As far as I know, it still works ok with the current stuff, just without some of the new information that can be displayed.  If it ever breaks, someone please email me so I can take it down. =)<br />
