I just finished fixing all my files and they work now. took me about an hour or so though, but that was my first attempt and second one should go faster.<br />
<br />
not sure if my email is shown so here it is<br />
walen@guardiansofforever.com<br />

if you wish to make the changes yourself you will have to understand what changes Verant made first. and that is posted somewhere here in the message boards.</div></div><hr />

An easy fix to those mods using window_pieces04, delete it.<br />
All those mods using pieces04 are in pieces03, therefore its basically a copy of 03. I opened em up and took a look at several I have using window_pieces and found this to be true. After I deleted the 04 file I had it working out just as it should. <br />
<br />
Hope that hepls a little.</div></div><hr />
