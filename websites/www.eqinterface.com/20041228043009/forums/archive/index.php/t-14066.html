<br />
SOE has posted a compiled list of all the changed in today's patch that came from the summit HERE (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=62501). Below is a snippet from the post:<br />
From EQLive<br />
At the first-ever EQ Guild Summit, EQ devs listened to an exchange of ideas from guild members and game press reps. The suggestions implemented in the recent patch are included in the following report: <br />
<br />
&quot;On June 5, SOE hosted almost 70 players from around the United States in our first-ever Guild Summit. This meeting allowed for a frank exchange of EverQuest views and ideas between the EverQuest Live team and leaders of some of the game's more prominent guilds. The various guild representatives came well-prepared (notes and notebooks, even CDs) with suggestions for improving the EQ experience.<br />
<br />
This was an amazing event for SOE and one of the first in the industry. The EQ Live team came away with hundreds of ideas for changes, improvements, updates and plain old cool new stuff to throw out to our half-million strong player base. Of course, with all the great ideas, it's going to take some time to get them implemented, but we're already seeing changes made to the game based on community suggestions. Wednesday's patch will contain even more great ideas from the community. &quot;<br />
