However EQTraders corner is not coming up here at my house, so... *shrugs* Mine's on hold for the moment hehe. Sides, I'm working on an alternate method after seeing the work done on the Pet Window Loc Guide. I DLd it and tried it today and it's SO much less laggy than the map mod, so I'm looking into doing something along these lines in another window.</div></div><hr />

Whether I agree or not is not an issue, but you should definately respect the wishes of the folks who put alot of time and effort in to their sites that the prove to the public for free.<br />
<br />
I would suggest compiling your list of tradeskills from multiple sources in different formats.</div></div><hr />

Which is why I have asked if it was okay already. I've even went so far as to post a request on the site itself, saying that if anyone had a problem with it's release that they should please speak up, because I don't want to step on anyone's toes. Still, the Alchemy information is my own, taken from personal experience and that which I still had from Belgar's Alchemy Page (may it rest in peace) The Fletching, from of course another source all together, ditto for Jewelcraft, but a good amount will likely be coming from Niami's site. Which is why I'm hoping that we can work together on this. If not, I'm just going to have to be a little more devious I guess.<br />
<br />
 As for the smithing, I'm already working on it.. EMail me at lucio038@yahoo.com and I'll probably have a workable version for you in the morning that I can send you.</div></div><hr />
