I have been modding Icebears Group Window, for use by the blind. :p It was hard to see the Percentages and such, or so I was told. So I changed the Color and Size of the window. Also changed the Font Size as well. Now here is the thing, it looks prity kosher but for on thing. The F5 group memebers Health % is now on the MAIN screen and at around the same spot as is should be in the UI. When I load the original UI, it is fine. But when I load my Moded UI it gose there. Everyone else's % is fine and when I look them over they are ALL the same, but for Screen position which would have to be ofcourse differant. So, the question is, WHY?<br />

Here is the Original File: http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/download.php?id=254<br />

I am attaching my Moded ver to this, for some reason I can't log into my Account to upload the file. :mad:</div></div><hr />
