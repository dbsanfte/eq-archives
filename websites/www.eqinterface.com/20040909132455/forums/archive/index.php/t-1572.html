<br />
I was ungrouped so you cant see the group member gauges, but they are very logically aligned under the target gauge on the left dragon window.<br />
<br />
Pet hp bars are still there under the group member's gauges.<br />
<br />
The righ clickies window (originally the player's window) is toggled on or off with Alt+C, since you dont need to have it up at all times.<br />
<br />
Works for view at 900 1200 and bigger.<br />
<br />
Im finalizing an assorted spellbook, and a dragon ani to go in the autoequip pad atm.<br />
<br />
Tell me what ya think :)<br />

How soon do you think before it's ready for general consumption by the UI starved populace here?<br />

Not saying its bad, but... could you make a smaller version possibly? Other than the large size, they are great :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rubeus_furious</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as  the title sugests very nice kudos on your great work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atheenath Dawns</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all thanks for all the nice comments, it keeps me going :)<br />
<br />
Vixyn, this UI works in a 1280x960 video setting. That means that even with the 2 dragons on the side, the space in between the dragons is as big as the space you had on 1200x700ish which is what most people use. <br />
<br />
Considering all the items and information that the &quot;dragon-windows&quot; contain, i cant really make them smaller, or items would be crouded on top of each other in the windows and it would be confusing to clic on, let alone uggly.<br />
<br />
If you dont want the dragon to be so &quot;visible&quot;, you can allways make them fade when your not activating them with your mouse over them.<br />
<br />
I had to consider a number of factors. First I wanted to group all of the things you might want to clic on with your mouse on one area of the screen (extremely important for classes like bards). This is why you have the spells, hotkeys, inventory and PRI/SEC/RANGE all grouped on the right dragon window, and the static info and group gauges on the left dragon window.<br />
<br />
I could have made the right dragon a little slimmer on his chest, but that would have killed the general symetry of the screen.<br />
<br />
Plus, it is, after all, a &quot;Dragonish&quot; UI :D)<br />

<br />
Thanks....still a wonderful mod<br />
<br />

&quot;Left handed people are the only ones, in their right mind....&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yes i am going to upload it lol. Just want to finish the assorted spellbook first, and I didnt have time to work on it the last 2 days. I will make my best to finish it tomorrow, so it should be up for grabs very soon now :)<br />
<br />
Oh, did I mention I am also working on a Hybrid (did I say ranger ? Did I ?) LotR/Legolas theme UI ? You should see a Screenie of it by Monday, and hopefully it will be finalized next week :D<br />
<br />
Bear with me, Im working as fast as I can :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atheenath Dawns</div><div class="date">09-03-2002, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok had a couple problems with the first files I uploaded (had a ' in the name of the zip file that was making the upload/download script fubar), but it has been solved and upgraded VER3.0  of the zip files are now available to download from these boards.<br />
<br />
Complete skins section : choose between caster/hybrid or pure melee main Dragon UI VER3.0 (upgraded)<br />
<br />
Spellbook skins section :  dragon spellbook VER3.0 (upgraded)<br />
<br />
Inventory section : dragon inventory with animated cartoon VER3.0 (upgraded)<br />
<br />
<br />
Had to break it down since the file was too big to be uploaded otherwise, so you will have to download these 3 elements to have the full package.<br />
<br />
Ive tested the VER3.0 upgrade personally, by downloading it from here and installing it from scrap, and it now works fine.<br />
<br />
Hope dragon lovers out there are going to enjoy it !<br />
