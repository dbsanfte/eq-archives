<br />
One downfall in my opinion is having the personal HP's/Mana and that separated from the group...   I like to keep my mana close to the group's HP's so I only have to look in one area.  <br />
<br />
The inventory and hot button window is superb!  If you could have 2 inventory slots right next to two body location slots though, I think that would make for easier swapping of items... for right clicky effects.<br />
<br />
Besides that, I think you got a real winner on your hands there.  <br />
Love the target window BTW!!!<br />

That's easily fixable though. All you need to do is move stuff around on the screen. :p<br />
<br />
Nice mod btw. When I was looking at it I was wondering why there was no target bar then I actually saw it lol. How could I miss something so big? :) What resolution is it in? 1024 x 768 I'm guessing? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ohh Yea and in reply to Haveing a Big Target Bar I do that cause Im a cleric and It Helps Time CH's as to maximise mana.</div></div><hr />

Thing is, I really liked the look of the fantasy one.  Is there a place where I can d/l that one?  Also, I play at 1024x768, and I get the feeling this thing is gonna swamp my screen.  Can someone tell me how to change its size in the xml file? <br />

I prefer one with names on it like the original posters.  One question though: is there a method to wether the color is red or yellow?  I can't really tell by your SS.</div></div><hr />
