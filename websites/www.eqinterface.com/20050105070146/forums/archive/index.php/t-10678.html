I do my editing while im in game using the alt tab ability.  I make changes to the xml, save the file, then pull up the options window, hit the load ui button, select the one i just changed and voila.  Your changes either work or they dont :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 things come to mind..<br />
<br />
1) Change Font Styles and give us the &quot;Sound&quot; tags for the buttons that is already there.<br />
<br />
2) Let us download a SOE Everquest UI Editor. Heck, most games give that away free that is included, but I am willing to pay for one, and I mean a real top notch one.</div></div><hr />

I think SoE could make another boatload of money if they released a really good UI editor that had WYSIWYG functionality and also integrated in some way with the real game for testing. I would pay a decent amount of money for that. *hint,hint*</div></div><hr />
