I have nver had to changed my UI files once I installed them.  And yet everyone is going though fixes and broken, how come I don't have to?  I just log on and the UI is up and I happy...am I missing something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Spiritweaver75,  I don't know which UI you are using but my guess is that you are probably using one of the ones from people who have gone through and made their UI for the most part unbreakable.  I know myself and many others have spent a long time going through all the files to make them as tight as possible so that when Sony come out with updates it is less likely to break the code.<br />
<br />
Just my guess since you did not mention the UI you are using.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Key files like EQUI.xml and EQUI_Animations.xml tend to change alot and if you dont have any custome ones of these then it helps with being patch proof.<br />
<br />
I think your just lucky :)<br />
