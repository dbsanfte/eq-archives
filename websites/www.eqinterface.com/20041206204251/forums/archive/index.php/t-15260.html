Wasn't freaking out Dolby , that was  the error I was getting from clocking on the new interfaces link on right side of homepage :)</div></div><hr />

Ideally it wouldnt show on the list untill moderated, but no system is perfect, however much we may want.<br />
<br />
As far as I have learned no file takes much longer than 3 hours tops to get approved - depends on what time it was uploaded and if any of the moderators are awake :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesnt show on the list until its out of moderation. The problem is the list is only updated every 15min and if the author submits something and then we approve it and then they edit it again right away its then shown on the list until the list updates again in 15min.<br />
<br />
I'm working on a more descriptive error.<br />
<br />
As for freaking out I was only being friendly there please dont take it the wrong way.</div></div><hr />
