When I do, I will see what I can do.  I am not happy with the latest changes (haven't actually seen them yet).  I made these mods for myself and would like to still be able to use them.<br />

The group one is the one with the problem the player one works fine. Colours in the gems drift off to the left so at 100% health of a groupmate shows yellow with a colour blotch to the left of the gem. seems the layers are getting shifted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chakarum</div><div class="date">02-20-2003, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded the group window for my own use, and modified it slightly to line up the gems on the left.  I also added a target gem below.  If its alright with Kuvasie, I will post it here for you guys to play with - hopefully it will be of use.  (I'm at work now, so can't upload, but will tonite if I remember...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvasie</div><div class="date">02-20-2003, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can post it, if you would like.  I am glad you like it.  I will be uploading one to the downloads section just as you describe after LoY is released.  I am hoping they have made their final changes to the group window.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chakarum</div><div class="date">02-21-2003, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here is my take on the TK Group Window.  The only problem I currently have is the transparency on the LFG button, but otherwise all is good!  It has all the group members, their pets, the invite/disband/follow/reject buttons, the new LFG button, and the target section all in one area.<br />
<br />
If you happen to fix the transparency issue with the LFG button, please post it... I can't figure it out...<br />
<br />
Thanks to Kuvasie for this excellent mod!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chakarum</div><div class="date">02-23-2003, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, managed to figure out alpha channels in Photoshop, so I fixed my transparency problem and put in a better LFG button... hopefully they will keep the button in the window now.  I also rearranged some items, so here is my final, fixed, group window.<br />
<br />
Kuvasie's original mod, and the T.King art, is the best group window I've found; I use all of the TK_Window mods that Kuvasie has put up for my windows.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />
