<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catavarie</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love all the UIs that are out there, but I haven't found something that really jumps out at me as to being my personal favorite one to use, I seem to find good and bad with everything thats out there right now and beleive me I've tried lots of UIs.  So I figured maybe i could just program my own UI and make it like I want.  So I was wondering where is a good place for someone with limited programming experience (minor HTML years ago) to get lots of information that would help me to be able to start writing my own XML file for a UI?  I would appreciate any response that anyone would be able to give me.</div></div><hr />
