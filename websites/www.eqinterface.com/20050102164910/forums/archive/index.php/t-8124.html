<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inertia</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a piece of real estate on a couple of edited UI windows that had no purpose.  So, I added a static image for atmosphere.  Now I am wondering if there is a way that I can activate that image to respond to mouse clicks to perform an in game function, such as a &quot;Hail&quot; or a &quot;/say blah blah blah&quot;.  The idea I have is going to be a permanent function so its even OK if I have to define what the button does in the XML code and not be able to change it in game.<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever toyed with a concept like this?<br />
<br />
Barring that is there a way to create a new type of button (not a hotkey button) that<br />
<br />
A) Perfoms my desired function <br />
<br />
AND <br />
<br />
B) Can use my image as a button face</div></div><hr />

My own XML knowledge is very basic, so I might be overruled by someone with more  skillz... I think what you're suggesting is possible, but I'mn not sure if it's worth the effort. Here's what comes to mind:<br />
<br />
A) The only programmable buttons I'm aware of are on the Hotkeys Window. Buttons in the UI aren't create-able or transferable between windows, so you'll probably have to use the Hotkeys.<br />
<br />
B) This should work, as long as you make the size of the button and the size of the image the same; I don't know which .tga file you'd need to replace though... and I'm sure it's used in other windows, so you'd have to specify the new image file in your XML.<br />
<br />
Of course, by using the Hotkeys Window, you make it usuable for other things, so... someone with real XML skill may have a better way, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Don't let me discourage you! I've seen plenty of UI additions that I never dreamed possible! Take my info as a place to start from, and see if you can't make it happen! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inertia</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK I kinda figured that a new button on the fly wouldn't be possible.  What I really want is to make the static image respond to a left click, if that's doable.<br />
<br />
All my hot keys are already mapped out and I just want to make another function that can be accessed a different way.</div></div><hr />
