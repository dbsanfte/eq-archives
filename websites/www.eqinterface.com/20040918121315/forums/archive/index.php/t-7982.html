<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">04-10-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For all those who have been waiting so patiently here it is.  the Skin that Saldarus and I have been working on for the past couple months.  We have it pretty close to complete but we want to give you all the chance to try it out and give us your feed back on how it is and what needs to be worked on.<br />
<br />
The file will be uploaded soon.  Looking to split the file up so that it will fit in here but for when it is here Following is the direction on getting it up and running.<br />
<br />
Once you have the zip file(s) just extract them into a new directory under your &quot;Everquest\uifiles\&quot; directory.  Remember the name that you give this directory because you will need it later when you are editing the ini file.<br />
<br />
Now copy the &quot;UI_Nechron_86.ini&quot; file to your everquest directory.  Check in the everquest directory for the current character ini file for your character and server.  Rename your current ini file to something else.  My suggestion is to rename it to the same thing and just add &quot;.bak&quot; or &quot;.old&quot; to the end.  Now rename &quot;UI_Nechron_86.ini&quot; to the name of your character file.<br />
<br />
For example if your ini file is named &quot;UI_Enron_51.ini&quot;  then you would rename this file to &quot;UI_Enron_51.old&quot;.  You would the rename &quot;UI_Nechron_86.ini&quot; to &quot;UI_Enron_51.ini&quot;<br />
<br />
Now that the file is named correctly you will need to double click on the file to open an edit window of the file.  Scan down through the file and find the line that reads as follows:<br />
<br />
UISkin=Default<br />
<br />
Now you need to change this line to the name of the directory you extracted the files to that I asked you to remember earlier.  For example say you installed the files to the following directory:<br />
<br />
&quot;C:\Program Files\Everquest\uifiles\Salchron\&quot;<br />
<br />
You would edit this line to read as follows:<br />
<br />
UISkin=Salchron<br />
<br />
Now Save and Close this file and start your EQ and bring up the character for this UI.  The skin should come up correctly with all the windows in the right place.  If the windows are not in the right place then most likely the cause is that you have named the ini files incorrectly.  You will need to exit EQ and double check the ini file name to make sure that it is correct.<br />
<br />
Sladarus and I will be monitoring this topic as well as the topic in the pre beta forum for those who have problems as well as for all your comments and suggestions.<br />

However was wondering if the red flashing box that comes on when you hit 'attack' is supposed to go over there where the timer is.  It just seems a bit out of place the way the shape and size of the box is according to where its located :)<br />
I do really love the ability to change the colors of the pieces and have them look very vivid.<br />
Great work :)</div></div><hr />

Yes its supposed to be there for now, we were either going to figure out cool way to show it or disable it, excuse the misplacement for now while we work that out.<br />

Ive created some blue to black gradient textures that everyone can try out and tell us which one you like best. They look kind of dark as just files but in game they do have patterns and look pretty cool. Go through them and let us know which you like best. Im uploading the file to my webspace so you guys can go ahead and start downloading it. <br />
<br />
To install it, unzip the file where ever you like, choose the background you want to try and copy it to your custom UI folder and let it overwrite the old one. Some look as if they have no pattern but youll see the pattern in game. Let us know which you like best.<br />

What area are you having trouble seeing, the chat box? I use chatfontsize 3 and can read them very easily. As far as having to change the colors, I posted new textures that should be easier to read text on try them out and see if they help.<br />

I have gotten use to the 1600x1200 resolution so that the UI was not so obtrusive on the screen.  When this skin comes out in 1600x1200, I will be using it on all my characters.<br />

Doh another font problem, fontsize 1 is very small, I use fontsize 3 for chat window and have no problem even with heavy spam reading it, of course if your using the texture that came with the UI as the chat background yes it is hard to read on top of, try some of the additional backgrounds ive posted and see if they help and let us know which you like best.<br />

Pet attack on the bottom? Hmm well I dont play a pet class so the order was pretty much random to what I thought was used, if people request that attack be put on bottom we can put it on bottom :)<br />

If someone who plays a Pet class wants to come up with a good order for the buttons we will more than happy to change the current set.

The more feedback we get the faster we can make adjustments to suite everyone. Our goal was to design a UI that didnt just have a flat look to it, that would look unique and be general enough to not be called a class specific UI. This is beta and there is alot to do based on your feedback, there are still many cool features that we havent installed yet but are working hard to get them done. So get us as much feedback as you can and we will hurry to meet everyones needs and get this into released so we can work on new modifications and resolutions so everyone can get the experiance.<br />

<br />
The UI itself was designed in 1024 768 resolutions you should have your eq display set to that to use it properly, as far as the backgrounds there are 13 of them all are the same gradient just with different patters so try them out and see which you like best, all of them should be easy to read on top of but some will of course look better than others to a persons eye.<br />

<br />
Booooo! download and try out those additional window textures they are dark yet not just black I think youll enjoy them as a chat box background and a window background for reading text. We need more feedback on those additional textures to decide which one to use for default release :)<br />

<br />
Sorry we will get that weight issue worked out and setup a patch to fix it. As far as adding timers, At the moment the only way to add timers is manually due to thier smaller than normal size. Arista said he/she was gonna work on a sizing option for downloading timers, once thats done, it will be much easier to give everyone a timer that they want rather than just timers that we manually install in the UI. For now we are working on a few general timers to install until that day comes. Thank you for the feedback.<br />

The nice thing with that allotment is those would be good timers for watching spawn timers and what ever so it may be helpfull to others.  Just an idea.<br />

<br />
Ok thats easy enough and I think that everyone could use such timers for now, will get those built up and a patch made for it and will let everyone know.  Just fyi im not big on code Im just a graphics guy, I made the timer quickly with a 2:30 recycle for snare just to see if I could, Im sure chron could do much better but hes been super busy on other things and I at least wanted some kinda timer in there rofl.<br />
<br />
I assume you mean names or icons telling you where each item goes? As of now no there arent any labels or pics telling you where items go, there is an auto equip which is the clear glass that covers the target window just drop there. As far as putting them there yes we will have some but they wont be default and will take a little making to get the put in, Ive considered putting the name for the item in there but sometimes that makes things look bad so we will see. Thanks for the imput hope I answered your question.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe Im actually working on that myself, The way VI stretches buttons to use the same ones over and over blows my mind at times because I could make some really nice looking ones, but would then have to modify the code for every single window to accept them, Just like the text for button in a window as far as modifying the color of the text. We are trying really hard to make this UI as independant from VI's standard scheme as possible so when they patch it wont break. With that being said Yes Im looking into making some different buttons, darker, that the white text will be easier seen on. In the end if I cant come up with a cool looking button that white will look good on we will see about changing the text but it will probably be a button change.<br />

<br />
and currently using it under 1600x1200.  I might only change:<br />
1. The bar under the Exp/Target/AltExp should be longer<br />
2. Buff/Songs could be a little bigger (not sure if this can be done)...so we can see the buff icons better<br />
3. Same for Spells<br />

Are you planning on putting the LFG button on the group panel?  You could put it right under the Disband button (horizontal).<br />

<br />
Zima.. Sadly, My monitor doesnt handle 1600 x 1200 resolution and I just found this out so Ill have figure out a way to see what your talking about. Actually, we have kinda discussed what we might do later when considering other resolutions, and so far we have two options, One..use the current layout and just make things fit and look well all resolutions and in larger resolutions youll be able to have the room for multiple chat windows in the center like it is now. Two, do a slight re-design, where most of the information which is now to the left and right in the center and put a chat window on both sides of that. As we get closer to working on other resolutions we will hopefully get feedback on which to do based on the pictures we put out.<br />
<br />
The F keys are my fault, someone requested it pre release, Chron put them in sent them to me and I said that looks good and didnt even think about them being the wrong numbers lol. That will definately be fixed in the first patch.<br />
<br />
Spellbook a bit wider? Actually, some have said the spellbook doesnt exactly match the scheme of the UI, so we are considering a re-design there as well, We are thinking of making the spellbook the opposite of the inventory and instead of wrapping around the target window wrap around the mp3 player and be upside down of course. This spellbook actually went with and inventory we first created some time ago so dont fear that will be addressed as well.<br />
<br />
LFG Button? Yes and we were actually thinking of putting it exactly where your talking about, but were trying to come up with a way to make both sides look the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Curumtiny... Buttons are a very tricky thing, if you actually look at the buttons we have now, some of them look weird at the bottom and some look fine. This is due to how VI stretches a default set of button templates to make them usable in any window. Ive tried so many combinations of buttons to make them look flawless without looking bland such as the default UI ones it drives me insane. As far as the color scheme and making them darker. It was my hope that there would be a few different colors that matched well and didnt look completely the same those are the buttons you have now but are too light. I will get some figured out that match and work well never fear hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you all again for the great feedback. Saturday hopefully we will have a patch to fix most of the minor things you have found so far as well as adding some general timers. Keep the feedback coming and we will keep trying to perfect what I hope turns out to be a wonderful and popular UI.<br />

Also when you do a inventory up over the target, health,etc bar the inventory on the left hand side blocks off the rest of your health bar and covers the %xx of your health bar, mana, stamina, and the green bar (breath?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not sure what you mean by blocks off you should be able to see all the bars just not the percentages as its wrapped tightly around the target window. The only thing I can think of is, the area that covers the target window is actually glass, there is lens flare in the area that your refering too is that what your talking about? If thats what your talking about, the white flare on the glass it should only cover up must maybe 10% in which case if your that low on health with your inventory open your prolly gonna be dead soon rofl. If you think its a big issue I can maybe tone it down a bit and make it more transparent and still look like glass.<br />
<br />
As for the group names dissappearing will look into that and hopefully get that in tomarrows patch.<br />
<br />
Green bar is primary pet health btw, breath bow only shows up under water over the target window jump in and you should see it. Chrons SS doesnt quite show alot of the features like that but they are all shown under the pre beta forum ill try and get him to put those under the main topic for people to see so they will know.<br />

Yah if you could maybe make it a bit more transparent would be great.  Like I said I play a warrior and as a Tank their is many times I come close to the under 10% when waiting for CHs.  I normally do a count in my head on how many seconds from the time I see the message of incomming CH.  Of course maybe I am better off not know hehe keep less grey hair waiting for the heal to land :D</div></div><hr />

Sorry had a very busy day today so couldnt reply or work on much. I hope to start working on things again tomarrow&lt;today its 3am lol&gt; I should be able to make that a bit more transparent for you no worries. <br />
<br />
I got an email requesting me to design some class specific layouts and wanted to post about it. Though we could make class specific UI's I dont know about chron but I personally dont have the time for it thats why I wanted to build a nice general all purpose UI. I have tons of Ideas and concepts for UIs I just dont have the time to put into them. Id like to thank everyone for being as patient as they have been on this mod. It may not be super great or class specific but I really seem to like using it myself. And it will be even better once its complete and the layout is exactly how we/everyone wants it. Just to show you, we could do class specific Im linking a picture of a UI a friend wanted me to build for him but I didnt have time to do it. If anyone wants to steal the idea/concept feel free Im sure it will make my ranger friend happy.<br />

1.  A bard was a bit away from me but singing some song.  The song appeared in the short duration buff window but the area where the name would be was all white and no name showed at all.<br />
2.  When trying to click on vendors it becomes difficult it seems thier is alot of area where you would click you get nothing or the stupid right click menu to change like the fading windows.  So I am not sure if their is any invisible windows their that I cant see or is some of the area from windows have a wide range on the screen.<br />
<br />
This is a great UI btw.</div></div><hr />

Yes working on getting the fkeys labels fixed sorry. <br />

Curum, the system is using the default short buff code with a few of our settings and it looks bad. We are making a short buff duration window that will be opposite of the buff window to go just above the spell bar.<br />

Looks like you have a 60 second timer going, and refer to that:<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;Player_A_TimerBar0&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />

&lt;Text&gt;0:02:30&lt;/Text&gt;<br />

If not too complicated (which it certainly looks like it would be), is there an explanation of what to change to set name and duration within code?  If other site has better explanation of timer, will gladly read there.   Would it be as simple as changing the text 0:02:30 to 0:01:30 ? <br />

I tried utilizing Arista's work into UI using &quot;FriendWnd.xml&quot; but seems to really bog down the processor and not work correctly.<br />
<br />
Once again, I love this UI, won't be able to switch back to default after using it now :)<br />

Also, very minor thing noticed with volume bar on MP3 player...can move slider off pretty easily, but with work can still get it back.<br />

Actually your right its supposed to be a 230 timer but its only a 1 minute timer rofl geeze how my math sucks. Im working on completing adding a few timers to that window right this second a 10 30 and one hour timer. I hope Arista gets a sizing option for her code soon so we can let people make thier own and just throw them on the background. As far as manually editing the timers, to make them whatever size you want, figure out how many seconds you want it to be multiply by 1000, then divide by 60, replace the duration of each animation(60 of them) with that number I use wordpad it has a replace feature makes it faster. The patch that will be uploaded today will have the general timers, fix the weight issue, the fkey issue, and a more transparent glass on the inventory to see all of the bars. The volume slider is my doing, I actually made the mp3 player myself and know very little of xml so thats why its screwy, what I think should work in my head doesnt always work right in game rofl. Hopefully Chron will be able to figure that one out for me.<br />

New features you ask? Well we have re done the buffbar to look more inline with the overall scheme of the UI. Tomarrow we should be uploading a nice patch with this and a few other new features to try out such as.<br />
<br />
A red flashing box that appears around the target box when you attack. Not the entire window just the box with the targets name in it.<br />
<br />
Will also be adding a new feature which will hopefully become popular for high end raiding. Flashing hp gauges, when your HP gets below 50% youll begin to see it flash yellow. At first we will do it for the owners HP just to see what people think about it. Then will integrate it to the group members gauges. Why would this be a great thing? Well if your in a high lvl raid sometimes the healer in your group is also spamming the Main tank with heals and can hardly keep track of its own members HP. But if it begins to flash yellow because its below 50% thier eye will easily catch it and begin to heal that player. Ill expect alot of feedback from everyone on that one so try it out when we post it for download.<br />

Ok first off no sadly we cant move the text to the other side for the sdb window. We wanted to so we could put it above the spellbar but the buff bar and sdb bar have to be identical appearantly. =/<br />
<br />
Breath window is tricky to move, try clicking at the very bottom of it that seems to help in the area where it looks like nothing is there.<br />
<br />
Im not sure why the target window would overlap the inventory, it should be on top when you open it unless somehow your making the target window active and on top. I wish VI would give us a way to layer the windows better and define whats on top of what. Ive personally not ran into that problem yet so will try and duplicate it and see what I come up with, maybe a bit more info would help.<br />
<br />
Eventually we will add either names or graphics to the inventory squares to show what goes where.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.<br />

Ok,<br />
<br />
1. No unfortunately this is built in by Sony/VI.  The two buff bars are made so that they have to be done the exact same way as far as the way the icons are layedout. <br />
<br />
2. The breath meter has to be grabbed by the bottom Far left or Right corners of the Meter.  So to do this you will have to be in the water.<br />
<br />
3. Not sure about that one.  What resolution are you running this at.  I have tried it all the way up to 1600x1200 and am not seeing that problem.</div></div><hr />

However, I found that the buff windows &amp; the spell cast bar take up too much of the viewable screen area, since you cannot click through them.  I would recommend switching to a slightly smaller font size, and wrapping the text to 2 or even 3 lines for each spell name, and reducing the icon size for the buff windows (so that the SD buff window can be moved up a bit so all 6 buffs can be visible at once).<br />

We are working on all of those and we will be putting a patch out shortly that will take in to account most of your concerns.  We will let you know as soon as we get the page out.</div></div><hr />

I like the colors.. but all i got them to change is the Options window and the chat box is there anyway i could get them to chang the color of the whole UI  <br />
<br />
Should be able to change the tint color of every window. Just right click on that window and adjust its tint if you want it back to normal set tint to white and should be back to normal.<br />

Should have it ready to go tomorrow morning.  It will be a full update for the most part so I will be uploading it to the download section and replacing the version that is there now.  It will be in the mix&amp;match section still but we are pretty much complete with it now so we will be having the Admins move it to the live version once we get some feed back to make sure everything is working correctly.</div></div><hr />
