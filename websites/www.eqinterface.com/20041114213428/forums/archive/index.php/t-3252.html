<br />
I have uploaded Alyquartz on the board and to my very genuine surprise, over 200 of you have already downloaded. I was expecting maybe 30 :P<br />
<br />
I'm really surprised and delighted by the response. With this, i think i will continue making modifications on the skin.<br />
<br />
I have to thank Statix for his work on Quartz, which i base my UI upon. His skin was the only one i have kept since the new UI has been made available.<br />
<br />
I would like to hear what you have to say about the skin, your impressions, comments and suggestions on future mods i could make. Keep in mind that i am not an artist, i am a programmer that can do some XML work. If it's out there, and looks good, i will definitely look at it and i may include it in my skin.<br />
<br />
I will always gove full credit to the original artists that create the UI though.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">galadryll</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used your Mod since it first came out, and dont plan on changing any time soon :) . I have had to go into the directory and add the Bard buff window, and it seems to be functioning OK (still getting that nasty your UI doesnt wotk..hehe). Was just wondering if you could create the same kind of window as the regular buffs ( I like the way it looks) with just the five buff spots. Please keep up the good work.<br />

I try to keep Statix's quartz integral. The reason is that since he's the artist making the design and i am just a &quot;falicitator of integration&quot; i really can't (and don't have the talent&quot; to start fiddling with the images.<br />
<br />
I would ask you to see if Statix can make this mod and if it gets in the design, it will be included in my mod.</div></div><hr />

I can still bring it up, but it has no cool look like the rest of my screen now. Do you or the original designer have the intention of adding this to it? By the way.... I love this mod so much I am using it for my druid and ranger.</div></div><hr />

I'd use it for her too if not for the nasty black square in the bottom left corner where her spells would be.<br />
<br />
Have you considered a melee version?</div></div><hr />

Thank You,<br />
Galadryll  <br />
<br />
If I am understanding you correctly, try /viewport reset while in game.  That should allow you to see through the various windows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, a lot of the xml files have been changed since ver 1.6. As I don't know much about the coding involved, I'm unable to fix everything myself.<br />
<br />
Anyone out there know enough to take a crack at making the fixes? I'd simply hate to give up this mod.</div></div><hr />

If anyone knows how to fix it, or if you know we going to have a patch released - just let us all know so we can enjoy this great UI again !!!! PLEASE!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">redfox</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He he... worry not.. wonderful UI.. I use it for all of my characters... casters and melee alike....  most notably my main, Hellhound Wolfrunner (51 Vah Shir Warrior, Bertoxxulous server).  Keep up the good work.<br />
<br />
Not sure about others... but my UI works well with LDoN ... I have the files for LDoN but have yet to retrieve a valid license for it yet.. soon I hope.</div></div><hr />
