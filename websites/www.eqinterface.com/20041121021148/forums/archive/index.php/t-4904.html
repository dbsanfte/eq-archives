Like I said, I like the Player Info/Target/Group attachment...problem is, I have a Pet Gauge underneath my HP Gauge.  Also, be nice if you could attach the Abilities window to the bottom of those three, as well as putting the target window between the Player Info and Group Info.  There are a few other things that may make it better, such as Wt and stats attached to that.  Post back and we'll see if you can help me.  Love your UI, right up there with Geist's as one of the best.</div></div><hr />
