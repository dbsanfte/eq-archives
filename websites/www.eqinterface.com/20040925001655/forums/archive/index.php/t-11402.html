But when it comes to spellbook03 and spellbook04,  I come up with this problem.  The default files are 256x128 pix.  But when it comes to the xml it is showing 256x75 pix.<br />
<br />
I created my pix as 256x128. But when I load the skin into eq, it turnates to 256x75 and distorts.<br />
<br />
What do I need to correct this issue.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
