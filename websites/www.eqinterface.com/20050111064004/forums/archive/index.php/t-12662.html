<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mathscitch</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. I have now become naked on my beastlord or at least that is what it looks like.  I also look like I am half orange tiger and half white tiger.  I am currently using the default ui and have no clue how to fix this.  All the other toons on my account are fine except the kitty.  Any clue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotta screenshot of it?<br />
<br />
Otherwise my only thought would be to delete your .TXC files. That may correct the problem. You could always give that a try.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TXC files is not always the fix, but worth a try. However I do not have any txc files :)<br />
<br />
Since the VahShir's came out, they have a ton of graphic problems, such as the one I have been dealing with since day one.<br />
<br />
I wear a Phase Spider Carapace on my Beastlord and 95% of the time it looks like I am wearing a chain tunic, but ONLY to other people (confirmed). If I re-equip it, it looks plate again (to them).<br />
<br />
I wish they would just sit and fix the bugs, THEN add new content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1. Dev team in charge of new content is NOT the bug team.. The team that creates new stuff does not handle bug fixes.. and throwing ALL the teams on bugs would only slow down the process not speed it up.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. New graphic engine being release.. THAT would be the fix they have been working on. from what Absor told me directly alot of the graphic glitch with Vah Shir and things like the BST epic on the Ogres (its too small goes through thier hands) will automatically be fixed with this new engine.<br />
<br />
Soooo there ya go.. next month or so it should all be water under the bridge.. (or so we hope) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is great to hear. Nice to get direct answers to long awaited questions that have not been answered before, or at least none that I can find. Communication is a major key.<br />
<br />
Thanks for letting me know there is such a thing as a horizon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mathscitch</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your answers.  I guess I will just have to wait for the new engine.<br />
<br />
Also, I am honored that Kudane and Drakah stopped by and answered my questions.  You all do great work and its much appreciated.  Thank you for all of your time and creativity to making EQ even more fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brinian</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had this problem on my Vah Shir beastlord.  It turned out to be my bracer of blood rage causing graphics corruption when I started up the client with it equipped.  Now I upequip it before I log, and everything is fine.<br />
<br />
Try bagging all your equipment, then restarting the game.  If you can equip your items and they show up fine, then you may have the same problem I had.  Did you buy or loot a new item right before you started having problems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mathscitch</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't believe I bought or looted anything new recently.  I will try your tip and see if that helps me out.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mathscitch</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I tried that option dear.  Banked all my items and camped out.  Came back in and started equipping items.  Several items didn't show up.  Pretty much only thing that showed was bp.  So I guess I will just have to look half orange/white tiger and be naked. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a Vah Shir Rogue.. he always looked like he was wearing a Gnome Skin outfit.. even when he died he was still wearing that darn Gnome Skin outfit.. lol..<br />
<br />
However, when he illusioned DE, or any other Race, he looked just fine! Removed gear, looked normal, etc. Soon as he got back to his original Vah Shir self, blammo, back to Gnome Skin wear.<br />
<br />
Got fed up with it...and Deleted the poor rogue.</div></div><hr />
