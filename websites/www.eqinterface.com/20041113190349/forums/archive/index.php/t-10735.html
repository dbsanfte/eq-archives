Wanted to post the GUI I am currently using. This was inspired by Forry, Vert, and my own prior work.<br />
<br />
Rather than going through the extreme challenge of modifing Daellig 2 to meet everyones demands, I built this. It offers significantly more flexability. I have included my ini file if you want the same layout. Here is a preview of what it looks like with the map window up.<br />
<br />
The entire goal was to be as efficient as possible while adding as much functionality as possible. The only difficulty some may have is with the pet buff window, song window, and buff windows. These all are effectivly perma fixed in their locations. They can be moved my GUI designers or by modifing the included ini file. Personally I like em where they are. The ini file is designed for a 1600x1200 resolution.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the song window which you can't see since I am not grouped with a bard, makes the buffs appear directly to the left of the standard buff window which is on the right side of the screen. The pet buffs are on the left.<br />
<br />
Guess that's it.<br />

<br />
This is actually the way it was before they added the pet buffs to the petinfowindow. I will send those files up tonight if I have time. I will also mod the group window so that for melees it has a stamina bar in place of the mana. There wasn't enough room for both. Or do you even want that, or just remove the stamina bar alltogether? The issue being that Sony in their infinite wisdom chose to make the AA Exp bar and the Stamina bar the same color..... If I add the stamina bar, I will have to change the AA Exp bar to a dif color to. No biggie, just fyi.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daellig</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are the files with the modified Group Window.<br />
<br />
I also seperated the Stats Window, and Spellbar window by using the petinfo window to display the stats.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">odball</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the overall look of this and very easy to see all info.  I just downloaded it and found that the ini file you included didn't change anything.  I changed the name to match my current char/server, after making a copy of the original one and it didn't look anything like your screenshot.  Also for those with pets where are the pet commands?  As the ini didn't work for me, was a pain to try to move the song/spell buffs to where I could see them.  Kept haveing to go from old to yours so I could move them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ebonicus</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love minimalist design, but all the stats on the spell bar are not necessary for me. How do make the spell bar and book a separate window?<br />
<br />
Also, can you make the target window resizable? clerics like a large target window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stavesoffury</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">odball, what reso are you in? the included *.INI is for 1600x1200</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ebonicus</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this interface is exactly what I have been looking for, but it has some inherent problems.<br />
<br />
I tried both version, patched and unpatched from this thread, for melee and for casters respectively.<br />
<br />
The spell window detached on the patch version is great, it should be like that for custom placement anywhere on my screen. I hate showing stats on my UI, i don't need to look at them, and will use inv win if I do.<br />
<br />
The first probelm is the window filename usage. I have a large target window which I usually replace for any skin, and I cannot, since your target window is the clickies window. If I try to use my custom target as the player window (your target window) the skin will crash. Target should be the default EQUI_TargetWindow.xml for the target window. Make a new window name for clickies window EQUI_ClickiesWindow.xml and add it to the main EQUI.xml include list.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, the pet window is just the self player stats window, so the pet commands window is inaccessible altogether. Again, the stats should be a new window name, like EQUI_StatsWindow.xml and should be on the include list as well. This way it can be closed for those who do not use it. This way, the pet window can function normally as well.<br />
<br />
Third, if you are a melee/pet caster like an SK, you need to see the pet window, and on the player/group window I need sta + mana bars.<br />
<br />
Fourth, your target window should show the casting meter on it, so a cleric can see if the CH rate is happening fast enough as the target's HP's are decreasing. Currently the casting meter shows on top of the mana bar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aside fromt eh above, I love this skin, and would use it if it would work properly for my toons.<br />
<br />

What buttons would be associated with it to open the window?</div></div><hr />

I built the GUI to work with any resolution. What exactly is the issue?<br />

<br />
I am a big fan of you Daellig 2.0 Skinn, But last time I wanted to switch to that skin is seems to be brocken, <br />
<br />
Anny chance you can take a look at that ???? PLZ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quantic</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The map is so wide that the chat boxes, if any, are SOOOO small to actually read text because of the other boxes.  This is using you .ini included.<br />
<br />
Is this wrong?</div></div><hr />

This is the ui I have been using and I truely love it!! however, it no longer works since the 12/23 patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GreenDragon</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clarify you can add new windows to the EQUI.xml file and they will show up when you start the game. However if you close them the only way to reopen them is to reload the skin/ restart the character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyaa</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a really nice UI you got there...using it myself atm (a bit modified to my need though ;) )<br />
<br />
What would I have to do XML-wise to get the casting bar into its own window like in the default UI?</div></div><hr />
