2 things bother me about the containers.  <br />
<br />
First, I can't find a way to get rid of that unneeded blank space at the bottom that shows up when you remove the bag picture.  It seems like it's just hard coded how much space there is for that stuff, but maybe I'm missing something.<br />
<br />
The second, and I notice this even in the default, is that there doesn't seem to be any way to get stuff like the 'Done' button to actually be centered (notice it's slightly off to the left in that pic)<br />
<br />
Anyways, I hope I'm just missing something obvious.</div></div><hr />

Containers are the only window where the program will resize the window (and we simply cant force it to be different.  I'm guessing the done button is set with a page or perhaps is being caught by an autojustify tag.  Unfortunately, while SIDLWIDL is good for layout - it doesn't handle the naunces very well so you will prolly have to notepad edit this until you get it.  I would suggest looking at some of the existing container mods - there are some good ones out there and you might see what is similar and working in theirs.</div></div><hr />
