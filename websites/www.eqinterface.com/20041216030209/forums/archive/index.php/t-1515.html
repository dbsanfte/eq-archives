since the skinner didnt modify buttons, etc - you should be able to drop Rombus' windows right into the same directory as the druid skin</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightWolf</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, the druid mod looks to be just textures.  I'm going to try to load it into my Quartz mod, and see how it looks ;)<br />
<br />
Should be able to work with any mod, so pick a good one (or combo) and load the druid texture file into directory with mod.  Should work.<br />
<br />
I really wish I had my laptop with me so I could test some of my suggestions.  I'm still in my SQL class (we're having a lunch break)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">.  Browse around a bit on the old site.  If you see a player window you like you can drop that in right on top of the Advanced Player Window.  It will ask if you want to overwrite and you just say 'yes'.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Mod's like vert's need to be handled with more care because he totally revamped the buttons but this one looks to be safe for mod drop-ins - check the druid skin's zip for XML if you arent sure.</div></div><hr />
