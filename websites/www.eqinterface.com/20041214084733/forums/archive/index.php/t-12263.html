I just finished up creating a standalone version of the hot button window. I actually made two versions - one that looks exactly the same as in the Lodi Dodi UI (called the &quot;Lodi Dodi Graphics&quot; version) and one that attempts to use your existing UI's graphics (called the &quot;Existing UI Graphics&quot; version) assuming the UI modified the standard UI buttons, backgrounds, etc.<br />
<br />
I just submitted them in the DOWNLOADS section under &quot;Hot Keys&quot;, and once the moderators post them, I'll add the links here. Meanwhile, you can download them from http://www.lodidodi.net<br />

Edit: Here are the links:<br />

In the hotbox window with all the bags and the 4 inventory slots:<br />

Melee 1 / Melee 2 / Ranged / Ammo...<br />

Is there a way to replace the four top bag spots with:<br />

Lower right: Breastplate<br />

I use those four for clickies on a regular basis, and always seems to have to little hotkeys, so being able to sport them instead of the bag slots would be great for me :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ignore me :) I found out that I could click on the small icons...<br />

<br />
Glad you like the UI.<br />
<br />
Not sure if you realized it, but you can actually access all your inventory slots from the hot button window, using the 4 tabs (bags/head/hands/body) on the right half of the window. Rather than trying to explain it, I'll just show you a screenshot of the window &quot;in action&quot;:<br />
<br />
http://www.lodidodi.net/hotbuttons.gif<br />
<br />
I designed it like that specifically so that different people wouldn't need different versions of the window depending on what clickies they use. :)<br />
<br />
Hope that meets your needs.<br />
<br />
Edit: Hehe. Guess you figured it out just as I was posting my response. Regarding the targeting ring, I don't think EQ reloads the target ring when you load a new UI while you are in-game. To force it to reload, do &quot;/indicator off&quot; then &quot;/indicator on&quot;. Or just wait and the next time you start EQ it will start using the new one.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I assumed it wouldn't be that big of an issue since it only turns on when you click in the top righthand corner of the window and then turns off when you click in the top lefthand corner of the window, and I didn't notice any performance degradation because I used the same files that are normally used to load the class animations into memory.<br />
<br />
However, if you do want to remove it altogether, I just created a new lodidodi_classanim.xml file that you can download *here*. (Edit: For some reason the direct link to the file wasn't working from within this post. You will have to go to http://www.lodidodi.net, and scroll down to &quot;Optional Downloads&quot; then click the link for &quot;Blank Easter Egg&quot;.) If you unzip this file and copy it into your UI directory (overwriting the existing lodidodi_classanim.xml file), then the easter egg will no longer be accessible.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this was a problem,<br />

<br />
The Lodi Dodi UI pulls the graphics for the standard size buttons from their normal locations within the &quot;window_pieces03.tga&quot; file (my UI has a custom version of that file), so if you overwrite my version of that file with the same file from a different UI, odds are that most of the buttons will switch to those graphics. Window backgrounds are also pulled from the standard files of &quot;wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga&quot; and &quot;wnd_bg_light_rock.tga&quot; so you can just copy those files over too.<br />
<br />
However, many of the smaller buttons didn't look quite right when the game automatically resized the graphics from the aforementioned file, so I ended up creating a few more files to store custom graphics for differently sized buttons, called &quot;lodidodi_buttons.tga&quot; and &quot;lodidodi_custombuttons.tga&quot;. So you'd have to manually convert those graphics over to the new style to switch over all the buttons.<br />
<br />
Finally, the backgrounds for inventory slots are stored in &quot;lodidodi_slots.tga&quot; (standard size, for inventory window) and &quot;lodidodi_minislots.tga&quot; (smaller, for hot buttons window), so if you want those converted over too, you'd have to change those files. You may also want to tweak &quot;lodidodi_spell.tga&quot; if you want to change the look of the spell gems.<br />
<br />
I do like the Tablets graphics (I actually based my graphics off one version of Tablets) so if enough people express interest, I might take the time to do this myself and post it on my website as an optional download.<br />
<br />
leama -<br />
<br />
I did design it so that different animations could be easy swapped in for the default animation. The plan was to create new animations once in a while to provide a little variety. However, don't hold your breath waiting for a &quot;dancing guys&quot; animation from me, you might have to create that one yourself. :)<br />

Was it intended with Unshared pp slot to be at bottom/left corner and for shared to be above gold? Just look like its in wrong place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes the shared/unshared pp slots are in the correct spots.<br />
<br />
Personally I stopped using the unshared pp slot after they added the shared pp slot. I can't think of a reason why anyone would want/need to use the unshared pp slot anymore. If you have a good reason, please let me know.<br />

<br />
That's a good question, so I just added it to the FAQ page on my web site (http://www.lodidodi.net).<br />
<br />
Here you go:<br />
<br />
Q: What/where is the &quot;easter egg&quot;? <br />
<br />
A: The &quot;easter egg&quot; is an animation hidden in the player/group window. To turn it on, click in the upper righthand corner of the window. To turn it off, click in the upper lefthand corner of the window (for example, on the &quot;ATK:&quot; text). <br />
<br />
Q: Can I change the &quot;easter egg&quot; to display my own clip?<br />
<br />
A: Yes. The graphics for the frames of the animation are stored in modified versions of the files that normally store the class animations (&quot;bard01.tga&quot;, &quot;beastlord01.tga&quot;, etc). Changing the graphics in the versions of those files found in the Lodi Dodi UI directory will change the animation. If you want to use a clip with more frames or fewer frames than the existing clip, you will also need to edit the &quot;lodidodi_classanim.xml&quot; file to add/remove frames used by the animation. If you make your own clip, send me a copy and if I like it (and it is not R or X rated) I'll post it here on my web site for others to download.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
You could modify the grey background fairly easily. The two files that store the background colors are &quot;wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga&quot; and &quot;wnd_bg_light_rock.tga&quot;, so you'll want to modify those. You'll also want to edit &quot;lodidodi_backgrounds.bmp&quot; which stores the frames around windows and the additional grey borders/backgrounds I used for some of the items within various windows. You may also want to edit some of the other graphics files depending on how extensive you want the color change to be.<br />

<br />
Any help is appreciated...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cowdery - THere are two possibilities for this.<br />
<br />
First, EQ has some minor bugs with the UI .ini files; for one thing, it saves the height of the confirmation window from the first UI you ever load for a character, and if you change UIs it keeps the original height for some reason instead of using the height it should be in the new UI. So if you were using a UI that had a shorter height than mine, for it won't change the height to my height, meaning it might cut off the yes/no buttons. To fix this, first make sure your character is using the Lodi Dodi UI, then log the character out. Go into your main Everquest directory and find a file named &quot;UI_Charactername_servername.ini&quot; (for example, &quot;UI_Lodi_innoruuk.ini&quot;). Find the section under &quot;[PopDialog0]&quot; which controls the confirmation window. In that section, delete all lines referring to height, such as &quot;Height1024x768=100&quot; and &quot;Height800x600=100&quot;. Then log back into EQ with your character, which will load up the Lodi Dodi UI and set the height of that window appropriately.<br />
<br />
Second, if it isn't a height issue, and there is room for the buttons but they just aren't showing up, check these threads:<br />
HELP please. Confirmation boxes broken (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11780)<br />
and<br />

<br />
Aaldolin - If you still can't find the arrow, here's a last resort: Load up the default UI. Move the target window and the player window to the middle of the screen. Make sure both are visible. (Alt-T toggles the target window and Alt-Y toggles the player window, unless you've changed the keyboard equivalents in your Options window.) Then load up my UI - the target window will become the arrow in my UI, and the player window will become my target window. Now you should be able to move them wherever you want them.<br />

Thanks..  After flipping back to the default I figured out what the problem was. It seems my old UI made my &quot;Target&quot; box completely invisible (faded all the way out). <br />
<br />
When I loaded the new one (and default) that stayed attached to the specific window.<br />
<br />
I just happened to slide the mouse over it and it appeared. Changed the fade level. Loaded Lodi again and the arrow appeared.<br />
<br />
Just one of those silly things that give ya fits and is obvious once you realize it. Would probably be better if the /loadskin command also reset the Fade levels of windows. Not sure if that's an EQ thing or a UI thing though.<br />
<br />
UI is great. I think my favorite part is how the spell buff bar at the top of the screen darkens each slot.<br />
<br />
Can't believe how many times I've had to sit there and count out my buffs to know where the final spot was at. With 1 - 15 darkening it's obvious with this one. <br />
<br />
The only thing I dislike is the Shared plat being flipped from the &quot;normal&quot; way. It's a personal preference type situation. Not sure how hard it would be for a mod to be made that flips this around. Similar to the way you have one to the Left and Right spell lists.</div></div><hr />

That is a great idea, unfortunately right now there is no way for any UI to tell the classes of group members, so that can't be done.<br />

I just posted an optional bank window download on http://www.lodidodi.net that uses a more typical placement of the shared slots. The graphics page (http://www.lodidodi.net/graphics.htm) on that site has a screenshot of both versions. It sounds like you, Hedein, and anyone else that doesn't typically share plat between characters would prefer the optional version.<br />

Thanks for posting your screenshot. It is interesting to see how people set up the windows.<br />
<br />
Zheer-<br />
<br />
I am considering making an &quot;optional download&quot; of the player/group window, adding gauges for group/raid leadership experience. It would require quite a bit of work to shift pieces down to make room, so I'm going to wait to see if other people make the same request to determine if it is worth the effort involved.<br />
<br />
Leegar-<br />
<br />
The casting gauge also appears as a half-gauge under the mana gauge. If that isn't convenient for you either, then check out the FAQ page on my website (www.lodidodi.net) which has instructions on how to bring back the pop-up window with the casting gauge.<br />
<br />
Malys-<br />
<br />
Other folks have requested standalone versions of my spell casting bars, so that is definitely one of the next things on my &quot;to do&quot; list. I hope to find time to do that in the next few days.<br />

I love the UI, esp the horizontal casting bar. Only issue I've encountered is that the casting gauge gets blocked out if I cast spells by clicking in a gem. Would there be any way of moving the text for the mouse-overs a hair or two lower to allow the casting gauge on that bar to show up?<br />

<br />
Looks like SOE screwed things up. Any graphics stored in &quot;.bmp&quot; files don't display correctly, while &quot;.tga&quot; files are fine. That is why even in the default UI there are pink outlines around buffs, because those are from a &quot;.bmp&quot; file. Unfortunately I used &quot;.bmp&quot; files for the majority of my graphics, which is why everything is all messed up.<br />
<br />
I just created Lodi Dodi 2.0.4 which uses all &quot;.tga&quot; files instead of &quot;.bmp&quot; files, fixing the problem. I uploaded it to the download section here, but it will take a bit for the moderators to approve it, so in the meantime it can be downloaded from www.lodidodi.net<br />
<br />
EDIT: The moderators have approved version 2.0.4 and it is available in the download section here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3003).<br />
<br />
I assume SOE will eventually fix this (since it &quot;breaks&quot; the default UI) but if you don't want to wait for them, you can download 2.0.4 and you should be back in business.<br />

Thanks,<br />

Arista's timers (from http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp) should work with my UI if you use windows that I don't modify, such as the Help window.

The next version of the UI will be designed so that each of my windows will work as a standalone. That will also mean you should be able to put other windows from other UIs into my UI without any problems. I can't promise you a specific release date, but I hope to be done in a week or two.<br />

I was just about to post that very same problem.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the Horizontal SpellBar from your website this morning and unzipped it to my Lodi fiolder, overwriting the vertical bar and copying the tga file as well.<br />
<br />
When I load up the UI in EQ I have spellgems but no numbers. <br />
<br />
I was going to fiddle with the XML file later to see if maybe it was an offset issue but wanted to check here for known issues first<br />
<br />
When I get a chance I'll grab a SS of the bar and post it here</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I downloaded the Mar 30 update to the UI initially I just dumped the new files into the old folder and loaded up EQ.  That left the BMP files in place.  At that point I got : <br />
<br />
http://www.buffbish.com/spellbar1_dark.bmp <br />
<br />
When I removed the BMP files altogether, I got this:<br />
<br />
 http://www.buffbish.com/spellbar2_dark.bmp<br />
<br />
Last night, in an effort to clean up my UI folders I deleted all of the old folders and reinstalled a fresh version 2.04, which included no version 2.03 or earlier files at all, unzipped the Horizontal bar into the new folder and when I loaded the UI again it worked perfectly.<br />
<br />
If you're having a problem seeing the numbers you might want to be sure you aren't mixing versions of the UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lodidodi</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is definitely sound advice to delete all your files and download/install the lastest ones if you are having problems.<br />
<br />
For example, the optional horizontal spell bar download includes both an XML and a BMP, so if you use the new XML but leave the old BMP, you won't see the numbers. (Glad you were able to get that working Yelara.) The verical spell bar is a little different, but if you are using different files from different versions for that window or for other windows, there's no telling how those might interact.<br />
<br />
If you're having problems, I'd highly recommend deleting all your Lodi Dodi UI files (including zips) and downloading &amp; installing the lastest versions.<br />

I just created a version of the compass that has a light grey background instead of the black (download at http://www.lodidodi.net/optionalcompass.zip) so that might make the blue line more visible for you if you're using little or no gamma adjustment. Let me know if the grey is too dark or too light, since I'll include this as an optional window in the next version of the UI. On the other hand, if you can't even see the blue line in the default UI, then something else is going on.<br />
<br />
Regarding UI error messages, I just rechecked the latest version of Lodi Dodi (2.0.4) and it didn't result in any errors even after the last patch. I'd suggest making sure you have the latest version of Lodi Dodi along with updated versions of any optional downloads. There shouldn't be any errors caused by the changes they just made to the Options Window since I didn't even customize that window so it is pulling that right from the default directory. (I assume when you said &quot;errors&quot; you meant the &quot;Your XML files are not compatible with...&quot; message when you load the UI, which means the UI may be missing a certain piece in some window, and not the UIErrors.txt file, which will have a &quot;warning&quot; entry for each file that I didn't customize that gets pulled from the default directory, which is normal for any custom UI.)<br />

Curious as to how you resolved your graphics corruption issue.

However, is it possible to make the grey darker? its sorta bright =P and I mean the entire skin - not just the compass. ;)</div></div><hr />

Finally got to try all of the compasses and decided on #3 because the blue Ldon line is clearly visible. I actually liked the gray of #4 better because it is a perfect blend with the rest of the UI but, alas, still couldn't see the blue Ldon line and I also use the lighter gamma setting.  Thank you again for all your attention and speedy response. :) <br />

<br />
I logged in right after the 5/26/04 patch to see what was changed, and I can assure you if the patch had broken my UI, I would have posted a fix that day. But as it was, the only problem was it gave the red XML error text because it could not find the new &quot;Auto-Bank&quot; button, and other than that the UI worked fine. I didn't think the autobank feature was important enough to warrant an immediate fix.<br />
<br />
However it appears I underestimated the enthusiasm of all of you that use the Lodi Dodi UI. :) I received quite a bit of feedback requesting an update (perhaps not realizing that the UI still worked fine even with the XML error message?) and when the next patch occurs I won't make the same mistake of waiting until I post the update.<br />
<br />
Lodi Dodi UI v2.0.5 can be downloaded at http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3003 (Edit: Approved by moderators for download) or http://www.lodidodi.net<br />
<br />
Along with adding the &quot;Auto-Bank&quot; button, I also implemented a suggestion to make the entire left/right sides of the spellbook window function as the left/right page buttons (for those of you that use the buttons rather than the arrow keys to turn the pages).<br />
<br />
Enjoy, and keep the feedback coming,<br />

I haven't customized the bazaar window, therefore it will use the same layout as the default. You probably just need to widen your window since the &quot;Hide All Traders&quot; button was added to the right of the &quot;Find Trader&quot; button.<br />

<br />
thx for your great UI.<br />
<br />
I just a have a question concerning the Hotbutton Window.<br />
Is there any way to change the 4 Clicky Items on the Inventory Page?<br />
<br />
Since i have my Pet Focus Legs in Inventory Slot 8, it would be much easier for me, if the &quot;Range Clicky&quot; would be a &quot;Leg Clicky&quot;( I know that i can take the Legs, click on the &quot;Cloak&quot; Icon, change the Pet Focus Legs with my standard Legs, right click them and so on).<br />
I tried to change this myself, but crashed EQ everytime. *g*<br />
<br />
If it isnt possible without much work for you or me, i can life without it, but that would make the UI perfect for me.<br />

Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lodidodi</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woonie - Personally I think Arista's Timer Mod is the best (http://www.timermod.com/). She recently came out with a new version, and I just tested it and it seems to work fine with the Lodi Dodi UI. I tested a timer in the Help window, but it should work with any window that isn't used by the UI.<br />
<br />
Maenshae - I assume you are talking about the block of four slots (Pri/Sec/Rng/Ammo) that is always visible in the Hot Buttons window no matter if you are on the Bags/Head/Hands/Body tabs. To change the Range slot to Legs, you'll need to make the following changes to the &quot;EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml&quot; file in your Lodi Dodi UI directory.<br />
<br />
Look for this section:<br />
<br />
	&lt;InvSlot item = &quot;LodiDodiHB_SlotRange&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;LodiDodiHB_SlotRange&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;!--&lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt;--&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;86&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;190&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;32&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;32&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;Background&gt;A_LodiDodiHB_SlotMiniRange&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
		&lt;EQType&gt;11&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
		&lt;!--&lt;TooltipReference/&gt;--&gt;<br />
	&lt;/InvSlot&gt;<br />
<br />
Change<br />
<br />
&lt;Background&gt;A_LodiDodiHB_SlotMiniRange&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
<br />
to<br />
<br />
&lt;Background&gt;A_LodiDodiHB_SlotMiniLegs&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
<br />
and also change<br />
<br />
&lt;EQType&gt;11&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
<br />
to<br />
<br />
&lt;EQType&gt;18&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
<br />
Then save the file, and the next time you reload the UI, it should show the Legs slot.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

I wanted to point out a link issue on your www.lodidodi.net site. You have 2 Target ring standalone downloads, one that is for usign your Bright Target rings on a non-Lodi UI and one for a dimmer Target ring for use with your UI. <br />
<br />
The 2 links are reversed. Clicking on the Bright link leads to the dimmed one and clicking on the other one leads to the default bright ring file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greymantle</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also any update to the standalone sections?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the heads up. I switched the links so now they are accurate. :)<br />
<br />
Greymantle-<br />
<br />
I've converted about 95% of the UI to standalone, so I'm just finishing up. Even though the appearance is almost identical to the current version, quite a bit of the XML code was changed behind the scenes, so I've got folks testing it now to try to catch any bugs before I release it out there to everyone. I also added &quot;Health of Target's Target&quot; functionality which needs to be tested. Hold tight, shouldn't be much longer now before version 2.1.0 is released.<br />
<br />
-Lodi Dodi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lodidodi</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, version 2.1.0 has just been released at EQInterface here (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3003) and http://www.lodidodi.net<br />
<br />
Although everything should appear the same as in previous versions, this version is almost a complete rewrite which makes each window function independently. You should now be able to mix &amp; match much easier (copying my windows into other UIs and copying windows from other UIs into my UI). To copy one of my windows to another UI, make sure to copy the XML file (e.g. EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml) as well as the associated TGA file (e.g. lodidodi_hotbutton.tga).<br />
<br />
The downside is since this is a complete rewrite, it is likely some errors were made, and although I tested it as well as I could, please post/email with any bugs you find.<br />
<br />
I've also included all the optional windows in subdirectories of the zip file instead of having them available as separate downloads. To use an optional window, copy the file from the subdirectory into the main directory, overwriting the existing file. Although all of the windows will function as standalones, some have special &quot;Standalone&quot; versions that have been tweaked to use the other UI's graphics in places where I had used my custom graphics.<br />
<br />
I also made the following additions in this version:<br />
<br />
- Added numerical values for Mana &amp; Endurance to the Player/Group window<br />
<br />
- Customized the &quot;Health of Target's Target&quot; window to use the color-changing health gauge. Also created an optional Target window that contains both the Target info and the HoTT info so you don't have to keep bringing up the HoTT window each time.<br />
<br />
- Created optional compasses with lighter backgrounds for those having trouble seeing the blue LDoN indicator on the standard black background<br />
<br />
- Created optional Combat Ability window with only 4 buttons instead of 8<br />
<br />
- Created optional Pet window with no buttons (no Attack/Guard/etc)<br />
<br />
- Created optional vertical Spell Bar window with no text<br />
<br />
Keep the feedback coming and let me know if you find any bugs.<br />

In case you haven't figured it out on your own, the stats were moved off the Inventory window to a new tab I added to the Actions window. Check out www.lodidodi.net for more info and tips about the UI.<br />

My UI doesn't modify the container window, so you must be using someone else's container window (or you have a copy of an old default container window) if your augment piece isn't working. Also I added the &quot;Auto-Bank&quot; button to version 2.0.5 back on 5/31/04. My suggestion would be to delete all the files from your Lodi Dodi UI directory and download/install a fresh copy of the latest version.<br />

As I understand it, that's just the way the ToT window works. However, I made an optional window which adds the ToT info to the Target window, so you don't have to worry about opening then moving the separate ToT window each time. Just copy the file from the subdirectory &quot;Target&amp;Player - Optional - Target &amp; HoTT&quot; to your main Lodi Dodi UI directory and you'll be all set with the combined Target &amp; ToT window, which looks like this:<br />

Please email a screenshot (or a portion of a screenshot showing your spell casting window) to me at kejulotuseater@yahoo.com<br />
<br />
Nobody else has complained about not being able to see the spell casting numbers. And the graphics for the numbers come from the same file as the graphics for the spell gems themselves, so you shouldn't be able to see one but not the other.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the feedback,<br />

Not that I'm slow or anything but I finally figured out my problem. I had the background textures turned off for this window! Since the numbers display is part of the background they wouldn't show up. The spell gems must be set as the foreground so they always did show. Had nothing to do with the alpha setting which is what threw me. Oh well, better late then never! <br />

<br />
I just posted version 2.1.1 of the Lodi Dodi UI which includes the following updates:<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
New Updates in 2.1.1:<br />
<br />
-Added tribute timer to &quot;Info Tab&quot; on Actions Window<br />
<br />
-Added space for 9th spell gem (to be activated in OoW)<br />
<br />
-Created optional buff windows with space for buff slots 16-20 (to be activated in OoW)<br />
<br />
-Created optional buff/song windows with smaller icons<br />
<br />
-Created optional chat window which displays spell casting gauge<br />
<br />
NOTE: Although space has been added for the extra spell gem and extra buff slots, the corresponding text was not added because the EQTypes will not be known until the NDA is lifted. Also note that currently on the live servers, buff slot 20 is displaying a bogus buff icon.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The new version can be downloaded at http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3003 or www.lodidodi.net (http://www.lodidodi.net).<br />
<br />
Note that immediately after OoW is released (or as soon as the NDA is lifted), I will be posting another update that includes text for the new spell gem and buff slots.<br />

I didn't customize the Merchant window so it is just pulling from the default. There should be no problem copying someone else's EQUI_MerchantWnd.xml file into my UI (as long as it was designed to work with other UIs).

Most likely the target arrow portion of the target window is hiding behind another window.<br />
<br />
I have a whole section on this on my FAQ page at www.lodidodi.net. Here is a snippet from that answer:<br />
<br />
If you can't find the arrow, press &quot;ESC&quot; to clear your target, then press &quot;F1&quot; to target yourself, then look for a white arrow. If that doesn't work, try pressing &quot;Alt-T&quot; to toggle the window containing the arrow in case it was closed. <br />
<br />
As a last resort, load the default UI (/loadskin default) and move the target window and the player window to the middle of the screen. Make sure both are visible. (&quot;Alt-T&quot; toggles the target window and &quot;Alt-Y&quot; toggles the player window, unless you've changed the keyboard equivalents in your Options window.) Then load up the Lodi Dodi UI - the target window will become the arrow, and the player window will become my target window. Now you should be able to move them wherever you want them.<br />
Please read the FAQ for all the info.<br />
<br />
Let me know if that works,<br />

<br />
The latest version of the UI (2.1.2) should have a working 9th spell gem. It definitely worked when I tested it on the beta server, and I assume it is working on the live servers as well, since you're the first person to mention a problem with it. Please confirm that you're on 2.1.2 (you can check the readme.txt file in your Lodi Dodi UI folder) and if not, then download the latest version.<br />

I can fix my problem like this but the target arrow will disapear again after a few zone-ins or re-logging in.  It's anoying to have to reset to default constantly and then re-adjust to where I like stuff.  Any ideas?  I can offer one..try making the background of the main box the conned color instead of havig a seperate arrow.<br />
<br />
BTW, I do like the overall interface ALOT!  Good work indeed.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you have some sort of problem with your INI file. Normally, the settings of most of the windows get saved to a file named &quot;UI_Charname_server.ini&quot; (using your character name and server name) every time you make a change to a window. Therefore most windows should remain where you move them. I'm wondering if something is stopping the game from saving your INI file or you are overwriting it with a new copy every time you play? <br />
<br />
Another possibility is that you are putting the con color arrow on top of another window, in which case when you zone the arrow might be ending up behind the other window, so you might just need to press ALT-T a few times to bring that window back to the top so you can see it. To avoid having to do this, I made a &quot;hole&quot; in the other window so you can always see the con arrow, so that's where I recommend putting the con arrow, as seen in this graphic:<br />
http://www.lodidodi.net/target.gif <br />
<br />
And unfortunately your suggestion won't fix the problem, at least not if you want the con color and the flashing attack indicator in the same window. Due to limitations in how Sony programmed things, the con color will only work in the target window, and the flashing attack indicator will only work in the player window, so I need to use combine both parts to make it look like both features are in the same window.<br />

The &quot;standard&quot; buff window you get when you load the Lodi Dodi UI only has 15 buff slots. To get slots 16-20, you'll have to use one of the &quot;optional&quot; buff windows. If you look in your Lodi Dodi UI folder, you should see subfolders named &quot;Buffs&amp;Songs - Optional - 20&amp;6 Slots&quot;, &quot;Buffs&amp;Songs - Optional - 20&amp;6 Slots No Text&quot;, and &quot;Buffs&amp;Songs - Optional - Small Icons&quot;. All of those options include slots 16-20, so just pick one and copy the files from that subfolder into your main Lodi Dodi UI, reload the UI, and you should be all set.<br />

Hehe. Yup, vertical buff/song windows are the next things on my &quot;to do&quot; list. It will be quite a bit of work though, so I can't promise you a specific date when I'll have it done. Hopefully in the next few weeks, depending on how much time I can find to work on it.<br />

Not sure exactly what you're asking. The top gauge of the player/group window is your health (followed by your mana gauge, your endurance/breath gauge, your xp gauge, and your aaxp gauge) so that should always be visible. No need to target yourself to check your current health. Let me know if I misunderstood your question.<br />

 I found it while seeking a usable one for extra buff slots and ended up loving the whole thing :)<br />

I do have one small request (It's not a fix so I understand if you can't help right now). As a soloing rogue sometimes fights can come down to the wire and it is useful to see my HP comparative to the target so I know if I am 'winning' or not. I was wondering if you could give me brief instructions on how to get a player hp bar working in the target window under the target bar - no fancyness needed just normal.<br />

You don't give a lot of detail so I'm not sure what's going on. Your best bet is to follow the instructions from EQInterface's installation FAQ found here (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/faq.php?faq=interface#faq_install). Make sure you are creating a new folder under &quot;uifiles&quot; (named &quot;lodidodi&quot; for example) and not copying my files into the &quot;default&quot; folder. If you still can't figure it out after reading the FAQ, send me a PM and I'll try to help you out.<br />

Right now I'm about to post version 2.1.3, I just need to find some time to finish testing it. No big changes, just some minor tweaks and some new optional windows. It should be a pretty quick job to make an optional target window for you adding a player health gauge (since it basically would be identical to the optional target window I already made that adds the target's target health gauge), so I'll try to get that done and include it as an optional window in 2.1.3.<br />

One lil question since the OoW patch updated version I can't see my breathe window (ya know the lil cute one with bubbles that tells you you're drowning) .. I copied over the old one from the previous version and it works fine, or did you do something sneaky with it and I'm not looking in the right place?<br />

The Lodi Dodi UI totally removes the default breath pop-up window (since I put the breath gauge in the group window as a half-gauge under the endurance gauge). It is fairly easy to bring back the pop-up window by copying the default &quot;/uifiles/default/EQUI_BreathWindow.xml&quot; into your Lodi Dodi folder, but after a reinstall of the Lodi Dodi UI you will lose it again. If you are seeing a &quot;lil cute one with bubbles&quot; then you must have downloaded that from somebody else and copied it into the Lodi Dodi UI. :)<br />
<br />
Glad you enjoy the UI,<br />

I was using the latest version of it, as always, and was typing a message to my raid.  Whether I hit some keys wrong or something, the target window gained a problem.  The target indicator, the arrow, was still on the screen and working correctly.  However, the target &quot;text&quot; box indicating my target and my HoTT (I use the optional version) no longer appeared.<br />
<br />
I have tried:<br />
<br />
1. Reloading the UI from the same files.<br />
2. Camping out of EQ and coming back.<br />
3. Rebooting the cpu.<br />
4. Deleting the entire Lodi UI folder and reinstalling.<br />
5. Deleting the entire Lodi UI and default UI folder and reinstalling.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this issue and have a possible fix for it?<br />
<br />
I was able to finish my raid by coping all files related to the target window from the default UI into the Lodi UI and reloading it.  However, doing this made the target window only show target with the text &quot;Target&quot; shown.  HoTT window had to be pulled manually, but it had the text for the window as well.<br />

What appears to be my &quot;Target&quot; Window actually consists of two pieces: the actual target window (which is the /con color arrow piece) and the player window (which has the target name &amp; health gauge, and HoTT info if you use the optional version). It has to be that way to get the /con color arrow and the flashing attack mode indicator in the same window.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure what happened to you is you toggled the player window portion. It probably saves the state (visible or hidden) in your .ini file which is why none of the steps you took solved the problem. I bet if you press Alt-Y to toggle the player window again, it will bring it back for you.<br />

Two possibilities come to mind:<br />
<br />
1. If you can right-click the spellbook but saving a new spell set has no effect, you might have your maximum number of spell sets saved. I think it only lets you save ten spell sets but I'm not 100% on that.<br />
<br />
2. If you can't right-click on any of your windows, open up the Options Window, and under the General Tab, there should be a button to toggle &quot;Allow Context Menus&quot;.  That is what turns off the right-click functionality in any UI, whether Lodi Dodi or the default.<br />

1. The &quot;Unshared Plat&quot; slot is exactly that, it is the regular plat slot for that player only. I moved the shared plat slot to where the regular plat slot normally is. (Note the shared slots are tinted yellow.) If you prefer a more typical placement, there is an optional Bank window (in the &quot;Bank&quot; subfolder) that has the shared plat slot in the normal spot. See www.lodidodi.net for more info.<br />
<br />
2. Any timer I would make would pale in comparison to Arista's timers at www.timermod.com so I recommend customizing hers to meet your needs and copying it into my UI.<br />

Ssmokey-<br />
<br />
Your vertical right-side buff window should look something like this:<br />
http://www.lodidodi.net/buffs-vert-right.gif <br />
If you aren't seeing the number blocks to the right, 1) make sure you are copying all 3 files from the optional subdirectory, and 2) right-click the window and select Background&gt;Texture to make sure you haven't toggled off the background of the window. (Right-clicking the vertical buff window is a little tricky, you have to click exactly on the one-pixel wide line that separates the number blocks. It might be easier to &quot;/loadskin default&quot;, toggle the Background&gt;Texture, then reload the Lodi Dodi UI.)<br />

<br />
I assume when you say &quot;...cant seem to get The new buff bar...&quot; you mean you want to use a buff window that has 20 buff slots.<br />
<br />
The standard buff window has 15 slots, to get the 20 slots you need to use one of the optional windows. In your lodidodi folder there should be a subfolder called &quot;Buffs&amp;Songs&quot;. Under that there are a couple different versions, including &quot;Optional - Horizontal 20&amp;6 Slots&quot;. Go into that subfolder, copy those XML files into your main lodidodi folder, then reload the UI and you'll have 20 buff slots.<br />

<br />
I don't think I'll be able to take the time to make a longer target window, as I don't see it really adding any functionality and it goes against a main principle behind the Lodi Dodi UI which is compactness. Feel free to fiddle around with the XML files yourself, it is actually the &quot;EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml&quot; you'll need to modify, due to the fact that window is actually the Player &amp; Target windows combined. To do it right, not only will you need to make the window wider and the target name longer, but you'll also have to adjust the width of the various background pieces. (Unfortunately that window is fairly complex in order to get the flashing border where I wanted it, working around limitations in the way Sony programmed it.)<br />
<br />
Kerir-<br />
<br />
Now that I created optional vertical buff windows, I realized I do need to create a horizontal version of the Selector Window, just like you mentioned. Hopefully I can find the time to code it and test it soon, and then I guess I'll post that as part of a new version of the UI.<br />

Love the UI!  Great job!<br />
<br />
Quick question...  If I wanted to use, say, the purple marble tablets ui graphics with the Lodidodi UI, would I simply need to change the names of the .tga files to include the &quot;lodidodi&quot; at the beginning of them, or is there more involved with it?</div></div><hr />

Glad you like the UI. Unfortunately, my graphics files are different from the Tablets graphics files so copying them over won't work. What I need to do to make a different &quot;purple theme&quot; is to go through all my graphics files and tint all the grey pieces purple. This has always been on my &quot;to do&quot; list but I have not had the time to work on it. I have just finished some minor tweaks that will be released as version 2.1.5 very shortly, with no other tweaks on the horizon, so the next thing I plan to work on is creating the different graphics &quot;themes&quot; (probably just blue/green/purple/red versions in addition to the current grey).<br />

<br />
Just an FYI that I posted a new version of the UI. There are only two minor tweaks:<br />
<br />
-Created optional Selector Window with horizontal layout<br />
<br />
-Switched standard/optional Buff Windows, now horizontal 20 slots is standard, horizontal 15 slots is optional<br />
<br />
However I did also post 3 new screenshots:<br />
<br />
1. 1152x864 with Standard Windows<br />
2. 1152x864 with Optional Windows<br />
3. 1024x768 with Standard Windows except Optional Vertical Buffs/Songs<br />
<br />
Enjoy,<br />

When I right click the chat windows and click on the scroll bar option to remove the scroll bar on the window, I have noticed that inadertently scrolling my mouse wheel while the cursor is in a chat window without a scroll bar causes my computer to lock up.<br />
<br />
The only fix is to shut off my computer and restart EQ. I have decided not to use the NoScrollBar option in chat windows now, but wonder if this is a problem with the UI or just with me?</div></div><hr />
