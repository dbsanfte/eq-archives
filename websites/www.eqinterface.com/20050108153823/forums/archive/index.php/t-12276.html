<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Everlast</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya, I would like to get some suggestion on what I should look for uprading my PC for better EQ performance, the main concern for me is need more fast and smooth framerates. All models on and above 1024x768 res.<br />
<br />
Current PC rig.<br />
P4 2.4Gb<br />
1gig ddr ram (PC2700 i think)<br />
Asus P4B533 (only support up to 4x agp tho)<br />
G4 Ti4200 128 ram (only up to 4x agp)<br />
30gig Harddisk<br />
Cable connection<br />
Default UI<br />
<br />
I know my PC is not too bad for now, but It still can't handle well when I'm raiding with 70+ ppls in planes, I have to set all new models off, texture quality set to low, no spell effects, no sound, show name off etc etc... Its sad, even though, I minimize all those settings but still having grachics lag(very low framerates)... :(<br />
<br />
I think i should look for a better video card, or maybe get a new mobo too? But for a student, I don't have too much choice, can't afford too expensive model tho :( Therefore, I would like to hear some suggestion on which part I should upgrade, Thanks in advice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what youe set up looks like upgrading is not gonna help much.<br />
I went from a system that was 256meg vidcard and 2 gigs of ram on a 3.2 gig P4 down to a machine about the same as yours and I have not had any perfomace differences PoK is still as laggy when a lot of people. <br />
<br />
So I think for now not much you can do about the lag :( <br />
Might want to try a lower resolution for the Raids though i found that helps a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: In response to the above poster.<br />
<br />
Just upgraded today p4 3.2, geforce 5950, 2G ddr400. With 600 people in the bazaare I had minimal chop and nowhere else even caused so much as a flicker (not even that stupid vortex in timea).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">martini_thief</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In about 6mo to early 05' All new Types of things are going to change ( New P5 coming out, ATX form factors will be the new BTX form factor, and even a new windows OS &quot;Longhorn&quot; in early 05). So if you can wait for the new Mobo's chips, ram, ect to come out then wait. Your system should do fine. Update ALL your hardware, and system drivers, then go buy a top shelf CPU, FSB, RAM, and GPU cooling system (a lot less then a full up grade) Call a friend who knows how to overclock w/ out killing things =) or even better spend a day learning how your self. you should be able to get close to a 3.0ghz w/  3200 ram speed, also it will speed up the FSB to about 1ghz, and your GPU's speed too. In the end you'll spend WAY less time and money. <br />
<br />
However, if you a rich student (is there such a thing?) I would start by upgrading your Mobo to a 875 or &quot;Canterwood&quot; board, don't go cheep on the mobo you really get what you pay for. Also the 5600 nvidia is a mid level card that should be more then enough (if you have $500 grab a ATI 9800) Another thing is since EQ is SOOO large a faster HD will help, Finding a Raid 0 SATA set up with 10,000rpm + and a 8mb cache will be a nice step up (and will still be in use with the new systems). Dual channel DDR is super fast and will feed your CPU all it wants and more look for the 4200 ddr2 ram (hard to find look on www.pricewatch.com) for uber status. If youhave a lame sound sound card .. throw it out the window, buy a SB Audigy plat pro. Make sure your Modem is hardware and not software run, Software modems use your CPU for help where as a Hardware Modem does not.  <br />
<br />
Make sure you Defrag weekly, and clean out all the programs, movies, mp3s, windows tools and anything else you don't use anymore. Also stop anything from booting up w/ windows that does not HAVE to be there.  <br />
<br />
With those overclocks, or updates, you will be able to play even EQ2 with every option and max make-me-cry-its-so-beautiful setting turned on.<br />
<br />
PS send me all the stuff you no longer need.. I could use it =p <br />
<br />
Any questions or if you think I full of crap ... jace@deluxe.net &amp; GL</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might want to look at upgradeing to a gforce 5900 ultra or a ATI 9800 pro/xt.<br />
<br />
I choose a gforce 5900 ultra 256 and get very little lag on raids with about 50+ people at 1600x1200 with medium particle effects. However the ATI 9800 works very well too.<br />
<br />
My main system specs. might help you get some ideas too.<br />
<br />
P4 3.0ghz (OC'd 3.6ghz)<br />
2gig Dual channel ddr ram pc3800<br />
Abit IC7-G (FSB OC'd to 1ghz)<br />
PNY Verto GeForce FX 5900 Ultra 256mb (OC'd core:483 memory:939)<br />
SoundBlaster Audigy Gamers Edition<br />
boot drive :: 37gb WD Raptor 10k rpm SATA<br />
etc....</div></div><hr />
