Remeber to take the .txt attachment off before pasting it in your mod folder.<br />
<br />
PS how silly is it you can't post XML files to a forum all about modding XML files for other people to use?<br />

<br />
I had the camera directly above me, looking down at an angle, and i seldom had to click more than once to target anything, plus it gave me a feeling of being really tall. This was a pretty long time ago though, and they only kept the camera that way for one patch, then put it back like it was...<br />
<br />
Oh well, It was fun while it lasted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its now and has been for a while,  possible to   reposition the camera any way you like <br />
<br />
what you do is press ALT  then  numeric pad<br />
<br />
alt 1  i believe moves camera back<br />
alt 7 forwards<br />
alt 8  move camera up<br />
alt 2 camera down<br />
alt 9 tilts camera forwards<br />
alt 3 tilts it backwards<br />
<br />
<br />
do not quote me on those keys, just experiment, trust me, you can make the camera be anywhere really<br />
<br />
and that coupled with all the different types of camera mode we now have,    follow from behind, etc<br />
<br />
lot easier</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't believe there's a way to see the technical name of the mod (i.e. a_decaying_skeleton_01). The only access we have to things like that is through EQTypes and the only EQType related to target name just shows you the roleplay name (a decaying skeleton). <br />

Mine does.  you need to use the label though.  I guess it's not that good an example because I targetted myself but you can see my target bar here (http://dm-mt.dynu.com/DM/geddineui.asp)</div></div><hr />
