<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isserlie</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I’m not exactly sure how this happened but there are 2 files in the HOTBUTTON category with the same name<br />
<br />
EQUI_HotButtonWnd.zip  <br />
<br />
The first one is the first page and was designed by Brimztone.  The other is on the last page and was designed by Atheenath Dawns.  Although Brimztone’s is very nice, it is too big for my purpose and it alters my inventory.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately both times that I tried to load the Dawns skin, it was the Brimztone one that kept ending up in my directory and hence in the game.  I have tried downloading it both from the individual information sheet and from the general listing of all hot button skins.<br />
<br />
Could someone please help me figure this out – it might be as simple as not having 2 of the same name  - or maybe a re-education of this computer challenged druid.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />

Trying to figure out how this happened since it’s suppose to check the filename to make sure there isn’t two of the same.</div></div><hr />
