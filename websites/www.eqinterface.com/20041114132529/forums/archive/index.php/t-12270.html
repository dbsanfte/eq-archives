<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its been more than a year since I created the Caleal2 UI and I have only had to do small updates as patches caused error messages to display. The UI hasn't failed to work in all that time.<br />
<br />
I don't play anymore, havn't in about 10 months, but my account is still active.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for feedback from past/present/future users of the UI about what enhancments, changes and new things people would like to have in it.<br />
<br />
I won't be doing a huge facelift to it, but I will considder small format and functionality changes, as well as adding some optional items.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

There is no tab on the stats/player widow at all and it doesn't come up in the bar of menus either.  Mabey just me, or possibly something was altered since you've last checked to make this incompatible.<br />
<br />
I REALLY love the LOOK of your UI, its basic yet SOOOO functional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to update the screenshot. The last time I dropped the pet window mod.<br />
<br />
The UI uses the default pet window, or any custom one you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghismonda</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My humble opinions, since you asked for them:<br />
<br />
+  keep the pet window mod, it works well for the tabs, but having the new &quot;pet buffs&quot; feature would be nice<br />
<br />
+ integrate combat discipline windows into the layout, options for a 4-button hybrid and 8-button melee version would be grand, and (as I suggested in another thread, sorry for the cross-posting) utilizing the empty space marked &quot;park timers here&quot; would be my personal preference<br />
<br />
+ although it doesn't bother me, an optional target window that does not include the ticking timer might be appreciated by some who can't find a use for it<br />
<br />
I love your UI, Caleal!  I was very disappointed to hear that you had quit EQ, but was overjoyed to read that you're still supporting your UI.  Hats off to you, and thanks for the hard work!</div></div><hr />
