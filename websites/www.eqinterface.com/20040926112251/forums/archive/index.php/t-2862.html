<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weredragon</div><div class="date">10-12-2002, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before I posted, I found out that the game cannot cope with any tga file properly if &gt; 256 by 256 I corrected that and still got that picture. After a good's night rest, I learned some more information: if you put the wrong size in for the TextureInfo field, no matter what size the picture, it is going to be scaled.<br />
<br />
Basically the problem that I had was that the texture's size was 320 by 256, and the textureinfo field had it at 256 by 256.  correction was to reduce the images real size to match (since it was &gt; 256 in width</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mallus</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe (not positive, just my interpretation of one of the tutorials posted here) that the restriction on tga files is actually that the dimensions need to be powers of two, rather than any actual size restriction.<br />
<br />
So while 320x256 doesn't work, 512x256 would work.<br />
<br />
Thanks for pointing me to the gimp editor in the other thread, btw.</div></div><hr />
