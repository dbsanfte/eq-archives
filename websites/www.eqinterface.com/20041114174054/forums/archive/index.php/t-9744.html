<br />
I am useing Tinkfu's code launching, (allows me to modify and patch the GUI alot easier and faster) :see screenshot:<br />
<br />
I will post screenshots once I get another EverQuest account, till then I just have to picture the UI in my head :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
think of it as a cross of FU, GEOS, and Solaria<br />
<br />
Lunix1<br />
&lt;!-- Built on code from the following GUIs--&gt;<br />
FU 7.19.220<br />
GEOS Alpha 6<br />
Solaria pb 2.0<br />
&lt;!-- More GUIs and GUIminiMods will be given credit closer to release --&gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not Tinkfu, Tinkfu is not my name.  For the name Tinkfu is not the correct name to address me by becuase it is not my name.  If you were to address me by the name Taleisin then that would be correct, for my name is Taleisin and I will only be addressed by that name which is Taleisin.<br />
  And furthur more it is not Tinkfu in control of FU it is I who is in control of the FU.  Taleisin who is not Tinkfu shall control the FU alone, which is to say, without Tinkfu and without Tinkfu shall I control the FU.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinkfu</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been following this thread for about... say 4 to 5 minutes now, and I just want to say that Taleisin is Taleisin and I am Tinkfu.. Taleisin is only in control untill I get back from vacation in a few years.  <br />
<br />
so please call him Taleisin, I would hate for him to use the name Tinkfu and ruin my chaotic nature with his dull sense of humor and lack typing skills j/k :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the first basic graphics test I did tonight didn't turn out well, :as you can see from the screenshot:<br />
<br />
so I am not sure where I am going from this point, the graphics in the screenshot took me 5 days alone, redoing them is going to be hell. Anyway, I hope this doesn't ruin anyones interest in Lunix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steppin</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This looks SHARP.. and CLEAN ....<br />
I got the linix buffs and really enjoy them..  they seem to be smooth.. lag free ....  would like to see a SDB that matches your main buffs   :)<br />
<br />
The screen cap you just posted looks great also...   the text looks EASY to read (for us with bad vision, that's sure a plus)!<br />
You've done a good job here  :)  thanks !<br />
<br />
steppin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, I could add a SDbuff window to the Lunix buff window, but it would be the same that you can find in FU666 as well as several other peoples UIs..  I'll consider putting it in.<br />
<br />
as for the above screenshot, that was to show how badly the graphics for the borders and buttons did on first test, the rest is the default UI..  but thank you for supporting Lunix :-)<br />
<br />
on this link on this post is the additional SD buff window that matches LunixBuff, I think since it is small posting it here is better than updating the whole buffwindow in the downloads area.....  for now anyhow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">incase anyone is wondering why the version numbering is so strange on FU as well as Lunix I've prepared a little chart (ie* I was bored this morning)<br />
<br />
Enjoy :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lunix has been given a great gift, thanks to Talyns and his Tablets Future Grey interface; he is allowing me to take some bits from his interface http://www.egri.co.uk/smileys/assimilate.gif and use them in Lunix.<br />
<br />
so I would expect to see Lunix launching closer to november now instead of march like I was planing.<br />
<br />
 why is there such a jump in the timetable you ask?  Didn't I ever tell you?  I can't draw worth a @%*#</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why so long?! If I put my nose to the grindstone I can spit out a whole UI in less than a week (if I'm in charge of creative control and have all the graphics I'm gonna chop up and use). And my stuff isn't trash either, it's real quality stuff, so I don't get what you could possibly be doing that'd take that long to complete.<br />
<br />
Enok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the november date is just becuase I like to give myself a large margin of error, I lost the first Lunix... it's on a floppy somewhere..  I'll probably have Lunix ready alot sooner than november, but if you want a list here ya go :-)<br />
<br />
reasons for long wait<br />
<br />
1. I am learning XML as I go<br />
<br />
2. I only have about 30 minutes a day to learn and write the UI<br />
<br />
3. becuase I couldn't draw (solved)<br />
<br />
4. I learn slowly<br />
<br />
5. I don't have a EQ account to test these on so I have to use a XML praisers just to make sure the code is good.<br />
<br />
6. I'm still fighting Tinkfu over useing his bit code launcher http://www.egri.co.uk/smileys/starwars.gif <br />
<br />
<br />
yup that looks like a good list :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh! I like lists. Here I go!<br />
<br />
1. I can sorta understand this, but XML is so easy, it takes like a week or two of modding before it becomes second nature to writing english.<br />
<br />
2. Ok, that really hurts development speed. Have a few hours is much less restrictive.<br />
<br />
3. I totally sympathize with this...<br />
<br />
4. Oh. Well maybe this explains number 1...<br />
<br />
5. K, now this one baffles me. Why are you making an EQ UI?<br />
<br />
6. Stab him in the eye and run off with his code. Just kidding... =D<br />
<br />
So, in conclusion, you don't have much time to work on this. Or EverQuest... what the heck.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - But keep on truckin'. The more stuff people make, the more stuff I have to rip off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have watched Tinkfu play EQ since '98  I got addicted to second hand EQ, I also love to write interfaces, *I made a few mods to the original cpp interface, gave tinkfu and map some timers and other such things*<br />
<br />
in reality I haven't played 1 minute of EQ, but I am to addicted to just drop it all together (at least untill Sigil Releases their game)<br />

and 7. I haven't been feeling well lately http://www.egri.co.uk/smileys/throwup.gif<br />

you have stabed Tinkfu for 5000 points<br />

Now since then I have the basic coding complete my delay has been completely based on graphics, I wanted Lunix to be beautiful as well as functional.  I have reworked this idea of mine and have now decided to create and release Lunix Pro for EQ1 and later release Lunix Home for EQ2.<br />
<br />
   Lunix Pro being a mainly function over beauty, and Lunix Home being a work of art.<br />

<br />
second reason, I have discovered a way to make the buttons of one window work in another (still unstable) for right now I am going to call the system HotLinking</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">love the crying face Shadrak.  Though looking at the hordes of people who use FU as well as LunixBuff (all 3 of them) it occurs to me that no one really wants a UI that I nor Tinkfu offer (a uncluttered with laggy graphics UI), yes I did learn modding the EQUI from Tinkfu, and I have tryed to following the path of the FU, but it just isn't working out.  Perhaps Tinkfu was right, <br />
{Last Sunday, around tea time, messhall, Fu Labs}<br />
Master Tinkfu The Gearless: You know, all that I have tryed to do with FUUI and other FU products has been in vain, no one needs a basic mainly text interface anymore they are just as happy with a UI that adds half a minute to thier zoning time, as long as it has gears and blows steam off the spellbar<br />
<br />
Taleisin The Seer: There are those out there who still want a simple, text based UI.<br />
<br />
Master Tinkfu The Gearless: Name one.<br />
<br />
Taleisin The Seer: Me.<br />
<br />
Master Tinkfu The Gearless: you don't count.<br />
<br />
Cindy &amp; Nails: WE DO!!!<br />
<br />
Master Tinkfu The Gearless: go back to your EQOA you traitors.<br />
<br />
(On The Phone) Maeldrew Maelfu: FU19 is broken and I got a PoG Raid tonight.<br />
<br />
Taleisin The Seer (talking on the Phone): email me your UIerrors.txt and UIProbeoutput.txt<br />
hang up<br />
Master Tinkfu The Gearless: so you going to be able to handle the proddies this week without me an` Cindy?<br />
<br />
Taleisin The Seer: yeah they shouldn't be able to phase me long as I have my claritinD<br />
<br />
Master Tinkfu The Gearless: hey, yeah about that...  I forgot to get the prescription refilled<br />
<br />
Taleisin The Seer: ...<br />
<br />
Master Tinkfu The Gearless: tal??<br />
<br />
Taleisin The Seer: *eye twitches* ... I'll be ok, just bring me something when you get back from dallas.<br />
<br />
<br />
it went on from there but you get the jist of it.  I'll be trying once more to create a UI to my likeing but it is not easy to please someone seeking perfection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok so here is the basic idea for what I am going to remake Lunix into..  a browser<br />
<br />
default size would be 1280x1024 and up from there<br />
<br />
sorry I don't have any screens ready yet so you will have to sorta imagine this<br />
<br />
:title bar: &lt;Includes&gt;Character Health, Mana, Fatigue, XP and AAXP<br />
<br />
:Standard Buttons Bar: All of the Selector buttons, Target health, hotbutton window (horizontal)<br />
<br />
:Address bar: Compass, Casting Bar, Casting &amp; breath Gauges, group bars<br />
<br />
:Body: EQviewport<br />
<br />
:Bottom of Window: Chat<br />
<br />
:Right window: Buff and SDBuff Icons (shrunk to half size)<br />
<br />
and that would be it, I would appreciate any feedback on this idea, and I am taking recommendations on medication  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellyana</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds very nice. lets see  something :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this version is going smooth and fast, I nearly have it ready to give everyone a screencap of it..  but there is one thing I want my fan to help me decide<br />
<br />
the AAXP on most windows is the same colour as the XP bar, I want to make it a different colour so it can be easly sorted from the XP bar..  but I need to pick a colour so here is a small sample of what it would look like starting with the normal colour up top down to some dark green.<br />
<br />
please give opinions..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok and here is a unskined unfinished screenshot that gives you the basic idea, I still have to rework the target, hotbutton, selector, Actions, compass and pet but thats about it.  Then I start on the slow part, skining it, so it doesn't look like this when I am finished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kedrin027</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like the teal 3rd one down</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok here is a better idea.<br />
<br />
:Poll:<br />
<br />
Should I include a mods folder with all the colours of the rainbow for this gauge?<br />
<br />
&lt;!-- Short List of Items not to Appear in Lunix2 --&gt;<br />
<br />
1. Timers, any Timers (becuase you can never make them the right time for everyone)<br />
<br />
2. HotLinks (this idea isn't paning out well I'll post the code later if anyone wants to take a crack at it<br />
<br />
3. Velious Version, (Seos beat me to the Velious remake, as you know I first tryed to create it with the help of Tinkfu under the NextGen name of GEOS)<br />
<br />
4. The Divine Casting Gauge (it was really one of those &quot;just to see if it works&quot; sorta things)<br />
<br />
5. Tinkfu's little easter eggs he put in all versions of FU (Shield with FU on them, SpellIcons for strenght buffs where he added a &quot;Mother&quot; tatoo, etc.)<br />
<br />
6. the FU7spellgem&amp;Icons (they make the download to large)<br />
<br />
7. Vertical Casting Gauge (made the game far to laggy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should I include a mods folder with all the colours of the rainbow for this gauge?<br />
No, just pick a color and stick with it. I use a color between the orange of the exp gauge and the yellow of the stamina gauge.<br />
<br />
. HotLinks (this idea isn't paning out well I'll post the code later if anyone wants to take a crack at it<br />
Yeah post the code cause I have no idea what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
Enok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here is the idea behind hotlinking.<br />
<br />
say you have your<br />
<br />
EQUI_SelectorWindow.xml<br />
<br />
and you want to put it's buttons in your player window<br />
<br />
EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml<br />
<br />
what I was thinking is you could add<br />
<br />
&lt;?xml version = &quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br />
&lt;XML ID = &quot;EQInterfaceDefinitionLanguage&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Composite&gt;<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_SelectorWindow.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
&lt;/Composite&gt;<br />
    &lt;Schema xmlns = &quot;EverQuestData&quot; xmlns:dt = &quot;EverQuestDataTypes&quot;/&gt;<br />
<br />
to the top of the player window.<br />
<br />
copy the buttons from the selector window into the player window and arange them where you want them.<br />
<br />
I thought it would fool the gameclient into thinking it is still the selector window but so far it hasn't worked.<br />
<br />
Hope you can figure this one out Enok :-)<br />
<br />
*anyone like the idea of All HotPink gauges?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah yes, I tried this a long time ago trying to get the auto-equip box into ANY other window. But no matter how I tried, I couldn't get it to work. I'm quite sure this does not work.

I made the save vs. vertical, I hope that is what you were talking about.<br />
<br />
Fixed Steppin's picky little spelling errors she found.  wont be making the background darker though..<br />
<br />
Another change for Stepping, Icons are on the right Text on the left.</div></div><hr />

found one error in spelling ...<br />
on STR    it's spelled STREIGHT ...  should be STRENGTH<br />
<br />
and i LOVE the way you set up the resists.. they are EASY to see !<br />
<br />
on Buff part..   wonder if making the blue background a little darker would make the white text of buff names easier to read ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to Sokol, I am not able to correct the graphical errors I ran accross when I created the backgrounds for each gauge..  redoing my graphics however will take some time, so I will be putting those on my beta1 list in on time (October 1st) but everyone on beta 2 will be let in October 20th.  No beta 3 is planed since it should be ready for release shortly after the 30th of October.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">small full preview.. yes I had to go back on alot of the windows.. becuase the graphics didn't take right.. and some in the screenshot aren't taking to their windows right.. but this gives you a idea how small it will be.. this was taken in 1280x968 the Lunix UI took only 110 pixels off the top..  small no? :-)<br />
<br />
anyway graphics look bad becuase I am the one doing them.. my last character sketch did however pull out of the stick figure form and into the dressed stick figure form :-)<br />
<br />
I can't really say when I will be posting beta but I decided it would be easier and alot more people would be happy if I made it open beta.. so it will be open beta  whenever I can make it look right.. till then enjoy the screenshot :-)<br />
