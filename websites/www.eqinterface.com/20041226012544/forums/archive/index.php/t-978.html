<br />
And thanks again for your wonderful mod ;)<br />
<br />
I am currently tweaking it a bit to suit my Monkly self, and I modified your basic Player Window to replace the Strength by the Weight, simply by changing the EQType.<br />
<br />
It works fine, but I was wondering if i could ask for a small favour?<br />
<br />
Since I am a really horrible artist, and I just love your other icons, would it be possible for you to design a nice little Weight icon for me? Maybe some scales for example...<br />
<br />
I think I can then do a little Copy-Paste to put it in your TGA files. :D<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

  I too have a request to make.  I tried doing this on my own the other day, but it didn't seem to work.  Is there any way you could add an auto-equip area to the inventory or hot keys area?  It doesn't have to be real big, but it's extremely hard when I'm constantly foraging and have to manually search through my bags to find the right container and then to add them too the stack.  Yes, I'm lazy and yes, I'm whining.  =)  Anything you could do about this would be much appreciated.<br />
