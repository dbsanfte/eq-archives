I've been using a custom window_pieces01.tga file in a customized UI which I've grown rather fond of. However, with the changes wrought by LDoN,  I seem to need help in modifying this file. They have added 3 question marks to the bottom right quarter of the image.  Apparently, you can't simply cut/paste into it to add new elements and expect it to work. =(<br />
I've attached a zip file with both the custom version and the new default version in it, so you can see what I'm talking about.<br />
My question is how would you go about adding the new question marks to the custom file, using Photoshop 5.5? Step-by Step directions would be appreciated, as I  am pretty much a newbie when it comes to the details of graphics files and their manipulation. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

If anyone is willing to help the file is attached, Thank you in advance</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">geijin</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The title says it all. What program do I use to create .tga art?<br />
I have photoshop 5.5, MGI photoshop, Painter 5, and Irfan 3.80.<br />
All of these seem capable of manipulating the .tga format, but EQ dosen't see the art the same way I create it.<br />
<br />
To better explain my problem, I have been trying to change the background on a T.King Draco to add in some custom art. I can get it looking the way I wish in photoshop. My other art programs show it correctly, but EQ either sees it as it used to be, ( when I cut and past ) or it sees it compleatly corrupted, with no transparencies. (  when I start new and add in what I want  )</div></div><hr />
