Wow nice I like it :nana: I really like the Mav_UI_Mods_10_16 but I like the way the buffs are in Mav_UI_Mods2.1. I like to see the name of the buffis there and easy way you could do that? If not no big deal im going to use it with my Druid becuase it the best setup i have seen. Nice job really like them:D</div></div><hr />

The bluring out is something VI has coded in the Animations dealing with tabbed pages somewhere.  I made a 1/2 a$$ attempt to find it one day and disable it, but I didn't locate it.</div></div><hr />

I wish I could take the credit for the Gold trim and Ivy, but all the credit goes to Sylverpaws.  I ran across the skin in the Complete UI section of downloads.  Sylverpaws has several others there that are just as nice.</div></div><hr />

To be able to use the Buff Window from Rev 2 with Rev 1 you need to replace the EQUI_Animations.xml and EQUI_BuffWindow.xml files in Rev 1 with the ones that are in Rev 2.</div></div><hr />

I get an error message when trying to load it, and then loads the default skin. Any Ideas or suggestions?  <br />
<br />
What is the Error message?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanthas</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Message just says: error while attempting to load (whatever I named the skin) and will load default skin. Says it everytime I zone too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, try deleting the folder the UI is in, emptying the recycle bin then Download and extract the latest one I have posted into a new folder.<br />
<br />
Don't copy any files from default into the UI folder, EQ will pull any missing files from default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanthas</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the error was wmd.xml</div></div><hr />
