<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barix</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been reading several of the newsgroups and been trying several things on my own but have not come up with any quick fixes to solve my problem..<br />
<br />
I like using my eq window at the highest resolution possible which on my computer i can crank it up to 1600Xwhatever...  But with the new interfaces in order to see related windows and read the font stored in them is impossible at this resolution i find myself reducing it to 800x600 in order to used assoicated windows, but doing this i lose my viewing area..<br />
<br />
I have noticed from reading newgroups that i can go into each and every file with an assoicated font command and change them to another type or size, this is a bit more than i can handle with my programming skills..  <br />
<br />
before u say u can use the command /chatfont #..  im not talking about that window..  I speaking of windows such as the hot box inv, and so on..<br />
<br />
so if someone could help me out i would app. it thanks..  maybe a skin can be designed with the bigger boxes and fonts in them<br />
<br />
thx<br />
