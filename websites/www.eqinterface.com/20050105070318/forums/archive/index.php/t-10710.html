<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whity</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if it´s possible to make a program (the developers of eqgui.com), for a noob like me to work on ui files for your own.<br />
With that I mean that if there is some kind of program that you could download or something so that unexperienced people like myself could make ui files for their own.<br />
I read the how to make your own ui files forum, but it is pretty complicated to me :(<br />
So therefor my question, would that be possible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Between a combination of SidlWidl, Word, and sheer &quot;ah well, so what if it messes up, I'll just try again&quot;, I went from knowing absolutely nothing (I mean nothing!!) about SIDL and coding and .tga and ... to ... well, not necessarily knowing very much more, but enough to be able to mess around, and to figure out what problems folks are having and (generally) how to fix it.<br />
<br />
I swear by SidlWidl.  And from everything I've heard, Sidl Fiddle is equally good.  If you are like me, looking at pure (text) code, you can't &quot;see&quot; what the finished product will look like.  Using those programs, and you can &quot;see&quot; it.  Made all the difference in the world for me.<br />
<br />
Mostly though, I've found the best way is for you to just jump in.  Make backups of everything you (successfully) do, so that when you change things and something doesn't work, you can revert to your saved one, and try try again.<br />
<br />
Good luck. :)</div></div><hr />
