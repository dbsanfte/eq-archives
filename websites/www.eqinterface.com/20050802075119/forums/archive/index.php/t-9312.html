<br />
Current version is:  Live 2005-07-13 13:31:27<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a conversion of the Lucy spell database created/provided by http://lucy.allakhazam.com.  Mostly it was for myself, but it got so handy I decided maybe other people would like it too.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions of comments feel free to post here :) <br />
<br />
One question I get asked a lot is..<br />
<br />
Q: I extracted this but it's not working.  What did I do wrong?<br />
A: When extracting the files, you need to make sure you preserve the stored folder names.  What this translates to in WinZip is picking &quot;Extract...&quot; from the &quot;Actions&quot; menu and checking the &quot;Use Folder Names&quot; box.  You need to type in the name of your Everquest\Storyline folder also; for me, that would be &quot;c:\program files\everquest\storyline&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you are using some other zip program I don't know what to tell you other than make sure you preserve the stored folder names.  When you have extracted things correctly, you should see the following items in your Everquest/Storyline folder: a file named storyFoofySpells.txt a folder named foofy a TON of files in the foofy folder named things like abc fxq bbq etc<br />
If you are still having trouble, try using the Windows &quot;Search&quot; or &quot;Find&quot; command to look for a file on your hard drive called &quot;storyGrobb.txt&quot;; this is one of the story files that is part of EQ, FoofySpells needs to be extracted into this folder.  When installed correctly, you will see a file &quot;storyFoofySpells.txt&quot; and a folder &quot;foofy&quot; in the same folder with &quot;storyGrobb.txt&quot;.<br />
<br />
Here's another one..<br />
<br />
Q: Why don't your New &amp; Changed indexes match up with the things Lucy says are &quot;new&quot; and &quot;changed&quot;?<br />
A: Lucy calls a spell changed if even one field in the spell data changes.  Things like &quot;spell icon&quot;  or &quot;unknown180&quot; changing is enough to flag it changed.  FoofySpells only reports a change for a field that is displayed by FoofySpells.  Since it doesn't show things like &quot;spellicon&quot; or &quot;unknown176&quot;, changes to those fields in the spell data aren't counted as changes in FoofySpells.<br />
<br />
enjoy!<br />

03/11/05 - updated to Live 2005-03-17 10:31:08, has DoN info, haven't been playing eq and saw people wanted an update, my accounts are inactive so i can only verify it as working with my html version.  if you see errors like text not displaying correctly please post in this thread.<br />
01/09/05 - updated to Live 2004-12-15 10:29:01, sorry for the delay<br />
10/26/04 - updated to Live 2004-10-25 11:59:14, trying another version of class level index, maybe this one satisfies everyone<br />
10/13/04 - updated to Live 2004-10-13 12:03:27<br />
09/23/04 - updated to Live 2004-09-23 11:30:28<br />
09/16/04 - updated to Test 2004-09-14 22:03:35, lucy hasn't given a db for the live servers so this is based on the latest test server info.  attribute indices are bugged past attribute #255 because of how lucy is dumping the csv file. put the class-level based index back to how it was, i just liked it better.<br />
08/11/04 - updated to Live 2004-08-11 10:25:30, hearts at the bottom of the page take you to the main index, some cleaning up of appearances, converted some other indices to the fastindex style, let me know what you think of the new index style, i may put them back to the old way for eqinterfaces.<br />
07/17/04 - fixed a problem with where certain spells linked back into the new AllSpellsByName index.  changed ClassbyName/byLevel indexes to use the new fastindex.<br />
07/15/04 - updated to Live 2004-07-14 09:45:55, some changes to reduce file size a bit, definitely delete your old copy before installing, file layout and names are all changed.  replaced the old ABC all-spells index with a much faster index, we'll see how ppl like it :)  also added some info to donate!  plz get me another game card, i would love for eq to pay for itself :p   removed the detrimental only versions of the messages index, and the &quot;cooked attributes&quot; index, they were sort of not so useful.   reorganized the allspells &amp; other lists sections a bit.<br />
06/16/04 - updated to Live 2004-06-16 10:05:51, lucy skipped a patch so there will be new/changed spells that are &quot;old&quot;, updated for level 70, the db lucy provides is sort of bugged atm because they are setting any attributes greater than 254 to 255 which is messing up the &quot;Unknown #255&quot; raw attribute list; probably a field width definition error in the CSV dumping code so bug them not me :)<br />
05/26/04 - updated to Live 2004-05-26 10:49:51<br />
05/13/04 - updated to Live 2004-05-12 10:26:49, removed the AE Detrimental index because it wasn't accurate; some AE target types are unknown.  slightly rearraged &quot;Other Lists&quot; on the main page.<br />
05/05/04 - i missed a whole update on 04-28, this adjusts the new/changed indexes to compare between 05-05 and 04-28 instead of 04-21.  Balance of the Nihil was a big change between 04-21 and 04-28 (just fyi).  sorry about that! :)<br />
05/05/04 - updated to Live 2004-05-05 11:15:35<br />
04/25/04 - updated to Live 2004-04-21 12:24:19<br />
04/20/04 - its not really new, just changed the description since backslashes mysteriously disappeared from the file path info<br />
04/14/04 - updated to Live 2004-04-14 12:00:37<br />
03/30/04 - updated to Live 2004-03-30 09:48:53, added some 'uknown' AE types to the AE Detrimental index<br />

02/10/04 - updated to Live 2004-02-10 11:16:59, lots of new indexes, finally some *limited* backlinks, and uh.. well a bunch of other stuff :)  enjoy gates of discord!<br />
01/14/04 - just changed the install instructions a bit, its not really new :p<br />
12/19/03 - updated to &quot;Live 2003-12-19 10:32:13&quot;<br />
12/18/03 - had left out hybrid disciplines from class indexes, sorry moderators! :)<br />
12/18/03 - updated to &quot;Live 2003-12-18 10:39:31&quot;, rearranged front page to make room for new melee sections, added endurance upkeep field for melee abilities<br />
12/07/03 - updated to &quot;Live 2003-12-06 00:56:40&quot;, this fixes the old data from the 11-15 version<br />
11/25/03 - updated to &quot;Live 2003-11-15 14:28:39&quot;, this is based on new downloads coming from db.allakhazam.com<br />
11/16/03 - updated to &quot;Live 2003-11-05 11:11:20&quot; .. lucy downloads are working again! :D<br />

10/09/03 - updated to &quot;Live 2003-10-09 15:43:27&quot;<br />
09/12/03 - updated to &quot;Live 2003-09-09 14:34:19&quot;, this is just an update to stay current with lucy's data.  they put up a new db, but the data hasnt changed so if you have the previous version of foofyspells you dont really need this one.  still no descriptions for ldon spells.<br />
09/09/03 - updated to &quot;Live 2003-09-09 10:47:32&quot;, added Attack buff index, LDoN!<br />
08/26/03 - updated to &quot;Live 2003-08-26 10:31:10&quot;<br />
08/06/03 - updated to &quot;Live 2003-08-06 15:00:12&quot;, added class alphabetical, tradeskill, cures, and detrimental only versions of CastOnXxx indexes. removed &quot;Updated&quot; field from details, added &quot;Deletable&quot; field to details.<br />
07/11/03 - really updated to &quot;Live 2003-07-11 11:22:38 &quot; this time :) <br />
07/11/03 - updated to &quot;Live 2003-07-11 11:22:38 &quot;, added more info to CastOnYou/CastOnOther indexes, better sorting of class indexes, cleaned up alpha-bar in main index<br />

06/18/03 - Fixed Bard and Ranger indexes, Level xx subheadings weren't being generated<br />
06/11/03 - updated to &quot;Live 2003-06-11 12:42:29 &quot;<br />

<br />
since i play on a localised server, would you allow me to change it a little bit to put in the french names and description ? (if i ever have time to do it :/)<br />
<br />
otherwise, one little question : how do you install it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyX</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You would need to get a french version of lucy's database.  The script I use only pulls values out of their file, it doesnt care english, french whatever.  Well ok maybe a little bit like the titles and field labels.<br />
<br />
See the download page for how to install, all you do is extract the zip to the right folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jahari Durden</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent work!<br />
<br />
One thing you could consider is offering this mod separately for each class. That way, every spell only appears once in each file, and the back 'n forth buttons would be a lot easier to implement.<br />
<br />
Also, this would actually make the filesize -smaller- as people would be able to decide for themselves what they want.. Like say.. Their own class, and NPC spells (didn't check if you included those, just an example).. This would decrease the download time for most people.<br />
<br />
And the spell nuts who want all the spells for all classes (like me, sigh :/) probably won't mind downloading an additional megabyte or two. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyX</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats a direction ill keep in mind as i make mods to the script.   its some flexibility i dont have right now so it would have to come gradually.  though i will say i dont exactly look forward to uploading 14 or 15 different mods after every patch :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borreny</div><div class="date">08-03-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a really awesome mod!!!  Now I don't have to do a web search while in game to see what a spell does if I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
I actually do like having the spells for all classes since I have a druid, shaman, and necro, and my husband has an enchanter and beastlord. Especially on our low level chars, we always have to keep checking to see what we get at the next spell level.<br />
<br />
I can live without the back and forth navigation - small price to pay to have this information directly in game.  Keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalysto</div><div class="date">08-03-2003, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this.  Someone asks about a Focus Effect or some spell, and I am all like &quot;Let me consult with Foofy!!&quot;  :D  Seriously, it is very very useful, thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lazaru5</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick question on the installation process of this.......<br />
<br />
Your instructions say to &quot;Remember to check the &quot;Use Folder Names&quot; box or you will have a bigger mess than you know how to deal with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Forgive the stupidity if this is an obvious thing, as my brain is having problems with flatulence at the moment, but what check box are you referring to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyX</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was talking about in WinZip.   If you are using some other way to extract files then you'll have to find some method of preserving the file structure stored in the zip.<br />
<br />
For example, if you are using the built-in zip extractor in WinXP there are no options to choose, so don't worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inusan</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This UI mod kinda got some recent airtime on Graffe's (wiz forum) (http://www.graffe.com/forums/), thanks to one of the moderators there. I installed it yesterday, and have to say, I'm very impressed.<br />
<br />
I have a suggestion, which will help with the issue of navigating back and forth, and which I believe should be pretty simple to add.<br />
<br />
Basically, in the spell description where it lists the class/level of that spell, you could make that link back to the Spells by Level list for that Class/Level.<br />
<br />
So for example, Minor Healing would have:<br />
<br />
Classes: CLR/1 PAL/9 RNG/9 DRU/1 SHM/1 BST/9 <br />
<br />
And each one of those would be a link, eg<br />
<br />
LEVEL-CLR.txt#level1<br />
LEVEL-PAL.txt#level9<br />
<br />
And so on.<br />
<br />
Obiviously, to do this, you'd need to add &lt;a name=level1&gt; tags into the level lists, but this can be done at the same time you already output the spell level.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, if you want to be more ambitious, the number above links to the spell list by level, and the class name links to the alphabetical spell list.<br />
<br />
While neither of these changes is absolutely required, I feel they would make this information much more accessible for users to browse - particularly for class-related spells.<br />
<br />
(Edit: add forum link. Oops, did I say Arcanist; I meant Graffe's)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyX</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks :D   could you post a link to those forums?<br />
<br />
thats not a bad idea, my main concern with putting links into the spell pages is the download size.  links are the big thing everyone wants =\  thats the best idea yet and you're right its very doable.  i wish there was a way to handle the indexes that aren't class-based though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kezzerdrix</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I installed it right, but for some reasonw hen i click on the areas it doesnt do anything at all. Little help please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyX</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure all the files are there.  It sounds like you only extracted one file; storyFooyfSpells.txt .. make sure you have the following in your Everquest folder:<br />
<br />
a file: Everquest\Storyline\storyFoofySpells.txt<br />
a folder: Everqeust\Storyline\foofy <br />
<br />
in the foofy folder there should be a ton of files.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I installed it like you said but when I go to check the list I only get so far...<br />
<br />
I open the journal window, load foofy spells, click on the class but then I cant click on the spell names to get data on them.. Is that supposed to happen or did i do something wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyX</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it sounds like not everything got extracted from the zip file.  using explorer, check to make sure you have the following (pretend everquest is installed in c:\program files\everquest):<br />
<br />
a file: c:\program files\everquest\storyline\storyFoofySpells.txt<br />
a folder: c:\program files\everquest\storyline\foofy<br />
a folder: c:\program files\everquest\storyline\foofy\data<br />
<br />
in the foofy folder there should be a bunch of files named things like ALL06-01.TXT, ONOTHER-071.TXT etc.<br />
<br />
in the data folder there should be a ton of files named like 0001.TXT, 3586.TXT etc.<br />
<br />
it sounds to me like only some files were extracted, maybe even just the main index (storyFoofySpells.txt).  or maybe you ran out of disk space while extracting, or maybe the extract process was interrupted in the middle.  just try to extract the zipfile again, and make sure you extract everything; because there is a lot :)</div></div><hr />

I had an idea that I was thinking about trying for myself, but maybe you know an easier way to do it than I do.... what about a Illia's Bestiary conversion? Like mobs by zone, and the basic stats that Illia has listed? Do you run a script to compile the data from Lucy or do you do it by hand? If you did it by script itd be easy ( i assume, I dont know how to write something like that though) but if it had to be done by hand it would be unfeasable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">12-02-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He can do this because LUCY provides the data from their database in a downloadable format.   Alla's and Illia's do not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyX</div><div class="date">12-02-2003, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah exactly.  i just run a script on the db that lucy lets us download.  if allakhazam &amp; illia did the same sure, i'd do it tomorrow :p  but being a pay-site thats prolly wishful thinking; in fact, i sort of expect allakhazam to stop allowing downloads soon now that they own lucy.</div></div><hr />

Two problems with the 11-15 allakhazam version were a missing Soul Clasp entry and Vampire Kiss having fire resist.<br />
<br />
This new 12-06 db from allakhazam seems to fix these problems.  Please let me know if you find further errors.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the PM, I did try to reply but your box was full.   As for the range listing on Nova Inferno, there's two ranges associated with targetted ae spells: caster to target, and radius about target.   In foofyspells, Nova Inferno shows a range of 200 and an AE-range of 300.  Lucy isnt showing the range field for targetted AE spells, only the AE-range field.  I could change this in foofyspells if it's confusing, but I sort of like to see both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you so much.<br />

EDITED: NM! I actually had a moment of sense and figured it out. It might help people like me to indicate that you extract everything into the whatever/whatever/whatever/storyline -- just tell them what to enter into the extract line. Otherwise, most of us idiots will put it all in the storyline folder via drag &amp; drop. <br />

Speaking for idiots everywhere, thank you for your consideration!</div></div><hr />

I really love this List. It's probably the thing I use most when playing EQ. Definately a must have :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyree</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">four and one half megs for this is rediculous, if it were maby 200k or less i would consider getting it again, but at that size and the mess that it is to navigate to get to all those links is not worth it. i made the mistake of downloading it once trying to see if it was as good as you seemed to make it out to be. it was not. having said that....<br />
<br />
If you would like to Make it better i have figured out a way for you to do it AND make it ALOT smaller, (as in 20-40k per class) download my druid spell list HERE (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3376) to get the idea of what i mean (its 19.3k) and has back links that take you to the druid level listings, i am currently working on the cleric and enchanter spells list (and enchanter Research is done now and will be uploaded soon as i finish this post) once i get all of the different classes done i will be making one like spoofys (the whole set of all classes) but alot more user friendly.<br />
<br />
This is not meant as a flame or whatever, just letting spoofy know that its way to big and he should try to make it better (I.E alot smaller and more user friendly) if he does that then i have no reason to keep making mine (trust me i'd rather him do all the work and me just download it). Was a great effort at making a complete listing but lacked on the user friendlyness and download size.... /cheers Spoofy heres to a better Listing in the future!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyX</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah its not for everyone.  if you think the download size is bad you should look at the actual size on disk.  <br />
<br />
although these files are all small, under 1k mostly, operating systems access disk drives in chunks called &quot;clusters&quot;.  so the smallest any file can be on disk is whatever size the cluster is on your system, for win2k/xp the default is 4k; it is on mine anyway.  its pretty huge :)<br />
<br />
having said that, i don't care about the size.  i care about speed and being able to look things up rapidly.  and thats what foofyspells does for me.  you dont always know what class the spell belongs to, or what level it is.  or maybe you only know something like it clobbered your BSS.  the point is, foofyspells is geared entirely towards looking things up in a hurry, with whatever information you have available.<br />
<br />
if all you're looking for is just the class spell lists then yeah, this is too much for you.  but foofyspells is pretty darn flexible and if people really just want class indexes only, thats not hard to generate.  i generate parts of foofyspells all the time for testing.  <br />
<br />
the main reason i don't make several small packages is because of the difficulty in updating/uploading multiple zips each patch.  let's face it, i don't get paid for this.  i'll keep this idea of generating subsets in mind though -- what would really be nice is being able to automate the upload part.<br />
<br />
edit:  i'd like to add that if the size of foofyspells is what really bugs, you can delete any of the indices you don't use.  if all you want are the class by name and class by level indices, just delete everything but the LEVEL-xx.txt and ALPHA-xx.txt files and the data folder in the foofy subfolder.  you can delete the attr folder too. <br />
<br />
and there are links back to where you came from, they just aren't at the top of the spell detail pages.  try clicking on the cyan-color field data, it takes you to the index that indexes that particular field.  eg. click on CLR in the Classes field of a spell and you'll go to the alphabetical cleric list.  if you click on the 9 in the CLR/9 part, you'll go to the 'by level' index for clerics.  those links really added a lot to the size, but its what ppl wanted so use them! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yours is significantly smaller, several things it does not provide though. <br />
1) No alpha listing - If I don't know the spell level I have to guess until I find it.<br />
2) No spell effect messages - Wow, what was that spell I just got hit with ? What class can cast it ? The second part is very handy when figuring out strategy for taking down caster mob X<br />
<br />
Those two right there far outweigh the difference in d/l file size, space on disk size, and the no back link in Foofy's spell list imho.<br />
That being said, if I was on dial-up I would probably would not d/l Foofy's list every time it gets patched due to the size of the download. But I am on cable, so the d/l is insignificant and HD space is cheap so that is not an issue either (I haven't exceed 50% capacity on a HD since I tried to update my Win95 to Win98 on a 1.2GB HD.)<br />
<br />
Thanks FennyX for a very useful mod (even if some peeps don't like it, at ~10000 d/l as of this post, its obvious ALOT of people do, myself included.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyree</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes mine don't have an Alpha listing, the reason mine was made is for the simple fact that for the most part, all i needed was a way to look up what spells i got when i dinged my spell level, having said that, i really don't worry to much about spell effect messages. As a druid if a mob nukes i root it and run out of range and dot the snot outta it till its dies (extended range is really nice). but enough of the rambling hehe, in all seriousness.<br />
<br />
I do NOT Dislike foofys list in any way at all other than i think its a little to much info for me to dig through, but again like he said its not for everyone, and i was also unaware that he had added links for easier navigation, i will have to download and try this new version out, again like i said in the last post if it gets better i will use it 8) and it seems that he has made one of the most seeked after changes so it seems feasable to use again, thanks spoofy for the timly response.<br />
<br />
As well as yours Weskat andBikther 8) (btw it still wasn't a Hate post he is doing a wonderful job on the updates and the mod)<br />

If i am being raid buffed i dont have to worry about knowing what every lil spell is from every lvl, so I can pick and choose if i need.<br />
<br />
The only thing i have to say is the new version is hard to get used to.<br />
<br />
I did like the alpha list (click on A and all the spells starting with A is lined up).<br />
<br />
And also the lvl of spells is a little harder to get used to although it is useful. <br />
<br />
I did like you could see only lvl 65 spells for a wiz not 64-66 or what ever it is.<br />
<br />
None the less it is a great mod and a job well done.<br />
This was just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyX</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is the first feedback i've had regarding the new style indices.  it took me a bit of getting used to also :).  in fact, i'd had them for over a month before i started posting them here -- i wasn't sure if people would like them.<br />
<br />
after using them though, i found they are much much faster to use.  these new indices really speed things up, no spell is more than 3 clicks away.<br />
<br />
if you find after a bit of time you would still rather have the old style indices, just post again and i'll change the posted version here back to how it was and keep the new ones for myself; its just a matter of how i configure the script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drumstix42</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally love the new interface. Mostly the level thing is cool, because you can pretty much go back now by click the level next to the class so you dont' have to go to a new search (like in the old interface). Though the the Alphabetical way makes you think a little (gotta learn those ABCs), it's still definately faster then click the left or right arrow until you get to where your going.<br />
<br />
Great job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mlewin</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you again for keeping this thing up-to-date.  It rocks!<br />
<br />
I saw that you were thinking of reverting to the old indexing style.  While the new indexing style takes a bit of getting used to, it is gobs faster to navigate in a pinch.  I definitely prefer it over the other indexing style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyX</div><div class="date">09-04-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">great :)  thanks a lot for the feedback.  i'll keep them as they are.  <br />
<br />
one thing i was considering putting back to the old index was just the level based class indexes.  also, because the OoW spells are only on test right now, i've been using test server data for my own version.  is that something you would be interested in using too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aramil Dannodel</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fenny...thank you for your great work, and meticulous upkeep of this Story Content mod.  A *lot* of people I run into are either asking me, my friends, or just spouting in /ooc &quot;What does &lt;spell name here&gt; do?&quot;.  I try to tell everyone that doesn't already have it to make a point of coming here and downloading your spell list...it's an invaluable tool, and I honestly don't see how I could live without it.<br />
<br />
My question/concern is as follows:  I've been using the spell list for just under a year now, and although I've fallen in love with it, I really dislike the nex indexing system.  Now, I know a lot of people posting said they weren't too keen on it at first, but enjoy it now that they've gotten used to it, but me, personally...no offense to your work, but I simply can't stand it.<br />
I was wondering if there might be some possibility of you making a seperate version with the old indexing system, or give us some sort of instruction as to how to change it back to the old system while retaining the new/changed/added listings.  If either of the two isn't too grand a hassle, I'd greatly appreciate any help on it possible.<br />
Also, I noticed you were hoping to start including the new Omens of War spell listings with data pulled from the Test server.  I honestly think this would be fantastic, since the newer OoW listings aren't fully described and detailed, at this point (not your fault, you're just picking up the information and cramming it together in a nice little, easy-to-use package for us).<br />

IMO splitting up the spells by pages made it A LOT quicker to be able to go backwards. If your looking for a level 40 spell lets say, and you click one, you can then click the level level next to the class short name, like DRU/40, but now when you do it, you've gotta scroll all the way back down to the level 40 spells<br />
<br />
;) I personally liked how it was before. That's my 2cp</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyX</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">have a new class level one, its sort of paged, and sort of sub-indexed, so it still looks simple, but lets you page around a lot faster -- with no scrolling  :D</div></div><hr />
