<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just as a note: once Lunix is Released and running smoothly I will stop supporting all FU mods including the main FU6.93.  But this isn't the end, this weekend I got to preview FU9.21 which tinkfu has been creating slowly over the last couple of months (it's 42Mbs large) he is useing a backwards compatable version of XML called HyperXML that lets him shape the interface InGame. <br />
<br />
 I can't say he is going to post this mod anywhere (is mod the right term?) ok not mod Total Rework, but I will try to talk him into it (even though it drops my framerate to what my VooDoo2 used to do it's still incredible)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup, FULabs has created a new UI toy :-) I haven't used it much since it is still in early alpha stages, but it is amazing..  a new UI toy (no not a offline viewer) that allows me to runthrough the coding of the UIs XML files and shrink it (ie* removes useless coding)<br />
<br />
we are working on a compiler and a offline viewer and will debue them as one package when they are complete..  this shall bring the end of the SIDLFIDDLE SIDLWIDL nightmare  (ie* the new toy is platform independent, it runs on 2 bootable floppies right now, but still requires parts of linux to run, that will be fixed soon though)<br />
<br />
ohh, I forgot to mention, it's a Linux based program, we are making it independent so that even windows users will be able to use it...  thiers will be on a CDbootable probably since we will have to write a GUI for the windows users.</div></div><hr />

Dolby (passed some of the betas through moderation even though they didn't work) *j/k*<br />
Enok (I stole alot of ideas from him)<br />
Cairenn (Cairenn challenged alot of the ways I wrote tiny tweaks into the coding, one of them she was right on so I'll give her some recognition)<br />

also as it is posted above in the news post, I have stoped working on Lunix in favor of Lunix_SM.  I hope this is a good idea :-)<br />
<br />
a update is comming soon to Lunix_SM I plan to add version 4 stats tab to the LunixSMbuff window allready in Lunix_SMbeta1.4, also I plan to rework the gauges so they take up less room, I have a special idea planed for the now blank player window that I think many mules will like..<br />

<br />
in my quest to make this UI the best in the entire world of EQ, I have discovered a way to make it absolutley error free (untill they have another patch)<br />
<br />
I am not going to include it in the mod untill I have a wide range of people test it.<br />
<br />
but be warned this has never been done before and it is very very Experimental<br />
<br />
after you run Lunix_SM_BETA1.5 check your UIErrors.txt file and tell me what you found in there..<br />
<br />
this is for Lunix_SM_BETA1.5 and will probably not work with any other mods.<br />
<br />
also, people who have put custom graphical files such as class animations, please do not use this plugin.  it would overwrite your custom class animation and other such things.  Only people who haven't modifyed the Lunix_SM_BETA1.5 sound use this..<br />

I do hope so... in the mean time I will be doing my best to try to mod your's to include what I mention..  (this will most likely take  a bit, due to im new on the xml modding way of life)<br />

<br />
I am working on a static buff window that has the player and the group bars in the bottom and the buffs on top, this will make the buff window 300pixels taller, but since there wont be a need for the player window or the group window, it frees 28 pixles (accounting for the borders of those to windows and some spacing issues)<br />
this would allso allow me to extend the other two tabs of the buff window.<br />
<br />
the other thing I am consider is making the ends of the gauges flush with the endcaps..  the included screenshot shows a blown up view of what they look like now..  the flush version would be just that, flush to the end cap.<br />

if there is anyone out there willing to help me on this version of Lunix please post here or PM me</div></div><hr />

personally I don't know how it works..  I had to steal the changing colour squares from tinkfu :-/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for anyone who downloaded RC0 or RCguildonly of the Lunix UI..  a problem has been discovered..  I left the compass window in the modded UI..  I have it set to load from the default..  <br />
to save room and make the UI run a little smoother please delete the included compass window in your RC0 or RCguildonly folder ( excluding people who have plugged in custom compasses )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">with that said..  here is a preview of the Buff( player ) window..<br />
<br />
image removed to save loading time<br />
<br />
the target gauge gets overwritten by the casting gauge when casting.<br />
<br />
also the target colour changing gauge isn't wanting to work..  it just stays red all the time..  not sure whats wrong on that.<br />
<br />
the stamina gauge gets overwritten by the breath gauge when swimming or drowning yourself.<br />
<br />
code is lighter..  though the twobox optimization I did for the window isn't wanting to hold.<br />
<br />
the new spellbooks are holding me back since I can't draw..  so I would say unless I can find a good artist the new launch date for this hour is 11/6/2003</div></div><hr />

<br />
can't give a release date now..  though I will launch without the new spellbooks...  that should speedup the launch.<br />
<br />
I also lost all of Lunix_II ( bluehat ) so it might once again become a EQ2 interface.</div></div><hr />

yup launch is today...  but keeping in step with how SOE releases their games..  many of the promised functions will come later...  and might have to be obtained by buying another expansion :P</div></div><hr />

The only request that I could think of is a current hp/max hp listing on the main screen so that I do not have to tab over to my inventory to see it...other than that awesome job! kudos...<br />

(i just wish that SOE would fix the damn targeting ring so everyone could use it rather than just the people that bought video cards from 4 companies...LOL)<br />

inside almost all unedited version of Lunix you will find a graphic file called window_pieces04O.tga please delete this file as it was just leftovers from when I put in the new compass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">saturday morning I am going to start total rework to all 3 of my main UIs, I have started tonight really on a new version of TypeC, this version will be posted for beta testing purposes, however there will be nothing visually different from the current TypeC..<br />
<br />
My goals while doing this are<br />
[list=1]<br />
 let my UI run on systems with smaller amounts of memory ( I currently don't want people with 256MBs of dram running the UI because I think it eats to much of thier memory )<br />
 It'll be alot of fun to start over :-)<br />
 ok your reading reason three, I guess you have figured out by now I have nothing else left to do :-)<br />
[/list=1]</div></div><hr />

<br />
but as I said early in my posts I can't draw, so most graphics will be default.  if you want to make me one... make thanks.<br />
<br />
if you want to recreate Lunix in your own image.. good luck :-)</div></div><hr />

the group invite and LFG magnifying glass...<br />
<br />
i am using Lunix pro, and i cant seem to find these buttons... any suggestions?  <br />
<br />
I lunix Pro I had decided to remove these buttons in favor of keyboard commands.. <br />
<br />
Group Invite = CTRL I<br />
Group Disband = CRTL D<br />
LFG = /lfg<br />
<br />
however if you wish these buttons in your group window almost any group window mod can be plugged in to replace the one I have in there by default *note group window mods containing other XML such as (EQUI_extraanimations.xml and EQUI_extratemplates) may not work.*<br />
<br />
I am sorry I forgot to post on this thread that I am quitting EQUImodding, therefor there will be no updates to Lunix Pro/b/c or Lunix IIBETA1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Werndog77</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
And thank you for this great mod! I totally understand you stopping the updates and it makes sense. But I just hope you know that the work is appreciated, your mods really are incredible.<br />
<br />
thanks again, and good luck to ya</div></div><hr />
