I hate it, I actually cannot stand it. I made my own mod, But im too lazy to post it, maybe I'll get around to it some day. I just cant see what everybody likes about the Vert UI. Will someone point it out to me? Because everytime I see it I really do gag. Im sorry if I offended anyone :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkShineKnight</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, Vertebrae did a supreme job on her UI.  I like the VERT UI so much, I have a set for each of my characters.  Hehe.<br />
<br />
Anyway, The reason why I like it is because...um...well...I just like the way it looks.  I like the HP/MP/STA/EXP bars and the way she has your stats (Str/Sta/Agi/Int...etc...SvF/SvC...etc...) on your pet section along with AC and ATK.  The buff bar was, in my opinion, lacking it's alignment but if I can see what buffs I had with their names, then I'm satisfied.<br />
<br />
Basically, it's a great mod.  This is no competition.  People try to make UIs that fit their personal needs.  They share them to see if other people would want to use it as well in order to not waste time making their own.<br />
<br />
BAH, I don't know what I'm saying anymore...I just woke up and now I have to work.  Hehe.<br />
<br />
Nuff said...I'll check back after work.<br />

Now that you've got that off your chest perhaps you'll move along and troll somewhere else. Mmmkay?<br />
<br />
Vert's done a fantastic job making unobtrusive graphics with easily readible bars and stats. Adding the inventory slots to the hotbutton bar was a lovely touch and the resists were just icing on the cake. The custom cursor was impressive even though it was geared towards rogues - I used it for quite some time. I think the excess 'side' graphics used in the most current version are a little much but it's still visually appealing.<br />
<br />
I'm interested in seeing a screenshot of the interface you spoke about. Perhaps someday you'll overcome your laziness and put YOUR hard work up for review. Wouldn't that be fun?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the Vert UI graphically is fabulous, I love the clean edges and corners, but think it was implemented horribly. It needs custom animations for it's borders and I personally think the animations file shouldn't be modified ( except maybe for changes relating to the buff window, spells or mouse cursor since changes have to be amde then ), anyways, instead of just insulting it, I'll psot a screenshot of the UI I'm getting ready to release which is based off of the original Vert graphics but without modifying the animations file ( I realigned the Vert graphics so that it became a skin that could be applied to any standard UI ). Here is screenshot.<br />
