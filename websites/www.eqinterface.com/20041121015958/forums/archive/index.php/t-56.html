<br />
1) Is this a good program to learn XML with? I'm starting from scratch, I don't really even remember HTML anymore.<br />
<br />
2) If there is a better free program (or free trial of a program) out there for me to learn XML with so I can make my own interface for EQ, can someone reply with a link or name of such a program?<br />
<br />
3) I already forget what this question was going to be so just ignore #3 =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just grabbed a small book/print out from online, read about it. Then got XML spy ( from work. :) ). And played with it.<br />
<br />
Loaded a XML document, created a DTD file ( this is something that VI really needs ) and vis versa.<br />
<br />
Play with it, and you'll learn. Its really a nice app and XML Isn't that hard. It's all structure, nothing more.</div></div><hr />
