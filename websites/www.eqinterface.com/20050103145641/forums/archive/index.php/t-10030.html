<br />
Ok so this is all new to me and I am ignorant when it comes to all this but fairly computer knowledgable so bare with me please.<br />
<br />
First off I went and DL Delta3.0 the complete version ( very nice btw).  I then proceeded to load it up and found that it was great except there were some things I would like a little different.<br />
<br />
So, I decide to see if I can just copy in the changes I want.  I took my default folder and made a copy, then pasted in Delta3.0  (loaded fine)  I in the process chose NOT to overwrite some of the default due to the fact that some of the spell gems I had a hard time figuring out as well as I liked the defaults better.  <br />
<br />
I then loaded in Gep_Group, I liked the people and pet %, and it loaded up but I recieved some type of error saying it might not work properly bla bla.  It DID load however so I continued on.<br />
<br />
Loaded TrackingWnd, just because I liked the bigger buttons, and it loaded fine as well.<br />
<br />
I then came to the problem area, when I changed my group box, I lost my Xp and AAxp bars and %, something I really wanted.  So I decided to change up my playerwindow to something that had all the info I wanted and more.  I copied over the Delta3.0 with Mafoos_PlayerWindow.  At this point it loads back to default when I load up.  I would only be guessing but perhaps it has something to do with multiple information being pulled from one source code?  Dont know and if I did I wouldnt be here so I will leave it to the intelligent ones such as yourselves.<br />
<br />
Here is my error log, thank you again for any and all help and I am really enjoying playing around with my screen :)<br />

[Sat Sep 06 07:27:50 2003] [Line:608 Source:UIFiles\delta\EQUI_TargetWindow.xml] Schema error - Duplicate item TW_FireNumber<br />
[Sat Sep 06 07:27:50 2003] Error loading skin: loading default skin instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also this isnt where I plan on stopping with my manipulation so if there is a error source code page I could go look at in case I have more problems could you be so kind as to post a Loc,  also when I copied over the default and chose NOT to on a few files, ie compass, it still uses the delta3.0 graphic instead of the default.  Anyway ty again.</div></div><hr />

Very heavily modified UI's will be the least likely to accept other mods, due to changes in things like the animations.xml file and such.<br />
<br />
In this particular case, it appears you have a duplicate label. In this case &quot;TW_FireNumber&quot; seems to have two instances. This is a fatal error, and will cause the default to load instead. There can only be one instance of a particular label.<br />
<br />
There are two possible solutions:<br />
(Note: Highly recommended you copy the UI's folder into one you can fiddle with - without the worry of totally destroying your original archives.)<br />
<br />
1) Rename one instance of the label to something else. (IE: TW_FireNumber and TW_FireNumber2. You would need to make sure to edit both the begin and end part of the tags) then load it up and see if you get continued errors, make sure it looks ok.<br />
<br />
2) Remove one instance of the label from the file(s). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here... I changed Mafoo's player window so it should work. Not sure why Mafoo called his resistances &quot;TW_blahblah&quot; since TW usually refers to the target window. He probably copied the code from some other mod. <br />
<br />
This and several of the other windows you are trying to use are quite out of date, though... and you will probably have a hard time getting it current so that it doesn't give you that red message. The attached mafoo's playerwindow should at least allow you to load the UI....<br />
<br />
I think I need a screenshot of this... Delta 3 with a different group window and added Mafoo's player window... *wince*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do not make a copy of your default folder.  The only things that should be in your custom folder are the actual custom files.  If you copy the default folder, it means that every single time SOE changes anything you will almost definitely have a non-functional UI.<br />
<br />
As well, re getting the the error message in game (files not compatible, may not work correctly, etc) ... if you get a message like that, you want to find out what is causing it (find your UIError.txt log file in your main EQ directory) and get it fixed.  While it may not cause a problem right now, it will later on.<br />
<br />
A perfect example of this would be the mess a lot of folks were in last week.  After the patch on 26 Aug, many people found that their UIs no longer worked.  After looking at their UIError.txt log files, they discovered that the problem went back to a patch on 14 May.  Until last week's patch, they were still able to load their UIs, but all had the &quot;your files are not compatible&quot;, and had to retro-actively make those corrections.  The same will happen to you sooner or later if you have that in-game message and don't fix it.</div></div><hr />

Definitely a must, nothing but headache otherwise.<br />

Excellent advice, although this is probably more aimed at those who know how to accomplish this. (Might be a good thing to sticky in dev forum somewhere? A pinch of caution saves a pound of trouble, as the saying goes I think.)<br />
<br />
However, on a different direction... mine still functioned fine after the changes on May 14, however broke on Aug 26 - fixed for Aug26, strangely enough worked fine, went back and fixed error message caused from the 14th afterwards anyway (I was short on time! hehe). Were the two related? Perhaps just the way my particular xml was set up, but it had seemed to me the 'break' was two independant instances. Either way fix or no-fix for 14th mine had still gotten broken with the 26th patch. :\  All fixed up now, but still curious.<br />
<br />
Anywho, hopefully this input helps you out a bit.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blossom</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you guys for all your help, I wish I could somehow learn how to fix it myself but, untill I get a little more familiar with this stuff, I will leave it alone.  I am now trying to put some other stuff together because I was having so many errors with stuff I was trying.  <br />
<br />
Couple more questions if you have time.  About the patch stuff, when a patch goes in do I have to go back and recode my Ui's or does EQ do that?  I am guessing its on the user side and so will it be something I need to learn in order to keep my screen fresh?  Also is there a page that has errors and possible fixes out there?  If so can you please link it.  I think if I could possible fix some of it myself without posting I would save some poeple allot of time.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for all your help, and next time hopefully it will be in chat and not in HELP ME I AM DUMB channel :)<br />
