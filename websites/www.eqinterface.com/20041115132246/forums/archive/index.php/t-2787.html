They're boring, depressing rectangles.  So I change them into more fun things.  Phase 2 in my personal war against default gauges....the group window.  Graphic was originally the crusader sword from t.king (who else). This however was heavily modified so that it wouldn't take up the whole screen..... It is still rather large but I like it. Still messing around with it; here's what it looks like.</div></div><hr />

Seriously- I use the Arcane Cast Gauge, the player window with the bubble-thingies for health, and Remelio's circular pet window mod, and I've just been desperately looking for a group window to match, please please upload this so I can play with it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That looks great. The green and red circles are the pet/player hp bars right? Hmm. May I make a suggestion? The thing I like about gauges is you can see people hp clearer. And percentages are nice too, which I see you've added. :)<br />

How big would this window be in a 800 x 600, or 1024 x 768 resolution?<br />
<br />
Nice job though. Any idea when you'll release it? :)</div></div><hr />

Maybe you could use the entire center shaft thingy as a player hp gauge? the circle at the end could still be pet hps. And maybe you could put the player percent in the circle at the other end.</div></div><hr />
