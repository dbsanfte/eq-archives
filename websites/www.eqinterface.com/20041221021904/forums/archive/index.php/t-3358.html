I read somewhere (bloody hell cant remember where though) that after 20 minutes of your death, your character is transfered to the Player's Graveyard. Now the question is where is this 'cemetary'<br />
<br />
I posed this question online among players and they said the players graveyard is in the zone where you died. Okay... I thought. So I went back to Kurn's Tower, not a good place to die down below (though there are places worse than this) and waited the standard twenty minutes.. just to be sure I waited 30 minutes (mind you I did so searching for my corpse as well to pass the time.. that and some casting). And nothing. No grave marker nothing... I ended up going to get my corpse anyway. So what gives? Is it not working yet or what? Anyone got any clues to this, let alone the site that actually has info on the Player Graveyards... any leads would be greatly appreciated! Journey well everyone!<br />

<br />
AKA no more long corpse runs...<br />
<br />
Sorry, anything pre-POP you are still getting your corpse.</div></div><hr />

For me it was a bit more hair-raising however.  At level 46 with 4 and half blue  I thought my level was secure.  Well - some Flys had my gnomer for din-din in the Plane of Disease.  When I landed in PoK at bind point I was 45 - lost alot of exp.   Matter of fact, I was no longer able to re-enter the Plane of Tranquility as I didn't have enough experience.  (verant can be so stupid).  Fortunately, a guildie was around and jumped to zone and rezzed me.  Since the experience returns prior to the porting part of spell I was allowed to enter the PoD.<br />
<br />
Not sure whether this check is done only at the PoT portal or if all the first tier PoP portals perform this check  (i.e. if I was bound in PoT - would I have been able to enter PoD after dying and dropping back to lvl 45).</div></div><hr />
