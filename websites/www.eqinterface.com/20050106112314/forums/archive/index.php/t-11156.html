When I try adding it to my ui folder and load that UI I get the default UI.  Knowing I've probably missed some files that eq added and changed over time and for trouble shooting purposes I deleted the default UI folder, did a complete file check on the patcher.  Then copied the default folder and named it Test and just added the EQUI_TargetWindow.xml file.<br />
<br />
This is what the UIErrors.txt says:<br />
<br />
UIErrorLog created at Mon Nov 10 17:06:12 2003<br />
[Mon Nov 10 17:06:13 2003] [Line:8 Source:UIFiles\Test\EQUI_TargetWindow.xml] ParseNodeList() SyntaxError<br />
[Mon Nov 10 17:06:13 2003] Error loading skin: loading default skin instead.<br />
<br />
I also tried downloading the file a couple times to make sure it didn't get corrupted in transit or anything but I get the same error each time.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreaciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then copied the default folder<br />
<br />
Don't do that step.  The only files that should be in your custom folder are files that have actually been customized.  Otherwise, you are setting yourself up for a world of headache, as every time SOE changes any little tiny thing in any window, you will most probably have a UI that no longer works.<br />
<br />
From the looks of the error message, there is an error in the window you downloaded.  The author has (most likely) forgotten an opening or closing statement, or a partial statement (ie &lt; &gt; bracket missing, etc).<br />
<br />
You can look to see if they have released an updated functional one, you can try going through the file yourself (start with the line number specified in the error log) or zip it up and attach it here and hopefully someone will have a chance to take a look at it, find and fix the error.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for letting me know that :).<br />
<br />
Although I did find for troubleshooting purposes it will make life a lot easier to copy all the files.  I deleted everything in my UItest directory and just copied the target window I want... loaded that UI in game then looked at the error text... it has an error for every single file that should be in the directory instead of just the error for what's wrong with the target file.  Although I can see how it will make life easier for real UI folder :).  Although I was happy I had the old action window recently, playing on a pvp server I'd much rather have the Who than the Find.<br />
<br />
I'd forgotten it tells you the line error /bonkself I'll be looking at them and seeing if I can work it out. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deviantelf</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">simple question, line numbers... the very first line is 1, the next line is 2... etc or does it work differently... like I changed something in line 8, won't bother getting into atm since I don't know if it really helped or not, but now it has an error in line 2... but this is line 2: and just below I've copied line 2 from the default file... sigh.  <br />
<br />
- &lt;XML ID=&quot;EQInterfaceDefinitionLanguage&quot;&gt;<br />
- &lt;XML ID=&quot;EQInterfaceDefinitionLanguage&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
And once while messing around I had an error in line 1: and then line 1 from default copied just below it<br />
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt; <br />
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt; <br />
<br />
both lines look exactly the same to me :( <br />
<br />
or are these both blanket errors?  just meaning something somewhere in the file is wrong.<br />
<br />
I've got 2 monitors and I've got the different files on different screens so I don't confuse them yet can compare things if I want.  I realize the mod file will be different in some ways, but I was hoping to find something easy to fix lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SpamFilter</div><div class="date">11-28-2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the same problem with Long Name Target modification by dkny23. If I try to load it the target window just reverts back to the default one. But that's not the strangest thing, I have about 10 UI mods loaded and about half of them revert back to default when I try to load dkny23's Long Target Window. If I simply put the original Remelio window back everything reverts back to normal modified UI.<br />
<br />
I have been using the original Remelio Long Target Window and that works fine. Unfortunately I have no idea how to edit XML files. But does anyone else know how to patch this? I love the original Remelio window but would like it with color too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This changed in Sept of 2002, SOE made the change that any file NOT found in the custom UI folder is automatically pulled from the default.<br />
<br />
our FAQ has been updated for a very long time with this info... <br />
<br />
As Cairenn said... doing this sets up a WORLD of hurt.. trust me (and her) you just don't want to do it!<br />
