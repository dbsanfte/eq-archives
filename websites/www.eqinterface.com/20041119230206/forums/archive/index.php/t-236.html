<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Milambus</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not too hard I would think.<br />
<br />
Create a texture in the shape that you want, with the area that you dont want displayed as transparent.  The use that as the background for the window.  Turn off the border.<br />
<br />
Ok, maybe it is a bit difficult, but doable.<br />
<br />
The window would still be square/rectangular but would display as whatever shape you want.</div></div><hr />

I guess I just wanted it to be like skins on windows apps like MP3 players.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But that is like the skins for Winamp. The window is still square but the transparent areas just don't show. Turn off borders titlebar, closebox and minimzebox, and that's all you see. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure you can definie what areas are clickable for dragging and such, making a window that is effectively as round as you can have in the square universe of the PC.<br />
<br />
Now that I know how to make them, I really wish Winamp would support TGA files (and alpha transparency) so that I didn't have to make a stupid text file to tell it what's transparent.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look for the &lt;style&gt; variables at the end of the file named Titelbar, closebox, minimizebox, borders, and sizable.<br />
<br />
If you turn off everything, you'll also want to turn off sizable so that you can still move the window by dragging. This means you'll have to play around with it a bit to make it look the way you want.<br />
<br />
Theoretically you could make a set of completely round windows, or even pyramid windows or any other shape.<br />
<br />
One other thing, you'll probably want to either edit window_pieces01.tga or make your own file for the window borders etc, to make sure they're totally invisible.</div></div><hr />
