I downloaded this about 4 weeks ago i believe and recently had hardware trouble and was unable to retrieve it. I found a copy of the description and was hopeing somone would be able to provide a link where i could dl it. here is the description<br />
<br />
Vert2.2 Cab based. Here's a list of what this package includes:<br />
<br />
- Anything caster gone.<br />
<br />
- Tweaked player buff window.<br />
<br />
- Brand-new targeting/hp window; Designed it from scratch with our class in mind, it includes: A small fatigue/casting/breath gauge, a large HP gauge which now reflects the warrior frenzy state (30/45%). And a mob HP gauge below.<br />
<br />
- Minor GUI trims, keeping the 800x600 player in mind (if you don't like the hotbutton setup edit the hotbutton xml file or reload the original one saved as .original).<br />
<br />
- 3min duration Arista timer.<br />
<br />
- And of course all the original Vert eyecandy you've come to expect<br />
<br />
<br />
and here is a Screen shot of it<br />

We try to remove all the broken ones we can because then their is less people in this forum asking for help to get their four week old mod that has been broken twice to work. ;)</div></div><hr />
