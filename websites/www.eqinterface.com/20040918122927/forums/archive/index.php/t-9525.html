Latest Beta (http://equi.carnology.com/files/my_mods/pubbeta/beta_madcolorseries.zip)<br />
<br />
*UPDATE* 08-03-2003 Version 0.6 Released!<br />
*UPDATE* 08-01-2003 Version 0.5 Released!<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Fixes:<br />
v0.6<br />
- Group window completely compatible finally. =)<br />
- Health and pet bars made a little longer.<br />
- There should now be enough room for longer names. If they are real long though they may overlap the percentage.<br />
v0.5<br />
- Target Window, fixed problem with name showing up on the health bar and the second percentage showing up.<br />
- Color changing squares on the Target window are now centered as they should be.<br />
v0.4<br />
- Combined my Target, Player and Group color changing mods into one series.<br />
- Slim lined the windows.<br />
- Fixed the name overlay problem on the target window.<br />
- Fixed the problem with one row of pixels blinking even when above 40% health. This<br />
  problem existed in all 3 windows.<br />
- Fixed some label and gauge names to allow compatibility with more mods.<br />
- All of the background images have been changed a little to allow for the narrowing of the windows overall.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Known issues:<br />
v0.4<br />
- Still one or two compatibility issues with the default EQ interface. This does not<br />
  affect game play at all and will be fixed before final release.<br />
- Target window, still a little taller than I want it, expect it to be slimmed before<br />
  release as well.<br />
- Report issues you come across to this thread.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
The Color Changing Window Series was designed with healers in mind. All three windows<br />
included in this mod have squares that change colors as health is lost. In the player<br />
window, as you lose health the square will change colors green-&gt;yellow-&gt;orange then<br />
once below 40% it will flash from red to yellow. Same goes with the group window and<br />
each member in your party. The target window does this as well. These mods can be used<br />
as a full set or you can pick and choose which windows you want to use.<br />
<br />
Here are screenshots of each window:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madmardeggan</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you mean on all of the windows or is there a certain one? Let me know and I will fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah sorry meant the target window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blacklord_sith</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems that it cuts off the lower half of the target name on the target window on mine as well as the green square being off centered. Other than that, the other parts work great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madmardeggan</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I will work on getting a patch out sometime today. Thanks for the report.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madmardeggan</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well got too busy at work to fix the problem today, i will try to get one either tonight or in the morning. For now if it causes a problem just remove the EQUI_TargetWindow.xml from the mod directory if it isn't useable. Sorry for the delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madmardeggan</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I fixed the Target Window, version 0.5 was just released! Let me know if you have any other issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weawen</div><div class="date">08-03-2003, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">love how they look, was wondering how hard it would be to instead of changing a square at the left of the target window but change the bar color it self.<br />
<br />
[Sun Aug 03 12:45:40 2003] [Line:2085 Source:UIFiles\Solaria-2mod\EQUI_GroupWindow.xml] Couldn't find class:item 'A_LFGBtnPressedFlyby' reference in FieldParseItemOfClass()<br />
<br />
Just got that error thought you would like to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madmardeggan</div><div class="date">08-03-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The health bars can be any color. Some fixes coming next week:<br />
<br />
1.) Percentages on group window to be relocated, when grouped with someone with a long name it interferes.<br />
2.) Pet health bar should be fixed so it doesn't show up if there is no pet.<br />
3.) Any remaining compatibility problems with everquest.<br />
4.) Anything else brought to my attention in time :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madmardeggan</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">V0.6 available see details in first post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nytekat</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">can you switch the target and player window?  that way the blinky box is around the target.  I hate it when it's around the player window... it's a bit of an eye sore.<br />
<br />
Was also wondering if you can make a player window without the exp bars?  Or would that be to much resizing for you?  I use the ellymix hot buttons so I have the exp bars on the bottom of them... if you can't no biggie :) just thought I'd ask.</div></div><hr />
