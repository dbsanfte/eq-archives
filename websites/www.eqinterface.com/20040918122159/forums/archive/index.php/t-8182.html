New colors include Red (Rage) and Yellow (Tropical).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daisy</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where would I find the past versions so that I can use these ones? Can find posts about them, but nowhere to download them from. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceBlast</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">version 4.3 was a full install so if you want to use rage or tropical just download 4.3 of any color, the 4.4 update for that color, and then the 4.5 update in either rage or tropical.  Install all files starting with 4.3, etc. and make sure to name the ui folder where your installing all the files to is either IceBlastUI-Rage or IceBlastUI-Tropical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daisy</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, but the trouble I am having is finding the 4.3 and 4.4<br />
Do a search and all i get is updates on main page and when I go to look and try to download what they got there, I get asked for my password again and then it throws me back to forums. I dont know what that means, but I tried it over and over again for like 2 hours last night.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daisy</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, I even enabled them to grab any cookies without even asking me if wanna save the info, still no go. Wont do today either.<br />
BTW, I havent had to log into the site in like 5 months, so they always been enabled. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm...how odd. The previous versions of iceblast were available in the same category as the newest one was when it was released a few days ago. Where did they go? Vacation? Just cuz your creator makes a new version of you doesn't mean you can high tail it outta town, shame on you :p<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daisy</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The posts are there, but the downloads are not.<br />
RAWR the longer I cant have this UI the more I want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceBlast</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I just went and looked an apparently one of the admins has deleted every version of the UI before 4.5.....what good is it to do such a thing when the latest version isn't a full install but rather a patch!?!?!?  Well to remedy this I'm going to re-upload full versions of the UI stay glued for when they pop up in the mix and match section......if they don't it's cause a admin had something against me putting full versions up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daisy</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Standing by :)<br />
Thanks Ice, I was seriously starting to wonder if I had lost it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceBlast</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">rofl np I guess the site either had an auto clean up date we triggered and it deleted all ui's before a certain date or a admin could have done the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">momoyeti</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Iceblast I love your UI. But is there anyway you can create a mod with all that but the group window just be a group window without the inventory? Or tell me how I can do that myself because everytime I just put a party window inplace of that one I get an error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kortoha</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey IceBlast I just found out about this place the other day and I must say I like your UI's and think they are some of the best out there. 1 Prob NO WARRIOR pointers :(  I know you guys are problly really busy doing other stuff but if already or have plans to make a Warrior epic pointer please let us know I know I'd love it and I'm sure other warriors would as well thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oedi</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, that was a loaded comment, but seriously, I can't imagine using anything different.  The only trouble I'm having is with the book window.  <br />
<br />
I'm trying to read things like recipes and newspapers and the background is so dark and odd looking that the black ink doesn't show up.<br />
<br />
I've tried to replace other book skins and they still don't work.  Do you have a way around this?<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
