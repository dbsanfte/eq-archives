Only the 1st 36 items may be priced in the trader window, and also only 36 may be displayed for sale.<br />
<br />
I already had more items priced than that, and the non-visible items still come up in the bazaar search window, although cannot be purchased.<br />
<br />
This is happening on both of my computers, and one of them has never had an UI mods applied.<br />
<br />
Just trying to find out if anyone else is having this problem, and if anyone may know a way to fix it. (way to modify default UI files to allow me to apply it as a new skin would be fine)<br />

<br />
Anything in your UIError.txt log file?  Dunno if there will be or not, this is a new one on me, but can't hurt to at least look, right?<br />
<br />
Sounds more like a bug to me, that should be reported to SOE, but lets make sure first.</div></div><hr />

EDIT: Zip removed - horrible code - doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't make a modified Bazaar window so you can price the items... but you can rearrange your backpacks to move different ones near the top if necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The last two lines of my Merchant windows are overlapping.<br />
<br />
So box 78 and 79 in the MerchantWindow ( last two, when you scroll all the way to the bottom ) are drawing up over 76 and 77. But it leaves about 10 pixes at the top of 76 and 77, so I can just barely see there's something there... and I can click on them if I'm careful.<br />
<br />
REALLY wierd....<br />
<br />
What's wierder is that it only happens on one computer. The other one is just fine. And it happens whether I load a custom UI or the original one...<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

I will take a look at the log tonight, but as I said on one of the machines, there have been no mods to the UI, so this is likely a problem caused by the patch to the default UI. The only thing I tried was deleting the bazaar XML files and letting them be repatched.<br />
