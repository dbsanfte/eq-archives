<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neori</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The last few days I've been suffering from a very annoying problem that nearly caused me to quit playing EQ until the next patch.  The game would run fine for a little while, then it would gradually get worse and worse and things would get very choppy, like the framerates were spiralling downward quickly.<br />
<br />
I spent days searching for information on the official EQ boards, and went through and upgraded any drivers needed and updating Windows as needed.<br />
<br />
Turns out it might be an infinite looping bug in the UIerrors.txt reporting.  Check out this thread, this is where I read about it:<br />
<br />
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/045809.html <br />
<br />
What I think was happening is there is some error in one of the custom XML files that EQ would continually write the error message to the log file, slowly eating up available memory and cause a degradation in system performance.<br />
<br />
I made sure that all the UI files were up-to-date, and when I was sure I was no longer seeing the red text message in game warning about problems in the UI (the one suggesting to load the default UI), everything ran fine.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will help anyone else who is having problems with bad framerates and performance in EQ when before the patch everything ran fine, like I had.</div></div><hr />
