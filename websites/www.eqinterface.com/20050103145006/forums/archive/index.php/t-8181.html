Not a LD, but it freezes and nothing short of a reset will get me back up and running.  This doesn't happen all the time.  Sometimes I can go 14 hours with no problems, then it happens every 15 minutes. <br />
<br />
i have reinstalled my Video Drivers and DX.  I have also reinstalled my sound card.  Sony's Tech guys told me to disable my SB Live! card.  I did this and still am having the problems.<br />
<br />
Help!  :(</div></div><hr />

Your system may be over heating.  More or less what happens is the CPU and other components in the system reach a point where they stop all activity in the system because it is too hot.  You may want to make sure all your fans in the system are clean and still working.  There is a freeware program out there that you can put on your system that will monitor you temperatures (assuming that your system has this capability, which most these days do).  The link below will take you to the website where the program can be aquired.  Depending on the CPU type in your machine the temp may be more problematic then others.  I know with the AMD chips alot of times when the CPU temp starts to get above 118F-120F it starts to have problems (I don't remember right off what the ratings on the Intel chips are).  But usually it is just a fan issue and you just need to clean the fan or replace it.<br />

Near the bottom of the page is the link to download the most recent version.<br />

There are plenty of other programs out there to do the same thing this is just the one that I use currently and seems to support the most systems that I have seen as yet.</div></div><hr />
