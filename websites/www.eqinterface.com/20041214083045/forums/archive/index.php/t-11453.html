<br />
We got EQIM up to speed yesterday so that it shows all the servers now.   You will see Venril Sathir, Kael Drakkal, Sebilis, Stromm, and Maelin Starpyre.  This is still unsupported software, but I hope you enjoy the changes we've made.  You don't need to change anything, just run EQIM and it will automagically download a new Serverinfo.xml file.  If you had modified your Serverinfo.xml file manually and added /nopatch to the end of your shortcut, you will need to remove that to get the newest file.<br />

So if you want to talk to your guild, create a &quot;Guild Channel&quot; and have your entire guild join it.  Passwording it would be a good idea as well.<br />
<br />
If you an unfamiliar with how to do so, here is the format.<br />
<br />
/join ChannelName:Password<br />

e.g.<br />
<br />
/join EQinterface:8675309<br />

For whatever reason, EQIM just plain stopped working for me a while back.  I've no idea why.  One day it worked, the next day it didn't, and I haven't been able to get it working since.  Even tried re-installing it, no joy.  Blah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unsupported Software? I guess that means that SOE has truely stopped development of it? :(<br />
<br />
It's a nice tool. I do agree it shouldn't cost 5.95$/mnth just to use it. It seems that once that was announced it would be free, EQIM production went to a grinding hault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its always been unsupported.<br />

Its not $5.95 a month. They toyed with the idea for chargeing but they made a BIG announcement awhile back saying it would be free and it has been ever since. :)</div></div><hr />

They published EQIM aa &quot;Beta&quot; and said it's free for now. They are discussing the price for it and levying towards 5.95$. After a bit of protest about the idea that this utility would cost a monthly fee, SOE made an announcement that it will be free.</div></div><hr />

i play on the localized server Sébilis (french)<br />
<br />
EQim works great but i can't get to see my char names correctly.<br />
instead of Kunis, in the selection and chat windows, i (and the people) just see something like 4b756e6973<br />
and, also, we can't add buddy, nor tell them, if they have an accent on their name (such as Hérisson :p)<br />
<br />
<br />
i know that EQim's no longer supported but pleeaaaaaaaaaaaaaase, just patch it. or push UBIsoft to patch it for you :p</div></div><hr />

I use the IM all the time, it's such a great thing. It loooves to crash when I log in to certain characters, not sure why. /shrug. And last I checked, it thinks that the Tarew Marr server is 'tarew.name', not the correct 'marr.name.' But we got a channel going for the people there, so it's not that much of an issue now. <br />
<br />
<br />
I am glad the IM is free; we already pay for the game. And the IM is sooooooooo unbelievably useful. I cannot tell you how happy I am that someone still pays attention.  Thank you thank you thank you. <br />

Below is a copy of an email I sent to several of the EQ email addresses, where they basically said to go stuff myself (politely) because EQIM was no longer supported.  If ANY of you have the ability to do ANYTHING with the serverinfo.xml file or could at least fix the mentioned bug with creating new friends on my server placing an incorrect tag, that would be great!<br />
<br />
Also, since it IS no longer supported, why not talk to the big guys and have them release the source code or whatever so that 3rd party people can pick up where you left off...  I'd love to see something more useful come of this app  :)<br />
<br />
Original Message Follows:<br />
------------------------<br />
I would like to know the name and/or email of the person who supports<br />
EQIM.  There are several really annoying problems that just aren't being<br />
addressed.  The biggest issue that I have involved the Tarew Marr<br />
server.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The problem with TM server was that, when EQIM was first released, the<br />
serverinfo.xml contained the tag &quot;tarew&quot; for Tarew Marr.  It would only<br />
report that TM was down.  It turns out that the tag needed to be changed<br />
to &quot;marr&quot; instead...and thanks to a nice and knowledgable guide I was<br />
able to change this in the serverinfo.xml and launch it with a /nopatch<br />
command to keep it from downloading the patch.  It worked great...  for<br />
a long time...  then one day I started receiving SERVER DOWN messages<br />
again for my server.  So I double checked the serverinfo.xml file and it<br />
was still fine...so I figured what the heck...and I ran the eqim.exe<br />
without any commandline options and it downloaded the serverinfo.xml<br />
file again (once more with the TAREW tag) only this time it now shows my<br />
characters and I can logon and communicate with anyone who was in my<br />
friends list.  The friends, however, were added as &quot;marr.friend&quot; instead<br />
of &quot;tarew.friend&quot; and work fine.  If I try to add new friends via EQIM,<br />
it adds them as &quot;tarew.friend&quot; which does not work.  So now, what I have<br />
to do to add new friends, is manually edit the xml file containing the<br />
friends I wish to add and enter the XML compatable code for their<br />
marr.friend name for it to work...  it is a complete annoyance and<br />
almost enough to make me stop wanting to use it, though it is great to<br />
see who is online real quick without needing to logon.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I don't care if you name the server tag &quot;tarew&quot; like they are now, or<br />
&quot;marr&quot; to match the file naming conventions of the logfile, friends<br />
list, UI files, etc (which to me makes much more sense - migrate it all<br />
over to &quot;marr&quot;) but whatever you do, I would at LEAST like to be able to<br />
add friends without editing the .xml file...  this is something that<br />
most people would not have the knowledge nor patience to figure out or<br />
do.  Almost everyone I know on TM does not use it because it has not<br />
worked for us for so very long.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Every single new person downloading EQIM for use with the TM server will<br />
just think that it constantly reports their friends as offline<br />
incorrectly, (because new friends they add are tarew.friend instead of<br />
marr.friend) so just imagine how many people aren't going to use it.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I know EQIM has been deemed free, and therefore you may not consider it<br />
important enough to do anything about, or maybe you just don't have<br />
anyone knowledgeable enough to test it with you...but I consider EQIM to<br />
be valuable enough to at least fix the minor problems with the Tarew<br />
Marr server...unless you are just biased toward us  :-)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I have also noticed some undocumented features within the xml file (like<br />
the ability to add a friend to a certain section, manually, and it<br />
allows you to access those friends from any name on that server you have<br />
created...  I was wondering if there were a more detailed set of docs<br />
with it anywhere.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The other major problem I have with it (am running on XP pro btw) is<br />
that once in a while it will crash and when I re-open it, it has lost<br />
all of my contact info.  It is so bad that I keep a copy of the xml file<br />
containing my friends list and copy it over when it crashes...with the<br />
extreme hassle of adding new users, it's a big pain...<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Anyway I would like someone to contact me as soon as possible to answer<br />
any/all of these questions.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just happened upon it today, and decided to come back and look if anyone had posted about it.  <br />
<br />
I think that SOE will never allow this as long as they require you to click the I accept to log into EQIM, unless TEQIM can incorporate this into the login for the plugin.<br />
<br />
I have too many years invested into EQ to risk my account being banned just for this convienance.<br />
<br />
I hope that something can be resovlved between the TEQIM developers and SOE.<br />

Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it doesnt, the trillian plugin seems to fall into a grey area. Since EQIM is no longer supported, but the coding is out there for it, it seems that SOE may treat this as one of those grey things.<br />
<br />
I use the EQIM pluggin for trillian, and I have mentioned that I use it to SOE people (even sent the link the file to one person) and so far none of them have warned me off using it.<br />
<br />
Soooo while its still &quot;use at your own risk&quot; I know SOE isnt actively hunting EQIM users (hehehe)..<br />

I haven't used EQIM in a while.  I didn't have any problems talking to people but I had a few anoyances.  I had to add people to my buddy list just to talk to them otherwise it would sit there forever doing nothing.<br />
I don't remember connecting to any channels....<br />
I do specificly remember that it would not connect to my guilds serverwide officer's channel.  (Some of our officers are active on other servers, this alows the users to go over to the officer channel and talk to an officer if there is any in EQ Land anywhere (the officers are required to auto-join all of their characters.)<br />
<br />
I was not able to connect to the serverwide chat channels for like the clerics (/join serverwide.cleric:cleric).  It would either give me an error or it would give me nothing....a blank line.<br />
<br />
This was back when DX9 was made a requirement, for about 2 or 3 weeks I was working to try to get back into EQ (3 reinstalls of 98SE, several diffrent versions of my graphics driver, EQTech emails, emails to my card vendor.<br />
EQTech basicly told me to bug-off.  My ATI Radeon 7000 with 32MB of DDR-RAM wasn't supported so get a new card or stop bugging us....and what are you doing STILL running 98SE??<br />
I never got a human in email a ATI.....<br />

It looks like with the maintenance downtime this week they are moving world servers around on their internal network. EQIM can't find Bristlebane (reports it as down when it isn't).<br />

I just realised that my EQ accounts expired today, and my mule was only still on because I hadn't logged off that ccount yet.

I use the prepaid cards for playing EQ (because I don't have credit cards) and can only figure that this might be the only thing stopping me.  Can someone tell me if there is something else I need to do?</div></div><hr />

I deleted EQIM, the folder, all of it's components from the Sony folder and from the registry.  Found EQIM again on the Sony site, DL'd it, and ran it.  Opened it, added a buddy....crashed.  Am I missing something?  Others say they use it fine, yet I can't.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only other thing i can suggest:<br />
<br />
...if your password has a non-alphanumeric (letter/number) character in it, EQIM won't recognize it and you'll always get an invalid login.<br />
<br />
If you are using numbers for a password, try changing it to alpha or alhpa-numeric combination.  Otherwise i don't know why it wouldn't work.  You've already done the most extreme fix that should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mareeuh</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No numbers in it  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's anything BUT letters and numbers, you will have problems. If you do have letters and numbers only and still have problems, try resetting the password.</div></div><hr />

Great idea :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most current online games do have a mail system of one method or another.  Some are simply emulated irc get/post methods, others are extremely flexible and work like an actual mail program.  I think EQ would benefit greatly from such a feature.  I hope they had the foresight to do this with EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qinadwen</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe ... you are only saying that, Inokis,  because you are retiring from EQ to go to EQ2  :p j/k<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope they will find some way to implement it into EQ also :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InvisiBill</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually it doesnt, the trillian plugin seems to fall into a grey area. Since EQIM is no longer supported, but the coding is out there for it, it seems that SOE may treat this as one of those grey things.<br />
<br />
I use the EQIM pluggin for trillian, and I have mentioned that I use it to SOE people (even sent the link the file to one person) and so far none of them have warned me off using it.<br />
<br />
Soooo while its still &quot;use at your own risk&quot; I know SOE isnt actively hunting EQIM users (hehehe)..<br />
<br />
/bow<br />
<br />
From the TermsOfService.txt in your EQIM directory:<br />
You may not create or use any software other than the Software provided by SOE to access the Service.<br />
<br />
You're right that they're not going after people using this (as it doesn't affect gameplay, it simply does what the SOE program attempts to do), but it is most definitely against the TOS. http://teqim.sourceforge.net/?p=letter sums it up pretty well. SOE seems to be doing what Lax suggested, and ignoring people who don't follow this rule since it doesn't actually hurt anything.<br />
<br />
It would be much better for everyone if SOE simply opened it up officially. Write up a few documents with specs for the protocol (Lax probably has all the meat of this info already) and let everyone make clients for it. With competition, all the clients would become better (and it would still require no effort on SOE's part). I personally know of some people who would keep paying for their EQ account just to use EQIM, if it were as reliable as one of the major IM programs/networks.<br />
<br />
The only downside for Sony would be the increased usage of the system (since EQIM has that neato usage-limiting feature that looks like a crash).</div></div><hr />

Also sounds like a good idea - and if they have had it before, it will be much easier than making a whole new post-system.</div></div><hr />
