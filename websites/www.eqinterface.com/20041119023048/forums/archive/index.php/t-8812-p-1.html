I am aware it does not suit non casters very well but i am working on one.  Also will change player window around so that red blinking box dont look so strange when you're in battle.

It roxor like no other!  You are a GUI Genius.  I've always wanted opposite player/target windows, it's like a fighting game, a head-to-head battle kinda thing.  The guages are supreme.  I love the design, and how the stats are streamlined horizontally. If I had to make a request, I'l like to see the compass encorporated into the rest of the Streamline UI.  Other than that, I LOVE IT.  It's going on all my chars.  I hope it survives Wednesday's patch!!!  *Two thumbs up*<br />
<br />
P.S.  Just a side note.  I don't know if it's intentional or not, but the spell gems in the hot button window align to the upper right corner.  And the black text in the Spellbook is sometimes hard to read =D</div></div><hr />

If there were a way to make it pure melee useable i would definately use it. Also, maybe make into different resolutions? Oh well, just an idea. Love the look of it though.</div></div><hr />

It is a very sweet looking UI. One problem though, until the time comes for me to get a better monitor I'm stuck with the 1024X768 resolution.

Fixed the spell icon hotbutton issue and the pet bar in group window.  Also addressing the difficulty in reading parts of the spellbook.  Working on melee and a 1024x768.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrmm... maybe I missed it but I didn't see a way to open the spellbook from the interface itself i.e. the standard book icon.  It's not a problem for me since I have a hotkey button that opens it for me, but after reading about the upcoming patch I think you need to implement one if possible.  The new addition to the spell memorization process utilizes the little default book icon in the gems window, and not having one obviously makes the new addition unuseable.  So, back on the point, the addition of a Spellbook icon somewhere on the Spell gem bar would make the interface completely functional after the 6/11 patch-to-be.</div></div><hr />

Works great at 1600 x 1200 btw too. Would love to see a &quot;melee version&quot; so the spell bar would be across the top of the chat boxs to make it complete.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">infinity9</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice new idea, great job man.  I really like the carbon-fiber look.  I would suggest a redesign of the spellbook, although pretty cool its a bit hard to read.  Also an inventory with a matchin theme to the carbon-fiber and the wave at the bottom.  It would really make your UI stand out more i think.</div></div><hr />

But I still kinda miss the fact that I can't cash in on the new spell gem list saving function because there is no spellbook in the window... anyone know how to add one, I'd like to do it today rather than wait, but if I must wait, I will because this UI is THE BOMB.</div></div><hr />

Love this btw. Would be great to get one overall version for Melee and caster types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkreapyr</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok a couple of suggestions or wishes heh<br />
could you make a similar buff window for the bard window<br />
and make the compass letters like green they would be more readable<br />
i used up someof my spam2 window for the actions window but it doesnt look right =(<br />
<br />
having tough time reading stats too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tekyn</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few are having trouble or having a hard time reading some of the stat labels and the such.  I am just wonder if you guys are running it on a 17&quot; screen, using a higher resolution, or maybe running it while EQ is in the Alt + Enter window.  All feed back is welcomed.  Thanks ahead of time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haylo</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love this UI and tried it out in 1280x1024 today. Sadly I don't normally run at that resolution so I couldn't use it regulary. Just a few observations. My monitor is 19in and I to had trouble with the font size. It's really teeny tiny. Also for the compass maybe brighter lettering and a possible loc indicator of some kind. Overall a stellar UI probably the best i've seen. Here's hoping you make a 1152x864 version ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Tekyn, I haven't found anything wrong since u added the spellbook.  The small text takes like 10 minutes to get used to, and I like it that way.  I was /drooling again when I saw the 1024x768 in the screenshot... is this being released soon!  I can handle 1280, but it's not as smooth as 1024, it would be perfect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jordaan</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another suggestion:<br />
<br />
Is it possible (at least for the melee version) to move the player's health bar to where all the other health bars are.<br />
<br />
Then, move the target window into the middle of the UI in some sort of pyramidal type box?<br />
<br />
BTW, love this UI. Functionally the most intuitive UI since vert.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Courtinae</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way to change the clicky boxes. Im looking to switch the ear spot to Ammo. Real nice UI =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tekyn</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the 1024x768 version should be out soon. Also modified the compass to be better able to read (hope it helps some) and also modified the fonts in the stats area to make it more readable. If it is still hard to read for some please let me know.<br />
<br />
As for moving the player target to the center and player bar incorperated into the other gauges, that is a possibility for the near future but that the moment i still need to fix some other bugs. :) <br />
<br />
As far as changing the inventory boxes next to the hot buttons, you will need to open EQUI_HotButtonWnd.XML with an editing program and do a search for: &lt;eqtype&gt;#&lt;/eqtype&gt;.<br />
where the &quot;#&quot; corresponds to the list below. Replace the slot number you dont want with the slot number you do (only the number). Then save.<br />
<br />
Inventory EQType:<br />
0 = Charm<br />
1 = LEar<br />
2 = Head<br />
3 = Face<br />
4 = REar<br />
5 = Neck<br />
6 = Shoulder<br />
7 = Arms<br />
8 = Back<br />
9 = LWrist<br />
10 = RWrist<br />
11 = Range<br />
12 = Hands<br />
13 = Primary Slot<br />
14 = Secondary Slot<br />
15 = LFinger<br />
16 = RFinger<br />
17 = Chest<br />
18 = Legs<br />
19 = Feet<br />
20 = Belt<br />
21 = Ammo<br />
22 = Top Left<br />
23 = Top Middle Left<br />
24 = Bottom Middle Left<br />
25 = Bottom Left<br />
26 = Top Right<br />
27 = Top Middle Right<br />
28 = Bottom Middle Right<br />
29 = Bottom Right<br />
<br />
If you are having troubles doing this or my directions are unclear, email me at ken-nek@excite.com. Plz let me know which slots you wanna change and i'll email you the new file you can replace it with. Also a new one should be out soon where you can switch to a second table of inventory items. Hope i addressed all the questions. ~enjoy~:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it possible to get right aligned buffs and song buff windows?<br />
<br />
And another suggestion. The black text on the dark blue background for the stats labels are a bit hard to read. Maybe changing them to a brighter color might help? Just a suggestion.<br />
<br />
again, love this UI. best I've seen since vert.</div></div><hr />

One thing i noticed, and would like to be put in<br />
as i cant see it anywhere,  &gt; the current weight holding.<br />
Max STR is there, just no current weight, would fit nicely in player window. =)<br />
I had to rename inventory xml, as its missing from there as well.<br />

There is no weight anywhere...at all...even in inventory...and it was on purpose cause I am a big heavy, lumbering, macho, shadow chicken.  I never really cared about me weight but not too worry you alienated whimpy casters out there with your delicate dry clean only robes and little wands...the weight will be added to the next update.  I am sorry my muscles got the better of me.  I will PUMP you up!!!:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalamaku</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 04:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just found your UI, awsome job!  i have been using vert forever, the one thing i LOVE about that program, is his clickies where he uses that cake program.  would it be possible to include an option like this?<br />
<br />
also, in a related request, in that area of the UI, would it be possible to either contrast the back ground behind the items a bit? would be purely cosmetic! hehe<br />
<br />
but awsome job, think i am making a change to this UI<br />
<br />
kalamaku</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vishuz</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had more of a chance to use both your melee and caster UI's... they are both great.  I love them... I've been looking for a good looking UI that just uses the bottom 1/3rd of the screen. I do have just a couple suggestions, though.<br />
<br />
- The secondary lines that move to show progress in exp and AA exp are too hard to see while the line is under the bar.  I know its small, and with the percentage right next to it it doesn't really mattter, it was still just something I'm used to.  Would be nice to change those colors to something that is more visible against the base bar's color.<br />
<br />
- The blue line for pet health is almost impossible to see under the blue line for group member's health.  Again, just something that I'm used to seeing.  Perhaps the standard red for pet health bar under the blue bar for group member health.<br />
<br />
Other than those admitedly small things, the UI is great.  I've been suggesting it to everyone I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalamaku</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">was curious, trying to play around with this UI and when i try and use the buff windows outside the UI the numbers/blue &amp; red dont show.  any help on why? i moved the player-bg with the buff codes, but alas was all for not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also another wee bit of news on the 1024x768 vers.

I've never used one because I didn't find a complete set that had everything I wanted and have it functional at the same time. This is a great UI.<br />
<br />
However, I installed the latest 6/17 DeltaC and there are two &quot;casting time&quot; bars. One in the center main console under stats and between the two 4 bank spells slots (where it should be) but also a floating one in the middle of the screen. How do I nuke the floating one?<br />
<br />
Also, is it easy to change the UI to a different color maybe by choosing RGB color values or is that stuff art assets?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can help you out on the spell cast bars perhaps.  Since I don't know of any way to mess with UI's other than in game and readmes, I did an ingame fix.  I personally set the casting bar to normal - 0 and faded - 0 so just the gauge showed.  Then I just overlayed the gauge on top of the middle guage in the main part, and locked it there.  Alternatively, you can set the fade to 0 and increase the fade time in the options window so it'll constantly be faded out.  Or I guess you could move it to the upper extremities of the screen so just the corner pokes out /shrug.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, added a tabbed right-click inventory thingy-ma-jigger.  Made songbuffs right aligned on both sized UI's.  Fixed color problem with buffs for 1024x768.  Fixed visibility of stat labels...i swear to god they are easier to read:p . (white with black outline).  The current weight has been added and uhmmmm I am trying to trim down the height of the smaller versions but it is not wanting to cooroperate.  Also fixed the visibility issues of the secondary lines in the gauges.  Also working on right aligned buffs option.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately i prob wont update the download until I apply the same chagnes to the melee version and get the smaller melee up and running.  Look for the update in a few days hopefully<br />
<br />
I do have two requests plz.  Keep the bugs and suggestions coming and to the 1024x768 and 17 inch monitor users, plz let me know if you think the UI takes up too much room and if you see any graphical glitches.  Unfortunaley i have a really big screen and when i try to use the UI i either go blind squinting when in windows mode or go blurred when in full screen mode.<br />
<br />
Egriffine, you can do what metro suggested, which is pretty clever, or do what my lazy self did, Just drag that window off sceen so ya never see it again:D<br />
<br />
Would also like to thank all users and those who gave input.  Without your help it would never be as functional as it is now.  thanks</div></div><hr />

Also on the pet issue i have been racking my brain for well since i created the UI trying to figure out what could go there since i got most everything viewable already.  any suggestions would be greatly appreicated.  <br />
<br />
Things I am still working on are trying to slim down the 1024x768 to take up less space but running into a few snags so its on hold for a while, a MP3 window, and a horizontal casting window.<br />
<br />
Kisak, i am sorry but i really have no clue as to what could be causing your problems.  Have you tried downloading it again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AloneStarwalker</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Tekyn,<br />
<br />
The Delta2.0 looks great!<br />
<br />
<br />
only got a few items i liked better from Delta1:<br />
<br />
1. loved the fact that the windows selector was hidden, i never used that bar...ever, possibly idea is to have a mod to put the spellcast window back there :)<br />
<br />
2. the left aligned buffs, and the right aligned bard songs..(any way we can have a left aligned bard buff mod for Delta2.0-1024?)<br />
<br />
3. Target Hp, i think in Delta1.0 it went: 100%    name.. not name   100% as in Delta2.0<br />
<br />
<br />
I really like the new pet window, it looks great! and i am a ranger and dont even have a pet.<br />
<br />
An idea for the multi page clicky window:<br />
<br />
how about doing 1st page like:<br />
<br />
[Primary] [Secondary]<br />
[Range] [Ammo]<br />
[Bag1][Bag2]<br />
[Bag3][Bag4]<br />
[Bag5][Bag6]<br />
[Bag7][Bag8]<br />
<br />
And then on page 2:<br />
put in all item slots.<br />
<br />
they will be minimized a bit, but would give you complete access to all clickies without anyone having to alter any xml files.<br />
<br />
and page 1 with page 2, could still work as a quick swap of weapons/items.<br />
<br />
<br />
hehe thats all i have right now, back to testing Delta2.0</div></div><hr />

But you realize, being popular you'll always get some criticism, so here's my 2cp ;D  I agree with the previous post about the bags in the clickie page 1.  I for one am not uber enough to have clickies on each item =P  So yea, if not an official update at least a guide on how to change those to inv slots?  That's pretty much all... being a Necro and using the pet window nonstop, I &lt;3 the new one.  The new spellbook rocks, the hotbutton spell borders look hot, the new spellgem window is awesome as well.  Love the new gauges too, it makes my exp look like it's rising more fluidly instead of choppily lol, a nice illusion it weaves.  I can honestly say this UI alone has kept me interested in EQ, and made me ok with the long grinds in the 50's /bow /kneel</div></div><hr />

P.S. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither will this UI.  dont worry about buff alignments and spell stuff or what not...i am working on em and the options to it should be up in a week or two, heres hoping anyways.

I use both your caster version and melee version of you updated UI... both are awesome.  However, even on the melee version there is a pet window.<br />
<br />
As a rogue I dont use the pet window, but turning it off makes an unsightly gap in the UI that otherwise flows together so unvelievably well.<br />

Anything you could do about that, akin to what you did for the original melee version?</div></div><hr />

On the pet window issue, i just created another chat window and put it where pet window was, and put most of the melee spam in it,<br />
using number only, Not perfect but it works.<br />
<br />
Just a thought for an update, could pet window be made into a bigger HP window?.<br />
I miss having that from my old UI, i dont always check my own HPs in battle, ( yes, i know thats the clerics job ) but i like to know, hehe ) and nice to have a big HP indicator )<br />

<br />
Things I would like to see done:  (these are in no way demands, just a wishlist)<br />
<br />
<br />
Remove the red blinking box when you turn on auto-attack.  It's very annoying and most of us don't need the visual clue when we start swinging at things.<br />
<br />
Perhaps find a way to incorporate the actions window into the design.  I use both the hotbuttons (for combat) and the Actions Window (for pull messages, resists, etc.).  I've been struggling with trying to find a way to place this back into the design.<br />
<br />
Provide an alternate for users to swap sides for the Target and Player health bars.  (I like to keep my health close to that of my group so I can tell at a glance if anyone is in trouble)  This would line up the Player health, group health and pet health in the same corner of the screen.  I also like the target being close to the place I'm about to press autoattack... just in case I target something &quot;no so fun&quot; to attack.<br />
<br />
Maybe provide an alternate 4x2 spell casting window without the spell names.  Compressing the space needed for spell window down a bit but keeping the same style as used now.   I know I usually have my spells in positional assignments because I started using the spell-presets that were recently added to the UI.<br />
<br />
Provide a set of buff windows with the spell icon and number on the left side so that they can be used on either side of the display window.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really do like this UI, it's very well done and has a look and feel I could really use.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your hard work thusfar.</div></div><hr />

There's a 1024x768 meleeversion.  it should be inside the 1024x768 folder. Hopefully.<br />
<br />
Sure, there are lots of things i would like to do to my UI and alterations/variations i would love to work on, but frankly i wish there were 30 hours in a day and i didn't have to sleep at all...but untill that day comes its gonna take some time for me to pump out these things.:p  I do thank you for your suggestions and plz keep them coming.  I do take them all into consideration and one day, hopefully, you will see em in time.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tekyn</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rebrof, the source of your problem is that you need to copy all of the files within the 1280x1024Grey folder into the Delta one.  All of the files (cept selector_bg) are the grey pieces for all screen sizes.  Then you need to go into the 1024x768 folder and copy the *.XML files into your Delta folder.  Finally, go back into 1024x768, then into the grey folder and copy the last TGA file, selector_bg.tga.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only things I would change if I had the first clue how to make UIs are the positioning of  selector window, spell gems, and buffs<br />
<br />
I would rather have the spellcast in place of where the selector window is now ( like a previous version you made) <br />
I use the alt functions in lieu of the selector window.<br />
<br />
Also maybe thought the buffs could be horizontal and set right above the bar that has mana, stamina, exp, etc..with angles at each side so it fits snug and forms a straight line across the screen.  Does that make any sense?<br />
<br />
that way everything sits on the bottom half of the screen in one nice and neat block.<br />
<br />
anyway thats just me, keep up the good work we all appreaciate what you are doing.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if you designed it this way but it seems VERY well suited to melee... Modded it a bit here and there (see attached screenshot)... Added a gradient target bar... Wanted to actually have it changed colors as HP decreased but than I thought, &quot;wtheck... the effect is the same.. only difference is not having a solid color at the start...&quot; Though I THINK ill try using the tint to accomplish this (though im not entirely sure it would work) Other minor changes were removing the chat title bars (I KNOW whats where heh) and eventually removing the textbox entirely...<br />
<br />
Xp AAxp and subindicators I also changed to one color (matching the group window) as the multitude of colors in the center I found distracting... Also changed the bar to a gradient map (shades gradually increase as exp/health increase or decrease)<br />
<br />
Something I want to mod into it but havent is moving the spellcasting gauge present in the melee version and having it reside permanently beside the compass (would require some graphic alterations) except I have yet to have found where exactly you coded that heh... or is that the default gauge?<br />
<br />
Another thing that would be nice is to have an invdividual per bubble hp gauge that resides in the target window... Much like the aaxp and xp sub gauges but using HP instead... Been trying to figure out how to code this in without much success... any ideas or was/is this planned?<br />

Kashale, are you just not seeing a target bar at all or just the gague?  If you can not see the entire thing hit &quot;Alt+T&quot;(might be CTRL).  If you can see the gague but not the background try setting the fade and normal levels to 100.  If neither of those is your problem then try and download it again. If that dont solve the problem plz post a screenshot.  thanks<br />
<br />
Kthist, that is a nifty idea.  That shouldn't be too hard to code.<br />
<br />
Metro and Moze, are you guys talking about the buffs or spellcast window?  I dont see to have a problem with buffs but i cant tell on the spell cast window since none of my spells are that long.  plz let me know which one. <br />
<br />
Moze, you confused the heck outta me:D .  But after reading it several times i think i got what you were trying to do.  If you want a blank empty gague bar for the spellcasting window then you are gonna have to either encode it or alter the selector TGA.  Else you could just move the spellcastgague where you want it, then go into the xml file and set the transparency to true and borders to false. As far as the single target bubble, just alter the gague pieces that are located in the spellbook_bg.tga file.  GL.  (i find it ironic you find the diff color gauges distracting yet your target and HP gagues are rainbow colored:p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kashale</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, Tekyn.  I finally got it figured out.  I went into the ym character's UI file and found under &quot;targetwindow&quot; selection that there was a setting for &quot;BG&lt;something-or-other&gt;&quot; and it was set to &quot;2&quot; whereas the similar bar for my hitpoints had that same setting set to &quot;1&quot;.  So I changed the target bar to match that and it worked.  Thanks, I love this UI.<br />
<br />
The only suggestion I'd like to make is having an option to have the spell gems on the right and the spell effects on the left.  It is much more convenient as a spell caster and pet class to be able to cast spells, target group members and send in pet commands all on the same side of the screen.  I think this suggestion has been previously made but I thought I'd throw in a vote for it as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your good work here  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moze Emdoyne</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did exactly that... than fixed both gauges so that they sit right beside the compass (near the target window)... No borders no nothing just the gauges themselves... Next question... for the selector window do the buttons/toggles HAVE to reside in that window or is it possible to move them to a different window?... wondering because Im thinking that where you have the toggles now would be a very nice spot to insert timers (room for 3 or 4 going across that black bar)....<br />
<br />
Still a bit confused on how to get the per bubble display on the target window.... heh...<br />
<br />
as to the colors...  it made sense to me...  and ive actually found the gradient target/player hp box something of a distraction as well... Might change it back to the way it was or go with a different color combination... The idea was to place the green yellow and red areas are key intervals.... Dunno whether im gonna keep it or not.<br />
<br />
The buff window was showing the overlap on the long spell names... think I fixed it by adding 10 to the width (makes it stretch out more so it might be necessary to alter the graphic length slightly for the background)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">egriffine</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Tekyn,<br />
<br />
Lots of nice changes from 1.2 &gt; 2.2, I love the grey and darker blue :)<br />
<br />
Changing your HP bar from white to red - thumbs up<br />
New spell casting window - awesome<br />
2 Page insta-click key bank - very needed<br />
Easier to read guages including ATK, HP - yup, nicely done<br />
Buff Effects align right - nod<br />
<br />
Two things that you lost though.. :)<br />
<br />
1) The spell casting bar was great in the center I miss that. Would love to see a slightly bigger verision of that bar there instead of main actions bar. Casting time is so important for a caster.<br />
<br />
I've never used the 'main' options bar I always use keyboard commands to access anything and the shrunken icons look like ass.<br />
<br />
2) The larger pet HP bar is great but the pet action buttons are way too small and placed in the very corner or the screen making them hard to get to. Bigger, better placed (inside it's own window).<br />
<br />
Is there anway to change the placing of each individual pet action key? Having a big fat attack, guard, follow up at the top of that pet window with the same large pet HP bar would rock. Lesser functions like &quot;go away&quot; under HP bar.<br />
<br />
Overall a superb UI, 9 out of 10. Use it all my chars now :) You releasing an updated version (including the spellbook graphic over reading material fix.zip) for patch changes today? =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kashale</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, I agree with the above post in regards to the pet window.  bigger, better placed pet command buttons.  i still maintain that buffs on left and spell gems on right make more sense.  at least have an option for each built in.<br />

again - thanks for an awesome UI  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A random group of thoughtlings..<br />
<br />
This is MY UI.  For the 1st time since UI's were introduced, I have always had 4 or 20 UI's in the folder.  Now I have 2, the grey and default.  It is great and I have a couple posts above that elaborate further.<br />
<br />
However I have read a couple things that got me to thinking while waiting Kandin Firepot to respawn.  Here they are.<br />
<br />
The compass size has been discussed as well as the lost space in the bottom right of the UI for non-pet characters.  What if the right side module were lowered enough to increase compass size.  While this might seem to throw the balance off of the entire top line, it would not have to be significant or really major.<br />
<br />
As to the vacant pet window space, I would kill for a timer.  Nothing fancy, just a simple minute:second timer.  Well maybe an hour:minute:second timer. <br />
<br />
Or, if the resizing of the right mod is too much work (just learning the fun and excitement of CookTop and the amazing destruction I can accomplish so easily and quickly) move the compass down to vacant space and put the timer where the compass is now.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, for us pet handlers, the existing pet window does look good as a stand alone in the top right of the monitor.  If the timer and compass are too much for them, they can stay with the existing.  <br />
<br />
Now, understand, these are just random thoughts, sugggestions, ideas, ramblings.  I seriously love the RED version of Delta and will not be looking for anything new for a long while.<br />
<br />
Wait.  There is a RED version, right?  My Necro loves Dark Red UIs.  He really does.  But they grey is fantastic too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Achrya</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a small prob with the 1024x768 on my 17&quot; monitor... the area next to the compass where the sta bar is... it over laps the group window button and visa versa... when they bar over laps it looks perfect.... but<br />
<br />
<br />
  When i select the group window like to click on a group member it covers up the sta bar... anyone else got this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RayzrShrp</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love your interface but I have one complaint that I can't seem to resolve on my own accord.<br />
<br />
The player window where it shows my characters name and health starts flashing red around its border in a rectangle a little larger then the angled part of it but only when I turn on auto-attck. I searched this site and you do reference it briefly but is this a known issue with a fix or is it a work in progress? Strange thing is it worked fine in my friends computers (both running 1280x1024)<br />
<br />
any ideas?<br />
<br />
a ui fan of yours</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orison</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this UI is kick @$$ but I have a few suggestions for ya... to make things a bit better for us 1027x768-17&quot; guys anyways.<br />
<br />
Here goes:<br />
<br />
- Get rid of the bar across the middle with the 'quick buttons' or whatever they're called (the stuff with guild/options/etc) to help lower the hight of the UI.  (I know I keep that invis on the top of my screen and it can appear when my mouse hovers over it).<br />
<br />
- Move the XP and AA bars to the right and stack them on top of each other next to the compass.<br />
<br />
- Drop the Stamina Bar altogether and relocate the manabar someplace else(maybe a thinner line under your health bar... sort of like how pets come up in the group window). This way you'll have freed up both 'tiers', the buttons and the mana/xp/aa bars, leaving more room to see the game.<br />
<br />
- Switch the 'Target Health' and 'Your Health' so that you have your own health above the group health bars (I find it to be easier on the eyes that way).<br />
<br />
- That HP Gauge fade that Moze made was pretty sweet, would suggest you use that too.<br />
<br />
- Option for something else besides the 'pet window' (perhaps the 'quick buttons' can go there or even an MP3 Player, or maybe you want to put the XP/AA bars there instead.<br />
<br />
- Also, I might suggest an option to have the 'spell cast/load bar' (where you click what spell you're gonna cast) go across the middle, above or in place of the character stats.<br />
<br />
Anyways, these are just a few things that I personally think might make this UI even better!  Use my feedback as you will, if you've already fixed some of this and I missed it then smack me later! I haven't really had much of a chance to actually USE your UI yet... just loaded it and had to log.  Nonetheless, the UI seems to totally rock... keep up the awesome work!! ;)<br />
<br />
Lookin' forward to the latest versions!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rikk Wolvenkin</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a beautiful UI, well done.<br />
<br />
I would like to see the window selector taken out of that space and a horizontal spell casting window replace it.   I usually just keep the window selector faded out at the top of the screen and a horizontal spell casting window in that space instead of out on its own would add to the integrated feel of this UI.<br />
<br />
That and the pet window (a timer there would be nice) are the only two things i'm not very keen on,  otherwise its a superb UI.</div></div><hr />

My older computers that I run EQ on can't correctly use TGA files bigger than 256x256 pixels. EQ stretches those  two files (selector_bg and spellbook_bg) to a size much larger than they should be. My question is, is there a way that those files can be descreased in size accordingly with the .xml files, so that it works? I'd do this myself but I have no idea how to edit xml files for something like this =(. or is there anything else that I can do?</div></div><hr />

<br />
:D  Couple of things Id like to see... If possible and im not sure this is anymore a per bub breakdown of the targets health much like is used in the aaxp and xp gauges..  Font sizes for ALL stats increased by at least one... as well as the graphic indicators...  its VERY hard to see those stats sometimes especially after playing a long time (Time is fun but well time consuming heh)...  In terms of buff icons I wouldnt mind seeing the name part of the gauge done away with entirely...<br />
<br />
Just noticed... On the target bar and self health bars is white hard coded as the color or would it be possible to change it to say black against the red?....<br />
<br />
Selector window: Might want to add AC to the hp indicator.... Maybe slide it to the left a bit and just add it in on the right...<br />
<br />
Chatwindow: It LOOKS like you did this (i modded 2.2 for it) was to get rid of the chat title bar entirely...  Cant tell for sure whether you did or not but having even a LITTLE more space in a chat window is well worth getting rid of a silly title...<br />
<br />
Melee damage/Melee miss:  Looks like you have widened the two chat windows by quite a bit... I could be wrong but what would the possiblity be of adding in two dedicated windows... One for Melee hits, crit hits etc and another for you being hit/misses/etc.  two little windows on each side of the two main chat windows should be sufficient.  <br />
<br />
Just some thoughts...</div></div><hr />

<br />
for me personally though, I think having the ac / hp / atk over on the left side around where the compass is would make it easier to see fast. That's from a melee perspective though :) i generally find myself watching the main chat and swaping weapons in and out on the left side, so having all the main information I need to see there would be easy. <br />
<br />
Another minor thing, have you though of putting the various resists lables in a color to match (and make easier to see fast ) like fire  = red, poison= green ect. ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall though, I would still say this looks to be the best melee (and maybe caster ) UI out there :)</div></div><hr />

I have no foreseeable complaints as to the way you have things assembled.  But if you want my suggestions on some aesthetic improvements... well then here we go!<br />
<br />
- I still think the hitpoint bar fades that Moze made are worth doing... they were pretty damn sweet.<br />
<br />
- The hot-buttons seem a little plain compared to the sleekness of the rest of the UI.  If there was a way you could do something to make the buttons match a little better... perhaps if you could make them look italicized (so to speak) or something along those lines - definitely not a big deal... but I'm nit-picking now.<br />
<br />
- Be sure to make a grey version!<br />
<br />
- Would be sweet to have some sort of programmable timer - but also no big deal.<br />
<br />
Keep up the amazing work!!  Lookin' forward to the next release! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">07-27-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO Delta3.0 seems to be melee friendly.  It looks nice and all, but I like the way it's all integrated in 2.2 right now.  In fact, I like 1.0 the best, EVERYTHING streamlined but /shrug, gotta keep with the times.  The main reason I'm not feeling 3.0 atm is the spell bar off to the left in that little tab, and the mana bar right next to it.  It's too out of place it seems, and it destroys the symmetry of the UI.  Also, the new gauge design doesn't look like it would fit too well, the gauges are too thick.  And, I can't believe you would change the target window placements!!!  They're perfect atm IMHO!  And the Window Selector at the top of the screen kind of destroys and hope of symmetry and style that the streamlined bottom half could achieve.  I know it's far from done and such, but for now I think I'll stick with 2.2 D=</div></div><hr />

But after a few alterations, and just using it day after day, I now prefer 3.0.  Why did i make changes to 2.x?  <br />
<br />
well it was a pain in the butt working with a melee and caster version of the same UI in 2 different resolutions.  3.0 is just one version allowing me to make 3 different sizes now.  Secondly, 2.x took up a lot of screen IMO.  3.0 is about 60 pixels shorter in height (makes a difference when using 1024x768).  Thirdly(this even a word?), the action window now fits inside the chat area if you so choose to have it visible.  Fourthly, there were a lot of little graphical things i wanted to implement in the original version of delta but i didnt have enough time.  Fifthly, i cant remember now, but it must have been important for me to change it  :) .<br />
<br />
I know that there is no way in god's green earth everyone will be happy with the changes, and quite a few will probally stick with 2.x.  therefore i will keep 2.x up for the time now with the patches and whatnot, and fixes to problems.  3.0 will most likely be up after tomorrows patch.  Here is the latest screenshot (shrunk down from 1280x1024)<br />

BUT... if I had to find SOMETHING to suggest, I might say to put the group window in the middle between the two chat windows... this way everything you could really need to use your mouse with is nice and tight.<br />
<br />
Hmmm... oh one other thing I just noticed.  Also not too big a deal, but you might want to consider labeling the F-Key #'s for the group window.  That way it's easier at a glance.  Also it makes it less necessary to do my 1st suggestion. :)<br />

I'll show you what I mean.  Also, while it's a really nice UI, it does seem a bit bulky for 1024x768.  I'm also having trouble perfectly lining up the Group Window, the Hotkeys Window, and the Window Selector window.  (In the larger version this was no problem, however it won't quite piece together in the 1024x768).  Also, I think the buff window is too large for 1024x768 in my opinion.  Just little things I've picked up on.  I've tried using the larger resolution but on my 17 inch screen it's just too small to read.  Overall, I am really stoked about this UI, very cool, very nice, very compact and very melee-friendly, just a couple of kinks here and there.<br />

Below is the .jpg I mentioned earlier.  Notice the stat numbers are all a bit off center.<br />

<br />
I want to congrats you about this UI, really really good.<br />
<br />
I have one problem of black box at the back of the UI, any idea of the problem couyld be ?<br />
<br />
I post a link to a screenshot to see the black box.<br />
<br />
I use the 1280*1024 resolution and the same for the UI, I think it is the default UI resolution ?<br />

<br />
<br />
just type /viewport and read the directions... if you play in 1280x1040 you will want something like this<br />
<br />
/viewport 0 0 1280 1040<br />
<br />
which is:<br />
<br />
viewport X Y Width Height<br />
<br />
you can mess around with it as you want and make the viewable screen as small as you want or as big as you want (only viewable to the point of your set resolution though), Good Luck</div></div><hr />

Stamina guage<br />

I'm not sure about the pet window, I never really did like the default as a necro, but we'll see how it goes.<br />

I really love version 3.<br />
The health bars look so nice!<br />
<br />
My main is a rogue, so as a melee it works very good for me.<br />
I loaded up a druid alt to see how it worked there, and only<br />
a couple of things jumped out at me. <br />
<br />
First, there doesn't seem to be an option for spell sets when you<br />
click the button in the center of the spell bar.<br />
<br />
Second, is it possible to eliminate the casting window that floats<br />
on its own since it is duplicated with the spell bar?<br />

Keep up the great UI. I am definitely hooked.<br />

Only one single complaint.  I think the group members need their F-Key labels (it just makes it easier when you need to hit up a fast heal on someone).  Besides that everything rocks! :D<br />

But I agree... if you could make a NICE looking blinkning red box somewhere that would be pretty sweet also.</div></div><hr />

I run at 1024 x 768, and it all looks great except for the buff boxes (short duration and regular)  My problem is that it is too long if you put them on top of each other, and when I try using a right aligned buff box and left aligned short duration buff box, the text is out of place on the short duration.  Anyone know how to fix that or how I could make the 2 boxes smaller (by about 1.5 buff slots).

<br />
really good job with the version 3 Tekkyn thanks a lot.<br />
<br />
In EQ there is now a key that enable us to switch from the 2 last targetted target. It is different from tab targetting between last target and you.<br />
<br />
This key is really really essential for a lot of class.<br />
<br />
I am asking if it is possible to have the 2 last target in the UI, i.e I mean get off the self target health and put the other on the key.<br />
<br />
Maybe I am not clear, maybe it is not possible, but if you can do this we can take a look at 2 target (for example the MT and a chanter, or the MT and another cleric ...) It could be really powerfull tool.<br />
<br />
See you later.<br />

http://www.mammothworks.com/eq/ui-new.jpg<br />

I really like this UI, solid work.  I seem to have too many chat channels though ;)  Actually moved my hits back to main window ( top left ), and me being hit to a clear window on left side of screen.  I now have chat channels in all 3 of the bottom windows.<br />
<br />
Only changes, suggestions ( tweaks I might do on my own if others don't like, ) are:<br />
1] Slightly increasing the size of the HP box, and incresing the font by one or two.<br />
2] Swapping Player / Target ( Player on left, Target on right. )<br />
3] Adding a clear and empty player window around the hp box ( for the flashing red sqare while attacking.<br />
4] Slight increase in the group member's pet health meter in group window.<br />
5] Maybe a different font for the compass.<br />
<br />
Just suggestions ;)<br />

I never really use the pet window to anything else than monitoring the pet health and I NEVER check my fatigue so that wouldn't matter.</div></div><hr />

I think it might be a function of there being no title bar... thingy... that you would normally use to move a window and has the close &quot;X&quot; on it.<br />

I'm a beastlord and usually care more about my pet's hp than my own, so I also made it a bit wider than the stamina bar was. I attached the file in case anyone else would like to try it out. I hope Tekyn won't mind that I've played a bit with his awsome UI... /bow. You are truely an artist. :D<br />
<br />
I have one concern. I noticed that when using the left-aligned buff window... the background for the buff labels is backwards. The gradient fades towards the icon instead of away. This causes the background to come to a sharp edge and looks a little weird when you have a long spell name that overlaps. Is there any way you could turn it around for the left-aligned buffwindow so that the gradient fades away from the buff icons like the right-aligned version does? I hope this made sense... <br />
<br />
Thanks so much for this fantastic UI... everytime I log in I have to sit and stare at it for a while before I can do anything.... it's just that good.<br />

This UI is the greatest UI i've ever seen!!! Great work!<br />
<br />
1 Question though:<br />
Is there any way to make the spell names of the spell casting bar &quot;tier&quot; -- so someone can read them? I was playing around with the offset and location, but I couldn't get it to work how I wanted.<br />
<br />

I agree</div></div><hr />

How do you move the buff windows? They start out in the middle of my screen, and I cant seem to move them anywhere.  <br />
<br />
Ok... this is pretty tricky.<br />
<br />
You have to find the rough &quot;middle&quot; of the buff windows.... and spam click (right or left.. doesnt matter) until you either get the Move arrow or the right-click menu.</div></div><hr />

below the buffs bare there is a couple lines of invisible pixels, you can easily grab on to, try it, once you find it, you set for good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would there be anyway that you could add in the style of the VERT Player window...<br />
<br />
I love having the way Vert Player Health and the group healths all together..<br />
<br />
Was the creator of this UI Melee? =/ it sucks being a healer and having to look all over for people's health.<br />
<br />
has anyone modded this? if not, i'd like to see the way Vert style player/group window in the style, imo i think that's the only thing that is missing..<br />
<br />
the healths are not player friendly for the healers that use the UI.<br />

As suppin said, I prefer to have as much of the parties health (including my own) together, for healing.  I moved some stuff around, and came up with this:<br />
<br />
http://www.sovereignguild.org/gallery/albums/album28/ny_delta.jpg<br />
<br />
Things Changed:<br />
-Target and Player health switched.<br />
-Mana added to casting time bar.<br />
-XP and AA removed from group window, added to target window (without bars)<br />
-Bars which used to contain XP and AA moved to top, and replaced with mana / player health.<br />
-Above posted changes with casting window / buff windows.<br />
<br />
I'd really like to enlarge player health to the full size of group members health, but that would require stretching the group window, and redoing the entire skin layout.  For now, this seems to work ok for me.  Let me know if anyone is interested in these changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Soooo... here's my version of Delta.<br />
<br />
http://www.triuneguild.org/durtyui/durtydelt.gif <br />
<br />
Changes:<br />
<br />
1. I moved the stamina bar under the HP's.<br />
2. I switched the target and player HP bars. I just liked having the target bar on the right.<br />
3. Added a pet health bar under the player HP bar.<br />
4. Removed the floating casting bar. Added a casting bar underneath the target bar (where the STA bar used to be) for those pure melee types that don't have the spell bar window.<br />
5. Didn't really like the &quot;mirror&quot; arrangement of the target and player name and percentage so I made them all left-aligned.<br />
6. Created a pet box that would fit under the target bar next to a chat window.<br />
7. Changed the inventory, selector, mp3, and map windows.<br />
8. Made the chat windows right-click closeable.<br />
<br />
Not many big changes, just a few to make it user friendly for myself and my guild.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think about my tribute to this fantastic UI.</div></div><hr />
