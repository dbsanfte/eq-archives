<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rikari</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 04:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, be prepared, im kinda long winded, and have had jpg files not load for me so am gonna attempt to explain in text in stead<br />
<br />
I found a group window mod that contained the following:<br />
Target Life bar &amp; %<br />
Player name beside Current 7 max Hp numerical value<br />
Player life Bar &amp; %<br />
Player Mana bar &amp; %<br />
Ac - Atk - Stam - Exp - AA Exp (all numerical)<br />
Group 1 - 6 with all the following:<br />
Group Member name same line as respective F# key<br />
Group Member life bar &amp; %<br />
<br />
Twinks Ive Made<br />
     1.) I took out the target window portion cause my hodge podge mod uses the resizable target window mod which i prefer greatly.<br />
     2.) I took the F2-F4 denotations (all previously grey and made them DK Blue<br />
     3.) Made F5 &amp; F6 light blue to be a visual quick ref aid so i can more accurately hit the right one in a pinch. :)<br />
     4.) I then moved everything up equally and trimmed up the total window size to accomodate for the newly created space at the top, having removed the target portion<br />
     5.) This is the part Ive been beating my head against the wall with, which u will soon learn, until this new UI skin stuff, i had ZERO exp with XML editing... Simply put, i want this final twink incorperated... i want to change my health and mana bars to use the tube graphics of the T.king Inv. exp bars<br />
<br />
Ive changed all the gauge info to be the Tubegauge graphics, and inserted the TubeGagueOverlay peice into the xml, but what i come up with is  All my gauges modified, but only one actual :Overlay Tube&quot; graphic hovering between group member 5 and 6, and half way off the right side of the screen.,Seems Im missing a line in my coding somewhere, but since im an XML newbie, I scraped that all together and am currently using the latest mod without those appealing gauges... (also, i have seen skins that use the same tubes, but have been thwarted on all my attempts to incorperate their coding into my xml file)<br />
<br />
If u can help with the coding or would even be willing to simply do it for me, email me plz... Any help would be appreciated greatly.. thanks<br />
<br />

Also a screenshot of the problem would help.</div></div><hr />

Seem to have deleted the failed attempt totally<br />
<br />
Im aware that the over all window will most likely have to be widened to accomodate for the slightly larger guages im wanting, but its a small price to pay for asthetics. :)<br />
<br />
Meant to post all this earlier, but started having comp problems and had to take some time out to spare it from my wrath, lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rikari</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Included is an image of the exp gauges i wish to use as my player, mana, and group member gauges<br />
Heres the link where various other T.King Art can be found as well::<br />

KaoUIv3.0 has a player window using the gauges like im after, but without the background extras.. Image of it can be found here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Etasi</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked through the zip file of your groupwindow.xml, but I couldn't find anything in it that referred to the tube gauge overlays you want, so I'm just going to start from the beginning.<br />
<br />
The first thing you need to do in your Groupwindow.xml file is declare the tkinvgauges.tga file, like so:<br />
  &lt;TextureInfo item=&quot;tkinvgauges.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;256&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;128&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
  &lt;/TextureInfo&gt;<br />
<br />
Then you need to declare the properties for each image in the tkinvgauges.tga file that you wish to use.<br />
<br />
The tkinvgauges.tga file that KaoUI uses contains two different gauge graphics. The code in KaoUI refers to the top one as the Exp Tube Overlay, and the bottom one as the AltAdv Tube Overlay. <br />
<br />
If you want to use the Exp Tube Overlay, declare its properties like so:<br />
  &lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;TK_ExpTube_Overlay&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
      &lt;Texture&gt;tkinvgauges.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
      &lt;Location&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;30&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;Size&gt;<br />
        &lt;CX&gt;149&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
        &lt;CY&gt;34&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
  &lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
If you want to use the AltAdv Tube Overlay, declare its properties like so:<br />
  &lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;TK_AltAdvTube_Overlay&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
      &lt;Texture&gt;tkinvgauges.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
      &lt;Location&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;70&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;Size&gt;<br />
        &lt;CX&gt;160&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
        &lt;CY&gt;28&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
  &lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
You can declare both if you wish to use both graphics, just be sure that you refer to the proper animation (I'll explain further in a minute). <br />
<br />
Next you have to tell your UI what the fill for your new gauges is supposed to look like, by adding the following lines to your groupwindow.xml file:<br />
  &lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;A_TubeGaugeBackground&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
    &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
      &lt;Texture&gt;tkinvgauges.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
      &lt;Location&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;100&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;Size&gt;<br />
        &lt;CX&gt;82&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
        &lt;CY&gt;8&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
      &lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
  &lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
  &lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;A_TubeGaugeFill&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
    &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
      &lt;Texture&gt;tkinvgauges.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
      &lt;Location&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;10&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;Size&gt;<br />
        &lt;CX&gt;100&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
        &lt;CY&gt;8&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
      &lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
  &lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
  &lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;A_TubeGaugeLinesFill&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
    &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
      &lt;Texture&gt;tkinvgauges.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
      &lt;Location&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;20&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;Size&gt;<br />
        &lt;CX&gt;100&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
        &lt;CY&gt;8&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
      &lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
  &lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
Now, you have to declare a StaticAnimation item for each gauge that you wish to use these graphics for. I'll just include one as an example. Be sure to name each one differently (for instance, GW_PlayerHealthTube and GW_PlayerManaTube), and to include each one as a piece of your window at the bottom of the file (for instance, &lt;Pieces&gt;GW_PlayerHealthTube&lt;/Pieces&gt;).<br />
<br />
&lt;StaticAnimation item=&quot;TK_PlayerHealthTube&quot;&gt;<br />
   &lt;ScreenID&gt;TK_TargetTube&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
    &lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
    &lt;Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;X&gt;-10&lt;/X&gt;<br />
      &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;149&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;34&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
    &lt;Animation&gt;TK_ExpTube_Overlay&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
  &lt;/StaticAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
The &lt;Animation&gt; part of the StaticAnimation is where you tell it which gauge graphic you want to use, so if you want to use that 2nd gauge picture, make sure you refer to the TK_AltAdvTube_Overlay instead.<br />
<br />
You'll have to adjust the location of your gauge graphics in order get them to display properly. I'd try setting the &lt;x&gt; and &lt;y&gt; of each of your static animations at the same &lt;x&gt; and &lt;y&gt; of the &lt;gauge item&gt; it corresponds to. You will have to move your static animations around, but this gives you a good starting place.<br />
<br />
Lastly, you have to change the &lt;GaugeDrawTemplate&gt; in each of the Gauge items that now has a TK gauge graphic, using the fill animations you already created. The default gauge draw template will look like this:<br />
&lt;Background&gt;A_GaugeBackground&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
&lt;Fill&gt;A_GaugeFill&lt;/Fill&gt;<br />
&lt;Lines&gt;A_GaugeLines&lt;/Lines&gt;<br />
&lt;LinesFill&gt;A_GaugeLinesFill&lt;/LinesFill&gt;<br />
&lt;EndCapLeft&gt;A_GaugeEndCapLeft&lt;/EndCapLeft&gt;<br />
&lt;EndCapRight&gt;A_GaugeEndCapRight&lt;/EndCapRight&gt;<br />
<br />
You'll need to change it to this:<br />
&lt;Background&gt;A_TubeGaugeBackground&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
&lt;Fill&gt;A_TubeGaugeFill&lt;/Fill&gt;<br />
&lt;!--&lt;Lines&gt;A_GaugeLines&lt;/Lines&gt;--&gt;<br />
&lt;LinesFill&gt;A_TubeGaugeLinesFill&lt;/LinesFill&gt;<br />
&lt;!--&lt;EndCapLeft&gt;A_GaugeEndCapLeft&lt;/EndCapLeft&gt;--&gt;<br />
&lt;!--&lt;EndCapRight&gt;A_GaugeEndCapRight&lt;/EndCapRight&gt;--&gt;<br />
<br />
Note: if you want to use this gauge graphic in another window, you need to include in that window xml file the Ui2D animation referring to the picture of the gauge (though named something other than what you called it in your groupwindow.xml file) and a static animation item for each gauge for which you wish to display the graphic. You should not copy over the texture info item, or the Ui2D animation items referring to the fill pieces of the gauge.<br />

The last part :<br />
<br />
**The default gauge draw template will look like this:<br />
&lt;Background&gt;A_GaugeBackground&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
&lt;Fill&gt;A_GaugeFill&lt;/Fill&gt;<br />
&lt;Lines&gt;A_GaugeLines&lt;/Lines&gt;<br />

&lt;EndCapRight&gt;A_GaugeEndCapRight&lt;/EndCapRight&gt;<br />
<br />

&lt;Fill&gt;A_TubeGaugeFill&lt;/Fill&gt;<br />
&lt;!--&lt;Lines&gt;A_GaugeLines&lt;/Lines&gt;--&gt;<br />
&lt;LinesFill&gt;A_TubeGaugeLinesFill&lt;/LinesFill&gt;<br />
&lt;!--&lt;EndCapLeft&gt;A_GaugeEndCapLeft&lt;/EndCapLeft&gt;--&gt;<br />
&lt;!--&lt;EndCapRight&gt;A_GaugeEndCapRight&lt;/EndCapRight&gt;--&gt;**<br />
<br />
and inserting the TubeGaugeOverlay peices were all that i had gotten through my trial and error learning methods was as far as i had gotten.. All the other alterations I attempted only led to unloadable mod, since i was soo clueless. :) <br />
<br />
   I had deleted the failed attempts before thinking better of it, which is why the overlay wasnt in my current xml file.. Guess i should have made that more clear.  forgive me? :)<br />
<br />
      Its currently being worked on it for me atm, but im going to go ahead and work with it too based on your helpful insight... If nothing else, should be a good learning experience for me...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rikari</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, after various experiments using the coding i was given, in different locations throughout the xml, ive successsssfully learned something...  XML editing and I just flat out do not get along.. <br />
<br />
      If someone would still like to complete the mod i was intending to do, outstanding, i will be overjoyed!!  Otherwise, im jsut going to stick with it the way it is...   Ive surpassed my patience with repeated failures....  Asthetics are nice, but not worth the migrane i now have, heh..<br />
<br />
To those that were assisting me, Thanks, but ima xml newbie and shall remain so indefinately. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rikari</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I thought I had posted the code for the group window to match the Jpeg I have of it, but i had posted the coding before i had altered any of it, and shamefully dont remember where i found it, or i would give the origianl creator credit..<br />
<br />
Anyhow, heres the xml file to match the jpeg i had posted. (My altered rendition)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astryne</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK here is where I am at with this.   However I am running into a problem that I am wondering if anyone else can verify.  It looks to me like &lt;Fill&gt; and &lt;LinesFill&gt; are stretched along the full width of the gauge and then the End Caps are added on top of that, making the gauge mostly unusable if you have caps with any width to them.  I have never liked any of the caps myself, but if this is true it makes them even less useful. Anyway, I am wondering if anyone else has seen this effect or if I have something else going on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astryne</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, here you go... This has all of the elements and everything set up right. However its going to need a little tweaking of the colors and perhaps some of the positioning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Ya werent kidding about repositioning things, but i knew that was coming anyhow... thats the part even i can handle.... i think, lmao... jk, i can manage this part fine enough... once its all arranged to specs and i have a full group, ill SS it and post an image for all to see ur outstanding job. :)</div></div><hr />
