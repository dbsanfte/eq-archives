<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Favrin</div><div class="date">04-07-2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As said earlier I cannot get this mod to work.  Obviously I cannot just paste these files into my mod diretory.  The directy is C:\Everquest\uifiles\Enchanter.  I copied all the files from the uifiles\default directory and placed them into the directory above.<br />
Now I want to install this mod and am not sure what to do.  Do I need to insert code from the EQUI_Animations file that came with he mod into the orginal EQUI_Animations that was in the default ui folder?<br />
<br />
The error log file is attached.<br />

Here is the link of the mod:<br />

<br />
First of all, NEVER copy the files from the default folder.  This is the most common error most people make when wanting to use UI's, aside from not even trying anything on their own.  Now, I didn't look at the UIErrors yet, and I still don't make a lot out of it, but if Carienn comes here she can help you out!<br />
<br />
EDIT:  After looking through your UIErrors log, I saw that you are having problems with &quot;LoY Window Updates.&quot; Basically, windows that use LoY buttons and such.  If all you want to use is the buff window, then all you have to do is copy the downloaded files into the UIFiles/enchanter folder, and delete everything else.  It should be relatively empty save for the 1 or 2 .xml files in there for the buff window.  If this doesn't work, which it should, post back here with some more information.</div></div><hr />

Ignore all the &quot;warning&quot; lines, it's just telling you that it can't find the files in your custom directory so it is going to pull them out of the default directory.  That is exactly what it is supposed to do.<br />

Those are your actual errors.  It means that your EQUI_Animations.xml file isn't current.  Couple options for you.<br />
<br />
1)  You can check and see if the author of the mod has released a patch for it.  If they haven't, you can try to contact them to get a fix for it. <br />
<br />
2)  You can fix it yourself, following the instructions in the Patch Fixes forum.  You'll have to go through and find where those things have been added to the Animations file.<br />
<br />
3)  You can say &quot;to heck with this one&quot; and download one that is current.</div></div><hr />
