That being said, when casting spells or using your hotkeys, which do you usually use more, the mouse or the keyboard?<br />
<br />
Also, feel free to post other suggestions, please!  I really want to update it, but I'm just plain not sure what to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">most of the players who were around for MUDs and the start of EQ are the most likely to use keyboard commands over mouse clicks..  so I would think later down the road thier numbers getting lower and lower.  probably 3 years from now there will be no EQ players who would rather /cast 1  than *mouse click*<br />
<br />
I would suggest adding micro text to the spell bar giving the command done on the keyboard to cast, just a informational tool.  or the keyboard shortcuts to do things like closeing the player wind &quot;Alt+Y&quot;  lower or raising the clipping plane &quot;Shift (LOWER)_ (RAISE)+&quot;<br />
<br />
but thats just my opinion :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellyana</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always hot button my spells.. and use the mouse only for looting and some targeting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It comes down to which is better at the moment for myself.<br />
<br />
For example: If I'm in the middle of typing something to a channel/tell I'll use the mouse to cast the spell.  The rest of the time I tend to use ALT+# (way easier than typing out /cast #), especially in hectic situations. I find it easier use mouse to target and keyboard to cast. This, I think, is probably a standard among those that mouselook? (In raid situations it is common practice for me to switch between different camera angles I've arranged before-hand and first person view. External camera offers more flexibility for on-the-fly targetting. IE: when someone needs patch healing or makeshift root crowd control if the chanter(s) are being overwhelmed in a pinch.) This is, if you haven't guessed already, from a druids perspective.<br />
<br />
My own UI reflects this useage, as the spellcast window is quite compact... it only receives the occasional click when the keyboard is in use.  Lately, I've had requests for bigger spell cast icons (for the mouse users I assume). As you've already began considering it, perhaps offer some flexibility - a spellcast set for both keyboard(compact)  and mouse (larger) users?  Thats one idea anyway. :)<br />
<br />
Another idea might be to offer something else in place of the built in MP3/Audio player.  There are many who don't use it at all... heck, maybe combine the spell cast idea with that - a compact spell cast window in place of the mp3 interface (probably more ideal for those keyboard casters since its way up top).  Opens up the field of view a little bit not having the spell in the corner there.<br />
<br />
Oooh, or move the spell cast left and down into that blank area?<br />
<br />
Wait, am I fixated with the spell cast window... maybe... a tad?<br />
(I tend to feel confined when stuff is floating around in my field of view area. hehe) <br />
<br />
Anyway, excellent interface, it's amazingly slim with abundant appeal visually. If I didn't use my own, I'd probably be using yours! (In fact, I've run it a few times on alt characters to see how it felt.)<br />
<br />
Mind not my blabbering, just trying to offer material for brainstorming up new improvements.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All good comments, and definitely the sort of feedback I am looking for.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons I ask about mouse vs keyboard is I was considering making a complimentary hotbutton box to &quot;match&quot; the horizontal spellcast bar of t.king/Remelio (not shown in that picture, but it's the same design, just horizontal instead of vertical).  That way, the two of them can &quot;bracket&quot; the target/player/group window, one on the left, one on the right.<br />
<br />
The drawback to that is for mouse users it will require further &quot;travel&quot; distance, which goes directly against the entire reason I had grouped everything &quot;clickable&quot; to one side of the screen to begin with, in my current layout.<br />
<br />
But, if more folks use their keyboards, ie keys 1-0 on the main keypad, then a matching &quot;horizontal&quot; hotbutton window would actually be much more intuitive.<br />
<br />
Keep the feedback and suggestions coming folks. And thank you for that which I've already received. :)<br />
<br />
(As an aside, but something that I know I find convenient as a ranger, my daughter as a druid, and my husband as a twisting bard {most obviously} ... we've mapped our spell cast/song keys to 1-8 on the numeric keypad.  Allows conversation on the main keypad at the same time as &quot;casting&quot; or &quot;twisting&quot; on the other pad.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have spent a good amount of time programming my self to use the keyboard more then the mouse.<br />
<br />
This is a neccesity I feel. In a raid situation if you miss an assist or cast a spell on the wrong target will trying to move the mouse into place it can spell disaster.<br />
<br />
When using your mousr to targer party member or click spells or hot buttons you can hit the wrong one if you have even teh smallest amount of lag.<br />
Think a cleric casting CHeal instaed of an instant cast Heal..one dead tank<br />
<br />
Using the keyboard the only way you will targert the wrong person or cast the wrong spell is if you hit the wrong key.<br />
<br />
Personally I would be happy if there was improved targetting of MOBS with the keyboard thus leaving the mouse for looting/inspecting/and inventory/window manipulation.<br />
<br />
<br />
So for me the more the keyboard is used the happier I am.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a paladin I mainly use the keyboard when casting spells. However I find that I do use the mouse every so often when trying new spells or casting quick buffs upon my self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brimztone</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally use the keyboard for all of my characters. Unfortunately, the lag in the game way back in early 1999 was so bad that using the mouse was almost impossible, not to mention trying to switch back and forth from the mouse to the keyboard to talk to people.<br />
<br />
Very few things I use the mouse for. A LOT of it can be done with the keyboard now. Ctrl-S is sit/stand, Ctrl-B is spellbook, alt+1 thru alt+8 are the memorized spells, 1-0 are the hot buttons, U will open doors, etc. It just takes time to learn all of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shiv</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, gotta stick up for my people.  I use the mouse for almost everything.  The thing I mostly use the keyboard for is chatting (which is why I prefer to use the mouse, so I don't attempt to use a function in the middle of typing something).  I equally use the keyboard and mouse for foraging, opening inventory (yes, I open my inventory with a hotbutton that I click with a mouse).  Opening windows, like story and options is done strictly with alt+[letter] (I never use the window selector window, I even have it hidden).  <br />
<br />
I do sit/stand with the keyboard, but I change angles and move around in combat, so I'm always using the mouselook.  Thus I have one hand on the arrow keys and one hand on the mouse so I can move around quickly and since I have anything I click on the left side of the screen (spells, hotbuttons) that's where my mouse cursor strays to.  I select mobs with my mouse unless I'm assisting, then I select the player in the group window and click assist.  All attacking I do is by clicking the [Melee Attack] button on my hotbutton window, in slot #2, the closest one to the center of the screen with kick, jolt, and snare placed nearby.  I only use the actions window for socials buttons and I never use the MP3 player.  <br />
<br />
Then agian... I dont use your UI.  I'm not a fan of MP3 player windows, horizontal buffs, integrated player, group and target windows, though open inventory I could learn to like.  I will admit your UI has a very good look to it, though I'm not a fan of viewports either.  It chops off some of the screen, and since I look everywhere all the time I have all my windows with a transparency.  If I took the time to get used to your UI, I'm pretty sure I'd learn to love it.  My UI preferences and play preferences are different from the majority here however.  Use it as you like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elghinn</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say I use both equaly for I am a two boxer. Playing two pc's at once both are a must. I use your mod on both my mains as well. I do however use the tt horizontal spell bar for it lets the compass kind of divide my spells dots on one side and nukes and fd on the other. That way depending on what is happening i can quickly use keyboard or mouse givin what is going on,and have little to no mistakes. I would like to see some changes being as I am not good with code and cant do it myself. I do not use the mp3 player at all its just there to look pretty. The target bar would look good there make it bigger more noticable. Get it away from all the other hp bars. Maybe put the stats there as well to fill in the gap that would be there and add something where the stats are now. For instance i have being trying to add the shield looking player life and mana bar from drakahs emulated ui to yours. Just for the graphics it would bring. No luck since I know sqat about coding.  :D  Just some other ideas i hardly ever look at the group members life bars anymore i just look at the color bubbles. Maybe put something like the TKing ones and scratch the bars altogether. Make them alittle larger of course and keep the percents in them. Well i guessed i strayed from the topic some sorry just my ideas.</div></div><hr />

I keep the selector window (alt+W) off.  Casting, targeting, spell selection, sit, loot, merchants, and any thing else you can think of i use the mouse.  Its ten times faster than using the alt+# keys to cast.    I'll be uploading my UI soon to Mix and Match take a look at it and you will see why i've chosen the mouse over the keyboard.  <br />
  You all that use the keyboard.  Mucho kudos to you.  IMO thats just hard.</div></div><hr />

I guess I just never got away from doing nearly everything with my mouse.  =)<br />
<br />
I played almost 100% by mouseclicks, it served me well as a raiding cleric over the years. The UIs I created reflect my play style.  =)<br />
<br />
I have been gone from the game for about 7 months, but I'm catching the bug again.  =x</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, when we use the mouse for everything else, it just makes sense.  Its all a matter of which is more efficient for you.  I use the right mouse button and the arrow keys to strafe a lot in combat when the mob keeps dancing around the tank.  So my hand's always over the mouse.  My hotbutton pages are also cleared up for more things since I don't keep spells there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maddawg554</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">me personally i come from playing lots of rpg's and such that only had the ability to use the mouse the majority of the time. <br />
as such i am very dependent on the mouse. when playing eq i usually have one hand on the mouse (even though i don't us mouselook) and one hand on the keyboard around the number pad. i have gone in and mapped a lot of my hotbuttons and shortcuts and such to any buttons that happen to be within a pinky finger length from there. <br />
but for targeting, assisting, meleeing, and all that other stuff i usually use my mouse, because of this i think it would help me and all others like me if u were to move everthing that is clickable (hotbutton window, spell bar, actions window, and grp window) all close together, which u accomplished well except for the spell bar. <br />
i love ur display of stats and ur open inventory window, don't think u need to change anything there. <br />
being a right-handed person that relies on the mouse alot ur ui is set up great except for that spell window. the overall look is awsome and it is all set up neat and clean i feel.<br />
<br />
thanks for an awsome ui and keep up the great work.<br />

That's the one I use now, I just plunk it down on top of the bar across the center of the screen just above the chat windows, over on the right hand side.  Fits beautifully there. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
However swapping between spell sets I use the mouse since I keep making more and more spell sets and can't remember what I call them... so I usually only use the mouse for that... or for a run by booking (i.e. getting chased by a train of Dwarves in Butcherblock heading for the POK book... I don't stop and hit the U.. :-)<br />
<br />
anywho...<br />
<br />
finally made 60 last night, in a LDon Group... anyone else notice the exp there is even better than in a PoV group?  I can't compare it to HoH or BoT yet, since I can't get flagged atm don't play enough time on to get a flagging raid done</div></div><hr />

Becuase normaly when I solo im clicking around there for pet commands, and use the mouse to cast in that situation.<br />
In a group or raid situation, however I use the keyboard to cast, but not usually the alt-# combo, but I have Macros assigned to 1-5 for hotbank 1 to assist,tash, scream to the group/raid that &lt;so and so&gt; is MEZZED ! etc. <br />
I agree with most that clicking can get you into a world of hurt sometimes in a raid situation , lol case in point I unmemmed Rune by mistake on a Telk fight just as it was about to start (guess who was first in the Rune chain), too bad spell sets hadn't been invented yet =) Luckily the spellbook pages are also macro'd. <br />

I pretty much use the keyboard for spell casting, moving backwards to pull the mob back while fear kiting, chatting and the /corpse button currently set to my G key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the keyboard almost exclusively.<br />
There are a few times where I must use the mouse, like YES/NO dialogs, but usually I can do everything I need to with the keyboard.<br />
<br />
I've used a bunch of UI configurations, and have realised for me I don't need  much more than some informative windows and chat boxes.<br />
<br />
I once was going on a raid and my guild really needed me to bring my cleric.  Well, I had been messing around with the spell bar and it was broken and looked an unusable mess on my screen.  I closed it and went on my way.<br />
<br />
Because I was used to using hotbuttons and shortcuts the only thing that I was missing was the text display on what spells I had mem'd at the time.  <br />
<br />
There are times where i use the mouse alot too  though.  Like when the baby wants attention and I can't easily leave the game.  Using the mouse lets me keep an arm free to hold her.<br />
<br />
I forgot to add, the new spell sets and all that came out after I pretty much stopped playing my casters.  So  most of the time I forget to use them anyway.  Is there a way to hot key them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jehanna</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, ever since I tore a ligament in my right wrist last fall (making toon movement with the number pad impossible) I have been running a Nostromo n50 game pad for my left hand (all movement keyed to that, and auto attack when I remember it's there) and have moved my hokeys to the number pad - so I mostly use the mouse when I'm not in combat. This is rigged to keep my main 60 warrior happy - but works ok for the 28 mage - and for him, I have a few offensive spells on the hotkeys, but most of the time I cast using the mouse, since the hotkeys also have those silly skills like sense heading and loc on them.<br />
<br />
Mostly use Mafoo's mods, so can't speak to your ui, but I think things like the game pad may become prevalent - it makes play a breeze, and since when you're typing you've got both hands on the keyboard anyway, it just sort of emphasizes the fact that you can't move or do much atm.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the mouse gives me tendonitis, which sucks, so I use the keyboard for everything I can.<br />
<br />
I rebound all the basic keys so that common commands are single keystrokes.  I use qwerasdf for the eight spells.  F7-F12 and `swap hot key panels.  I use the number pad for movement, sit/stand, attack, spell book and camera control.  Nearest npc is 'x' and nearest pc is 'c'.  Target center screen is 'g'.  Between those, I almost never need the mouse for targetting.  When I first created this keyboard layout, it took me a few hours of play to get used to it.  I had been playing the game for over a year at that point.<br />
<br />
Now that we have spell sets, I have most of my common swap spells set up for quick access.  When I die I hit &quot;/mem standard&quot;, and &quot;/mem voq&quot; or &quot;/mem nuke&quot; puts the appropriate spell in my swap spot.  The limit of 10 spell sets is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
There are a few commands that still require the mouse, although they really should not.  Dropping an item, for example, should not require a screen target.  Looting everything on a corpse should not require the mouse.  Yes/No in a confirmation box should not require the mouse (although Enter/Escape would probably be dangerous defaults).  The only actions that should require the mouse are manipulating container contents and buying from a merchant.<br />
<br />
I forgot to add, the new spell sets and all that came out after I pretty much stopped playing my casters. So most of the time I forget to use them anyway. Is there a way to hot key them? <br />
<br />
Yes, &quot;/mem spellsetname&quot; loads a spell set.  You do have to use the mouse to set them up though.</div></div><hr />
