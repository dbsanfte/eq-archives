Have a little respect.  Our Commander and Chief deserves more credit than you give him.  Besides, he is a lot better than his opponent was/is.  Imagine what Mr. Gore would have done after Sep. 11.  He would have run around like a chicken with his head cut off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi-tech goes a bit farther now days than it used to - yes - even some of the digital binocs have multiple ways of show data.  So even when lens covers in place, you can still get accurate information such as range finding and &quot;blip&quot; tracking of targets.  Additionally, what may appear to lens covers could simply be glare/sand filters.<br />
<br />
Second - with regards to the book - Anyone wanna buy my copy of the 2nd ed AD&amp;D Players Handbook which was bound upside down?  Seriously - I bought it from WaldenBooks when it was first relased.<br />
<br />
Granted - yah his book really was upside down.  But there's too many dynamic factors that discount it.<br />
<br />
Basically, its a funny photo...leave it at that without all the mudslinging.</div></div><hr />

I'd be skeptical if the image on the back cover wasn't flipped the wrong way. It's definitely a fake. Funny, but faked. :)<br />

<br />
There are the Bush-bashers out there, and i'm often one of them, and there are the Bush-backers, and there are plenty of them too (most of them, in my opinion, must be true patriots...) and then there are the bushwhackers, and we won't get into that.<br />
<br />
I wasn't aware the photo was fake, but thanks for pointing that out, I won't spread it as a true example of his idiocy now. It *is* a pretty good fake.<br />
<br />
 It's easy to pick on the man because of his record, and because he's just *not* the best public speaker, but i'm sure he must have *a few* ounces of competence in his noggin to have gotten as far as he has. Money alone can't do that.<br />
<br />
 Everyone is still bitter about the 2000 election which was, on both sides, a complete farce. Gore isn't nearly perfect, either. However, reviewing his own record, and his ideals, and his plans for the country, I saw him as ultimately the best person to lead a country such as our own. Isn't it enough to know that the *best* person for the job should be the one who gets it, the one who the people choose? Bush may not be an imbecile--but just because he's advarage doesn't mean he should be the one in charge of our entire country. And that's why i'm not a fan.<br />
<br />
As for this:<br />
Besides, he is a lot better than his opponent was/is. Imagine what Mr. Gore would have done after Sep. 11. He would have run around like a chicken with his head cut off. <br />
<br />
I find it not only extremely tasteless, but inaccurate. Firstly, <br />
absolutely no one knows how anyone would have reacted differently to that day, had something been different. It was an awful, awful event that doesn't need to be taken lightly like this. Secondly, your asumption that Gore &quot;would have run around like a chicken...&quot; is a biased stereotype based on your image that &quot;those damned liberal democrats&quot; are weak and inferior to the mighty &quot;Grand Ole' Party&quot;. The truth is, the only difference between the two, save a few very minor issues, is that both hate each other. As Vetinari would say, <br />
&quot;I believe you find life such a problem because you think there are the good people and the bad people. You're wrong, of course. There are, always and only, the bad people, but some of them are on opposite sides.&quot;<br />
That's right, kids, the Democrats and the Republicans are essencially the same party. Now that that's out of the way...your method of attack was one of cowardice; that is, you attacked their image, or their appearance, or some hypothetical situation of your own devising. Admittedly we've done that to some extent with Bush, here. But if you're going to assault someone, please, assault their actions, their ideals, their beliefs, and back up your opinions. I can't stress this importance enough. That kind of one-sided arguement is the *root* of society's problems, from bullies to bombings. Please. Think.<br />
<br />
In closing, I'd like to quote Bartlett:<br />
&quot;In the future, if you are wondering, 'Crime--boy, I just don't know' is when I decided to kick your ass.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Bush is actually exceptionally intelligent. I respect him for taking moral stands while the Democrats, with whose proclaimed ideals I agree more closely, do nothing except try to get in the way, and don't even do that very well. I am amazed at how much he has accomplished despite obstructionism in Congress, in the UN, and just about everywhere else. But I do NOT agree with or like him.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I agree with Gore. I like Gore. I am angry that he did not win, and I believe that the electoral system needs to be overhauled because the winner of the popular vote should not lose the election. But I think he really could take a lesson from Bush and go get some spine, just like the rest of the Democratic party.<br />
<br />
None of this means I can't make fun of whichever one I choose. Bush is prone to slipups when speaking, and it's amusing :) Gore acts like a pompous ass most of the time, and that's amusing too. Neither of those factors affects my vote or my appraisal of them as leaders but I still think some of Bush's quotes are even funnier than Dan Quayle's!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, AS OF LATE, the two parties have merged towards the each other.  However, when Mr. Gore was vice president he worked under a man who cut military spending with a vengence.  THAT is where I draw my &quot;weak democrat&quot; bias from.  You are correct that nobody could have predicted Sept. 11 and you are also right that no one can assume to know how some one would have reacted.  However I made that comment out of spite because without a strong military backer in the house I might not have my job, or my home for that matter.<br />
<br />
To be honest, the thing that REALLY bothers me about this country is this:<br />
<br />
People preach that things have changed for the better in our country.  They  say we have drawn closer and that this whole thing has made us better people.  However, look around now.. only 14 months after it happened.  Has anything really changed besides us becoming more paranoid?  Seriously, there are far less &quot;patriots&quot; now than there were in the couple months directly following the attack.  There are the same problems there always were with people.  Now maybe, (I think it was Tom Brokaw.. could be wrong) was right when he said that the WWII generation was the greatest to live in this land.  I can see where he draws his conclusion from.  In 1941, when Japan attacked us the country geared up, and STAYED geared up until the enemy was vanquished.  Nowadays we have come to expect quick and easy results from our military through the Air Force's (HURAH!) strategic bombing and interdiction campaigns.  That is not how we will work through this conflict.  Like WWII this one will require the FULL willpower of the people to be successful.  Right now I see a big divide in this country, between people who would take &quot;Half Steps&quot; and not follow through, and people who are willing to get dirty to get the job done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What does Intellegence have anything to do with how effective you are as President.   I feel Bush is intelegent but more then that he has common scence, and he has the guts to lead and make the tough decisions.  Lets see President Clinton was a Rhode Schollar, Carter was another intolectual type, and likewise Woodrow Wilson.  <br />
<br />
Clintons Presidency was one big mess up after another.  From turning down the three opportunities to be handed Bin Laden.  Bombing the Aspen Factory in Sudan.  The utter embarresment of Mogidesu(sp?).   Clinton was blessed with a good economy which was a hold over from the Reagan 1980 economy.   Clinton was just a form of Reality Televison for the masses of United States.  From his White Water, Monica Lewinsky and impeachment.  I personaly was glad he was Impeached for how he purgered himself in court denying an American Paula Jones her day in court.  <br />
<br />
Some will point to the good things like Welfare Reform, Balance Budgets and such that Clinton signed.  But all of those were done after the 1994 Republican's taking control of the House and Senate.  Clinton vetoed Welfare reform 2 times, then passed it on the third time shortly before the 1996 Presidential Election.   All but the first 2 years of the Clinton Administration were with a Republican controlled Congress.  <br />
<br />
The first 2 years while the Democrats were incharge such things like gays in the military, a tax increase from 29% to 39% for the top tax bracket.  Also in that tax increase was a raise on Social Security Taxes for the seniors.  Another part of the Democrats were in charge was the failed attempt of nationalizing 1/6th of the US Economy that being health care.   Under Hillary's health care plan doctors would be told what field they could practice in, how much they could charge on their fees.  Have you ever thought why so many Canadians come to the United States and pay for their health care, when they could get it free in Canada?<br />
<br />
Carters Presidency was one of the worst in the history of the United States, with the oil and gas lines.  Inflation in the 20% range in parts of the United States.  Also abandoing  a ally Shah of Iran which put the Illatolah(sp?) in charge and the radical Islam that is currently still in place.   Which lead to the long Iranian Hostage Crisses, and the failed attempt to rescue them with the Delta Force (I believe that was the force if my memory is correct).<br />
<br />
Woodrow Wilson who promised to keep America out of the World War I.  Then later reniged on that promisse in 1917 after a German letter to Mexico government was intercepted (cant think of the letter name off the top of my head).  That letter basicly was trying to get Mexico to go to war against the United States.  Wilsons dream was the League of Nations which was the first attempt of a Global governing body.  The League of Nations was a complete bust that had no teath in it, to put down wars or revolutions.  <br />
<br />
I personaly would take some of those not as well educated Presidents like Ronald Reagan, Abraham Lincoln and George W Bush any day of the week over Clinton, Gore, Carter, Wilson.  Yes I am a Republican and I am not rich at all my wife and I make about 32k a year.  To me I want to pay as little taxes as possible.  Why shouldn't the governement for once have to go with less when money hits hard times.  Instead of always demanding and taking from others.  <br />
