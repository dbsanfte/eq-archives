<br />
I have made some mod's of UI's downloaded here by laboriously editting text. Now, I want to take a shot at making a UI. So I want some sort of Interface.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

I have a 0.2.9 release on my HDD dated september of last year. This thing is so bugged I prefer to keep EQ running in a window and reload my skin to view changes. If anyone here knows the developers , I'd be willing to help debug the source, because truthfully it could be a great tool if it didn't crash every time I alt-tab out of the preview window, with an index out of range error...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply. I'll have to use his dll's as references see if I cant re-engineer the exe.<br />
<br />
hehe This is off topic but I just tried to Alt-Shift-R out of the IE window ROFL !</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;configuration&gt;<br />
&lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging=&quot;true&quot;.<br />
&lt;/configuration&gt;<br />
<br />
did get .net but now not sure which one the update installer gave me.does haveing .NET SDK v1.0 stop those errors? or can you only use program to get acurate pixle count an locs an sizes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont know really.. I have Net 1.0a and I don't get that error /shrug<br />
<br />
I would imagine it is asking you to put that code within the SidlWidl.exe.config file (open it in notepad).<br />
<br />
I looked at mine and I dont have that in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axeion</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the reply Drakah .have tried puting it in exe.config file .if have the &lt;configuration&gt; after app stuff it tells me their error on that line. i can remove that part an dont get that error but get save error or another when i save an get it tells me in details again i need that code in their . <br />
<br />
/shrug  ill try down load .net SDK 1 an see if that helps .had to copy all the locs an sizes for bank mod by hand then use wordpad to edit code .was long an boreing work that way but got the job done.<br />
<br />
*edit* downloaded .net Sdk 1.0a  it wount install n win 98 system .</div></div><hr />

I'm running 1.1 no problems so far<br />
can't seem to create new windwos( disconertning) does the 1.0 do that?<br />
<br />
Anyone got a link to 1.0 ...looked on micorsoft but as soon as something new is out they tend to erase the old verisons lightening fast.</div></div><hr />

Takes awhile to download (103 MB).  I'm on a cable modem and it took a few minutes longer than expected, but naturally that isn't too bad.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brannuer</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love using this program, but it does have ... quirks.<br />
<br />
I get errors a lot when starting it, but if I just hit Ignore, the program usually opens and pretty much works for me.<br />
<br />
Mine has issues with making the first letter of the Type Name Upper Case in the XML sometimes. This causes errors until you correct it to match the definition. You can correct it in the program though.<br />
<br />
I have to be careful clicking outside the preview window graphic or I get the index out of range error - however I can usually ignore this and continue. I wish I were better at C# so I could try and fix this myself, but I still really really like the ease it does bring to making my own little mods.</div></div><hr />

If so  might there be some way to contact them.  Maybe even contact the old programer for it.  I might think about picking it up and working with it.  I don't have a warm and fuzzy about it, but it would be fun to play with to figure it out... <br />
<br />
Would be great to get some updates for a software that could make all of our lives so much easier.....<br />
<br />
I might even be able to set it up when you make a new UI that it throws all the old stuff to the side, but still keeps what is require in the window. <br />
<br />
If anyone has any contact info please let me know and i'll see what i can do with the program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, author has been MIA for a year or two.</div></div><hr />

I'll look at it and see what i can learn about the programing..  Hope i can help out in getting it updated.<br />
<br />
Any Info that would help track down the previous owner of this would be much apreaciated. <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance if you have this info.</div></div><hr />

Can I also install the 1.0 .NET SDK?  Is there a 1.1 SDK?  Were can I download the SDK(s)?<br />

Thank you.</div></div><hr />
