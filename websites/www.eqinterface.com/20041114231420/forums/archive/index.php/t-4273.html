<br />
Dzeh, yes, it certainly is possible to detach the compass but I like having it built in where it is.  I'll consider it for future versions.<br />
<br />
Theramor, yes, 2.1 had the texture set as basic black as it was what I liked when I set it up.  3.0 is now ready and is textured.  Only the chat screens  remain black.</div></div><hr />

<br />
first, i want to say how great your work is, looks really cool.<br />
<br />
but i wonder what size your monitor has? 34&quot;<br />
I cant even read the small fonts in the left Text Box.<br />
ok, i COULD read em, but i dont have a spyglass on me<br />
while playing EQ =)<br />
no offense, but is there a way to make this letters a little<br />
bit BIGGER?<br />
Maybe the size in the right Text Box, thats a good size to read<br />
and hey, i have a 21&quot; monitor, doing fine with the original<br />
drakah UI<br />
<br />
could u please tell me how to change the letter size,<br />
ur skin is really cool, and i would hate it  downgrading<br />
to drakah again.....<br />
<br />
thanx for help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JarynVZ</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I appreciate the kind words.<br />
<br />
As for the font size, simply click in the chat box you want to change and type /chatfontsize 4 (or 5, etc).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jagz2006</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">grr!  i want to dl this, but my monitor wont let me go about 1024/768 res!  its a 17inch cheap piece of crap (cant even find the brand name).  my video card isnt the problem for sure (geforce 4 ti 4600).  is there any way to force a higher resolution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TANUVYEN</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i follow the instructions and whenever eq starts up there is an error with direct X and it wont work. i think it has something to do with the part of the instructions where u edit ur eqini.  in your eq directory from the old one to the new one that is in the download. also, you say to delete your UI_xoroduz_86.ini and put that name on the file UI_casters(or pure melee)_86.ini but my original ui character file thing doesnt have ini. after it. any feedback would really help, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JarynVZ</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to go to your windows preferences and enable file extentions to be displayed , you currently have them hidden.  <br />
<br />
Hundreds of people are using the UI with no such problems.  If you are getting a direct x error, you should make sure you have the newest video card drivers and perhaps re-install Direct X 8.1.<br />
<br />
Once you have file extentions enabled you'll probably have to delete your eqclient.ini and the UI_yourname_##.ini  in your EQ directory, then the jaryn folder in your uifiles directory, then re-install.  <br />
<br />
As always, make sure your video card and monitor support running in 1280 x1024 mode.<br />
<br />
I'm not here to provide tech support, but hopefully this will help you.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caead</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, first off I wanted to say it looked real good, I downloaded it and changed monitor to the size you suggested, but had lots of problems... first, it retained the old UI with all the boxes in the original spaces/sizes... even after doing Select Skin... second, LOL My char, when I removed items, was literally nekid =P and his face looked like Robo-Cop and Terminator with metal plating.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas wtf happened? hehe any help would be greatly appreciated, might try to go reinstall it now<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JarynVZ</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Follow the directions carefully please.  If you follow them to the tee, you won't have to set anything.  All the settings are in the ini and xml files.  Just log in after following the instuctions to the tee and it will be completely set up for you.<br />
<br />
If you have followed the directions to the tee, your video card/monitor cannot support 1280x1024 resolution.<br />
<br />
Jaryn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caead</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL Stupid me... right after I downloaded another UI that was just to see how it worked, and didnt install it.. however, it said it that it was an automatic installer or something.  I went back and redid the install process for your's, and am going to try it agin now.  Hopefully this time it will work.  <br />
<br />
BTW, a quick question:  the folder that we move over from the download into the uifiles in EQ directory, is that jaryn, or the entire unzipped folder containing the UI_&lt;Char's Name&gt;_&lt;Server Number&gt;.ini files?<br />
<br />
Thank again, hope to be back with good news!<br />
<br />
Caeadweu<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I tried it again, and this time my bard wasn't a nekid Terminator, but the rest of the skin didn't load. My computer should be able to run this screen size, so I don't believe that is the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JarynVZ</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Caead, please read the instuctions again carefully.  You only have to move over the folder named &quot;jaryn&quot; to the folder named uifiles in your EQ directory and then the other 2 files to your main EQ directory.  Again, all the directions are in the ReadMe that came with the download.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JarynVZ</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3.0 is now ready and posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caead</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry for making you go through all this work, but I'm curious about one thing: in the instructions for 3.0 (which I'm going to try) it states that &quot;You will need to rename <br />
this file to something like UI_Xerxus_86.ini For example, if your character name is Blizzy <br />
and your server number was 86, your file should be named UI_Blizzy_86.ini&quot; .  I have a question regarding this: my file in the Jaryn folder currently says only UI_Caeadweu_83, with my char as Caeadweu and server as Xev 83.  Do I need to add the .ini to the end of the file in the folder?<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Another question: does it matter if I change the amt. of Luclin graphics in Options to full?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JarynVZ</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Luclin and Velious graphics have nothing to do with your UI.  To turn on your file extentions on your computer, please seek windows technical help.<br />
<br />
Again, if you follow the directions to the tee and your computer is compatible, you will have no problems with installing the UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TANUVYEN</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have all the updated drivers and ofcourse the updated version of directX or else i wouldnt be playing eq at all. i dont expect you to be like a customer service rep like the guy who keeps repetively posting questions that would be answered if he just read the instructions but  yes ive done exactly what the instructions say , everything is where it should be, ive trippled checked. yes i switched the windows preferences so theyll show. im convinced its something with the editted eq.ini  . but you are not a customer service rep so im not gonna bother asking you whats wrong or how to fix it. but if u do ever come across any ideas then could you post any that come to mind, k thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I installed this skin the other day, and it's just what I was looking for.<br />
<br />
BUT (there's always a but) I have discovered this UI from Jaryn prevents from playing at all (error message from EQ when launching the Server connection) when you activate all characters models from SoL.<br />
It seems to support some, but not all of them.<br />
<br />
Is this, like, normal ?<br />
If yes, is there a plan to update this UI ?<br />

3. What happens if The default windows get patched?<br />

<br />
1) Go to your uifiles folder in your EQ directory and click on the Jaryn folder.  Now find the file called window_pieces04.tga and delete it.<br />
<br />
2) Now just download the new JarynUI Short Duration Buff Window (bard box) pug-in here (http://jaryn.ancientrealms.org/JarynUI-SDBW.zip).  Unzip the file and put it in your Jaryn folder and then start EQ.  You're good to go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skoriksis</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice UI, but I've found a bug. It's the same one that Chikkie mentioned.<br />
<br />
Chat 1 (the left chat window) has a glitch that happens where it starts to move left and off of the screen. The compass also has this same problem, and the memorized spell bar also moves up.<br />
<br />
As for the Chat 1, the line &quot;XPos1280x1024=0&quot; starts to go negative. I didn't notice it doing it when I was zoning, but I did get disconnected today and noticed it was off to the left by around 20-40 pixels. Because you don't allow your chat boxes to get the 4 arrow crosshairs to move them around, the only way I was able to fix this problem was to exit the game and edit the UI_playername_servernumber file manually and go back into the game.<br />
<br />
I haven't completely figured out what causes this chat window, the memorized spells and the compass to move, but they seem to be the only 3 effected so far.<br />
<br />
As for a different thing... my compass has the pasty white color behind the N-E-S-W where as your screenshots show a textured grey color behind it. Not sure why mine hasn't shown up the same yet. It appears that it's not picking up &quot;window_pieces04&quot; correctly.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps debug the problem!</div></div><hr />

This UI is awesome... Currently, i'm running it at 1600x1200.  Attached is a screenshot of what the caster version looks like running 1600x1200.  All i had to do was stretch the compasswindow to 1600 wide and rearranged some windows.  Take a look.</div></div><hr />

All that was done was extend the compasswnd to 1600 from 1280 and a rearranging some of the windows.  Since I've done it already, I'll upload the modified files.  Just download the complete jaryn32 files and install it.  Once it is working, switch to 1600x1200 mode and log off EQ, all the way to the desktop.  Now replace the your UI_CHARNAME_86.ini file with the one I've included in my attachment (use the appropriate version melee or caster file).

But just ran into a small snag.  I recently bought one of the new high speed Plasma Screen Monitors and even thought the graphics on it look to me a much much higher resolution the max setting for it is 1024 x 960 at 72hz(even thought it looks like 1620 x 1100).<br />

You could manually change the 1280x1024 in the ini's to what you want it to be just to get it to log in, then re-adjust the windows accordingly.  It will be a pain, but you can pull it off.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm an addict of Jaryn's UI (i'm a rogue, and love the melee UI).<br />
I just upgraded to 3.3 version, as I purchased LoY.<br />
Two pb occured:<br />
<br />
1) There is still no Charm slot in my inventory (neither for my caster alt, nor for my Main rogue).<br />
<br />
2) The brightness of the game has increased a great deal.<br />
(for this part, does the UI change anything on the Graphic card settings? - I have a G-Force3 card, which entirely supports 1280x1024 hi colors display).<br />
<br />
The way I have installed the UI is overwrite the former Jaryn UI version, without deleting old files first. Do you think that could be a reason for the Charm slot not appearing?<br />
What about the Brightness?<br />

Thanks a lot<br />

In the zip file you downloaded is the new inventory xml file that has the new charm slot, armor dye button, etc.  Try logging out of the game and deleting the jaryn folder before moving the new jaryn folder to the uifiles directory.  <br />

As for the brightness, click on options, then display, then move your gamma setting down.  I play with it all the way up.</div></div><hr />

If you do like it copy the XML file into your Jaryn directory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a quick question , in the read me file it states..<br />
<br />
So, once you have found your EverQuest directory, find the file in the same folder as <br />
this ReadMe called eqclient.ini.  Right click on the eqclient.ini folder and select copy.<br />
Now in your EverQuest directory, click on Edit, then select paste.  It will ask you if you<br />
want to overwrite the current eqclient.ini.  Click yes.<br />
<br />
I&quot;m not clear on where you want to paste the INI file you just said to copy.  <br />
<br />
Could you clarify please,<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

Looks Great like Jaryn said... <br />
<br />
Where is the XML file though?<br />

Simply follow the directions and paste it into your main EverQuest directory.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JarynVZ</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had a bunch of tells and email lately asking if I'm planning on putting out a new version or continuing to update this line.  Not really, I've been super busy with work lately and other random projects so I'm mostly just updating my own UI as I get bored with it and need a small change here and there.  <br />
<br />
When I originally put together this UI, it was last fall when Drakah only had 1 version available and people missed his earlier work.  He has since released a version similar to his earlier work and even put out some neat new versions that I recommend people use.<br />
<br />
I personally am still using my version with a few modifications since 3.3 as seen in the screenshot below.  I most likely won't continue posting new versions of JarynUI unless people really want me to, but please check out some of the new UIs by Drakah: http://www.eqinterface.com/list.php?skinnerid=166<br />
<br />
Here is what my UI is looking like these days: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lalaornie</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">*edit* ignore this post ~ even though I could set my video settings in the game to the correct values, I just checked my monitor preferences and they do not support the required viewing, guess I'll have to find a UI that does, lol, sorry for the post *edit*<br />
<br />
As someone posted earlier (in January?) I also crash to desktop with an eqgame.exe error at the server selection screen.  My problem does not have to do with following directions, as I have installed this and previous ui's on my husband's computer and it works fine.  He is running Windows ME and I use Windows XP, could there be some problem with compatibility?  My monitor and video card both support the correct viewing size, I checked under 'Options' and it is set correctly.  Going to look around and see if there is somewhere else to look for help or maybe try one of Drakah's UI's.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

It is still the default appearance, but everything is smaller, and the 'keyboard shortcuts' you said in the readme work. I dont understand ?<br />
<br />
<br />
It said my XML files do not match everquest files or something.  I'm sorry, I'm not too smart about what these things mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JarynVZ</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You apparently didn't follow the directions as it never says anywhere to go into the game and load the skin.  You don't have to do anything other that follow the instructions to the tee.  Thousands of people have been using this skin for a long time.  <br />
<br />
Your problem falls into one of these:<br />
<br />
1) You did not follow the instructions.<br />
<br />
2) Your video card and/or monitor cannot support the resolution this skin runs in.</div></div><hr />

Great UI, I love it, very functional for my bard main.  Was curious though:  Are you planning on updating it with the new tweaks on the basic EQ UI?  e.g. the targeting circles and HP bar colorings?  If so, it'd be awesome!  <br />
<br />
Thanks much!</div></div><hr />
