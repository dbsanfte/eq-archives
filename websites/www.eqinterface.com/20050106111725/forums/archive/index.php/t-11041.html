I don't really have time right now to do trial and error, especially since I think you would need to log out and back in for any changes to be visible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velisaris</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I'd like to know what settings to mess with as well so that I have just a ring around the target's feet.<br />
<br />
No blinking, no pulsing, no expanding, no shrinking, no waving, no swirling, no shifting, no spinning...just a single ring around the feet of the target.<br />
<br />
Any info would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing some of the settings in the TARGETINDICATOR.INI files are similar to those in the PATH.INI files (located in Everquest/Spelleffects/path.ini).  And the SOE developers were good enough to annotate the PATH.INI with a set of instructions.<br />
<br />
{instructions}<br />
<br />
# Distance between control points. If the path points from the server has gaps larger than this, <br />
# control points that rest on the spline containing them will be created.<br />
ControlSegmentLength=10<br />
<br />
# Minimum segment length. If smaller than ControlSegmentLength, will be placed on the <br />
# spline that contains the control points.<br />
SegmentLength=1<br />
<br />
# Texture is the filename prefix to use for the the line. It will use the EQ game directory<br />
# if a plain name is given, but the name can be a full pathname also.<br />
;Texture=H:\destus\Path\TubePathTraslation\Smoke4<br />
<br />
# FrameCount of 0 will cause 'Texture' to be loaded with just a .tga extension.<br />
# FrameCount &gt; 0 will cause the Texture#.tga to be loaded for each frame (no preceeding zeros)<br />
FrameCount=0<br />
<br />
# Duration controls how many milliseconds to show each frame of the texture animation<br />
Duration=10<br />
<br />
# InitialLength determines how much of the line is initially visible<br />
InitialLength=1<br />
<br />
# GrowSpeed controls how fast the line extends towards the goal.<br />
GrowSpeed=0.05<br />
<br />
# TextureScale controls how much of the texure is used per line segment. Negative values will<br />
# reverse it's direction.<br />
TextureScale=0.02<br />
<br />
# TextureSpeed controls how fast the texture is UV animated<br />
TextureSpeed=.005<br />
<br />
# FloorOffset controls how far off the ground the pathing line is placed relative to player height<br />
FloorOffset=1.0<br />
<br />
# ShapeSet is the name of a [Section] in this file that has a list of shape names to use for this line.<br />
ShapeSet=ShapeSet1<br />
<br />
#<br />
# Note: If the following sounds are in the EQ play directory they will be played at the appropriate time:<br />
# FIND_START.wav, FIND_LOOP.wav, FIND_ABORT.wav, FIND_COMPLETE.wav<br />
#<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd be very interested to know what can or cannot be changed.</div></div><hr />
