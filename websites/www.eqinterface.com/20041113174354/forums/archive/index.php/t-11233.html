Currently I use the TK intergrated UI as my main UI, switching to the WOW intergrated some times. I find I prefer the windowpieces TGAs you use with the Legacy UI better inserted into the TK intergrated than the TGAs from TK's Celtic UI. Mebbe it's just me hehe...</div></div><hr />

Except for one thing. Are you gonna make one like this UI? http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1207<br />
I'd like to see a L.O.E. UI like that because I currently use that UI and won't ever switch it out (great for us Bards, although I still play a Beastlord on my offtime). I like where this is going though Drakah, looks excellent. Keep up the awesome work!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bunkerking7</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mean like that UI in the link, only with the Windows and such from the L.O.E. UI. That is if its possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I realize what you are referring to, however if it was possible to spend time on it, I would, however, EQ gives 300% more options than the areas that LOE is for. Cramming all those options/buttons/bars blah blah blah into those small windows of LOE (live version) would be unplayable and unusable.<br />
<br />
I started off with &quot;Emulated UI&quot; for this and there was a ton of wasted space for things that could had been used wisely (like it is now).<br />
<br />
For example, the Player Window...<br />
<br />
That would be like a 200 x 200 box with an a big animation in it with the bar underneath. Now you know you are going to get those peeps who say &quot;why put in a lagging animation box when I could had put all my stats in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
...its all for a reason the way I make em...mainly so I can use em :) Now if someone REALLY wanted an Emulated UI, not thinking of functionality, not caring about loosing bars, hotbuttons, stats, some spell slots, etc. then thats fine but it wont be coded  by me just for the fun of it , it would have to be done because it is able to, and this one is not in that league really =p~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dstalon</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off I must say that I love this UI. It's very cool. <br />
<br />
However, I noticed that there were a couple bugs. The first one seemed to be kinda major. <br />
<br />
1. On the looting of mobs the screen is cutting off a portion of the boxes on the right side. Also there is no done button. the only way to get out of the loot box is with the close on the title bar. <br />
<br />
2. I couldn't find a close button on the title bar, not sure if that was a bug or intentional. The only way that I found to close it was by clicking the actions button on the hotbutton bar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keilia</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not having a close button has been a common bug in eq since the last patch. Is itthat way with other UI's or default? It's been happening to some people even with default UI =/ As for the loot window, have you tried moving it closer to the middle of the screen ? Just an idea. I do not have the issues with the UI itself,so not sure that it would be an actual UI bug ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dstalon</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Loot window is the only screen that the boxes are cut off. No matter where I put the window it stays the same. It almost looks like the windows was improperly sized, but there is no way to resize it. This is the only UI that I have this problem with. Celtic, default, and others work fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 04:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You got 2 options:<br />
<br />
1) Delete the Loot Window xml file, so you do not have to worry about having the Loot Window size conflict with your INI file.<br />
<br />
2) Read the ReadMe file and use the enclosed INI file ~or~ edit your current INI file and remove the information from there that reflects [LootWnd] information. It will rewrite it correctly once you are in-game to the Loot Window xml it has loaded in memory (Default or Modified).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ryoujikaji</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">awesome ui :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">storroll</div><div class="date">12-01-2003, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Drakah, Awesome UI.  I did have a problem the other day with My Warrior and the Loot Window.  I followed the directions in the Readme, and the window is now big enough.  I managed to fix the XML file for the Loot Window, it appears that the LW_LootSlot29 and LW_LootSlot30 have their locations reversed?  LW_LootSlot30 X Coordinates were 210 and LW_LootSlot29 X Coordinates was 252.  I switched the values and I now see all of my Items on the corpse that I can loot.<br />
<br />
So in the modified XML the X Coordinate for LW_LootSlot29 is 210, and the X Coordinate for LW_LootSlot30 is 252.  I don't think there is a #31 Box on the graphic.  Do they use the 30/31st Box?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dstalon</div><div class="date">12-02-2003, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tips on the loot window. I finally got it looking properly. However, I found another bug (or at least I think it is). On the group window, whenever someone is in a different zone than the one you are in, thier character name does NOT show up.<br />
This also happens when someone dies and goes back to thier bind point. Not sure if this is supposed to be like that or if it's a bug. Just wanted to let ya know in case you weren't aware of it.<br />

I thought this too. Then I looked really close, and the name is in TINY black print it looks like to me.</div></div><hr />

Hey Drakah.<br />
<br />
What do I need to do to implement only this into my current UI?<br />
<br />
and if it is not possible with the current package, will you make a standalone of it?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
 Qinadwen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aornie</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Totally can't get the loot screen to work.   I've deleted it at this point and am anxiously awaiting a rebuild or a patch of some kind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no patch, but I will let you know that the next version it will not have it in at all, mainly because in the back of my mind I knew that this may pose a problem for some people.<br />
<br />
If you want to use the Loot Window that IS customized, you MUST use the included INI file. Black and White.<br />
<br />
If you do NOT want to use the customized Loot Window, delete the LootWnd.XML file and do NOT use the INI file included.<br />
<br />
As far as any concerns otherwise, a while back ago I opened a homepage for discussions about the work im doing since it is easier for me to keep logs of what bugs were found by people, ideas, etc. I do continue to post here of course and upload the new files but if you want to make sure your messages get to me I would recommend posting at www.shakahr.com.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />
