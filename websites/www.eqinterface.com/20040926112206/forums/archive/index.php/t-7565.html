are adding a charm slot?  That wouldn't change the color of the file at all. I use Photoshop5. In order to change the color of an image you would want to select that image . There are various ways to select an image. But first you would want to make a copy of the image on a seperate layer and rename that layer 0. Do all your mods there so you won't mess up the original file. Select your image by using the alpha channel (select/load selection) or select color range or a marquee or even the magic wand (that's a pain in the a** though)  then while it's selected on a layer you can go to Image /adjust/ hue and saturation/ from the drop down menu. <br />
You can adjust it, or check colorize. <br />
You can also use Image/ adjust /replace color/ or image /adjust selective color or color balance as you get more familiar with the tool.  I always use brightness and contrast after I am done with hue/sat adjustments and usually don't touch the lightness slider on the hue/sat box. Remember that the value of the color will change depending upon the gamma of EQ too.</div></div><hr />
