<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssharlon</div><div class="date">09-16-2002, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to get these to work with Vert 2.1 crystal meth and although it worked the backgrounds are completely gone, all that remains is the text in the box?  any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tipop</div><div class="date">09-16-2002, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you install the TGA's as well as the XML's?  That is where the graphics are.<br />
<br />
If you try that and still can't get it to work, email me your spellcastingwindow, buffwindow, and animations files at Tipop2000@telocity.com and I'll see what's wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssharlon</div><div class="date">09-17-2002, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried pretty much every way I could think of to get this to work :<br />
<br />
1.  tried using all your files and modifiying the animation file with instructions from both install notes.<br />
<br />
2.  tried using the files but only the install notes form one of them (tried both independantly)<br />
<br />
3.  tried using the included animation file as well.<br />
<br />
I guess I will send you my files via email, but basically its just the included vert 2.2 crystal meth animation files with the edits you call for as stated above,  I also have tried them with the tking gems and without and always get the same results.   Stranglely enough when I do make the edits as called by both files I error out and revert to default.   Thanks for any help you can provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tipop</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, go ahead and send `em to me and I'll install your files and see what happens over here.<br />
<br />
Someone else tried these mods and had no problems at all, which is why I moved it over to the &quot;Released&quot; area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krotus</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So whats the scoop with these windows?<br />
Look awesome and wanna try em<br />
Will the alteerations to anim file work as described in the readme?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tipop</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two other people have installed them with no difficulties.  I haven't gotten an email from Ssharlon yet, so I don't know what is causing his problem yet.<br />
<br />
Give it a try and see.  Just install into a different directory so you can undo the changes easily if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssharlon</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gonna try one more time now and then ill send you my files,   got a nice clean version of vert 2.2 and really want to use your files so wish me luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xinen</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are long names meant to fall below out of the outline of the background? Like Koadic's Endless Interlect, the interlect gets cut off and sent to the bottom which is really annoying.  Do you think you could configure it so it just cuts off part of the end like -lect or something so it fits correctly into each buff icon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evilrulz</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea I have the same problem on mine, the KEI buff drops the intellect to a 2nd line and makes things pretty pretty wierd. If theres a way to make it truncate long buffs id find that much more preferable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xinen</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A friend of mine had his cut off the end the the real long ones. So i'd be Koadic's Endless Inter.  You can still tell what buff it is easy and it looks neat and good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tipop</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure how to do that.  I'll tinker with the size attribute and see what I can come up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalamos</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure where the issue is, but there seems to be something in Vert's 2.2 mods that makes alterations to the buff window not work.  I tried installing Remelio's buff window that I really like with Vert 2.2 and had similar problems.  Just a blank box with the text descroption of the buff.  No icon and no background color.  Also, you can't click buffs off.<br />
<br />
I think there's something else in the animation file that botches it up.  Simply changing the .tga file reference for blueiconbackground and rediconbackground portion of the animation file doesn't do it.   I hope a solution is found cause I'm not a big fan of Vert's buff window, but the rest of the mod rules!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalamos</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I know the fix for ssharlon's problem.  Try making the window a bit wider, or change the window setting so you can alter it by dragging the edges.  Then drag the right side out until you can see the icons and background.  This worked for me on a similar buff window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wandor</div><div class="date">10-14-2002, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You probably need to update Vert's animations file to get the right backgrounds to work with the buff window.</div></div><hr />
