<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">truth2k</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The list of New Downloads on the main page is great to see what's been submitted lately, but there's a number of people who like to update their UIs on what seems to be a daily basis at times.<br />
<br />
Is there any way we could seperate the updates from the actual new submissions?  Otherwise this list almost gets to feel like people throwing infomercials at you again and again, trying to sell their product.<br />
<br />
I mean, I know what's around, and it's nice they're keeping their UIs up to date, but what I'd really like to see represented are the new ideas.</div></div><hr />

You’re seeing a lot of updates because of the recent patch. I think I'll keep it how it is for now. I personally like to see what’s new if it’s an update or an all together new interface.<br />
