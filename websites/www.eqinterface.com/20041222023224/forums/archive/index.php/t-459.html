<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mileron</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, I've not had any problems with actual window mods.<br />
However, if i use something such as the Lambent_blue mod by Kudane, or Floop! by Tephrox, I have problems.<br />
<br />
I made a copy of my default uifiles folder.  Pasted it.  Then I unzipped the files from the Floop! zip file into that folder.  Logged in.  /loadskin floop.  The window arrangement itself changed a tad.  Log out.  Log back in.  The window selector is blue now, as are the inventory hotbuttons I've made, and some of the window outlines.  But no cool background.  So I loadskin floop again, and log out.  Restart PC.  Re-log in.  Same problem.<br />
I can take things like the updated tracking (for non-rangers) window, or the updated player info windows, and get something changed.  However, whenever I apply a full modification skin (including the one from EQDruids at http://pub50.ezboard.com/feqdruids24038frm1.showMessage?topicID=1497.topic , to make sure I wasn't nuts), I only get the fringe benefits of the mod.<br />
Little curly-cues of color.<br />
<br />
Am I doing anything wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arantius</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As if this could surprise anyone, VI screwed up.  See the second (at time I'm writing this) news post on www.eqinterface.com.  Oh hell I might as well quote it right here:<br />
<br />
Post Patch Addendum: Something has changed with the &quot;default&quot; backgrounds only 1 of the 2 background images seem to be loading from &quot;skin&quot; files. I am sure they will be fixing it shortly, soo yes you installed it correctly if your still seeing grey hot buttons and inventory screen background.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, with Verant caching the graphics now, it is like the files window_pieces01.tga and wnd_bg_light_rock.tga don't want to load up because they are initially loaded by the character select screen, so any skins/mods that use those 2 files will not work correctly for the time being..&quot; (per Oguler, thanks Oguler)<br />
<br />
<br />
This personally pissed the hell out of me, because I had changed the linesfill image, to put the blue line in my XP bar back in the middle where it used to be, and got rid of those way-too-small-to-see-much-less-try-to-count tick marks they added.  They broke that and I spent hours trying to fix it before I read this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just take your modded window_pieces01.tga and rename it, then add a new texture definition to the EQUI_animations.xml, as well as new definitions for the new gauges, having them point to the new file, but using all the same dimensions as the old gauge types.<br />
<br />
This should work as long as you don't change the SIZE of the gauges.</div></div><hr />
