<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's basically what it is. Instead of describing it, which would be rather tricky, i'll just post a mock up i did using my m4d PSP sk1llz. Hah. Casa out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Casa,  I see from your graphic where you want to put the spell gems, the Hotkeys and the Bars but where did you want the Buff you mention in the Subject line of your message?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah bugger, it does say buff, doesn't it? i actually didn't mean for it to do so...but if this is possible, i suppose it would be a worthy addition. I think that those cool compressed buff windows--the ones that look like wide buttons that show a small buff icon and the buff name--would be ideal for this mod, with 10 displayable buffs stacking with 2 columns of 5 icons. I guess you could put it immediatly below the hotkeys. The important part of this mod is that everything &quot;line up&quot; and take up as little room as possible--and again, if the hotkeys aren't do able, then leave them out. Thanks to all those interested!:nana: casa out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should not be a problem.  Actually the Hotkeys will probably be the easiest part to make up.<br />
<br />
I will get started on it today and see how far I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crikey, word dislexia today. I meant to say that if the buff window was undoable, than forget it. Thanks again for your help, and i look forward to see what you can do! Casa out:nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any luck?:o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Casa,  I am nearly done with your mod but I need to what the 4 bars you are showing in the graphic are?  Just let me know and I will get it wrapped up and put it up here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome! i'm glad you're still working on it and even moreso that it's nearly done. The upper left bar is the casting time bar, which probably would only be up when you're casting (duh:P) but if you can figure out a way to have an empty bar in its place while you're not casting, to make the thing look &quot;even&quot; that would be cool. The upper right bar is the mana bar, the lower left is the stamina bar, and the lower right is the hp bar. That should be all; if you need any more info just ask, and thanks again for making this mod!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what I was able to come up with.  Let me know if this works for you and I will send it up in my next message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, looks great! it's almost..perfect! Just what i wanted. Thanks so much for making it. The only thing i'd ask is if you're able to center the hotbar scroll buttons, it would look a bit more even--other than that, i can't wait to try it out. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you could make it look even better (maybe) if you incorporated the &quot;square button&quot; mod...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, Here it is.  I have centered the Page scroll buttons.  <br />
There are three files included in the Zip.  The two XML file are the files for the window you want.  Copy them to your new directory and go.  Once you load the new skin though, you will need to re-align the two windows again.  Unfortunately due to some of the limitations that VI has in the new UI everything could not be put into a single window.  But with the two new windows you can put them together and you have the window you wanted.<br />
<br />
Also I have included the TGA file that will allow the spell gems to have squared off corners if anyone wants that as well.  But this is not needed and the other two files will work with or with out this file being extracted.  So it is up to you all whether you use it or not.  <br />
<br />
Let me know if this works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good idea, that is a cool mod. Actually, if i'm correct as to how he's making it, any spell gem you have installed would work on this. Since the space needed to accomodate the new, blobby gems is large, any other gem mod (which works independantly of this mod since a gem graphic mod is tga controlled and not xml) would show up and work fine with this mod. I think. One thing that would be cool to see would be a version of this scrunched down for the best fit of the older, &quot;pointy&quot; gems, which many people use. It seems to me that this would allow for an even more compact, functional mod. Anyway, these are just thoughts, good work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will look into compacting ti down some more tomorrow...</div></div><hr />

I have a request for you, once you are finished creating the window for Casanunda.  <br />
<br />
I like the concept of the window above that you are working on for Casanunda.  But I also like the Hotbutton + Inventory window that was created by Guardiangimp.  Is there a possibility of combining the 2 concepts into one window?  <br />
<br />
Hotkey + Spell gems + Inventory (http://www.geocities.com/singine93/page5.html) <br />
<br />
I would like it to look something similar to what I've cut and pasted (Obviously the box would be one continuous form instead of the cut and past of the one pictured in the link.)<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Amojoman,  I can probably build this for you but the one problem is that the Hotbuttons and the Spell gem buttons have to be separate windows.  VI has hard coded the functions of these different buttons into their respective windows.  But what could be done with transparancy is to build it so that one windows fits right on top of the other.  That way when you are looking at them they would appear to be a single window.  Let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya know what ? i think that is The mod where Kudane's hexagonal gems would be useful and pretty :)<br />
<br />
I wonder if how it would be to have the &quot; &lt;- # -&gt; &quot; on top of hot buttons ,  being struck between the bottom 2 jauges</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey Sylviania,  I thought about that too with the Scroll buttons.  Started working on that this morning.  Will see how it looks later.<br />
<br />
Also looking at some of the other Spell gems shapes and stuff to see how they would look with this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I am looking at compacting this whole thing a little more as well.  One thing with that though is that I will have to make it work more with one Spell Gem shape that others.  The reason for this is that not all of the Spell Gem shapes will look good compacted down.  So I will let you all know when I get there which spell gems work best and which will probably not work real well.  I can tell you now though, the squared off corner Spell Gem shape will not compact much at all.  The shapes are pretty big to start with and already they are overlapping with in this current version. so they will probably not work well when I do get the Compacted version done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, i think kud's hexagonal gems would fit nicely--i think the corners wouldn't overlap at all. Try it out, post screen, see what it looks like! <br />
<br />
I also think now that the hotkey page number and arrows would probably look better above the hotkeys, since it would give it a more &quot;divided&quot; look. Looks good now, though ^.^<br />
<br />
And kudane, where did you get that kewl texture from your screenshot? I like it!<br />
<br />
Finally, i was wondering if we'd see a windowed version of this mod. I know it's still in development, and i don't even know if a windowed version is possible since it seems they have to be in two seperate ones, but i think at least for my tastes, having everything in windows would look more uniform. But this, again, is just another idea. We don't want to kill you with work, chronwaas! Again, i'm infinately thankful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Casanunda,  Glad you like it so far.  I am also looking to see if I can find a way to make it appear to be windowed.  I will let you know what I find out.<br />
<br />
I agree with you about that background of Kudane's.  I like the Stone Wall look it has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here is the compacted mod,  Let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
I have made this mod using the hexagonal spell gems.  I have checked on the other spell gem shapes to see how they look and it appears that the original oval shaped gems look good (and I might actually be able to compact it even more with those, but I like the HEX shaped ones).  The Squared off Spell gems look ok as well.  <br />
<br />
I am still working on the other stuff but keep the suggestions coming.  Let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome job again, as usual. Perhaps you could see how you can compact them for the original small pointy spell gems they first had on test before the ui went live. These work just fine for me, and would probably allow you to compact even more. If you need the file of the old gems i can send it to you, or give you a link to the file on this site, it should be under the spell gems forum. Thanks again, looking good!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup I am already working on an even more compact version.  It will be a lot smaller than even this version.  So I am holding off on putting this current version up here.  Very soon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here is the new fully compacted window.  Let me know what you think.  I have included in the jpg both the oval and Square Spell Gems.  I like it better with the Oval Gems.<br />
<br />
If this is good I will upload the files for you.  Just so you know this is about as small as it is going to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amojoman</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chronwaas,<br />
<br />
the Hotbuttons and the Spell gem buttons have to be separate windows. VI has hard coded the functions of these different buttons into their respective windows. <br />
<br />
That bites, :( ... <br />
<br />
If you could fit the 2 windows together seamlessly, It would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that's just frikkin' cool. You've managed to not only shrink down the gems to a reasonable size that's still visible, but you've compacted everything beyond belief. I love it. Thanks so much for making it, and i look forward to downloading this baby when you get the chance to post it ^.^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here it is.  Thanx for all the suggestions and keep them coming.<br />
<br />
Also for those interested I am still working on the seemless window thing.  I have been looking around and I may have found a way to merge them into a single window.  Will let you all know as I get that part figured out.</div></div><hr />
