<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Big Red</div><div class="date">09-10-2002, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back before the new UI came alone i was using 800X600 resolution and found it to cause least amount of lag even during raid. However since the new UI everything seem so huge in 800X600. I was just wondering is there a UI out there thats made for smaller reso or is there a way to be in 1024X768 and still only get 800X600 lag??<br />

thanks.</div></div><hr />
