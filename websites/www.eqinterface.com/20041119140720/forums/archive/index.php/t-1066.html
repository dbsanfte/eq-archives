<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaelicor</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering if it is possible to move the compass into another window, in my instance, the Player Window. I did a dirty Cut-n-Paste, and was able to get the graphic in there, but it did not function (just layed there like a lowly percent sign). <br />
Now, if this isn't possible, I'm wondering if there's a way to move the entire compass window into the player window, so it's governed by the player window. <br />
I may be asking for too much, but I saw the compass for the first time and I fell in love :P wanted to use it to fill this big gaping hole in my self designed player window.<br />

:nana:  &lt;------I'll have what he's having!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaelicor</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok over the last day or so I've been working with the compass, I've found out this :<br />
<br />
1 : the compass does not function in the player window. since there's no eqtype associated with the compass apperently. I can get the graphic to show up, just not functional.<br />
<br />
2: the compass itself resists movement in it's own window. it bases itself at 0,0 in the compass window.<br />
<br />
3: the compass distorts and loses it's accuracy when stretched horizontally. This sucks because you could have tried to make the horizontal size bigger or smaller to fit the window you're making.<br />
<br />
4: the compass RETAINS functionallity when stretched or squished vertically . the graphics stretch or squeeze according to the vertical size you give it, and retain's it's accuracy nicely :)<br />
<br />
5: Other elements can be put in the compass window. I made a Compass/Target window tonight, though it's the same horizontal size as the normal compass, so it's tiny, and long names will get chopped off .<br />
<br />
that's my current experience with the compass window. Thanks to the guys in serverwide.eqgui who offered some suggestions  and how-to's :)<br />
<br />
NOW...anyone know if you can make a window call another window ? :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh well... Maybe they'll change it in a future patch.. It would be nice to put it elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

No way! You mean people where in there? /grin :nana:</div></div><hr />

I Need to say that his isn't completely true.  I (probally like you did tried to resize the two '180' width elements to the scale I streched the main window.  This caused compression between 'N' and 'E'.  Leaving those two elements alone at X=180 resulted in a functional compass.  you just see more of the bar.<br />
<br />
I was very glad of this since it was ricidlous that it wasn't as wide as the standard player/target/pet windows.</div></div><hr />

Thanks,<br />
