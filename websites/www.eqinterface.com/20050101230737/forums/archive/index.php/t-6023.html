I have my main, a melee who uses one UI, and I now have a caster type and want to use a different UI on this char, can I do this? and how, if I can?</div></div><hr />

I like to play a lot of alts and my cleric would need a different UI than my Chanter or my Wizard.<br />

<br />
For each skin you are going to use have a different directory name under your uifiles directory.  Put each of the different skins one in each directory.<br />
<br />
Next login to your character,  do the /loadskin skindir 1 where the skindir name is the name of the directory where you put the skin for that character. <br />
<br />
Then you may have to rearrange the windows a little to get them where you want them and then logout.<br />
<br />
Go to the next character and do the same thing only use the skindir name that you put the skin for that char in.<br />
<br />
Repeat for last char.<br />
<br />
That is all there is to it.  You now have three different characters with three different skins.</div></div><hr />
