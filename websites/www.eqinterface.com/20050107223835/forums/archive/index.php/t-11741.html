I just started using the Neptune Vert UI, and I got an AE TL during a raid, and found that my TL box didn't have a Yes or No button, so I was unable to accept it!<br />
<br />
No idea where the details are for the size of the window so I can't resize it to see if that's the problem...<br />
<br />
Any help?<br />
<br />
P.S. Edit: Nm the P.S., combat window lag resolved itself lol.</div></div><hr />

This actually is a very common issue with the system as of about 2 patches ago and it has NOTHING to do with the UI files at all.<br />
NOTE: My use of the word delete is a suggestion. You may wish to RENAME the files as a safety precaution.<br />
<br />
1) Delete EQGAME.EXE<br />
2) Delete EQFX_DX8.DLL (or something like that)<br />
3) Delete EQClient.INI<br />
4) Delete *.opt.<br />
On the Advanced Patcher Tab reselect all (including legends) content.</div></div><hr />

Turned on &quot;Style Size&quot; option in EQUI_ConfirmDialogue.xml file (copied from Default since Vert didn't have it).  Resizing with the mouse revealed my suspicion was correct, window was the wrong size, the yes and no buttons were further down =)<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, resizing it by the numbers in the xml file didn't affect the size of the window at all...<br />
<br />
Edit: eep didn't notice that was you Enzo! /hug!</div></div><hr />
