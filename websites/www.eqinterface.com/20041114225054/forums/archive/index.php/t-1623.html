<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my effort to make a UI for small screens.  It was designed to reduce lag on raids, but that has more to do with luclin models and clipping planes than anything else.  But it does use a very small amount of video memory, good for older video cards.<br />
<br />
It's not the prettiest, but remember we're talking 640 by 480.  Lots of room for text and battle spam along the bottom.  Just enough room for spell and spawn timers and other critical information.  No room for conveniences like extra inventory slots and pet control buttons and pictures of flowers -- make macros in the hotbuttons window if you need those.<br />
<br />
The viewport is 448 by 336.  This is what I'd show as a caster... a melee type would alt-s to get rid of the spells list and alt-t to open in the same space a list of stats, saves, atk, and endurance.  She might leave the timer up to time disciplines, or could close it too.  I figure that's all you need for a raid, or maybe more than you need.<br />
<br />
Anyone else interested in running 640x480?  Or have some suggestions for changes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be very useful for running EQ on a screen that won't go over 640x480. On the other hand, most computers that won't at least run 800x600 can't run EQ either.<br />
<br />
Excellent work though. I'd do something like this myself if I had to raid frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chadoz</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the mod 640 x 480 don’t use it unless I am in huge lag area like bazaar or on huge group w/lots of spells flying around. I would like this mod for my other players that require the lower res.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tealen</div><div class="date">09-02-2002, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would you mind posting this? My second system is way low end and can barely do anything.  I'm mainly using it to transfer stuff and do an ocasional plvl for myself, but it could use all the help it can get.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't the velious era UI be friendlier on graphics cards? <br />
<br />
Probably but there are things that can't be done with the velious era UI - Like bazaar and trader modes, not to mention following inventory links, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ertaisi</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the new UI is smoother and faster than the velious UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PLEASE put it up for download. When I have the UI on everything seems to run slower(especially my mouse) so I want to use 640 x 480 and modify some of your stuff :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kevdawg</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">files plz omg hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Munknee</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been slowly working my way back into eq and hopefully I can use this to work the bazaar with my 16mb pci vid card lol.  If I can run eq without too much lag and still solo with the monk nerf I could be back in!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you ever plan to release this UI? I just got PoP and I went to the plane of tranquility, and I could barely move. I turned my resolution down to 640 x 480 and I could atleast move somewhat comfortably. I gotta upgrade my computer :/<br />
<br />
I'm searching for 640 x 480 UI's so I can actually do stuff in pop and that interface looks great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally got around to working on UI stuff again.  PoP has been fun, and so was travelling for xmas.<br />
<br />
It's in the download section now.  Hope it works for you.</div></div><hr />
