<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raldor</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm working on a custom experience gauge and I've pretty much got it working except for one thing. Since I'm using custom pictures for the bubbles and blue lines, I don't want EQ adding it's own tint to them. Can anyone tell me how to disable this?<br />
<br />
I tried just deleting the lines out of my EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml, but that made them appear as solid black bars. I don't know if it defaulted to 0,0,0 or what. Right now I have it set to 255,255,255 and it's not all that noticable, but I'd like it to be perfect. Thanks for any input.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reason for this is cause of the requirements to fill the bars. Each bar is the exact same bar, with a different color fill.<br />
<br />
The only way around this is to make a custom generic bar that works with the fill colors, and use the fill colors to colorize your bar.<br />
<br />
There's been really interseting renditions of this I've seen around. You can do anything with it.<br />
You just need to work with the limitations, not fight with it. ;)</div></div><hr />

So you can't disable the fill tint command? Oh well that's too bad but at least setting the tint to 255,255,255 worked almost as well as having none at all. <br />
<br />
Your gauges don't all have to use the same bar though. You probably already knew that but were just referring to if you use the default a_gauge items, but I attached a shot of my player window I use for testing just to show there can be different ones.<br />
<br />
The hp gauge is the EQ default gauge. The stamina gauge is the first one I made just to see if I could actually make something work in the UI. The huge one is the exp gauge I made yesterday. I'm already thinking about making a larger panel that houses all the gauges with different style bars for each one but it will take me a long time because I'm not an artist and even simple stuff takes me forever.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Exactly; don't have to use all the same.<br />
It was just an example on how VI uses it's fill.<br />
Puts into play that all are the same bar to be filled.<br />
<br />
There's a mod that psycogears made that's located in the Beta forum. It does something a bit different; It uses the fill option, but places it on the &quot;outside&quot; of the bars themselves.<br />
<br />
Take a gander. It's quite interesting: http://forums.eqinterface.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=832</div></div><hr />
