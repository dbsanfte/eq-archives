<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gramp</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to make a UI that showed as much as possible on the screen, was as full featured as possible, stayed true to the default UI, and took up the least amount of visible space.  It is not made specifically for any class, but the group window is very handy for healers.  This is what I came up with:<br />

<br />
- The player window is a slightly resized version of TheWorks3 by blarz.<br />
<br />
- The target window is an unmodified version of Tosevite UI - Target by Iare Tosevite.<br />
<br />
- The group window is a modified version of nodent's Group-color-change mod (took out stuff that was redundant with the player window and resized it).  AWESOME for getting your attention when someone's health is getting low.<br />
<br />
-The mini inventory window was done by me, Gramp.<br />
<br />
Here's a zip to try it out.  If there is enough interest, I will request it be 'officially' released.<br />

<br />
Also:  Fixed a bug in the group window where one of the guages was too long.</div></div><hr />
