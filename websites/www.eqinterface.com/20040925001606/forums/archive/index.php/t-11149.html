When EQ looks at the TargetIndicator.tga, it doesn't display the bottom 16 pixels.  These bottom 16 are cut off where the circle meets itself...so for anyone making a moving ring, those bottom pixels will make an offset.<br />
<br />
It's kind of hard to explain, but here are some pictures that I hope will help:<br />

This is a clockwise moving 3 pronged swoop that is smooth at the intersection of the ring.<br />

This is the TargetIndicator.tga that is used to create the above picture.  See how I left the last 16 pixels black and made everything line up for the first 240 pixels instead of 256.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps when creating those rings!!</div></div><hr />

Thank you<br />
I've been fiddling with it and I couldn't figure out what the beef was with my tgas.  Now I know.<br />
<br />
I'm still trying to figure out which direction it reads the file.  Just when I think I know and make a texture it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, thanks for the tip!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trebax</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, thanks for the info, I'll be updating mine very quickly.<br />
<br />
I'm making one for rogues...four ragebringers coming in and, well, &quot;piercing&quot; the mob from four sides.  However, when I made my TGA and implemented it, it comes up as only a half-circle.  There are still four of them, but it only covers a 180 degree arc.  Any ideas why?  I've played around with the XML files to no avail.<br />
<br />
Also, if someone could post their knowledge on what each of the &quot;lesser known&quot; XML elements in the targetindicator.ini file do, that would be wonderful.  Such as &quot;Pointcount&quot;, &quot;Additional&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just check out this thread! (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=58631)</div></div><hr />

Why would my file only display half a circle, when everyone else's has no problem being a full circle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tephrox</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well... I updated my target ring, taking out the bottom 16 pixels, and revising the whole thing... and it didn't work. Now my target ring has a large gap on one side.<br />
<br />
My target ring used animation, but that shouldn't affect it. So, anyone else notice if it's using all 256 pixels now? It is for me, at least.</div></div><hr />
