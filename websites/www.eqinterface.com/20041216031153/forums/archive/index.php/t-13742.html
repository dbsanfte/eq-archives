I play both a 65 ranger and a 65 rogue.  As a ranger I'm glad you put the prim/ sec boxes with the spell box, makes it easy to switch out weapons, etc.  I'd like to use the UI with my rogue as well, but because he's not a caster of course, he's missing the prim/ sec ext.  Is there any way you could add a prim/ sec spot on the containers, Like some of the UI's I've seen (ex: PriSecContainer, found under containers in the download section)  I've tried loading some of those up, but I think as you mentioned before, probably because of the x,y thing, it wont load up correctly.  It would really help a lot to be able to switch weapons within my bag rather than having to open my inventory and switch them that way.  Any help would be awesome.. thanks<br />
