I have been using the blue fantasy mellee ui for quite some time now and yesterday i had the unfortunate problem with my hard disc going boom, i have attempted to download and install the version that is on site and i am unable to get it working. I have installed in the usual way it is in the correct place. I can use some other ui's that i have downloaded but they dont suit my character and me. Please help me if u can.<br />
Many Thanks <br />

<br />
I want to use it, only one thing.<br />
<br />
It would be preferable if the beads around the window selector graphic were always visible and maybe color coded so that one could identify quickly what they were clicking over time, at least visible at all times.<br />
<br />
I have looked high and low and can not find  invite/join and disband buttons for group. Had to learn how to keyboard it. hehe<br />
<br />
Also, the AC and attack, at the very least, onyl show 3 numbers and therefore cut off complete information hehe. Should show 4 I believe. I would check other things for this, in case I missed something, haven't been using long.<br />
<br />
Other than that, this is stunning, I really really love.<br />
<br />
Haha in fact, please fix it fast. I've been using Steamworks, and I love it, but it doesn't have some of the things I need, so I'd like to switch to caster version of this for my Shaman.<br />
<br />
Will give more info if I can think of some. Hope that isn't too much criticism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elysiat</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, I think this should be for GoD version.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope it makes sense with that fix...</div></div><hr />

Is there going to be any updates to go with the OoW expansion, I miss my Bluefantasy UI!</div></div><hr />
