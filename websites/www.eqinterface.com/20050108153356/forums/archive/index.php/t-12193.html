<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pheonix</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, first, I'm not much of an artist, so I found someone elses UI that I liked and have been altering it to fit my own desires.  One of the changes, that I really like, about the UI is that the 3 targeting boxes (Player window, Group window, &amp; Target window,) have been combined into one larger box.  The main problem I have now is in 3 parts, and I cannot seem to fix them.<br />
<br />
1) The target indicator now has a &quot;0%&quot; floating in the middle when I have no target.  The original Target window hid this 0% when there was no target.  I've attempted to find where it says to hide it in the default &quot;EQUI_TargetWindow.XML&quot; file but cannot find it.  I've also tried copying the contents of the default file over exactly without any success.  Finally, I tried digging through all the other files to see if I can find where it tells the game to hide that number when there is not target.  The only thing I can figure out is that there is something, somewhere, that tell the game to hide the display of a label with a particular name on a window with a particular name, as I can create a window with the right name and it starts working.  I just cannot seem to find out where this is, so I can change it to suit my needs.<br />
<br />
2) Related to the same problem above with the same attempts at solution.  I really like the way the &quot;con&quot; of the target pops up as a box around the target indicator in the default configuration.  I cannot get it to do so in my UI though.<br />
<br />
3) Finally, I like the way that a flashing red &amp; white box pops up around the player name when auto-attack is activated.  It's a handy little visual reminder that you are attacking.  Again, I cannot get it to work for me.  It seems to be related to the same problem I listed in #'s 1 and 2 above.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the &quot;LFG&quot; &quot;Invite/Accept&quot; &quot;Decline/Disband&quot; buttons I had so much trouble with fall into this catagory as well.  The original UI did not have these buttons, but the combined box used the same window name and file name as the group window does in the default configuration.  When I originally added the buttons, they did not work right.  I ended up copying and pasting the items from the default group file, and then altering the location and size to fit my needs.  They then started working like they were supposed too.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone out there that knows how to fix this?  Please any help would be appreciated.  My only other option is to again seperate the 3 boxes, and I really don't want to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladred</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I've found with the target box is that instead of using a UI2Danimation and a Staticanimation like a normal graphic, it only uses the UI2Danimation and defaults it to 0,0 in it's window. Just like the compass window does. The on'y way I've found to move it around is to graphically hide the one that shows up in the UI2Danimation and specify where I want the Staticanimation one. The only problem with that is that it won't comply to the, 'if there is no target don't show the target box' thingy. What I really wanted was the target gauge to be the 'target box' where as when you target something the gauge would change colors to the targets con. This unfortunatly is impossible from what I've found.</div></div><hr />
