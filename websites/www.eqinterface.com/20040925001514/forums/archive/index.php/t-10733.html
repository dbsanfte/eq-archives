<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maginus</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been doing custom UI's since the new GUI came out. But I am curious how such artists make such detailed work such as T.King for exsample as well as a few others. <br />
I mean I use PSP but I can't start from scratch on screen and make that kind of detail. I usualy have to do it on paper and scan it in. Is there a special program these people use to get that kind of work or are they just incredibly patient and work pixel by pixel?<br />
<br />
Well if anyone knows of a nice program out there that does the shadowing and textures and stuff like that with a detailed tutorial please let me know I am eager to advance my skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morpheaous</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, yea.. i'd like to find out if there's an easier way to do that much detail, and that realistic of artwork, without hand drawing it pixel by pixel. They are incredible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use adobe photoshop. You can do pritty much anything you want in it and there are a tun of tutorials to show you how. It was expensive though.<br />
<br />
I dont think there is any software out there where you can type &quot;I want a cool graphic&quot; and it will make you one. It takes talent to make something look good in any program. The more you read the many graphics tutorials that can be found with a simple google search the better you will get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used 3d studio max back in my school days... its not an easy program to use. Way too much money for me to buy just to fiddle with now. Heck even the student version of the software is expensive. I guess for a software tool they use in Hollywood special effects its cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andraax</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are tons of good programs out there that are free.<br />
<br />
PSP have a bad habbit of not doing just what you ask for some times, I personaly am lucky enough to be able to have work pay for my photoshop license, but I also use GIMP (got used to it since I use unix systems alot), and it is freeware. Basicaly, for pixle fiddling GIMP is the best program out there, photoshop don't have any realy good pixle editing capabilities.<br />
<br />
For realy good quality graphics you'll have to put alot of time into learning the tools, be it 3D Max or Photoshop or any thing else, it all takes time to learn the tricks to get the result you are looking for.<br />
<br />
If you can afford photoshop that would be the best starting program though, it can do just about anything you like, just just have to learn how to do it :)</div></div><hr />

So the tutorials will be nice and hopefully help me advance thank you. I will also look into photoshop and gimp. <br />
