<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goldmoonn</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been updating and tuning this Mix and Match UI for some months now.<br />
<br />
I am creating this post both to present the UI to those that did not check it, but might like, and also to those that use it already, as a means of contacting me to give sugestions and requests<br />
<br />
The UI is largelly based on Vert and Solaria, with very small modifications by me, and also other additions that i liked.<br />
<br />
One of the things i also did was add several options you can change, like horizontal or vertical buff windows, among others.<br />
<br />
The UI can be downloaded on the following link:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2905<br />
<br />
Please check it out, and if you use and would like me to add another option on the UI (one of course that does not change it too drastically) i can try.<br />
<br />
As of the time of this post, i have made a small change in the UI, so maybe it will be unavailable for download for about a day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bellow is the Full Description:<br />
<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
<br />
I have made this UI from mixing several pieces i liked from eqinterface, mostly Solaria or Vert UI.<br />
<br />
I will try to give the proper reference to the original authors where possible<br />
<br />
1) Small Selector: i didnt like the size of the original. I cant remember the original author atm...<br />
<br />
2) Compass: From Solaria UI.<br />
<br />
3) Player Window (from Solaria UI): HP, Mana, XP, Alternate XP, Stamina<br />
<br />
4) Group Window (Solaria). All bars have % too<br />
<br />
5) Target Window (Vert. I have modified it to add the Color overlay for /consider<br />
<br />
6) Pet Window: 3 different pages on this window: normal one with pet hp and command buttons, pet buff window with hp and pet buffs, and a third, listing some player info like reisists, etc<br />
<br />
7) Buffs e Bard Buffs: smaller icons and description of the spells<br />
<br />
8) When a spell is being cast. a Purple bar will e shown on top of each chat window, instead of opening a Casting Window. <br />
<br />
9) 3d Target (Majestic Ring of Illusion by Raxthorne): i found this one much more beautifull and of better visualization.<br />
<br />
10) (Vert) On the hotkeys window, there are more &quot;shortcuts&quot; for bags and right click items. These you can customize. There is a small application on a sub folder of the UI you can use to do this.<br />
<br />
11) Spells, names of the spells. <br />
<br />
12) Mini map: i have chosen this one for being small, compact. I have also edited and removed the background image, so the map is clearer. (ps: between the little arrow buttons on the bottom, there is one unlabeled buttom. Clicking it centralizes on you on the map)<br />
<br />
13) Music Player: i have editei the music playerto a format i found more robust.<br />
<br />
14) Spellbook Icons of Warcraft III Theme<br />
<br />
15) T.King Celtic Inventory<br />
<br />
16) A detailed pic of the 3d Target<br />

What's New (updates)<br />
<br />
01-12-2004<br />
<br />
- I have fixed the background on the book window (not spellbok).<br />
<br />
- Added Combat Skills Window.<br />
<br />
- I have made modifications and tested for the upcoming Gates of Discord Expansion, so no wait for an update, using the ugly default UI!<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
01-23-2004<br />
<br />
- Changed Player window and Group window to Solaria<br />
- Hot button window changed to Solaria too, (smaller)<br />
<br />
- Added optional &quot;Buffs&quot; and &quot;Spell Casting&quot; windows.<br />
Go to the &quot;options&quot; folder and read instructions. Each sub folder has a picture giving an example as to how the window will look like.<br />
You can choose to have horizontal buffs windows (which i liked a lot), or vertical (the one that is default on my UI here), and also several different Spell Casting windows...<br />
<br />
- Removed animations from the 3D target (but still use the same one) so it is less processor demanding. Also updated it to work with &quot;GoD&quot; expansion.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
05-12-2004<br />
<br />
- Removed some unused files from the .zip<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />

- Added two different options for the map windows:<br />
With or without a background graphic<br />
<br />

NOTES ON UPDATING:<br />
================<br />
<br />
If you already use my UI, before updating, delete all the directory named Goldmoonn from your UIFILES directory, and then extract the new .zip file, always remember to leave &quot;Full Path&quot; checked, on Winzip</div></div><hr />
