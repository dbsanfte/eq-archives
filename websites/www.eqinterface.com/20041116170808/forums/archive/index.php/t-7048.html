<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuakkgom</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the beginning of the new skin.  Going for a steel/aluminum/lcd look.  Note I've only tweaked (so far) the following:<br />
<br />
- Mouse cursors.  (Anyone know what the sword looking cursor is for in window_pieces01.tga?)<br />
- Gauges...pretty lcd with a slight tint (default tints in fact)<br />
- Sliders.  I'll prolly need to work a lil to make it like the winamp style...so the thumb doesn't poof at 100%  ;)<br />
- Coins.  Uh, yah well....smoothed and nifty<br />
- Backgrounds<br />
<br />
Most is pixel art...aided with Photoshop.<br />
<br />
(Note: this in no way represents what the finished product will look like...but for the most part is close as far as some appearances.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weawen</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the background you got going, it looks very steel and grainy.<br />
<br />
The gauges are also very slick.  I hope you get them working out I would use them for sure.  I cant wait to see this when its all done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuakkgom</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welll...I'm still changing the lovely window pieces graphics.  I still have a few window border bounding issues to mess with, but I'll strike those when I finish the window pieces set.  I think I'm gonna go with the top bar like that on top of the chat window. The other looks too tacky.  And I have (on paper) drawn the new close and window shade buttons.  More to come once I finally finish the pain in the arse part.  <br />
<br />
Snap attached so you can see all the fun I've been having.  :D :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuakkgom</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In addendum.  Gauges work well...just not one block down at a time, still the ole sliding effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weawen</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its looking very well, cant wait to see the final project.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya might wana look at the gagues a little, maybe make the lines smaller and more of them so it looks more smooth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuakkgom</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll see what I can do with that.  ...Almost finally at window tweakage point.  Sooo soon I should be able to show off my psychotic idea.  =D  (granted others have prolly done/thought of it)<br />
<br />
Oh yah, did you mean &lt;-- horizontal --&gt;  or<br />
^<br />
Vertical<br />

Size?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuakkgom</div><div class="date">03-01-2003, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally finished with messing the window_pieces graphics.  I unified 'em all into one file (granted with a great deal of changes...but should be easy to adapt to new expansions).<br />
<br />
Anyhow, without further ado.  Here is a screenie at 640x480.  One of my present irritations is now with the border along the top ot the red buttons.  The alpha layer is correct, the color layer is correct, but for the love of god I wish I knew why it messed up like that...unless it's EQ's stretching and crunching thing.  I'll prolly never know, but at least it near invisible at higher res'<br />
<br />
Oops.  Now I find out that I can't change window title text color.  Curses...you'd think they'd be nice and allow the darned UI to be fully customizable.  =P  *changes header colors*<br />
<br />
*shuts up and spits up the screenie*</div></div><hr />

Going to probably pick a different window for tabbies...*closes eyes and throws a dart*<br />

<br />
It has the advantage that almost all windows can minimize which makes it usable at sub 800x600 resolutions.  <br />
<br />
To be added: Inventory splitting, Graphics and mods for membar &amp; buffbars, mp3 skin, spellbook.  ...And that should finish it.  =P<br />
<br />
Chances are this thing should be completed by tomorrow.  The hard part will be the sketches I've been juggling around for the bars.  =)<br />
<br />
Snap attached of course.  I have no idea what in blazes I'm gonna call it though.  The directory I have it in is called Steel and Gem.  ...oh well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuakkgom</div><div class="date">03-02-2003, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have decided...forget fancy bars.  May as well keep it simple like the rest of the UI.  Got cast window done.  Working on buffs.  Then comes a simple edit of spellbook.  Mebbe I should call it &quot;The mad tinkerer's skin&quot; ... gotta love my planning.  ;P</div></div><hr />
