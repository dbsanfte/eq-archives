<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you know, I think Nexus portals and PoK books have spoiled you most of the players...  I still like to take the boat (when they work)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jethal</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the people who've joined the EQ community in the last year or so want it fast fast fast.<br />
<br />
I still remember maxing my Sence Heading on the boat from Freeport to Butcherblock.. now there's no reason to do either.<br />
<br />
What used to take 20 minutes, now only 1 minute.<br />
Honestly, I long for the old days sometimes where you could take your time.. in many ways, the game was so much more fun then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qinadwen</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Talesin and Jethal - it has taken some of the old charm out of the game with all these portals and stones, and not to mention, removed the need for wizard and druid ports. The new PoK stone to Gunthak will not help this. I think I will also try to take the boats more - although it is tempting to use the gnomes, as they are up all the time on my server.<br />
And after using some 14 days trying to get my Sense Heading up from 1 (at lvl 45, which is very hard) just to see all get it at 200 as a default bummed me a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done it the hard way too; I remember hitting sense heading non stop, I was lvl 40 when i got it to 200 and was stoked.  I also played for a year with just basic eq before i got any expansions.  I just think it would be nice to have a magi port.  No sense in running across 5 zones if you could just go there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also agree. Iam so tired of hear peaple say it to hard. Dam i ran a 3 lvl rog from kelethin to halas. Didnt know right where the zone connection where. Why shuld this game be real easy. Whats wrong with runing to guntark. Crip it just sooo had ..:nana: <br />
<br />
Think it be nice to see real fixs not just crap for the children who play. Make them WORK for there lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm far from a child...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Camar</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I still remember taking my Lvl 1 (at the time) Ogre SK from Ogguk to Thurgadin, and then around to Kael.  I did the entire run on foot, no SoW, no porting, no invis item/potion.  Damn that was one scary-ass trip!<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you need to get to PoK fast from an LDoN camp it's not THAT far to hit a book.  From the BB camp there is one in zone, and 2 in the zone next to it.  From EC it's just a short jog over to Freeport.  When in Everfrost, yet again a book in the same zone.  If you can't put in enough effort to run around a bit and see the countryside....find a druid or wizard :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yasoldat</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have any idea how many times my ranger died on the qeynos to freeport run and that was back when SoW was still 39 for rangers?<br />
<br />
And after I reached 39, what happens, SoW is reduced to 30 for rangers. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcherPhate</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to see an Event were the Nexus portals and POK are broken.  THe boats work and there is a  that will take you to POTranq.<br />
<br />
And have the Port to POTranq npc Be in like the bottem of Split paw post revmap lol.<br />
<br />
THat would be funny</div></div><hr />

It's annoying to have to run through Butcherblock, Nedarias Landing just to be late for the raid. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aramil Dannodel</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the devs' reasoning behind the whole Knowledge concept (and especially with the new Gunthak stone) is because those without the ability to become invisible (through a spell or class ability) were getting aggravated at having to shell out money constantly on invis potions just so they could leg distances through KoS zones that could potentially prove fatal...and then the corpse run usually ended up being even worse for them.<br />
<br />
While I appreciate they're trying to help out those that don't have any form of invisibility to get them through areas that would be too much of a pain too, anyways, there have always been ways to circumvent that.<br />
1) Get an invis buff from someone, and run like hell, crossing your fingers, toes, and many of the fine hairs covering your body that it doesn't thin out in the middle of a red-conning KoS area.  Heh...those were fun.<br />
2) Buy invis potions.  /shrug<br />
3) Find a Druid/Wizard and ask them nicely for a lift...chances are, if you are polite and don't just blather on with &quot;d00d port plskthx&quot;, they'll be nice enough to teleport you, buff you, *and* not ask for a vital organ as your &quot;donation&quot;.<br />
4) /cough  Hunt somewhere else.  Heh.<br />
<br />
Honestly, though, I definitely have to agree with Taleisin, Jethal and Qinadwen...boats &gt; all.  Sadly (and I'm not sure about otherwise) but as far as I know from the few servers I play on, the boats no longer even make any rounds...most are perma-docked, due to the devs' unwillingness to &quot;fix&quot; them...I recall just after the Planes of Power expansion shipped, I had petitioned regarding the boats, and the GM basically (all but used the exact words) &quot;Buy the expansion, or feck off!&quot;.  Boy, did I give him a chewing.  /chuckle<br />
<br />
If there's any new teleports I want to see out of Knowledge, though, it'd definitely be what Parasite mentioned...as stated Knowledge's ease of travel has spoiled players, and I know if I ever get invited to a group (with how slowly I zone), I get constantly badgered on my way out there &quot;u still comin&quot;.  Aside from the poor grammar involved, when I can breeze through Butcherblock with a topped SoW and 240ish AGI, unbuffed, I don't really think it's necessary to get two /tells in that zone, alone.  /sigh<br />
But then, that's the way the game has been evolving...it's more about speed.  It is nice that you can grab a group anywhere across the world, now, whereas you were restricted to spamming LFG within a couple zones before (mostly due to people not even having the patience then to yell at you to run to their group from 20 zones away), but I feel it does detract from the magic of the game...<br />
I recall a song (to which the name eludes me, at the moment) with a verse along the lines of &quot;It's not about getting from point A to B, but the journey in between&quot; (bear in mind those lyrics aren't exact...don't really feel like going through my CD booklets at the moment).  But then, just my opinion on the matter.  /shrug<br />
