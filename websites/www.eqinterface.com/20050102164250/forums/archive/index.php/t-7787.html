My problem is that he re rights the way that EQ looks for stuff.  There is no EQUI_Animations.xml to adjust the way that the txt files tell you to do it.  If anyone could help I would be apprecaitive.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Statix</div><div class="date">03-30-2003, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">about the only thing quartz doesn't work with is cursors, this is because verant is retarded and allows only 1 item to be defined as a 'cursor' in the equi_animations.xml file (which quartz doesn't modify).<br />
<br />
Quartz pulls its additional data out of the equi.xml that is in the default folder then loads what it wants (a giant include hierarchy)<br />
<br />
if you try to make a duplicate item for the cursor in everquest the xml standard will bitch at you for having duplicate things.<br />
<br />
Sorry but cursor changing (from what i've found) can only be done if you mess with the equi_animations.xml file and quartz doesn't use it since verant breaks it constantly :)</div></div><hr />
