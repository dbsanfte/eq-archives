<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InvisiBill</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been getting virus spams caused by Mydoom/Novarg (http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.novarg.a@mm.html). One of them spoofed an &quot;@eqinterface.com&quot; address, so I figured this would be a good place to warn people.<br />
<br />
The message came from the IP address 216.237.20.226. http://www.invisibill.net/ipcheck.php is a script that will show your IP address. If yours is close to that but not exact, I'd still check into it. It's possible that you were using that IP at the time, and it has changed since then. I also have a few other IPs of infected machines listed on my page.<br />
<br />
http://files.invisibill.net/unmydoom.inf is a script to remove the virus. It does all the steps listed in the manual removal section of Symantec's link. Just save it, right-click, and choose Install. It may have problems with files that are in use, so I suggest running it once, rebooting, then running it again. It also attempts to delete possible infected files created by the virus in your Kazaa shared directory. If you have any files of *questionable* origin (you'll understand when you see the filenames the virus uses) there that happen to have one of the possible names, your file will get deleted.<br />
<br />
I just wrote up a big blurb at www.invisibill.net about this. Check that page out for more info on anything I've said, or just ask me here. I'm honestly trying to help people (and stop all the crap email I'm getting), but I also don't trust anyone without verification either. The IP check script doesn't do anything on your machine. It's just a function on the webserver that prints the IP address of whoever made the request for the page. Very standard for webstuff. The removal script is a standard Windows .inf file. You can open it in Notepad (should be the default action) and look at it. I explain on my page what all the different sections do. Even if you don't know anything about programming, you should be able to get an idea of what it's doing (or more appropriately, that it's not doing anything bad).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes my email box and I'm sure Kudanes email box has been flooded. Our mail server strips the virus/worm off the email and we just get the email w/o the worm and info about the mail server that sent it. We use clam av and mailscanner on our servers.<br />
<br />
Kinda sad how a worm can still move around pretty much freely and cause problems.<br />
<br />
You can get a remover tool from Symantec at: <br />
http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.novarg.a@mm.removal.tool.html<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw it looks like that IP you gave belongs to a nextweb.net mail server named orange some where in SantaAna-CA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InvisiBill</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The IP actually resolves to 216-237-20-226.orange.nextweb.net. VisualRoute (http://visualroute.visualware.com/) says it's in Tampa, as one of the upline points is in Tampa. However, there are also &quot;SAN&quot; and &quot;LAX&quot; names after that, so I guessed it was in California. NextWeb offers wireless access in the Bay and LA areas (http://nextweb.net/coverage.html). I'm guessing this is just someone who uses NextWeb as their ISP. The SMTP engine is a little tricky even. If you look at the header, you'll notice that the HELO command returns the domain of the spoofed email address, which will get it past some filters. For example, the one I got said Received: from [216.237.20.226] (helo=eqinterface.com). It's saying that it's at eqinterface.com, even though that IP has nothing to do with eqinterface.com. I have gotten other ones from that same IP address, and they each return the domain of the spoofed address, which is different in each email.<br />
<br />
And yes, Symantec does have a removal tool. It just goes back to my thing where I tend not to trust things until I verify them. With a compiled executable, I can't be 100% sure of exactly what it's doing unless I reverse-engineer it and look at the code. With my script, you can open it up in Notepad and check it out.  If you know a little about programming, you can probably figure most of it out. If not, you can go to MSDN and learn about the different commands in .inf files. I bookmarked this page (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/install/hh/install/create-inf_3aav.asp) because it has a handy table of what the DirID numbers are. From there, you can follow the links to learn all about .inf junk. Also my script is under 3k. Their util is over 148k. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What makes it worse, this virus is sending off to junk emails that's caught by my catch all (joe @gpcentre.net, alan @gpcentre.net, leo @ gpcentre.net, etc).<br />
<br />
Good thing my real mail account isn't effect with it yet. Just my mail &quot;firewall&quot; you might call it. ;)</div></div><hr />

Whats real sad is I'm getting POSTMASTER responses saying that an email is infected with the virus from my address to addresses I don't even have in my address book. I checked my computer and my system is clean, so it looks like some spammers have the virus and are using my email address as a sender. *sigh*  <br />
<br />
Yes, as is quite common now, this virus spoofs the sender address. It searches the hard drive for files that could contain email addresses - anything with these extensions: .htm, .sht, .php, .asp, .dbx, .tbb, .adb, .pl, .wab, and .txt.<br />
<br />
It also randomly makes up names. This means you get a bunch more of these crap emails if you have a catchall domain, like guice said. It will take a domain and try common names like &quot;bob&quot; or &quot;joe&quot;.<br />
<br />
If it spoofs your address as the sender (i.e. your address was somewhere on an infected computer's hard drive) and the virus guesses a bad address (i.e. joe@domain.com is full or non-existant), the mail server will bounce &quot;your&quot; message back to you, just like it's supposed to. While people are saying that this may be the work of spammers or someone else trying to somehow profit, you getting error messages has no direct connection to spammers. Those error messages simply mean that an infected PC has your address stored somewhere on the hard drive. Note that it searches PHP files, which would include cached copies of forum pages like this one.</div></div><hr />
