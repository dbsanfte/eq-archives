It is also great for the UI's that I have made for my friends, as they can automatically get updates as I make them without the need for me to upload them to my ftp server and then they download them.<br />
<br />
The application is called FolderShare (http://www.foldershare.com/index.php?) and I have just started using it recently, but it seems to work wonders so far without any problems.<br />
<br />
I'd like to invite others of this community to try it out and see what you think as well.  It is free for the service and the application</div></div><hr />

I have 3 comps with EQ on them and it would be nice to just update one UI Folder. Wonder if you can specifiy it to sync the ini files too.</div></div><hr />

You would have to share the whole EQ directory.  It would be very time consuming to set up, but after the initial setup then ony the changed files would have to synch.</div></div><hr />

That's near 3 gigs some people's systems. Not really an &quot;easy&quot; think to do. :eek:<br />
<br />
--- Edit:<br />
Yeah, actually it would appear that is uses FTP to sync the files. You update, it uploads it to it's server (your library) and then FilderShare on your other system will see the change and download the modified file.<br />
<br />
This will not work very well with a 3 gig EQ directory on patch day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm playing around with this on two systems I have. I'm starting to understand what it does.<br />
<br />
When you create a library, it uploads basic information to your online library. Stuff like checksum (I think--some type of &quot;auth&quot; method. Checksum is most valid) and your client information (for p2p connections). When the check sum (or what ever) changes, the FolderShare application will prompt you to download a new version on a remote machine-it will also automatically upload it after you've edit it. When accepted FileShare opens up a pier to pier  connection to Xfer the files across.<br />
<br />
The Peer IP information is stored within the misc data that's stored on the remote library.<br />
<br />
So far I'm unable to find a way to Sync up individual files that exist and must remain in a nonSync'd directory (ie the ini files). It seems to be all or none. FileShare doesn't even follow Sym links (shortcut in windows term).<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't too bad for basic functionalities. Can even be used for sync'ing websites, if FileShare gets a linux/unix port.<br />
<br />
But for detailed syncing, select files in different areas, etc, not sure it's there just yet. However, it's getting there judging from the posts on the forums. They seem to be taking these feature requests seriously.</div></div><hr />
