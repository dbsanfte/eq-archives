<br />
I cleaned up the xml, reveamped the graphics, and added a few new things here and there (definately will want to check out the layer window)<br />
<br />
Anyway, whithout a whole lot of fanfare and such, click <br />
HERE (http://webpages.charter.net/nytcrie/EQ000030.JPG) to see what she looks like.<br />
<br />
expect another version with a complete graphic overhaul (thanks Tadashya for letting me borrow your graphics for awhile :) ), and following hot on it's heels will be versions for SK, Monk, Elves, and a totally caster oriented one.<br />
<br />
A few things I am debating incorporating are timers, locations, and/or tradeskills, but still working out how I would want to do those.<br />
<br />
Anyway, let me know what you think and keep an eye on the downloads section (would be under complete sets).  I'm always open to suggestions.<br />
<br />
I did include with it optional horizontal hotkeys and ALL the Tking books modified for the way they are used in themod, with instructions for each option.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I can understand what yer sayin, allow me to explain (as I do in the ReadMe file accompanying the UI) why I fell this isn't something that is normally an issue.<br />
<br />
(EDIT:  just realized that sounded like a brush off.  Actually, I completely respect your opinion, I didn't mean it to saound as if I didn't.  I just wanted to state that while I understand you feel the possibility of clicking the wrong spot, I personally feel that's not an issue.  Again, didn't mean to make light of your concern.)<br />
<br />
The effort was to reduce window size and condense the information as best possible.  The Cast Window, by nature, was a bit large.  I have seen several loverly spell gem mods, but again, they are all quite large.  I decided to stagger the gems, then shrink the gems (they were at one point even tighter).  <br />
<br />
Now, since this UI started (back when we got the new UI), that window has not changed much from the design you currently see.  I've played in many conditions since then (heavy lag, fast and furious exp groups, soloing, etc.) and have never clicked the wrong spell.  Part of that is because I very rarely click my spells, I use the Alt-casting keys.<br />
<br />
Since I was designing this as a ranger, I did think about this alot.  I decided that there really wasn't very many spells we had to cast rapidly, and when we did, it was faster to use Alt-casting than to click the gem.  With SNare, Jolt, and whatever two situational spells I need in the first 4 gems, my fingeras are already near those keys by default (hotkeys, plus my movement is re-mapped to be more typical of a FPS).<br />
<br />
This is why I shrunk the window as much as I did.  Honestly, once you are playing you will see you don't have many instances where you will click the wrong spell (unless they all have the same icon, and even then there's the tooltips).<br />
<br />
You may want to keep an eye out for may more caster oriented version coming out in the near future.  It will contain a different spellgem window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand your preferences Kiriani, but would urge you to keep in mind that many of us do use the mouse to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do keep that in mind, trust me.  The whole time I was working on the origianl idea, I was asking in guildchat and in several of the chat channels I participate in.  I asked people about the clickies, I asked about the placements, and I asked about the spell gems.<br />
<br />
I've found that it's roughly 50-50.  Even I sometimes click the gems as opposed to alt casting, depending on the situation.  The gems are still pretty easy to sling over and click on.  I've also tested it in various situations, from the lag infested bazaar to a full blown high end raid.  Still no problems.<br />
<br />
As far as listening to fedback, I do consider it.  FOr example: the spellbook icon is now gone.  I have seen many people request it be removed.  I personally tend to click it myself, but in the end I went with the majority.<br />
<br />
Again, as I said in the last post (and in the edit) wasn't trying to come off sounding arrogant or dismissive, just explain the thought behind it and why I was not likely to change it for the ranger/hybrid versions of the UI.  The caster version, however, will have a larger cast window.<br />
<br />
I can, however, throw in an alternate version of the gem window.  I've already done so for the hotkeys and spellbooks, and just recently did one for the buff window.<br />
<br />
Again, I want to apologize if I came off in any manner that wasn't respectful and considerate.  I do consider others opinions andplay styles, and I do appreciate feedback.  I wasn't trying to sound as if I was being stand-offish.</div></div><hr />
