I'll be using Photoshop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I managed to figure out how to tint the files using Photoshop.  I selected two different colors on the duo-palette (for the life of me, I can't think of a technical term for that and I'm too lazy and frustrated to load Photoshop and find out... lol), then went to Image, Adjust, Hue/Saturation... or Ctrl+U.  I checked the box that said &quot;colorize&quot; and it did it all for me.  I now have a pretty teal tint for all my window_pieces0*.tga.  It matches nicely with the image I used to replace wnd_bg_*_rock.tga.  <br />
<br />
Anyhow... the problem I have is that all my windows and cursors are now blocked.  It appears that when I adjusted the hue/sat, it removed the transparency of the objects within the files.  Can anyone tell me what I did wrong, cuz I hate having a cursor with a black box around it.  Also, if I put my spell window on 100%, it blacks out my spell gems completely.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt I just messed up one little thing and it's a totally simple fix, but I'm begging for help.  :)<br />

Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, looks like I'm going to have to sit myself down and get a little deeper into Photoshop.  I've not used it for anything too major yet.  I guess I'm probably overlooking something because as it stands now, when I open the tga files, I have a totally flat image - pictures on a black background, no way to differentiate between the individual pix unless I manually draw them out - a very tough, loooong process.  I'll go back into Photoshop and see if I'm missing some nifty capability it's trying to keep hidden.  Computers like to do that to me...  ;) <br />
<br />
So off I go to hunt.  Any other suggestions, ideas, comments, etc would still be much appreciated.<br />

Okay - I've spent several... too many... hours today trying to figure this out.  I know it should be simple, but my brain is frying.  Would someone PLEASE be so kind as to give me a short walk-through on exactly how to edit just the colors?  I know which files to edit, but I don't know what to do to prevent either a box behind the objects (instead of a transparency) or else an outline of the wrong color.   I read somewhere that to create a transparency, you needed to put it on a purple background (don't remember where I read that), so I massively cut the images (I've been working w/ file ...01.tga - the one with the cursors), and placed them as a transparent layer over a purple background.  So now all of my items have a purple outline.  Which would be fine if my color scheme was purple.... but it's teal and it kinda clashes.  heh.<br />
<br />
Anyhow - it's tomorrow here in central Europe, so I'm off to bed.  Happy Editing.<br />

Using Photoshop, here's a quick breakdown.  (And I was right - it is Really easy)<br />
<br />
Open a copy of the default window_pieces0*.tga.<br />
Choose primary color on Color Palatte.  (My choice was dark teal)<br />
Select the Magic Wand:<br />
~ 0 Tolerance<br />
~ Uncheck: Anti-Aliased, Use All Layers, Contiguous<br />
Click on black background - Not one of the images.<br />
**This should select all of the black on the screen, boxing off the images.<br />
From the Menu:<br />
~ Selection -&gt; Inverse<br />
~ Layer -&gt; New -&gt; Layer via Cut (or via Copy)<br />
~ Image -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Hue/Saturation -&gt; Colorize (check box)<br />
**Here you can adjust the levels of Hue/Sat/Lightness<br />
<br />
That's it.  Save your file as the correct window_pieces... make sure you save a copy as .tga, because it will automaticaly want to save it as a Photoshop-type file.  Wash, Rinse, Repeat and enjoy your new colors!!!<br />
