   Has anyone else had a problem with going ld since you have installed the new UI?  I have been going LD very frequently since the new UI so I went back to the old UI and no problems since.  Any suggesttions other then stick with the old UI until the new UI has been patched a few more times?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />

Or does the game just quit?<br />

I dont know how the new UI could make you go LD.... I could see it make you lockup or kick ya back to your desktop. Then again I didnt program the new UI so who knows what kinda goofy code they got in there.<br />
<br />
Going LD can be from many things...<br />
<br />
- Your ISP<br />
- Your ISP's ISP<br />
- The backbones to your city havein trouble<br />
- If you have a linksys router some upgraded firmwares reset the DHCP every 5min.<br />
- if your on dialup your phone line quality may have decreased thus increaseing your packetloss and latency issues.<br />
- Some software on your computer (winXP auto update, etc.)<br />
- so many I dont have time to sit here and list them all.<br />
<br />
I think it would be best to give verant tech support a call during there normal phone support hours and tell them about your problem. They can have you run through some diagnostics on your computer and possible find a solution to your problem.</div></div><hr />

I *have* noticed that a couple servers have been laggy lately. Remember, EQ just recently broke the 100k record for number of people online! ;)</div></div><hr />
