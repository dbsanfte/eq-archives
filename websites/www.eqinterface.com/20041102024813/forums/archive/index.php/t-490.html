<br />
What I've done:<br />
New gauges for memorize and scribe spell to fit the skin.<br />
Done button as you see in picture with fancy highlight. (one at the bottom too, but that doesn't work atm.. seems you can only have one 'done' button..)<br />
prev/next page at each end of the book.<br />
All borders removed as you can see in the picture.<br />

The files (http://www.ascendingdawn.com/ui/Spellbook.zip) <br />
Included two EQUI_Animations files, one with only the changes and one complete.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yozzy</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I planned on on doing that, but for the highlights to work that button would have to be so wide that it covered some of the spell icons.. and you would end up closing the book when trying to mem a spell.<br />
That's why I tried to make 3 buttons, one for each highlight and one smaller one in the middle, but you can only have 1 'done' button atm :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tasiel</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its changes such as this that I love to see. While most people want things compact, I think the new UI just needs a little color. I have this installed for my mage and hope to see more people come up with ideas such as this for other classes as well. <br />
<br />
This is a Great spellbook for a mage!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfran</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still learning things like buttons and containers myself, so bear with me.<br />
<br />
The ScreenID for one of your buttons (the top one...the one that works) is &quot;DoneButton&quot;.  The ScreenID for the bottom one, the one that doesn't work is &quot;CloseButton&quot;.  From the was that the &lt;Button&gt; tags are set up, there is only one inner tag I can see that would tell the interface what that particular button is supposed to do and that's the &lt;ScreenID&gt; tag.  The rest is just basic positional and display info.<br />
<br />
So..<br />
<br />
1.) Is it possible to have two items with the same ScreenID?<br />
2.) Would giving both buttons the ScreenID of &quot;DoneButton&quot; allow them both to work as a Done button?<br />
<br />
I'd test it myself, but I'm pretending to be working.</div></div><hr />

I'll try and fix it later today, right now I'm suppose to be working ;)</div></div><hr />

However one snaffu...   I get the error it can not load the skin.  I placed a copy of it in a new folder in my UIFiles and tried /load filename&gt;<br />

<br />
