<br />
or at least side by side?<br />
<br />
i use the mouse control.  healing is part of what i do.  i do not want to have to run the mouse all the way across the screen to target someone and then heal them.<br />
<br />
if you have seen one that has what i am talking about, please leave a link.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I added the Player window just to fill up some of the space. Can also add most anything else you want except for buttons.  <br />
<br />
Let me know what you think or if you want any changes like health percentages etc<br />

OrtinUI (http://www3.sympatico.ca/nitro_wolf) <br />
<br />
also to use pet window togged pet info button on or off on selector window( bottom right).<br />
<br />
unzip ortin.zip to everquest/uifiles directory and follow the README.TXT that is in ortin.zip file.<br />
<br />
this interface UI is not done, i still have to delete AAexp and Exp bar from player window or from the hotkey buttons( hehe not sure if i want it up top or down below).<br />

<br />
I like what you've done with it very much :) I made the original with my cleric and my beastlord in mind  (just a matter of changing out the clickable items for the beastlord). It actually seems much less cluttered with the player window seperate.  And you've done a great job with the graphics, far better than anything I think I might have come up with lol (I've been scared to try :P )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nitrowolf</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well it is your UI with ICEy Blue interface  graphics by Leo ICE, all i did was change the spell window, spell book , inventory, player window plus some coding. hehe i suck at doing graphics myself too.<br />
<br />
still have to remove the AAexp and Exp bar from player window or the hotbutton window. still not sure if i like that up top or down below.<br />
<br />
plus a better buff window would be nice too, but have not founded a good one that goes across the top, also i moved the inventory slots to the group window was trying to move the invite and disband button up beside slots, but its does not want to work there( hehe oh well back to checking the code have to be a way of doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bonestomper</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">uhm.  uh.  who has the dummies guide to installing user interface?<br />
<br />
