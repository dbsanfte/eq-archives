It will tell you exactly which file EQ is having problems with and even what the problem is. If you post the error lines here, maybe someone can help.</div></div><hr />

Try that. Your having problems with your group box. You need to go in and add the mods to whatever group box your using. I ran  into that issue with more than a few of the group boxes that are posted on this site.<br />

<br />
Does the information from the fixes need to be added in addition to whats already there?  From what I could see the text to add to the files was exactly the same as what was already there, but I still get the errors every time.  I appreciate any help... I'm a networking guy, so I'm clueless when it comes to coding, etc :P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, double and triple check that you spelled everything properly and that the additions were placed in the correct files.</div></div><hr />

<br />
look in the patch folder for Cairenn's post on what to patch for ldon and you will find in the EQUI_Animations.xml file you need to add Drag_Item26 and 27 (i believe)<br />
<br />
these are what controls the icons for the items such as the new bag, or new weapons and armor.<br />
<br />
its not a hard fix once you find what to put in.<br />

i figured that since LDoN icons were working BEFORE i loaded the skin then that must mean the code that i need to ADD to my custom UI MUST be in the default folder.  <br />
<br />
the guide linked here said that it was dragitem26 &amp; 27.  so i looked those up in the default folder and i found them.  i copied and pasted and wallah, it's now working.<br />
<br />
yes i 'm a bonehead sometimes.</div></div><hr />

IF you've edited the .xml files correctly, then the other possible problem is with texture caching. <br />
<br />
If everything esle is correct and you've been using texture caching to speed up zoning performance, then turning it OFF will cause EQ to properly load any new textures. <br />
<br />
You can turn texture caching off BEFORE logging into the game, by using the button marked OPTIONS from the login screen.  This will cause EQ to quit caching local copies of textures and graphics. <br />
<br />
You can turn caching back on afterwards in order to restore any speed gain you recieved while using it. <br />
