<br />
But the biggest thing in it for us here is they gave us warning on<br />
<br />
Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week.<br />
<br />
Targetwindow.xml<br />
Playerwindow.xml<br />
Groupwindow.xml<br />
EQUI.xml<br />
<br />
Soooo Expect lots of patch releases from authors.. Also good chance we will need to go into &quot;battle mode&quot; if we get slammed with a lot of people on at once. But we will see how it goes on the 14th<br />
<br />
(battle mode is low graphics, and turning off a few features that are bonus, and not required to navigate the site)<br />
<br />
The whole message is WELL worth the read..<br />

not much to change.<br />
<br />
On the test server only added are health % to player,target and group window. Not a big deal since almost all ui modders have done this.<br />
<br />
In the equi.xml only tipwnd.xml added for the upcomming tips window.<br />
<br />
If nothing else changes with the patch on 14th, nothing upsetting for us there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was going to mention that myself. The changes don't appear would cause any issues to anymore.<br />
<br />
Most mods add the % themselves. SOE is just .. catching up with the times and are now including it in the default UI.<br />
<br />
Only files I see hitting people is the HelpWnd.xml and the EQUI.xml file. (Why people edit the EQUI.xml file, I do not know.)<br />
<br />
Possibly options, but I don't know any UIs that actually modified this file. Although Options seems to be a big fix.<br />
<br />
(Options and HelpWnd changes found on  Cairenn's Post (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?threadid=8404) )</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is, you'll need to make sure that your naming convention matches theirs, or add theirs and just 0,0 them out.<br />
<br />
But you guys are right, it's really not that big of a deal, global search/replace from what an author used to call it to what SOE wants it to be called, plus the addition of the label (%) itself, if not already included,  and viola, done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's the question. Are these bars hard coded into the UI like and Pet_HP? I would take a gander and say no. You can have a Player Window w/out a Player_HP name or bar and it will still work. Remove Pet_HP and it will blow up.<br />
<br />
The names mean nothing unless they have some hard coded value in EQ. Pet HP bars do. Same as any button.<br />
<br />
I don't think you even need to worry about the naming conventions. Of course, I could very well be mistaken. I hadn't tested my current UI on the Test Server recently.<br />
<br />
I'll have to test this and get back to ya. ;)</div></div><hr />

As soon as I changed the names, the errors went away.</div></div><hr />
