<br />
I talked with Lyth a bit last night while I was seeing if there was an easy fix.  He never really had time to play with it after his initial release.  <br />
<br />
Basically, it seems to be limiting how much you can display on a page to about 750 pixels.  So the options are to further break down the pages to all be the size of the velious page, or to look into using a different window.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna mess with it some more this weekend.  I think the Story window would be useful for this since I'd have to reformat all the information anyway if I added 3 or 4 more tabs.</div></div><hr />
