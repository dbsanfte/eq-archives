So let pretent you down load fubar.zip.  <br />
<br />
Open the Zip file.<br />
<br />
Extract it to a folder named &quot;fubar&quot; in that folder you will see a lot of files some with &quot;tga&quot; and some with &quot;xml&quot; extention.<br />
<br />
Move the folder to to ....\everquest\]uifiles <br />
<br />
Now in the uifiles you should have two folders:<br />
    default<br />
    fubar<br />
<br />
Run EQ; login into a char, type /load <br />
<br />
You should see two items in your list which will match the two folders you have in uifiles<br />
<br />
Select fubar, click load. If it does not load, the UI may not be compatable with LDoN.  Other than that, it should work :-)<br />
