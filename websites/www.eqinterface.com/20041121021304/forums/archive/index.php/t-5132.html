This totally takes out the functionality that each window was created for.<br />
<br />
You should be able to create a new window for whatever purpose.<br />
<br />
Want a new tab'd window? Call it EQUI_tabwindow1.xml<br />
<br />
Want a new plain window? Call it EQUI_bordergraphicleft.xml<br />
<br />
Want a new tab'd Chat Window? Oh please let us use this one.<br />
<br />
thats my 2cp's</div></div><hr />

Just an assumption, but Yeah, I have to agree, that would rock if we could have one big tabbed window.  But then again, we would be switching back and forth a lot with some characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amost</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea not a bad idea.. personally i want built in msg buttons next to my spell gems.. fizzle? no problem move your mouse a very short distance and tada.. I won't go into the possible macro solution but yea i like to have a few ways of doing any one thing.<br />
<br />
Maybe i'm just gimp as a ranger but I still hate my track window, maybe i'm hard of seeing but those fonts don't display worth a heck. I'd like to make them bold, be able to sort track by aplhabetical order for when searching for spefic mobs out of the huge list of garbage.. and be respected as the tank that I am.. :D okay maybe thats a little far.. should stick to the cleric..<br />
<br />
Who knows I'll probbly jump on this project myself, just like to put the idea out there if anyone more talented wants to give the idea a shot.<br />
<br />
Happy NewYear!</div></div><hr />
