after OODLES of hours POURING over the content on this site and in the forums, i think i've covered just about everything. the forums didn't help me much, but eventually, i figured out what i needed to on my own ... here was my scenario:<br />
<br />
i am new to the whole UI thing (haven't played since before the NEWUI was introduced) and its entirely too confusing. when i see a picture of a nicely set up UI under 'complete UIs' and i download and follow the instructions, i would hope my screen would look EXACTLY like the screenshot given, right? not so. half the complete UIs don't contain a .ini file that tells the particular windows where to align themselves on the screen. eventually i settled for one that i liked, and spent another 2 hours arranging windows and clicking every ALT+ __ and CTRL + ___ to make sure i had everything available and up. (very frustrating)<br />
<br />
suggestion: make another folder for 'complete UIs PLUS .ini file' and ANOTHER folder for 'complete UIs withOUT .ini file' -- this would help tremendously as its very frustrating when you get all the cool window graphix that someone's put so much time and energy into designing, but it doesn't make any sense at all when the windows are alligned to their default positions. (try looking at it as a new user trying to get TRANSLUNA to work... the windows are there, you can see them, but nothing is lined up to be all snazzy - simply because the .zip file is missing the creator's .ini [and no amount of /loaskin'ing WITH &quot;use INI&quot; checked helps this])<br />
<br />
i know this was long-winded, but i DO hope that this helps new players understand why half this stuff don't work like it shows.<br />

Thanks for your suggestion. <br />
<br />
I don’t think we will add new categories for this however I will add an explanation to the FAQ. I know I've posted to great detail in some posts explaining this to people asking why the windows aren’t the same so the forum should have had the information you were looking for.</div></div><hr />
