I use Cairenns wrap around UI, the MP3 player is a part of it, there's a patch right now, again, on my night off of work, again.. myabe they'll fix the last patch with this patch :P here's hoping.</div></div><hr />

From patch message so no bug but i wish we could at least have a chance of chosing ourself if we want the windows to close or not.</div></div><hr />

- Improved the functionality of the ESC key. Windows close in the opposite order that they were opened. <br />
<br />

<br />
Yes bug.<br />
<br />
If you have no &quot;extra&quot; windows (item stats, tracking, friends, containers, etc) open and hit escape, does your player info window close? or your pet info? or target? group?  hotbuttons? actions? No (and I just tested to be sure) because they are &quot;static&quot; windows.  Previously, the music player window was also &quot;static&quot;.  It didn't (and still doesn't) close on zoning, camping, etc, the same as the rest of the &quot;static&quot; windows I listed.<br />
<br />
Now, if you hit escape, it closes.  It still stays open through zones, camping, etc, but closes if you hit escape &quot;one time too many&quot;.  Hence, bug.<br />
<br />
See what I mean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I press escape all the time.  It's the easy way to get out of loot windows, bank and merchant windows.  It's also the only way to clear your target.<br />
<br />
I've also noticed that escape now also closes the friends window, which I think it didn't do before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well ok then Cairenn hehe, several ways looking on it :)<br />
<br />
I use the UI as Xymarra and have custom MP3 player with stats/ Note window as timers / friends as big target. If i want to close a window i want to close it manually.<br />
<br />
Have /bugged it and /feedbacked it so i hope it will be fixed.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed, this new behavior is driving me nuts. This one patch has eliminated most, if not all, of the good window options that were available for the timer. Almost any window that can be spared for the timer now closes when ESC is pressed, making it very inconvenient to use. I have sent in a /bug report and hope that enough people do the same so that they will fix it.<br />
<br />
For me personally, the only windows I want closing when I hit ESC are containers, inventory, loot, merchant, and bank. I want all other windows to stay open until I manually close them. Maybe they can add a new menu toggle option that forces a window to stay open (kind of like &quot;pushpin&quot; on some apps), similar to how the &quot;Lock&quot; menu item currently locks a window's size/location. Windows with the &quot;pushpin&quot; option toggled on should stay open even when ESC is closed. This way, players can decide for themselves which windows they want to keep open to suit their personal preferences.</div></div><hr />

I have /bug'd it once and tempted to bug it more.  I am using Cairenn's UI too and it exp is one of those things I tend to have my eye on so its really cheezing me off :P<br />
<br />
I know I am not adding to the conversation much.. but I just had to get that off my chest :D</div></div><hr />
