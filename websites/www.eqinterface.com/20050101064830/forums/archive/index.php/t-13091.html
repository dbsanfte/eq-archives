<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, let me say this is the best &quot;newbie request for help&quot; post I've seen in a very long time.  Most of the time such posts just say &quot;Help... my stuff isn't working.. please help!!!&quot;  And they all they say....:D <br />
<br />
Other help seekers should take a lesson from this post.  It contains two things vital to getting help.  First, a link to the ui mod in question.  Second, a copy of the UI_Errorlog.txt file.  You are to be commended for the way in which you asked for help.<br />
<br />
Now, to actually answer your question:<br />
<br />
Short Answer <br />
The ui mod you linked to was last updated in July of 2003.  There have been a few significant changes to the EQ interface since then.  In short, this ui is no longer compatible with Everquest.<br />
<br />
Lonk Answer<br />
The ui you linked to is using a custom EQUI_Animations.xml file.  This is the file that defines and / or declares the majority of graphics and animations used throughout the interface.  However, since July of 2003 (when this ui was last updated) the default EQUI_Animations.xml file has been changed in order to declare/define new graphic elements in the default ui.  These elements are actually used elsewhere in the ui.<br />
<br />
Now what's happening in your case is that this ui tries to use some windows from the default ui.  (Sidenote:  all the entires in the error log that say Warning merely mean that there is no custom version of that window in your ui, so EQ attemps to use the default version of that window).  Some of these &quot;default windows&quot; use the newer graphic elements I mentioned above.  But since this ui does use a custom (and out of date) EQUI_Animations.xml file, these newer graphic elements are never defined.  Thus, you get the five lines towards the end of your error log that contain &quot;xml reference error&quot;.    The way to fix this is to edit the custom EQUI_Animations.xml file and add in the definitions for the newer elements.<br />
<br />
Of course the easiest way to &quot;fix&quot; this problem is to use a ui that is current.  Look for ones that have been updated since the end of February 2004 and /or that say they are GoD compatible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
P.S. I am glade I did the post right I really needed to know what I was doing wrong.</div></div><hr />
