<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eqinterface.com/images/sections/eqgserver.gif&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Tonight eqinterface.com/eqgui.com transferred over to a new and much more powerful server. We are now on a Dual Xeon 2.4ghz (w/HT) system with SCSI drives. This should help us a great deal when Sony releases those patches that break your interfaces.<br />
<br />
I have to apologize that I didn’t give any warning. I was so busy working on getting the new server ready.<br />
<br />
Now we need another patch day to test out our new server :)</div></div><hr />

(assuming its isn't fixed by the time you read this) I used the old EQInterface.com address to get here to post this.<br />

Hey, it worked !<br />
The SSL/TLS-aware Apache webserver was<br />
successfully installed on this website. <br />
If you can see this page, then the people who own this website have just installed the Apache Web server software and the Apache Interface to OpenSSL (mod_ssl) successfully. They now have to add content to this directory and replace this placeholder page, or else point the server at their real content. <br />
<br />
ATTENTION!<br />
If you are seeing this page instead of the site you expected, please contact the administrator of the site involved. (Try sending mail to &lt;webmaster@domain&gt;.) Although this site is running the Apache software it almost certainly has no other connection to the Apache Group, so please do not send mail about this site or its contents to the Apache authors. If you do, your message will be ignored. <br />
The Apache online documentation has been included with this distribution.<br />
Especially also read the mod_ssl User Manual carefully. <br />
<br />
Your are allowed to use the images below on your SSL-aware Apache Web server.<br />
Thanks for using Apache, mod_ssl and OpenSSL!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our IP is now 64.191.99.203 but could change in the future... thats why we have a domain name. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our IP would only change if we moved servers... like I did tonight. So it is static. But we may move again some day...</div></div><hr />
