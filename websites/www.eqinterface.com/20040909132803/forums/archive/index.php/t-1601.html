<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">epochpulse</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im searching for a smooth, quartz like BL skin, but one with a theme.  Ive checked Oguliers (sp, sorry bro) and i sorta like it, but the enlarged icons create a bad resolution....i generally play in 1600x1200.  I love the spell book from his skin, but the multi-colored circles in the center drive me crazy.  Id appreciate any help, ive attached the file that i belive holds the spell book graphic, if its not, post and ill put up the other files.<br />
<br />
i would like the exp to have a % displayed at the end, rather than over it...similar to ragbert...the only other thing is that id like the pet to have his health displayed with the red bar and a percentage as well.  I like the vert UI, except the bars are blocky which i cant stand for some reason.  If one can make the skin as smooth as possible, id be happy, but the windows need to be able to move.<br />
<br />
ohh, one last thing...i know, im picky, i dont like my screen all cluttered up, which is why i play which such a high res...i like to be able to see....i use T.Kings graphics for spell gems and such, so those are no worry.<br />
<br />
EDIT: i cannot post the file that holds the spellbook graphic, but if you are working on this, email me and i will send it to you!<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help i can get!!<br />
