<br />
(Here's a new version of the EQUI_Kaori.xml (http://www.angelfire.com/rpg2/thedarkexile/kaoriuimods/EQUI_Kaori.zip) file that has T.King and Remelio's Arrow cursor instead of the sword. Download this file too: tk_arrow.tga (http://www.angelfire.com/rpg2/thedarkexile/kaoriuimods/tk_arrow.tga). It looks more like the original cursor and will come default in the next version of ui.)<br />
<br />
* Documentation<br />
Taken from my description in the downloads area:<br />
<br />
A true mix of Vertebrae, T.King and Remelio, Drakah<br />
<br />
I began working on this version (previous ones were only private works) when T.King and Remelio released their Standard Stone inventory. I originally started with Vertebrae's UI v2.2 as a frame. For this version, I added pieces from T.King/Remelio's works, Drakah's UI Mix v1.0a, and some of my own art and coding. They all deserve some credit for this.<br />
<br />
This UI also comes with T.King's Standard spellbook (seamless version). His current spell buff icon files (v1.04) were too large to include in this zip file. You can find them here: http://pub10.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=74.topic<br />
<br />
Special thanks to Gendal and his excellent SidlWidl program (Everquest SIDL [xml] editor). It is unfinished and currently in its v0.2.9 Alpha stage, but still very helpful. You can find more info about SidlWidl at http://www.sidlwidl.com<br />
<br />
* Important Notes <br />
* The class animation in the EQUI_ActionsWindow.xml file included with the UI is set to 07 (Monk). If you aren't one: delete it. Then, open the /Alternate/ folder that comes with the UI. You'll find your class's file. Just re-name it to EQUI_ActionsWindow.xml and move it out of the folder. You'll also find one without a class animation if you prefer that.<br />
* The long compass bar that is found at the bottom of the screen in the screenshot may not work in resolutions lower than 1280x1024. If you run the game in a lower resolution, I recommend using the EQ_CompassWnd-Small.xml located in the /Alternate/ folder. Just re-name it to EQ_CompassWnd.xml and move it out of the folder. You can preview this window at the top of the screenshot.<br />
* I have included two optional setups in the /Alternate/ folder. The one from the screenshot is the caster setup. The melee setup just moves things around a bit to occupy the space that is left open from not having the spell casting window open. If you use mana, I suggest using the caster setup because the only mana gauge is located in the spell casting window. If you want to use one of these setups, rename the file to UI_Yourname_XX.ini where XX is your server number, and move it to your /Everquest/ folder. *Important: These setups are only for 1280x1024, they will not work otherwise*<br />
<br />
* Edits <br />
* Forgot to mention something about the hotbutton window. It might not be compatible with CCake, (the program that comes with Vert's UI) I havent tried. The slots for the two tabs on the right must be manually changed. A hotbutton window without extra tabs is available for download -&gt; see October 1st news.<br />
* Also, the friends window is in fact the pet info window. This is not accidental. I moved all the pet hotbuttons and the gauge to the friends window because of Arista's timers and other uses for the pet window that require tabs. Since the friends window is not compatible with tabs, you can now use her timers in the pet info window and still see pet stuff.<br />
<br />
Have fun</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the EQUI_Kaori.xml file you will find the cursor definitions just like it were the EQUI_Animations.xml file (they happen to be about mid-way through the file btw). I moved some things here to make it more organized and give proper credit. Like the EQUI_Animations.xml file, this file contains things that are shared between multiple windows. If you don't find something in the EQUI_Animations.xml file, it's probably located here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just tried out this mod you made, &gt;VERY&lt; well done I must say!<br />
The other day I was thinking how it might look to have the #'s on the bar that goes across, heh!<br />
<br />
I will use this mod for a bit and give it a whirl =p<br />
<br />
Few suggestions I would like to inquire, if you can -great!- if not, oh well I asked =)<br />
<br />
1) Color borders around spell gems in the spell window. Seems to be missing.<br />
<br />
2) Name tags for Resists and Normal stats on the &quot;cap bar&quot; are different sizes. <br />
<br />
3) Whats the &quot;100&quot; for on the left side of the target window?<br />
<br />
4) Perhaps for the ones who like the compass on the &quot;cap bar&quot;, maybe mod the Pet window to have the &quot;Stats&quot; underneath that is the same size in height as the Hotkeys/Spell Window?<br />
<br />
5) Add Stamina to player window if ye shrink the HP #?<br />
<br />
err I think thats it .<br />
<br />
Awesome work!!! and thanks for the credit too =)</div></div><hr />

err I think thats it .<br />
<br />
1) I'll look into this<br />
<br />
2) The normal stats labels are actually graphics that came with Vert's UI. He also included resist label graphics, but they were fairly large and looked funny on the compass bar. I'll try shrinking them down and see how they look.<br />
<br />
3) Your HP% ;)<br />
<br />
4) Good idea<br />
<br />
5) I took the stamina gauge out of the player window because it took up space and some people prefer not to see it. It's now located at the bottom of the actions window. That space was left blank in Vert's UI because he made that window the same height as the hotbuttons window. I liked the idea of keeping it the same size so I just filled up the space.<br />
<br />
 Awesome work!!! and thanks for the credit too =) <br />
<br />
You're welcome!<br />

Copy over your mouse.tga file from your default folder. Go into EQUI_Kaori.xml and change these lines:<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DefaultCursor&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;Texture&gt;mouse.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
&lt;Location&gt;<br />
&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
&lt;CX&gt;22&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;22&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
&lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
&lt;X&gt;4&lt;/X&gt;<br />
&lt;Y&gt;1&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
&lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
&lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
Then add these lines:<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;TextureInfo item=&quot;mouse.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
&lt;CX&gt;32&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;32&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
&lt;/TextureInfo&gt;<br />
<br />

Let me know if this doesn't work</div></div><hr />

Open EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml in wordpad or notepad and find the word Player_ExpGauge.  You'll see:<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;LinesFillTint&gt;<br />
&lt;R&gt;0&lt;/R&gt;<br />
&lt;G&gt;50&lt;/G&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;200&lt;/B&gt;<br />
&lt;/LinesFillTint&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Increase the 50 and 200 (max you can make them is 255). Do the same for Player_AAXP. That will make the color brighter ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Averad</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">love the ui but there are a few things that bother me and I wish they could be changed.<br />
<br />
1) The pet window doesnt work for me (friends window)<br />
2)I wish the inv hotkeys window Didnt have the right clickables because your missing one inv slot (that blows)<br />
3)I would like to have my pets hp under mine (get rid of those huge ugly hp numbers the hp% is enough)<br />
<br />
If I could get one thing changed it would be a non rightclickables version.Next would be a working pet window then my pets hp under mine (get rid of those ugly hp numbers)<br />
<br />
Also how do I remove the sword curser I removed it from your xml file but now im left with a smaller sword.</div></div><hr />

I set this up, this mod is great .. I love it.  I HAD to get rid of thr sword cursor though :)<br />
<br />
I didn't read your main post, not sure if you mentioned it, but for anybody using this in 1280x1024 resolution, use /viewport 0 0 1280 760, works wonderful.<br />
<br />
I'd like to make a few suggestions (even if you dont do them, I will figure out how to for myself, or atleast try :))<br />
<br />
1) Redo the bottom bar with all the stats so all the text matches<br />
<br />
2) Make a Hotkey bar without the addon bar.  Just a normal hotbar.<br />
<br />
3a) Make the Spellbook button a little bigger<br />
3b) Move the text for the first spell name, down a little .. in the spell window.  It has the name running right along the top of the window.<br />
3c) Make the mana bar a little smaller :)<br />
3d) Is there a casting bar?  I can't find it :/ .. make one that runs under the Mana bar.<br />
<br />
4) Make the HP/aaexp/exp bars a little smaller, and include a stamina bar.  Possibly remove the big HP tag from it.<br />
<br />
I Think that's it :)</div></div><hr />

Something else I noticed, if you try to tint the compass &quot;strip&quot;, it only tints from the ATK label and right.  Anything to the left of that remains grey.  No idea how to fix this, but thought I'd mention it ... <br />
<br />
<br />
The reason it does this is there are 2 or so graphic seperate pieces that are overlaying the compass that are parts from the background of the bar so you do not see the Strip that bounces back and forth. If you want to change the color of the bar, you will need to do that manually out of game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The pet info window or the friends window? I didn't include a pet info window in the download. The friends window has all the pet stuff in it, so that you can use one of Arista's new timers in the pet window and still be able to see it. Mentioned this in the documentation. Hope this helps ;)</div></div><hr />

Edit:  Seems none of the other ones will work with Kaori's animation's file either..  and I assume bad things will happen if I replace hers.  Any ideas?<br />

<br />
a) Shrunk the Group Window, so it is a little shorter, (20 pixels less), and moved the guages around accordingly .. they look great still.<br />
<br />
b) Made the Player Window a little bigger (20 pixels more), Re-arranged the name/hp number &amp; max number / HP guage, made a new Mana Guage to match the HP guage .. and moved the EXP guages down as well.<br />

You can not move the pet command buttons to any other window other then the pet window they simply will not work.<br />
Just like you can not move spells to another window, nor Auto Equip.<br />

It's my choice on my chars. In any case, would like to point out that the links for downloads on your first post are broken (somethin bout Angelfire not promotin remote linking).<br />
<br />
1 last suggestion I would like to make is regarding the buff window. Would it be possible if you can make a background for the spell names and such? White text on a transparent background would be difficult to read out in light backgrounds (like gd, western wastes just to name a few).<br />
<br />
Regardless, the UI has the perfect mood for the game. Kudos to you.  :nana:</div></div><hr />

I know most players don't need it but I'm running a low level SK and he, like his owner tires easily.  It would be nice to know when he can use a zing.  I would even do without the xp or aaxp bar to make one of them back into a stam bar.  <br />

Thank you for all your time and excellent work.  You and every &quot;skinner&quot; out there has made EQ a totally new experience for me and I believe most of us out there.

Maybe Im a minority on this, playing with the action window off that is, but everything I would use the action window for I do either thru a hotbutton or typed command.  So by keeping the action window closed, I have that much more space on my paltry 1028x768 screen :)<br />

If you use the Spell Gems Window with the mana bar, just download the Player Window with the mana bar that I put up on the main post. Open the xml file in wordpad or notepad and look for the mana percent (happens to be first piece in the document). Change the EQType to 21 from 20. Then go down to the mana gauge (second piece down). Change the EQType there to 3 from 2. Now you have a fatigue percent label and gauge ;) You can change the colors to something other than blue using RGB values in TextColor and FillTint.</div></div><hr />

Read this other reply that Kaori made .. he was suggesting to use this to replace MANA with STA, but you can use the same idea to replace AAXP with STA ..  :)<br />

Download this file too: tk_arrow.tga (http://www.angelfire.com/rpg2/thedarkexile/kaoriuimods/tk_arrow.tga).

When you have a syntax error listed like that it means the code isn't XML compliant (not necessarily SIDL-related, hard to explain). To test this just open the file in internet explorer, and at the end you'll see where the syntax error occurs. I fixed the file, it turns out your &quot;commenting&quot; was a little messy where you told it to skip some tabs :)<br />
<br />
The attached file should work.<br />
<br />
I'm not completely sure which tabs you wanted but, I finished whatever had a &lt;!-- at the beginning of a line or a --&gt; at the end of the line. If you are missing a tab you wanted, just remove the &lt;!-- and --&gt; from the line where the code includes the tab.</div></div><hr />

What do you mean? Anyway, all windows are being re-sized for v3.1 to be as small as possible for optimum screen space saving.<br />

Easier to do than you think. Just open EQUI_ChatWindow.xml and change &lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;false&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt; to say true. I suppose I should include this in v3.1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarisk</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well for example, the long horizontal stats bar at the bottom cuts off in 1600x1200, gives a good amount of space on the right (or left or both depending on if I move it) also when I put it into 1600x1200 the chat windows were stuck on the bottom and I couldn't even resize it, lol.<br />
<br />
But I will do as you suggested and hopefully it will work so I can keep this great lookin UI =) or I'll just wait til the next version =)<br />

To change the fill colors in the player window, open the EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml file in wordpad and go to 'Edit' 'Find...' and type in 'Player_HP'. It should warp you to the part of the code that defines the gauge. Scroll until you see:<br />
  &lt;FillTint&gt;<br />
    &lt;R&gt;200&lt;/R&gt;<br />
    &lt;G&gt;0&lt;/G&gt;<br />
    &lt;B&gt;0&lt;/B&gt;<br />
  &lt;/FillTint&gt;<br />
Change the 200, 0, 0 all to 255's. To change the fill colors in the group window, open the EQUI_GroupWindow.xml file and repeat the process, except find 'GW_Gauge1', 'GW_Gauge2', 'GW_Gauge3', 'GW_Gauge4', and 'GW_Gauge5'. All the FillTints of these gauges should now be pure white.<br />
<br />
By the way, it is taking quite a while to get v3.1 exactly the way I want it, so hang in there!</div></div><hr />

Only problems is I can't get it to work and I REALLY REALLY want to use it.  :(<br />

I downloaded the zip.  Extracted to appropriate folder.  Replaced the apropriate actions window (i'm druid), and used the UI folder for the settings that came with it.  I also downloaded your 4 zip files for the fixes.  I am using the appropriate resolution.  Now, here are my problems:<br />
<br />
1.  I have no spell book (it's invisible and all i see are the icons)<br />
2.  The icons are the default icons (spell and buff icons)<br />
3.  I CAN&quot;T see a buff window.<br />
4.  None of the stuff fits where it's supposed to go.  I at first had the tiny bottom bar at the bottom with all the stats and resists, but I would like it to be at the top like on the screenshot. <br />

That being said I'd like to see if I could get a bit of help with the issue im having. I downloaded the new mouse icon and for some odd reason Im getting no icon at all. Just a invisable mouse pointer. As you could imagian this makes it a bit harder to play. I downloaded the new mouse zip and than extraced it right to the kaoriV3 folder. Did I miss something here? One other cosmetic thing I was wondering about is there any possable way to get the old casting bar back. The new graphic is very pretty but after playing for a few years I've grown attached to the old pink casting bar, O and one last thing. How would i go about moving the lag meter?

i'll double check and try to get all the different resolutions into the INI's so it'll work for everyone, and hopefully post a caster version pretty soon<br />
<br />
i hope this helps Kaori and Cairenn a little bit so they can continue doing great work with keeping this working and updated thru all the various VI patches, if either one of you two would like me to tweak settings and test or what not, i'd be more then happy to help, you can shoot me an email at talynskael@earthlink.net</div></div><hr />

Id like to start by saying what so many others have said and that is thank you for all the work you have done and for the very nice mod. That being said I'd like to see if I could get a bit of help with the issue im having. I downloaded the new mouse icon and for some odd reason Im getting no icon at all. Just a invisable mouse pointer. As you could imagian this makes it a bit harder to play. I downloaded the new mouse zip and than extraced it right to the kaoriV3 folder. Did I miss something here? One other cosmetic thing I was wondering about is there any possable way to get the old casting bar back. The new graphic is very pretty but after playing for a few years I've grown attached to the old pink casting bar, O and one last thing. How would i go about moving the lag meter? Thank you ahead of time for your help and hard work. <br />
<br />
Did you also download the graphics file? There were two files you needed to download to get the other mouse icon working.<br />
<br />
New version that will be released this weekend has a regular cast bar (attached the file if you want to use it).<br />
<br />
Lag meter can only be moved by using viewport (it always stays in the top left corner).</div></div><hr />

What does your uierrors.txt file (in /Everquest/ main folder) say after you try to load it?<br />
<br />
If you copied both the raid window and raid options window into your kaoriv3 folder you should delete them, you only need them in the default folder. If you copied your EQUI.xml file over as well, that is probably the problem - but now that you have copied it, do not delete it. Open it up in wordpad or notepad and add &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_Kaori.xml&lt;/Include&gt; as the last &quot;include&quot; in the same style as the others if you don't have it there already.</div></div><hr />

i'm using the tking buff icons, tking's latest inventory, Celtic, it goes nice with the overall feel of KaoUI, i've got the latest Pet Window, so your friends window works great for those that use it, and currently i'm still playing around with the caster version of this mod, i'll put that up here so you can see the diff (i'll have both a bar cast window, and the arcane orb included)<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice tweaks!! I love the new celtic inventory, and you're right, it does mesh beautifully with KaoUI. I can't wait to see a caster version!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any plans to fix the friends window though? Kao said something in the description about friends window not being compatible with tabs, which means it hasn't been touched in a few weeks. Friends has tabs now, and extra buttons, so it's throwing errors for me. I could fix it, but if it's been done by Kao I'd like that one :)<br />
<br />
Also, someone mentioned there's a PoP patch for this UI... I didn't see it. Is it somewhere in this thread? Honestly I haven't gone through all four pages of the thread...<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
First of all, thanks for the UI you provided to us, I think this is the best around.<br />
<br />
<br />
But since the 21st of October patch, I fail to load the Cairenn UI. So Cairenn, my request is pretty simple: can you post ALL your UI in a .zip format so I can download it please ? I get lost with all the updates and problems with Kao/Cairenn UI. And can you please put the Tking arrow pointer already installed please, I got an headache last night when I tried to install many pointers on my UI, and it failed everytime. Thanks :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
<br />
~Randy<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. I think the UI is really perfect, except for one thing: the Nature's Defender pointer is just too big... You should put a &quot;ready-to-download version&quot; of your UI with a smaller pointer, Kaori. But that's just my opinion. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I greatly appreciate the hard effort put into making these mods available to us and i do realize you dont need to do this for us at all. Thank you again for your hard work! please dont look at this as a complaint, but as someone who loves your mods and would love to be able to utilize it :)</div></div><hr />

As always, posted shrunk to 800x600, click image for 1024x768 view.<br />
<br />
Since there seem to have been so many problems with my mod ...<br />
<br />
IF you are using my smaller mods of this UI:<br />
<br />
1)  Make a new subfolder within your custom folder, named anything you want.<br />
2)  Move ALL .xml files in your custom folder into it.<br />
3)  Download the attached zip file and extract into your custom folder.<br />
4) Any other custom files (example a timer mod, map mod, etc) you had and want included, move back out of the subfolder you created in step 1 back into the custom folder.<br />
<br />
There are two additional subfolders:<br />
<br />
One is the ActionWindows folder.  In it, you will find the EQUI_ActionWindow_CLASS.xml files for each class.  Pick yours, rename it EQUI_ActionWindow.xml (take off the _CLASS part).  Copy it into your custom directory.<br />
<br />
The other additonal subfolder has two optional files in it.  One is a Small Compass that is *just* the compass, without the long bar that has all the stats and whatnot on it.  The second is a smaller Player &amp; Group combo Window that does NOT include the stamina/casting, exp and aaexp bars.<br />
<br />
This download does NOT include any .tga files other than those which are absolutely necessary for this to work.  No spellbook, spellcastingbar or buff icons.  No backgrounds.  No custom spell book.  It does, however, include a T.King Inventory, as that is required for the inventory tabs I have on the two tabbed windows (any T.King inventory can be subsituted for the one I've included).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilander</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, Id like to say thank you to Kaori and Cairenn for creating the greatest UI Skin I have yet to see!!   Fantastic job!!<br />
<br />
I read that you will be releasing a version 3.1 on Saturday (tomorrow) and just wondered which problems exactly this updated version will address, as I am having a few minor problems with the skin myself.<br />
<br />
The first problem I am having  and have had this for a while now  is that on zoning I get the your XML files are not compatible with current Everquest XML files blah blah blah.. message, strangely enough all the windows do continue to work just fine and it does not automatically load the default UI.   Nevertheless, there seems to be a problem somewhere.<br />
<br />
The only other visible problems that I have is on raids, I crash straight to desktop frequently once I accept a raid invites, so right now I solo to avoid this problem, but obviously this is not ideal.   I understand that the raid XML files must be copied over to the custon UI folder, but I dont know which files these are.   Also of interest, I think about a week ago I made alterations to the Annimation.XML file as instructed.<br />
<br />
Anyway, looking forward to version 3.1, hopefully one simple zip file will address my problems, also is there any chance you could start a new thread when it is released titled Kaori v3.1 Released or words to that effect?   This post is rather cluttered and slightly confusing now hehe.<br />
<br />

Downloaded with ease, Installed with easy. Only problem I am having right now is the new raid window will now show up. I do have PoP installed and registered. I looked and the two raid files are in your UI folder, any clue as to why they may not be working? or is this a fix for 3.1?</div></div><hr />

Comos, when you go to extract the files to your directory, did you make sure that the &quot;use folder names&quot; option is checked?<br />

Most of the mods are from this forum by people that posted them, those that arent i think i gave credit to all i used... if not smack me and i'll fix it right quick.<br />
<br />
Both versions are best used on 1152x864 (Mainly 1024x768 or higher is good.... 800x600 kinda gets cramped a little)<br />
Just unzip into UIfiles .... rename the .ini to UI_Yourname_Yourservernumber and move it to your main EQ directory and your gtg.<br />
<br />
All windows are currently working as of Oct. 26. <br />
