I have been running this now for a couple of weeks and everything seems fine, but let me know if you run into any problems.<br />

This UI was created using t.king artwork, both complete pieces and pieces I made using a borders kit.<br />

Thomus has said he will send me the source files, so can *attempt* (ok I am rolling on floor laughing at this point) to keep up his spell sets.  I will do my best.  As of right now I don't have the files.  Until I do, all I can do is use the EQ ones and add them into the appropriate places.  I can munge them a little and have already, but I want to see what actually goes live.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elberethe</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been using the TKing Celtic UI for a long time now and would like to say that I love the recent changes to it Kuvasie.  I have a few suggestions/wishes but please do not let that indicate I'm not thrilled with the new look.  I have enjoyed this interface because it is very clean cut (the pieces fitting together flush and clean) and doesn't take up a whole lot of window space.  You have added some beauty to it without it loosing what I like :) <br />
<br />
1) Is there anything you can do to update the pet window? I believe I'm still using the one from the 1.8 release.  At first, I could resize it (up/down) but now I can not.  The window buffs goes in is 2 sizes too large.  I did manage to get a couple of my alts resized to 1/2 that size before I could no longer resize it. <br />
<br />
2) Something is terribly wrong with the new melee window.  I can't resize it at all and its just a small box.  I believe this is 1.8 version too.<br />
<br />
3) In the new version, I really prefered the boarder on the chat window to be the narrow version from before.  I like the effects and background you are using but its wider now and wider = less space.  Is there anyway to get that more narrow?  Otherwise, I think I will go back to 1.8 version for just the chat windows. Maybe make the chat window border same as the border on the other windows?<br />
<br />
4) I found your hotbutton celtic thing and tried that.  It doesn't flush with the rest though =(  I really like the way it looks too, but more I like having access to all my inventory slots!  I can't use it though as it really breaks up the clean look.  Is there any way to border it and make it fit with the rest of the pieces?<br />
<br />
4a) If not, is there anyway to make the top 2 buttons on the Celtic 2.0 Hotwindow our choice?  I could choose to put an inventory there or another piece of jewelry?  I do not need quick access to my secondary or my arm piece, but would like access to my neck piece and ear piece (hope this makes sense).  Is there anyway you or even I can change what pieces are clickable from the hotbutton extra slots?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your effort to keep this UI updated. It is still my favorite by far.  Thankyou for any time you might spend considering any of my suggestions.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvasie</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am glad you like most of the changes.  You had a long post, so I am just going to use the numbers to answer your questions.<br />
<br />
1 - I would suggest you just delete the pet window.  I have no idea how I would want remake it, since if you place the buffs underneath it is too large.  If you delete the petwindow, the default window will take on the borders of the rest of the UI.<br />
<br />
2 - I have no idea what this is, that window is not included in either mod.  See what happens with 2.0.<br />
<br />
3 - To get the thin chat border, simply delete the EQUI_chatwindow.xml file.  You will have the default window using the the borders of the rest of the UI.<br />
<br />
4 - This one lost me, what celtic hotbutton thingy??<br />
<br />
4 a - You can change the extra inventory slots by going into the code itself.  There is no way I could do this and have it fit what everyone needs.  Here are the names of the slots in the code (in order): &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot13&lt;/Pieces&gt;  &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot12&lt;/Pieces&gt; &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot15&lt;/Pieces&gt; &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot10&lt;/Pieces&gt; &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot17&lt;/Pieces&gt; Just change the EQtype to what you need in those slots.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elberethe</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thankyou for help =)<br />
<br />
I will answer same way, hopefully make it easier.<br />
<br />
1- Worked, but I liked TKings pet window better and I was able to resize it to make it small on a couple of characters before it stopped letting me do that ~shrugs~ Maybe you can make a pet window (the buffs showed up in the window small size not big like in players buff window too).<br />
<br />
2- Think I might have found answer to this trying to understand your last answer.  I didn't realize it was going to take so much &quot;coding&quot; on my part though.  Not sure I really want to get that involved and may just use default interface for melee chars. If interested the problem I'm having is very similar to one described here and sounds like the people making interfaces using the same name for a file that eq uses.<br />
<br />
From:  http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11691<br />
<br />
Quoted:  The problem is that the new file EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml is using the files window_pieces06.tga and window_pieces07.tga. That is the reason your combat window looks all jumbled.<br />
<br />
You need to copy the EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml file from the default UI directory into your custom UI directory.<br />
<br />
Then make a copy of window_pieces_06.tga and window_pieces_07.tga from the default UI and rename them to something like original_windows_pieces_06.tga etc.<br />
<br />
Then modify your EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml file by replacing all window_pieces_06.tga to original_window_pieces_06.tga and window_pieces_07.tga to original_window_pieces_07.tga.<br />
<br />
3- Perfect! Exactly what I wanted here =)<br />
<br />
4- http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6556<br />
One you created .. very pretty =)<br />
<br />
4a- I *wish* I understood this.  Here is only thing I could find even remotely similiar to what you stated I would:<br />
<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot17&lt;/Pieces&gt; <br />
  &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot10&lt;/Pieces&gt; <br />
  &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot15&lt;/Pieces&gt; <br />
  &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot12&lt;/Pieces&gt; <br />
  &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot13&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
What confuses me is that the hotbutton window has 10 slots for hotbuttons and 5 slots for other.  So assuming those 5 slots for other are what is stated above then I should see in the first slot my chest piece; 2nd slot my RWrist; 3rd slot my LFinger; 4th slot my Hands; 5th slot my Primary.<br />
<br />
I do not .. what I do see is: 1st slot Primary; 2nd is Secondary; 3rd is RWrist; 4th is my next to last satchel on right side; 5th slot is my last satchel on right side.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is: 1st is Primary; 2nd is Chest; 3rd is Neck; 4th and 5th the same.<br />
<br />
Now *IF* I understand this (I probably surely do not) all I would have to do is change the numbers to read:<br />
<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot13&lt;/Pieces&gt; <br />
  &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot17&lt;/Pieces&gt; <br />
  &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot5&lt;/Pieces&gt; <br />
  &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot12&lt;/Pieces&gt; <br />
  &lt;Pieces&gt;HBInvSlot13&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
Way it would look in game:<br />
13=Primary in first slot<br />
17=chest in second slot<br />
5=neck in 3rd slot<br />
12=I do not know why this equals satchel and not my hands but it does<br />
13=Same thing this should equal Primary but it is my satchel.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm in the wrong place?  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I guess this last question is mine to figure out since I'm the one who wants the change. However, I would appreciate you looking at thread I posted for problem 2 as I think this was caused by the way you are naming files in the UI and if I change it now then I'm going to have to change it everytime there is an update.<br />
<br />
I know some of you like to do that sort of thing and make some beautiful stuff, but it really isn't my thing.  I just enjoy the nice things you create and like them easy.  Any help you wanna give me on last question, I would appreciate, but after looking at this stuff, I can see you are probably quite busy.  I will understand.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the 2 things that did get fixed.  Helps alot =)</div></div><hr />

Celtic 2.0 SE is a completely new UI.  Just unzip the files into a folder in your uifiles folder in EQ - go into the game and use the loadskin command.<br />

<br />
Thats just the problem. It is huge and stupid =P I do not know how I did it but I simply dragged the pet window to make it smaller and the buff icons appeared small in the window too when I did that (much smaller then they are in player buff window).  They just resized themself to fit the smaller window. I have reset them now so can't even give you a screenshot now. Wish someone would do something with the pet window.  It is insane.<br />
<br />
 I will have to look into this one, my combat abilites window shows up just fine.  Pieces window_pieces_06.tga and window_pieces_07.tga are not included in this mod, so EQ should be pulling them from the default. ??<br />
<br />
Not to worry. I just use default on melee for now =/ <br />
<br />
 Great! Thanks, but it wasn't made for this UI.  It was made from one of tking's orginal spellbar mods. <br />
<br />
Aye, I know, but if you ever some extra time and nothing to do and feeling bored (lol) if you wanna make a border on it and make it fit with this that would be nice.  No big deal though.<br />

<br />
I must be missing something. I still don't understand this but my significant other is going to take a look at it.  I see what has to be changed and I have the codes .. the codes just do not match what I'm seeing when I log on.  Don't really know how to explain it.<br />

I hope this helps a little,<br />

Yah, it helped alot. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this UI. I love it even more since the small changes you made to it (after I changed back to default chat windows).  This is a very sweet UI for people who like things neat and to fit together smoothly.  Has all the bells and whistles without all the clutter.<br />

Thanks for your work on it.  I very much appreciate that =)</div></div><hr />

That would require modifying the graphics files and the xml file. It may be easier to just find a different one in the dowloads section you do like and replace it.<br />
