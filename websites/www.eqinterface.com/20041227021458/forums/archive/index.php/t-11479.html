<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eqinterface.com/images/sections/melee.gif&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Yes last night there were about 100 or so Warriors, Rogues and Monks in West Commons where the new vendors have been placed to help test out the new Melee Skills (a spawned mob called &quot;no loot for you&quot; was our test target).  Here are some tips that will help if you want to try out the new melee.<br />
<br />
• Remember this is the test server, things are not set in stone yet<br />
<br />
• The books cost 2 or 3 copper each, kill some &quot;yard trash&quot; on your way there<br />
<br />
• Give the book back to the guy you buy it from to learn the skill<br />
<br />
• ALT-C opens the new window, then right click on one of the 8 hot-keys to memorize the ability you learned<br />
<br />
• As of 12/3 only the &quot;openings&quot; part of the change has been added, effects are not all done yet.<br />
<br />
• /Feedback is your friend, keep your feeback to the facts, and useful.. &quot;this sucks&quot; or &quot;this rules&quot; is nice, but not helpful. Try and be as specific as you can.<br />
<br />
If you have the time or desire, please feel free to help give feedback, with out help we can shape the new melee abilities into a very nice workable addition. Feel free to discuss (politely) your findings in this post Here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11478)<br />
