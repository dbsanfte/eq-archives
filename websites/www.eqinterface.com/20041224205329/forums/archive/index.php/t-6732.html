<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">02-17-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stuck my UI under mix and match because it borrows elements from the Kaori UI and also has TKing, Remelio and Cairenn pieces in it as well..   I made the UI for 1024x768 resolution but will adjust it for higher resolutions on request..  I started this thread because I would like to get feedback on it, if you like, dislike, suggestions, improvements, etc..   If I change anything or make updates I will post them here..  I haven't discovered how I go about making changes to the original upload, but once I figure that out I'll update the description and of course add any global modifications..  ;)<br />

Done. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I've already made some minor adjustments to this... Added a few optional ways of setting up the inventory, including a swapout of the inventory/player windows..  I've placed these optional files under an options folder..  I also cleaned up a few cosmetic issues, and moved the stamina/breathing gauge to the selector window.  I added a .txt file with a little bit of info on the mod.  I did not make it patch proof yet, it still uses a custom EQUI_Animations.xml file, inherited from Kaori that I will have to go through and pick out the customizations from..  And I think it will be a couple of weeks before I tackle a higher resolution version..  I am still including an EQUI.xml that has the popup casting and breathing gauges removed.  Only a few minor things have changed from the original screenshot so I'm not including a new one.  <br />
<br />
I'm sending in the update now, it won't let me attach it to this post..  It may be awhile before you can download the updated version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I made all my modifications, tested them, zipped up the file, sent it in .. and then realized I hadn't included the update to one of the files..  DOH!..  Anyway, nothing is hurt by not having the updated version; I just changed the way the gauge background looks a little.   But I did notice that I screwed up the buff window and short duration buff window.. I tried to realign everything a little bit better, but looks like all I did was manage to get the text off center..  Sorry about that, I will either fix it, or leave out those windows in a future release (you can get almost the same buff windows as a seperate piece done by Cairenn, whose original code was modified for these)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">02-21-2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, just letting everyone know to expect some updates on Monday..   I will probably do as Kudane asked and upload them as patches first, and then will release a final version of my UI by the end of next week..  Then I will start working on the 1280x1024 version.. ;)  One of the things that will be fixed is the buff and short buff windows to correct the alignment of the text..  Also this will include any new additions for LoY and the updated castspellwindow.  <br />
<br />
Also I haven't received any real feedback on the UI yet, would like to hear from those who have used it as to how they like it, things they might want to have modified for their use, etc..  I think I pretty much like it the way it is atm, but I'm willing to listen to any ideas..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">04-09-2003, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I apologize to anyone who may have been waiting for me to create another version of this UI for higher resolutions, but I am unfortunately no longer in the mood to work on any UIs..  I still have yet to upload the &quot;final&quot; 1024x768 version after the LoY patches..   (patch for LoY can still be found in the patch forum for anyone still trying out the UI..) .  Again, sorry if I had you waiting in anticipation over the higher resolution..  but it doesn't seem anyone else has taken the opportunity to voice their opinions on the UI anyway.. hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leiloo_EQ</div><div class="date">04-11-2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can completely understand not being in the mood anymore to make changes. I made a modified version of Kao's UI myself way back when. I still use it, but I don't update it for anyone now besides me and my friends. Thank you very much for your UI though it really taught me alot on how to modify my own. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will have the updated UI out within a couple of days for the LDoN windows..  I just made the changes the other day ..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigs</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how do you auto equip stuff with this ui?  seems to be very nice but auto equip is missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I've never had any use personally for the auto-equip area..  I always put the item where I want it to go.. (and when looting you just have to right click to auto-equip anyway)  I'll have to verify, but either the auto-equip area is on the &quot;stats&quot; tab over your class animation, or I wasn't able to get it to work with the tabbed inventory..   Also note when using the tabbed inventory that the class animation always shows the warrior animation..  Can't fix that one..<br />
<br />
There is a solution for you though ..  In the directory for this UI there is an options directory.  In there I've included an alternate inventory that includes a working animation and I believe an auto-equip area (again over the class animation I believe)..  It is wider than the one shown, so it may not fit as nicely with the rest of the windows, but you can use it if you really need an auto-equip area...  It also has an optional inventory/player info window swapped setup..<br />
<br />
If I get time this week I'll try to get some screenshots up of the alternate windows..  It's been awhile, but I believe I gave instructions on how to use the optional items..  <br />
<br />
As for supporting other resolutions, I'm not sure I'm going to get around to porting this to higher (or lower) resolutions anytime soon..</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I just wanted to speak out that I love &quot;¢¾¢¾¢¾&quot; your UI I use quite a few UI from here and I was really pumped when I seen one that was for 1024x768 as that is what I have always used. tried others but too old to get them to where I can see the little print :-)<br />
 Well anyways I just wanted to say thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will update this UI as soon as I can for the new melee system changes in Dec 18th patch..  and I think I'll remove the modified EQUI.xml file .. ;) ..   That should make it more resilient to patches..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have decided to stop playing EQ, therefore I will no longer be updating or supporting this UI..  If anyone would like to take over this UI then please feel free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arslayn</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man I love this UI I dont like running a 1280 Reso as I dont like the text size in the windows. This UI has been perfect and Ive used it almost a year now (even after OoW changes)however the OoW patch caused a few problems... Im now to a point to AA and get expanded spell buffs and the extra spell but the UI doesnt support it and after 10k hp the compass/stats combo bar wont display properly(not a big deal but be nice). Can anyone help me with a fix for the the buffs and spell slot problem? Ive managed any fixes to this point like the combat window add etc along the way but these fixes are beyond my understanding I tried a few xml edits that just broke the UI all together that I then reverted back....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I started playing again, though I'm not using this UI anymore..  I can easily update the spell bar.. the stats (compass) bar might be a little more difficult because there's not much room left on there but I'll see what I can do..  And I guess I'll bring it up to date finally..  as soon as I have a little extra time..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I made the modifications to the cast spell window that should work .. I haven't tested it myself though so let me know if you get any errors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I think I gave enough room for you people with way too much HP.. ;p ..  However just like the previous file I haven't tested it so the changes may not be exactly right.. let me know if anything is too crowded or if this didn't resolve the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arslayn</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">do I just copy/paste the info from the 2 over the existing xml files ? <br />
Or do I have to rewrite the info provided into the existing XML files bear with me if this seems like stupid questions like I said Im totally clueless when it comes to true XML editing. I ask only because when I copy paste to note book its not showing the ascii text &lt;spelldraw-&gt; etc type text and so far It looks as if the first adresses the 9th spell gem (I think lists only to 8th) and the HP issue with Compass combo window but I dont see a fix for the Buff window past the 15th slot.. as well as  with the buff window the last buff (15th) was always not quite  correct you couldnt  click remove it and it never showed an icon it was just text and transparent. <br />
 Heh I know just what you want to see a person making requests for a UI that you dont even use. Thank you very much for taking the time to address my original request and so quickly :)<br />
Both the files you have posted dont display properly under IE or Netscape can you possibly zip them maybe so they can be just be unzipped over existing files etc?<br />
<br />
edited for spelling and a bit of grammar ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what happened to the last buff..  probably something I never noticed because I never had that many buffs up..  and I can certainly fix it for you.. (will have to figure out what happened to that buff first) ..  As far as the other files, they show up fine for me..  Not sure what might be causing you problems, but you shouldn't need to copy/paste.. just right click the link and choose &quot;save target as&quot; and then save as the same name under your kx2UI folder under everquest/uifiles (normally under &quot;program files&quot; or &quot;program files/sony&quot;)<br />
<br />
Just as a followup .. the path where the files should be placed is &quot;C:/program files/everquest/uifiles/kx2UI/&quot;  or &quot;C:/program files/sony/everquest/uifiles/kx2UI/&quot; ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I'm a little confused..   When I coded this originally and took the screenshots the last buff icon was showing fine..  and when I look in the code I can't find any reason why it wouldn't still be showing up..  So I'm not sure why you aren't seeing it..  I will have to wait until I get home today to be able to modify this one (or you might simply find another buff window to replace it with.. you would simply need to overwrite the file..  Mine was a modified version of Cairenn's buff window, and her files are under the &quot;Featured&quot; section of the downloads)<br />
<br />
Gah, just thought of something.. it is possible that I noticed that problem and fixed it after you had downloaded the files ..  You might also try downloading the UI again but ONLY extracting the buff window file..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I think this will take care of the extra buff slots for OoW .. please use it and let me know if there are any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arslayn</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx for the instructions for the files. Ill load all 3 later tonite etc and give them a test when I can. Again THanx very much for the effort you put into it for me its very generous.</div></div><hr />
