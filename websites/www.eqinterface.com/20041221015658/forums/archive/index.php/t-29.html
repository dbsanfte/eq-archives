<br />
not sure if I'm the only one who noticed you dont have to camp out to get new skins on the UI, and maybe some do, it could be vid card dependant, who knows with EQ</div></div><hr />

<br />
Typing /loadskin custom did nothing but revert all my settings to default.</div></div><hr />

I never had any trouble loading skins with the /loadskin command myself.</div></div><hr />

I used /loadskin and then happened to die (only lvl 10 on the char i did it on) and when I popped up at bind I had the new skins.  So use /loadskin and then zone, seems to work also.<br />

<br />
**edit** ok so there is one problem all the window positions are reset to some default setting,  perhaps after logging out they go back to where you had put them before? i reloaded a custom ui that i already had up and it reset my positions to the default but after logging and coming back they were back where i had put them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phalia</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded a bigger hotkey bank, entered EQ, typed /loadskin {filename}, and my new and improved hotkey bank popped onto my screen.  Of course it rearranged all my previous settings :\  I have done this 4 times now.  (I did NOT have  to camp out, or zone.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razer</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/loadskin works for me too, unless somethign is missing from the skin I am trying to load, in which case it says it can't load it and loads the default.<br />
<br />
regardless of wether or not it loads a new skin, the default skin, or any other skin I have previously used, it ALWAYS resets the windows to the default position and it sucks, and they need to make it so that it saves settings you use for a skin in whatever resolution you have used it in, so if you go and load it again, it uses the settings for your current resolution so you don't have to waste time moving and sizing everything again. If you haven't used the skin before, or have used it in a different resolution, THEN it can load it at default settings.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will happen sometime int he future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the /loadskin command does load the coordinates stored in the XML files, so if you don't like where they go you can modify your mods coordinates (although there is still a bug with it, I explain in another thread)<br />
<br />
No you don't need to log out to get your UI changes UNLESS they are of a graphic nature (eg. someone has actually modified the .tga files).  Not sure about zoneing as I never tried to move zones while messing around with files but character selection screen seems to be far enough.  The graphics seem to only be loaded once (at the point you log in).</div></div><hr />
