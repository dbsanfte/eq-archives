(Updated to give the Link to all my Skins:p) (http://www.eqinterface.com/list.php?skinnerid=60384)<br />
<br />
My Player window combines the Player and Target windows with auto attack blink, player/pet guage and target guages with percentages, mana and casting guage, and transperant background.<br />
<br />
The Loot window has all 31 slots in a one look window. I'v concidered making the loot window with smaller slots to save space right now there normal size :).<br />
<br />
I made my Big Bank Window with the bank slots stacks over each other and extra inventory slots at the bottom. It has the money in the corner with the buttons under it and the shared slots below that (and they are marked:)). I have added equipment on the other side of the bank and inv slots plus wgt, AC, and ATT info.<br />
<br />
And the Hot Button Window is the default window on a Weight loss program but it looks better on smaller view areas (800x600) and cramped layouts<br />
<br />
Its still a little rough (i call all my stuff rough :)) but good ... yes good :D :p <br />
<br />
If you upgraded or change them in some way please contact me and leave my name in it :) and add that you modified it.<br />
<br />
if you have anything to say post it here or give me a P message<br />
<br />
All my UIs have been updated for the new patch<br />
