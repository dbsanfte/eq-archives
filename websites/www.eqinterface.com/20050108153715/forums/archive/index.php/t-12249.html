<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sbalke7270</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this is my first post here, so please be patient...  I cannot seem to get individual UI windows to work on either of my accounts.  I can, however, get complete sets to work with no problems (for the most part).  Is there something that has to be done differently if I just want to change my character info window?  I like most of the Mix &amp; Match sets, but there are other, separate windows I'd like to install individually.  I have tried having the separate UI window in its own folder and selecting it from the options screen in game.  I have also tried replacing the files in the full UI folder.  I hope you can understand what I'm trying to say here and can offer some insight as to what I am doing wrong.  Thanks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If someone wrote a complete UI, then each window might not be self-contained, and might be dependant on other files within the UI, meaning that window won't work when it is copied into another UI.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you are talking about a window that is meant to be standalone, then it should work if you copy that file into the directory for the UI you are using.</div></div><hr />
