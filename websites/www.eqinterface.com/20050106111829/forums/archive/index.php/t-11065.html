I know a little (and I do mean a just a little) of how to tweak these files.  And I'm baffled here.<br />
<br />
I tried the patch fixes, and added the stuff that went before the <br />
&lt;Screen item = &quot;TargetWindow&quot;&gt;.<br />
<br />
Only when I tried to Find the below line to add the line that went after it... there was no such line.  And I've no idea where it would go :(.<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;Target_HPPercLabel&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
Being as it looks like it's missing at least one important line... I'm also wondering if it would be easier just to scrap this one and for someone to write or edit a new one.  <br />
<br />
Basically all I want is the window to look like that one with the con color.  Doesn't even need the con ring I've seen in the target bar on the default.  Would like the box about the same size, without the Target window name and all,  and the percent to the right of the health bar to allow for those obnoxiously long names.  I think the con color in the target bar is neat... but I've no idea how to accomplish that, so I'm humbly asking for some kind person to take the time to fix or create this if the task would interest anyone.</div></div><hr />
