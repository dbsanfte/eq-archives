<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I decided to keep the current version at the top of the thread.<br />
<br />
Its intended mainly as a healer group window, but will work for everyone.<br />
<br />
It has all 6 group members in it, It leaves out your name, but has names of other group members over thier lifebars.<br />
<br />
Life gauges are slightly thicker than normal for increased visibility in higher res.<br />
<br />
Pet lifebar, Exp and AA bars are at the bottom by the invite/disband buttons.<br />
<br />
Each life bar has a large gem on the left end that has a life % indicator in it, and the gem changes color as the person takes damage. Green(100%) to yellow(75%) to orange(50%) to red(25%) to flashing red(~20%).<br />

<br />
If you would like to try it, download it and let me know what you think. Click links below to download. Unzip it to your UI directory, it is a self contained mod with its own graphics files.<br />
<br />
Download version with transparent background. (http://home.attbi.com/~mbeiser/Files/CalGWbeta3trans.zip)<br />
<br />
Download version with background.(shown) (http://home.attbi.com/~mbeiser/Files/CalGWbeta3.zip) <br />
<br />
1/28/03:<br />
Fixed pet lifebars.<br />
Using different graphic for the gauge tubes.<br />
Added F key lables to the color changing gems.<br />
Moved the % numbers onto the lifebars.<br />
Changed gauge backgrounds so the rings show in the dividers in the gauges.<br />
Added blank gauges so the metal rings show in the gauge tubes at all times.<br />
<br />
1/29/03:<br />
Changed the size of the % labes on the lifebars so they do not block mouse clicking the lifebar to target a group member.<br />
<br />
Changed the order the gauges are so that the pet lifebars for group members can be clicked to target the pet.</div></div><hr />

I was wondering if you could make a version with exp and aa at the bottom. Being a cleric i dont watch my stamina too much.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvasie</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks good - nice job!  You have made some improvements to the grp portion that I thought needed to be done to my smaller version.  I don't have time to try this tonite, but what sort of pet gauge problems are you seeing?<br />
<br />
Kuv</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, pet guage....<br />
<br />
I stole this last night to hack up the great job you guys 'collaboratively' did for a horizontal (cuz that's the way I am) and discovered as my Beastlord partner conjured up a friend that they just don't show up.<br />
<br />
No errors, even when replacing the the guage template with the default guage template and reloading, the darn thing just doesn't show up...:confused: <br />
<br />
Gonna work on it again tonite when I'm not trying to get a level, will let you know IF I make any progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xzoltar</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like the new look but to reason why I will still using the old t-king group windows. <br />
<br />
1. Stamina/breath/casting bar : not useful as a cleric ( O well not for me at least ) and Already have it in another windows... <br />
<br />
2. I dont seem to see the F2 m F3... button, this really make cleric job easier like this and dont make error, when you think the main tank his in slot F4 when he his in F2 oups, CH Incomming on Enchanter.... You know what I mean...<br />
<br />
But nice work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xol: /agree  F key Notations are the absolute MOST important thing to a healer GW. (Mine are font size 5 on the horizontal mod.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Caleal:<br />
 am at work, so cant test....erg....<br />
<br />
Think this may be it, cuz XML is really weird about placement of tags and this may be in an area it should not be...<br />
---------------------------------<br />
- &lt;GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
  &lt;Fill&gt;GW_TKTubeFill&lt;/Fill&gt; <br />
  &lt;/GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
  &lt;TextOffsetX&gt;-100&lt;/TextOffsetX&gt; <br />
  &lt;/Gauge&gt;<br />
---------------------------------<br />
1)  I dont see a Background Definition &lt;Background&gt;&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
2)  &lt;textoffsetx&gt; is in the template definition. I think it should not be cuz of XML's quirkiness.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here also is a preview of the horiz mod I will be using based on your initial work (if we can get the pets to show up :)  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cytogene</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to use Fkeys for targeting.  after time u just know what member is what Fkey. if you hav to look to see u may not make it.  i use my mouse to traget now from the group window. hot keys to cast. the big bubbles give me a larger target to click on and i can target someone else mid-cast for the next heal. don't use the party window to target if you hav LAG issues. i'v been using this for a lil while now. the red flasher after death really helps rub salt in the wound..lol i enjoy the mod.<br />
<br />
P.S. sometimes pets show and sometimes they don't. it's a beta i'm sure it will get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xzoltar</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personnally only use my mouse for tradeskill, selling , buying and equiping myself. <br />
<br />
Others times I only use hot-keys. Sometime you reform the group and  its hard to remember the place where F1 to F6 his. Sure I can play without them, but this make my life so much easier, I prefer aving them at sight. <br />
<br />
All people are different, I prefer not telling in message window what spell im casting, by usally people like read ---( COMPLETE HEALING COMMING ON %T )--- I only use it if a Paladin his in our group, otherwise my group know that IM the cleric I decide if they will live or not ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-24-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, so I've got the horizontal mod working and I use it, and I can't find any PET GROUPS to find out if the fixes Ive tried are even working, so...posting this for someone to give it a test and see if the pet bars are online or still hosed.<br />
<br />
Please. PM me and post here if you have questions/ideas, cuz I'd love to see both the original and the horiz mod get used for pet groups too.<br />
<br />
...do you think if we get the rumor going that there will be 10 spell mem gems on Leg of Yk, that sony will have to make the mod just to keep us happy?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Cal:  One of the things that led to it working was changing the GW_PetGuage# tags...The array must start at zero<br />
<br />
Reset the PetGuage from 0 - 5 and see if this works it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TraleighRoV</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOVE the look of this , personally as a cleric i dont use F keys- never have, but i have to agree on making the bottom bars exp/aaxp sta i never look at and as far as breath i think most peeps have EB items now ;p</div></div><hr />

That was it, thanks. Anoying sometimes the little things.<br />
<br />
I got it fixed so the pet lifebars show, and did some other changes/additions to it. I also changed the breath and stamina bars into exp and AA bars.<br />
I personally abandoned this for my personal use because I could not get it to fit where I want it in my UI. I generally abandoned the tking graphics overhaul of my UI altogether. I found all the fancy graphics to distracting, and was getting headachs. *shrug*<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll keep working on this and some other mods for individual windows. I'm learning a lot from them, even though I have no intention of ever using them. :) <br />
<br />
***Updated the picture and download links at the top of the thread***<br />
<br />
I think I'll redo the bottom gauges a tad and throw in a stamina bar so it will be hybrid friendly, and make a melee version with the stamina bar where the mana bar is now. I havn't decided if I'm going to put in lables for the F keys yet, it just seems like extra clutter that is not needed.</div></div><hr />

I agree that you do need to put the F# keys some where near the person but I dont think that is a good place for them, maybe next to their names like<br />

<br />
Changed the order the gauges are loaded to help with targeting group members pets. You have more than a 1 pixle wide area to click on now. =)<br />
