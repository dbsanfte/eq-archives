<br />
<br />
sorry no, that is a server side graphic..nothing controlled by the UI effects that.<br />
<br />
The only option you can try is when you first start EQ go into OPTIONS (instead of Login) and turn off &quot;Elements and horses&quot; <br />
<br />
see if that reverts them back..<br />
<br />
doubt it though<br />
<br />
sorry...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're looking for a Velious-like interface, I'm personally biased toward my mix and match UI, appropriately labeled &quot;Velious2&quot; (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2824)<br />
<br />
It's not identical to the Velious interface by any means, but works great for low resolutions (I run in 1024x768 and can't run higher resolutions without REALLY small text - monitor isn't big enough). I've used this UI since the UI was customizable, so it's undergone many updates and changes through the months. It's also quite &quot;patch resistant&quot;. Feel free to check it out, though don't take my word for it, see it for yourself and make your own conclusions.<br />
<br />
I know there's other Velious-like interfaces out there, just have to search for &quot;old school&quot; or even &quot;velious&quot; and should be able to find something you like.</div></div><hr />
