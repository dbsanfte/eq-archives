I really like this one, the player window, the best, so I put it up for download.  It has a transparent background, and the art is done by t.king and then slightly modified.  It has no pet bar because I use remelio's pet mod, which has pet HP there. It also has no AA XP because I am not to that level yet.  That would be easy to code in though.  XP is shown as a percent because I don't think a bar is necessary. <br />

Guages left to right:HP, mana, fatigue<br />
Numbers left to right: HP, XP, mana</div></div><hr />

I am repeatedly amazed by folks with artistic ability... I can do the XML (well, more or less :p) but the graphics I've seen over the last few weeks... simply amazing!</div></div><hr />

I am seeing pieces of it floating about in mods other than his own.  I am not too clear on how much of his work he likes floating about but I assume people ask permission first before modding.<br />

the piece above is from this piece of work : http://home.attbi.com/~tomjking/tkingward.jpg</div></div><hr />

Neat to compare and see what Pasha did to mod it, too!</div></div><hr />

Just an idea.. I play a rogue and like this only I have no need for a mana bar at all heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">most likely.  I would be hestitant to touch another person's artwork though.  Kinda like handling another persons.... ahh.. truck, yeah :)  <br />
<br />
T.King has a full mod coming out eventually</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that isn't a piece that was originally made for EQ, nor was it posted in the &quot;supporter's&quot; forum.  Instead, if you go to his thread on the main forum, he has a link to his personal artwork page.  It can be found there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pasha_V</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it is artwork from his main page. I am not in on the insider stuff anyway, anbd if I was I would not steal anything and post it here ). I asked permission to use the graphic and turned it into that. I could make a rogue mod too, if you want.</div></div><hr />

Ripping consisted of stealing another person's artwork or copying another person's artwork without their permission.<br />
<br />
I think it would highly advisable to contact Mr. King and ask him if it's alright if you rip his artwork. <br />
<br />
Think of it like the &quot;truck&quot; example... someone steals your truck... then they haul some wood around in your truck... then they ask you if they borrow your truck to haul some wood.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this will help you gain some perspective.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiradok</div><div class="date">10-03-2002, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried this thing today, and I gotta say, amazing.  It fits right in with all the other t.king stuff I use (which is just about everything he's created).  I just had one idea. How hard would it be to combine this mod with one of the flashing target mods, so that there isn't this big floating red border around the graphic?  I think that would make it look just that much better.</div></div><hr />

I'll also make the mana the right font and a deeper blue color to make it easy to see. And again, I received permission from t.king to use his work! I admire his work very much and would do nothing without asking.</div></div><hr />

Stole the words right outa my mouf. heh. Super nice job - I use it presently. But that big red auto-attack ring (its really a huge box) around the entire thing is annoying... anyway to turn the feature off or get it to wrap around the thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where can this gauge be found.  I like the look of it a great deal and would love to have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pasha_V</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mod is in the player window downloads area.  I'll be uploading the mod to get rid of the auto attack flash today....the catch is that it will overwrite your target bar.  If you have a custom target bar and don't know how to get it to work with this you can send me your target XML (veovis39@hotmail.com) and I'll mail it back.  I'll post the code needed for the AA XP number as well. Can't do either right now as I'm not at home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pasha_V</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ignore the above post....there are too many variations for me to post them all in the downloads section. If you have a request, send me an email (veovis39@hotmail.com) and I'll send you the mod you want.</div></div><hr />
