<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard to say .. Actually there 'Might' be a way, if you turn off wrapping.<br />
<br />
Then again, VI could have hard coded that to be that way, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Irras</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I noticed that the name can be removed, how is that done?<br />
I'd like to keep the name up there, but the player info box takes up too much vertical space with the surname below</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Removing the Surname requires hiding it. In reality your HP par has a &quot;built in&quot; lable tag. That's the name your see in the Player Info window.<br />
<br />
To remove it, change the size of the HP bar to 108x8. *Edit* Oops, forgot. Also change the TextOffsetY to 30 or something greater than 9.<br />
<br />
Now, to Put your name back in. This requires creating a new Lable of EQType 1. Create that and just place it back up top there. X,Y cords will be 3,0.<br />
<br />
I forget the size though. To test that, keep out the EQType tag and it will place Player123456 in there. Size it until it works for you, then put back in EQType. :)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps ...<br />
<br />
*Quick Epic .. see above*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">quite simply, you need to add this to your PlayerWindow file:<br />

	&lt;Label item=&quot;GP_Name&quot;&gt;<br />

You can Change the Item and ScreenID value to what ever you want. I just copied it from my mod and I use GP_ as a self identifier of my custom additions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Irras</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just tried that out and it didn't work out very well... the last name appeared over  the first name, and the HP bar disappeared altogether.  If anyone has a Playerwindow like this, or can make one, please post it.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to do is keep the window around this vertical height.<br />
<br />
- &lt;Screen item=&quot;PlayerWindow&quot;&gt;<br />
- &lt;!-- &lt;ScreenID/&gt;<br />
  --&gt; <br />
  &lt;RelativePosition&gt;false&lt;/RelativePosition&gt; <br />

  &lt;CX&gt;140&lt;/CX&gt; <br />
  &lt;CY&gt;75&lt;/CY&gt; <br />
  &lt;/Size&gt;<br />

I think that's the info you would need.   Even moving the bars closer together could help.:nana:<br />
This is what I would like it to look like.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried but couldnt either. Now that I am making a new ui this would help tremendously to fit things better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the PlayerWindow Screen is completely relevent with this mod.<br />
<br />
What you want is the Player_HP gauge.<br />
<br />
And that window has a bit more than just a Name change in it.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the tags in the Player_HP gauge. They are all completely self explanitory. Maybe there's an OffsetY or X for the gauge as well I forgot about. <br />
<br />
It's been a while since I made this mod. Take a look, it's not that hard to figure out. Just a lot of text, but like reading HTML.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Irras</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to know all this stuff, but it's been so long I forget everything... I actually had to post on how to get my signature picture.  I look at an XML file and not all of it is self explainatory. Like Relative Position.... No idea what that is. And the offsets that you mentioned...lost there too...I guess I'll just keep checking the sites to see if anyone else makes it.  :D :nana: :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Offset is just that .. an Offset from the original position given ( &lt;Location&gt; ).<br />
<br />
Relative - Relative to the Window you're in. Turn it off and reload your skin. And take a look. Then you'll see what that means.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you ever wonder what an element is for, change it, reload the skin and look. Nothing more. Some are easy, some requires tinking a bit.<br />
<br />
trust me ... I've just spent 3+ hours tinking with the freeking borders in EQ. It's a long pain processes ...<br />
Good thing I don't have EQ to distract me ( this system can't play EQ, only load it enough to play with UI. :) ).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daneel</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying to put my full name on a single line in the player window since the UI was released. I'm sure its not a modification of the Player_HP gauge but I could be wrong. As Irras' attachment shows above, it appears to be possible.<br />
<br />
I've seen numerous mods that have the player first name on a line without the surname at all. Although I can copy and paste code that does that for me, I still don't understand how it works. I think the first name is attached the Player_HPNumber (EQType 17).<br />
<br />
Please post any other ideas you have for this. It's driving me nuts right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mafoo</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have some ideas!<br />
let me see what i can do!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The player's Name and Surname are attached to the Player's HP Gauge.<br />
<br />
How the developers, like myself, removed the first name is by 'hiding' the Name/Surname that's attacked to the HP Gauge.<br />
<br />
Then we added a whole new Label of EQType 1 into the Player window.  EQType 1 = Name ( nothing more ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mafoo</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I belive you are looking for something like this<br />
http://www.mafoo.org/host/UI/irras.jpg<br />
took me about 20 mins, and some thinking :o)<br />
for the technical explination<br />
first name is stemed off eqlabel 1 and formated right (to make the neat alignment)<br />
surname is is a gauge with text offsety set to -15 and gauge offesty set to -1000 (to rid the gauge) and sized to hight 14 (so you only get the name apearing!<br />
<br />
note: this is a fully working mod, not just a picture, so down load th ezip and try it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something I have seen done for ones that might want Full name across single area. Put name in Border where like a mod I have seen would have said Advanced Targeting - Just change and put whatever you like there :)<br />
<br />
Then all you would need to do is put like the old -250 trick to get rid of name above bars.<br />
<br />
If space is what you want this may work also - I like Mafoo's last post also :)<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:  Maybe :(  Maybe Not <br />
<br />
Mostly preference if really wanted above bars and such ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guhldan</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could always &quot;hard-code&quot; it too.  Add a text label of your full name and position it wherever you want.  Of course, this means your alts will also see your name instead of theirs and would require one mod per alt.  This doesn't bother me since I intend to make a mod per alt that I play.  My monk doesn't need a casting bar, mana, etc., for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Irras</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man that's perfect!  Thank you!  I knew there had to have been a way. I wish I knew more about this stuff so I could do it, but I'm still learning.  BTW, the pic that I posted was just something I made in Adobe Photoshop, it's not real, just an example, but yeah, This mod looks great, now to try it out :D :nana: :D</div></div><hr />
