<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aprilbeapril</div><div class="date">03-24-2003, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sort of two problems. <br />
<br />
1.  I downloaded Nightelf 2, from http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1710.  I cannot find a UI_Jethal_20.ini file, or any .ini file, in the zip.  Is this something I could get from elsewhere?<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  I then tried Nightelf_loy, from http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1678.  I did find the UI_Name_##.ini file (wheeee progress).  I renamed it appropriately (UI_Xtiky_31.ini in my case).  I have tried both /loadskin Nightelf true and /loadskin Nightelf.  It seems to load the skin fine, however it doesn't line up the windows for me.<br />
<br />
... now I'm lost.<br />
<br />
PS, I tried to read the forums but all I could find was &quot;read the FAQ&quot; in reference to this sort of problem.  I'd like to suggest a &quot;my windows don't line up automatically&quot; FAQ be added in the stickies--it might be covered there but I must be too new to this to recognize it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">03-24-2003, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">depending on what order you did the /loadskin, your ini file may have been changed. Try copying the ini file again (with the appropriate corrections for char name and server number of course) then in game use /loadskin  &lt;ui name&gt;<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
p.s.    Jethal operates EQRangers.com, so if you do not get a response on this board, may want to send him a PM there or post there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jethal</div><div class="date">03-24-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">reply's are correct here<br />
if you /loadskin nightelf  you'll wipe out the preset window positions.. copy the UI_Name_## to your EQ directory and rename it.. then /loadskin  select the nightelf from the list and make sure to use the &quot;Use INI&quot; option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhaelethV</div><div class="date">03-25-2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe what April meant was that there is no UI_Jethal_20.ini file in the nightelf2.zip file anywhere, so she can't rename it.<br />
<br />
I had the same problem, I downloaded the skin but there's no character file in the zip anywhere so we have no way to set the windows up properly.<br />
<br />
Any chance of you posting that file for us Jethal?  The skin looks awesome and it would be really nice if we could use it.  =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aprilbeapril</div><div class="date">03-25-2003, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">#2. I got working.  Just blatant stupidity on my part.  I must have loaded the skin without using the ini the first time.<br />
<br />
#1. the file was just missing in action.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help, everyone, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DvlHlx</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, for some reason, I can't seem to download the zip file with the INI included, every time I put in my password, it tells me to enter my username and password again, if anyone could post up a copy of the INI to DL would greatly appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That’s because the link is dead, the interface is out of date so it was removed. You need to find the updated version in our downloads database ;) I believe there are now two different versions of this in our complete sets area that should be easy to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DvlHlx</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Downloaded the updated version, also PM'ed Jethal, problem is, the new version doesn't include the ini file :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well hopefuly Jethal will see your PM or post here in a couple days and post an update to his interface with the ini file :)</div></div><hr />
