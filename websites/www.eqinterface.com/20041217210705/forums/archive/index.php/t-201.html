<br />
A few nbrs i have found to work<br />
<br />
Buff icon size 30 <br />
<br />
The nbr behind the buff icon font 4<br />
<br />

<br />
On a side note, is it just me or is anyone else noticing more occurences of the old &quot;zone at low health and lose all your buffs&quot; since the new UI has allowed this changeto the buff box?</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 teeny things I'd change.  1 is, I really liked the numbers from the other's guys.  I think it looked really cool.  The other is, I had 15 buffs tonight and the 15th kind of wrapped around to the top.  I think the box needs to be a wee bit bigger to accomodate all 15.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Proetus</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what resolution are you running?  I can get 15 buffs and still have a tad of room at the bottom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzim</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this has been asked before by others, but has anyone been able to create this buff window in a horizontal format with the Buff Labels possibly below the Icon?  I have done a search in this forum and others in the EQ community and have not been able to find a UI mod with the Buff Icons horizontal with the label included.  If anyone can assist me in locating something like this I would be very grateful.<br />
