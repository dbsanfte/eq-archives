<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dunkz</div><div class="date">08-31-2002, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw an example somewhere where a person had put most of the UI elements other than Buff Box into one large window.  I'm trying to do something like that but I'm finding that certain UI elements don't behave the same in windows other than their own.<br />
<br />
An example is the invite button.  When I put one into a different window it's always enabled and does nothing.   Perhaps I'm missing the way that this button is bound to windows.<br />
<br />
In any event, is what I'm doing possible or was I viewing some visual trickery?  I'd like to have one seemless window with all the UI controls in them on the right side of my screen</div></div><hr />

I would hope they do this as it is a much needed thing!</div></div><hr />
