Let me clarify. All my files will still be on Eqinterface.com. There is nothing that is on my personal site at  www.shakahr.com that isnt here. Although, since there are those peeps who need help still on mods they wish to tweak to their own liking, I feel it was best to setup a General forum and a Supporters forum since time is a factor, and most of which these mods I will never use. On a side note, mods that have been in beta, ideas, and unreleased UI's, and of the sort will be part of the Supporters Area to test, use, etc. Once it passes that stage, soon after, I will be releasing those to the public.<br />
<br />
As the UI's become &quot;solid&quot;, they will be updated to EQinterface as to not create problems to those whom may find errors and do not know what to do if downloaded from another place.<br />
<br />
All UI's, thus far, have been fully tested and pose no problems to date.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dinian</div><div class="date">03-16-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice group/player/target window design on the newest UI Drakah, I'm going to play around with this tonight :)<br />
<br />
I like the layout of the group/player windows but I must say I find the new hotkey setup to be a little too much of a change!<br />
<br />
I liked your old inventory-bag hotkey layout so I'm going to throw together something with the old design, and see if I can apply the chat border to it somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">03-16-2003, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh tis why I call it &quot;minimized&quot; :)<br />
I, personally, never used the &quot;bag inventory&quot; sections in the hotkey area, was just as easy as opening/closing the inventory window. Space is more important to me atm, having the bags was just a novelty at first, but then just got in the way. /shrug <br />
<br />
Curious to see how ya do though :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dinian</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I made the modifications today and here is the result.<br />
<br />
I actually feel the same way as you now that I think about it. I rarely if ever use those bags... I tend to hit inventory and bring it up. Note I also re-used your old window pieces #3 file because I didn't like your new buttons.<br />
<br />
I'm going to go remove the bags again but make the hotbuttons non-transparent and use the old style look.<br />
<br />
BTW, I used this today in a raid and I *loved* the way the group/player/target system worked and the layout of the new target window as a quick click window was everything I ever wanted. Thanks for this sweet work.<br />
<br />
I wonder... how hard would it be to put the guages as found in the windows pieces #1 file back into your new target/group windows... maybe it is just because I'm not used to them, but I think I liked the old gauges better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just noticed something...and I never bothered to check either.<br />
<br />
In your screenshot, your &quot;Power&quot; (mana) area is blank. I could had sworn I fixed that to show &quot;Breathe&quot; if Mana is non-existant.<br />
<br />
Did you remove the gauge or did I totally forget to put that back in? lol. If not Ill reupload the tweak.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not a bug, just missed implementing the breathe bar. I will work on it and re-upload a newer version for that.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I can make it so the word &quot;pow&quot; gets replaced with &quot;air&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katchin</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just starting using this UI, v nice until I went to windowed mode, cant get out of it again. I'm not using eqw so help file doesnt cure it. screen goes black when I hit alt+enter, have to hit it again to get picture back, my highest resolution is 1280x1024.<br />
<br />
Any solutions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dinian</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Drakah, art request here.<br />
<br />
Could you make the target window (really the player window but let's call it target for now) a bit taller?<br />
<br />
Reason for taller is I liked how your DAOC target window had a special little groove where the in-place casting bar (awesome addition to any target window IMO) would pop up. It would be really neat if your new target window had the same thing. If you look around, most caster centric mods have this feature. It is useful both for nuke timing and for clerical spell timing.<br />
<br />
At least it has been useful to me ;)<br />
<br />
Again, I know this is your mod; I'm just shooting you some of my requests and seeing where your creativity takes it.<br />
<br />
Nine times out of ten, your creations are way better than anything I could throw together :)<br />
<br />
Also, having an &quot;air&quot; meter instead of &quot;pow&quot; would be really cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katchin</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also, is it possible to increase chatfont size in smaller window? <br />
Yes, i am a noob, first ever UI..... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dinian</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the easiest way to change font size:<br />
<br />
On any chat window, right click the chat area and select &quot;Always chat in this window.&quot; Don't worry this is temporary and you can always make the main chat window the &quot;Always chat in this window&quot; later.<br />
<br />
Then type /chatfontsize n<br />
<br />
Where n is a number (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hotbutton window<br />
------------------------<br />
Took the old hotbutton window and moved things around, and removed the bottom row of bags. <br />
<br />
I bordered it but excluded the title bar. <br />
<br />
I also resized the hotbutton window to be exactly as wide as the group window and exactly as tall as the quick click window.<br />
<br />
Target window<br />
------------------------<br />
Moved the gauge around a little, made the text larger.<br />
<br />
Added a casting bar under the target HP gauge.<br />

I'm still tweaking this window around.</div></div><hr />

YES AGAIN lol (ugg)<br />
<br />
o - Pets were not being shown in the Group Window (Player and Group) - Fixed<br />
o - MP3 player had a bad graphic on it somehow - Fixed<br />
o - Misc Graphic Tweaks<br />
o - Old files from leftover mods were somehow left in the zip - Removed and Fixed.<br />

--To lessen any problem of future releases, I would strongly suggest you delete your folder, and re-download. Otherwise, you will need to redownload it and Overwrite any existing XML/TGA. But you may miss files that are not needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I couldnt image it without a border, would look unfinished...also the ChatWindow uses the border as part of the XML, no choice in that one.</div></div><hr />

&lt;rips hair out&gt;<br />
<br />
o - HP bars looked like it was in-half due to the pet-bars. Pets and Player now get along in the Player information area as well as in the Group window.<br />
<br />
I think we covered all the angles.<br />

<br />
The question is... is the Min set a collection of separates usable on 1024x786 or is it limited to 1280x1024 as the other full UI's were?<br />
<br />
I use Mixed on one PC.. but on my second PC and laptop, I have always been unable to use your UI's due to resolution requirements.<br />
<br />
Min set is downloaded and ready to install ... just hope I can!<br />

Thanks again for your great effort in making the best UI mod collection out there.<br />

It seemed to load all the art and everything, but all my boxes are scrambled all over the screen, it does not look like the picture.  Did I do something wrong?  Go easy on me here, it is my first time messing with this stuff.  I read your UI help and thought maybe it had something to do with an INI file?  But one was not included with this mod.  If anyone can point me in the right direction here it would be greatly apprieciated.  Out of all the mods I looked at Drakah's seem to look the best. please help the n00b :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Drakahtkingmin, is a Window Separate type of mod. Which means you do not need an INI file for it, move it around wherever, or incorporate them within other mods you currently use. All in all, you place the windows wherever you personally want. :)<br />
<br />
You can make it look like the picture on your own, that was just an example of how you can do it.</div></div><hr />

But the reason why you may of had an error is because the Target Window is really the &quot;EQUI_Playerwindow.xml&quot; -- this way it has the red flashing border around it instead of the normal player window mod.<br />

    Hi there.  First of all, I want to say how much I love your UIs.  I haven't come across any that suit my desires as much as yours do. <br />
<br />
    :confused:   I am, however, having a slight problem.  I downloaded the latest version of Drakahmain and the pet window will not go to the correct place under the group window (bottom center).  It's stuck on the right side and I can't get it to move (even tho it's not locked).  Can I get some help w/ that?  I'm using Drakahmix right now, which I also love, but I just love the ability to toggle between pet window/stats/clickies.  Also I noticed the big globe casting window is gone and replaced by just a little line.  It's still in Drakahmix, so if I wanted to copy the file over to Drakahmain what file would that be?<br />

You gotta use the supplied ini file in Drakah's zip file.. read the SoesUI 1.6 thread for detailed instructions on how to use ini files.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did that.  I took no different steps than I did w/ his older versions and they still loaded up just fine, windows in place and everything.  There is one step I have done slightly differently, but the UIs STILL loaded up properly.  Instead of renaming drakah's file to my own char/server I would just open it up, copy everything that's in it and then open up my ini file, copy it over what's in mine (matter of fact, first I delete everything that's in my ini completely then paste) and then load up eq and it works just fine.  Just not w/ this version.  I'll try it the other way and see if that helps.  Tho I'm trying to understand what the difference would make.<br />
<br />
Still wondering about the casting globe btw.</div></div><hr />

Using Drakahtking with the latest patch<br />
<br />
only difference i saw was when i renamed and copied the UI_drakah_## file, in the eq directory instead of server numbers they now use the server name<br />

ie UI_Bruenoar_83 (i think it was 83) now became UI_Bruenoar_Xev<br />

These UI's have undergone alot of maintenance and time consuming hours to keep them current. However, I have taken the 4 UI's and created 1 Full type UI called &quot;Drakah Legacy Version&quot; for those who still use these types of Interfaces. This UI is the replacement for the 4 listed and will remain current throughout the patches. Feel free to use the Archived versions as pieces you most likely can interchange if you are so inclined, but please do not ask about them as they do not have support any longer. I am sure you understand that since I make these on my own time and own free will, that this is a most suitable solution for me and everyone else.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marrah</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two questions please ;<br />
<br />
1. As of this moment Drakah Legacy UI version 4.0 is good to go and compatable with the 11/5 patch?<br />
<br />
2. Also if I am using the older archived UIs (i.e., Drakah Tking) will they work with the 11/5 patch at all or not?  If not can I fix them myself to work or is it too difficult?  I do not know how to code xml btw.<br />
<br />
thanks for the help  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All's I will say is this since I typed all this before on the file description...<br />
<br />
1) Old Combined INI UI's will NOT work, will NOT have any support. They are gone, done, complete, caput, do not pass go, do not collect $200.<br />
<br />
2) The New Combined INI UI, named &quot;Drakah Legacy UI&quot; is now the replacement. And I did state in that file description &quot;Tested as on 11/4/03&quot;. So yes, it does work for 11/5/03.<br />
<br />
Again, you do NOT have to move ANY windows. If you cant, then there was a reason for it :)<br />
<br />
<br />
** Comon guys, this isnt brain surgery...use SEARCH, exhaust ALL places where I might had mentioned things of importanance. I do not want to ignore PM's but if it is a silly question for something already stated (file description, thread, etc) then I am going to have to choose to let someone else help you so I can continue on working some things out.<br />
<br />
I am not pointing fingers, please dont take this out of context, but I do get a ton of realllll winner questions that I keep pointing to the good ole cartoon on the main page :nana:</div></div><hr />

Also i was able to use the Sars vertical buff / bard song boxes,cant remember what i did to get it to work with drakah but i cant seem to do it with the new legacy, can anyone help out with these , any help appreciated :) (or if anyone can direct me to a vertical buff box with the little boxes behind em to keep track of how many buffs i have up that shows the spell gem graphic along with name of the buff next to it that works with the drakah legacy that would be great too) :)</div></div><hr />

Ok your ui w/ the no movement for boxes is great, like i said i love it, but I am one that likes to have it to where i can have more than two boxes because i am a healer with 4 and 5 boxes so forgive me if i am one of those people with the silly question but in order to fix it to where i can have 4 and 5 chat boxes i needed to move the personal box......... so what your saying is if it is meant not to be moved you then only made this for people with only 2 chat boxes?  or can someone else help me out to figure out how to move the personal info box.......... <br />
<br />
<br />
The chat boxes are only locked in-game. You can unlock them, move em around, etc. make new ones, etc. I was referring to the static windows such as the compass, player/group window, pet window, that sort of thing.</div></div><hr />
