<br />
Hey guys, I've been a long time reader of this forum, never posted yet until now.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone that knew XML very well could help me. Seeing as I don't know HTML, or XML to save my life, I'm asking here.<br />
<br />
I want to replace my Pet Window, to make it look like this.<br />
<br />
http://www.owensbri.addr.com/eq/wnd_spells.gif <br />
<br />
I know this is supposed to be the spell thing, but I'm a Rogue, and have no need for spells heh. I also know I don't have a pet either, but its the only menu|window thats not being used by me, that might work for this little change. If its possible to make this the pet window... but no visible buttons... that would be nice too. I'm just gonna put it up on my screen and place my compass in that little box for it.<br />
<br />
I like that screenshot (above)   and I wanted to put that into my upper-left corner of my screen, soo I can make my UI a little more even.<br />
<br />
This UI rocks by the way, props to the maker.<br />
<br />
Thanks to anyone that can help... <br />
<br />
Shoot me the files to my email address... XBeebziertX@Hotmail.com<br />
<br />
EDIT: You could also send me a message on AOL Instant Messager, my screen name is &quot;Beebziert&quot;<br />
<br />
Or whatever I need to do<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
