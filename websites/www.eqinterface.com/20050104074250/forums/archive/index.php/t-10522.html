<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fazzarya</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My UI runs just fine on one computer but on the other (exact same UI) whenever I cast a spell the screen lags like crazy while the spell cast bar runs down. If I am not casting the UI works awesome, no lag or anything. Any clue what would cause this?<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

It has several things that will get you an answer quickly..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fazzarya</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.<br />
<br />
1: It was originally titled &quot;Transparent&quot; but was never updated so I believe it was removed from this website. I pieced in a different spellbook, spellgems, casting bar and inventory window.<br />
<br />
2: I know you probably get this a lot but I guarantee the mod is installed right. I do know that much. :p<br />
<br />
3: I didn't include the uierrors file because I just had the UI fixed for my other account and it was given a seal of approval. I included it this time for your perusal however.<br />
<br />
4: As I said it works fine till I cast a spell, then it bogs down horribly. If it helps at all I was using a UI that worked great, casting or not casting, but had no LDON adenture interface window. When I changed the UI to one that supported LDON, I got the spell lag problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks again. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fazzarya</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So do I just cut and paste that in somewhere? Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look in your custom folder and see if you have the file. If you dont see it look in the zip you downloaded and see if its in there... if it is then copy it to your interface folder... if you dont you need to find it... if you cant find it you need to pick a different casting bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lewzephyr</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is rather peculiar.   I had to rebuild my machine due to power supply crash (and I figured what the heck, since I was in there... might as well rebuild the OS).<br />
<br />
Ok I did a complete backup of my EQ directory, so nothing has changed there.<br />
I installed Window 2k and all the recent drivers for my gforce card.<br />
(this is the exact version I was using before rebuild).  But now, when playing EQ, and casting spells or opening any new window (i.e. Map, inventory, containers) i get a freeze in frames.  I dont get any more lag than I used ot in the past from just moving around etc.  But again when opening &quot;ANY&quot; new window, I get a halt.  Also when closing multiple containers via ESC... I get a seperat sound for each container opened... where in the past I would hit esc, and all windows would close at once with one singel grand sound for all the containers.<br />
<br />
Very odd, I am sure its something with the layering of drivers with Direct X but ill have to look into that when I get a little more time.   If anyone had similar occurances, and had a fix, Id be happy to hear of them.</div></div><hr />
