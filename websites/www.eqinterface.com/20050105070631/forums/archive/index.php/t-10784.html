Obviously there is a starting location in the file, but I have no idea where (Well... I do have an idea, but I have no way to verify where they should be).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Want to be sure of what you're asking...<br />
<br />
When you set up BST UI for a new character, the windows aren't where you want them, but if you manually move them in game to where you do want them, then they stay there even after you log and come back in, correct??<br />
<br />
But, what you want is for the windows to start off in the correct location everytime you start off another character with the interface?? <br />
<br />
If that's the case, let me know... otherwise, could you please clarify your question?? I may be able to help you out with this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomko44</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes... once you move the windows once they will happily stay put, but if you start a new character you have to initially move the windows. I assume that the Location for the Window Draw is where it will start off before you move them. Not sure what the actual screen coodinates are and if they are resolution dependant.<br />
<br />
I would like to change the starting coordinates so when people load up the UI it works properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You would need to include a UI_Charname.ini file with the UI to do this.<br />
<br />
In each UI window you specify where to draw the window, but it's never seemed to work too well to me.  It might jsut be offscreen items, but I've only been able to windows into the right general area.  specifying it in the ini file will actually work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomko44</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then why is there a &lt;location&gt; tag with x,y coordinates in the Screen section. To me, that must be telling the server where the starting point for that window is. For example, the code in my PetInfoWindow has the following code:<br />
&lt;Screen item = &quot;PetInfoWindow&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;!--&lt;ScreenID/&gt;--&gt;<br />
		&lt;Text&gt;Songs/Pet&lt;/Text&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;false&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;415&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;395&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;184&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;122&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
<br />
I assume that this code says that the Window should start off in position 415,395 of the player's UI and that the Window should start off as 184x122. If I am wrong, then what does the location tag do in the Screen Item?</div></div><hr />
