So maybe somebody could grab the maps off of eqatlas or somthing, throw them in a windows and have /loc running the background - then a lil dot on the map to tell you were you are.  I dont know if it can be done, but it would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It can't be done because they don't give you enough control over the interface to put in a movable icon.  Plus, nobody's using my maps in a mod except me. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kett00</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EqAtlas is yours?  Nice Site bro, good work!<br />
<br />
It sucks it cant be done.  Even if there were no movable icons, I would be nice to have the maps there, better then pulling out the stack of hundreds of maps:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothan</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only way it could be done:<br />
<br />
Write an application that monitors your log file for /notes and /loc.<br />
<br />
Make tons of hot keys that when you click them it does something like /notes mapchange:scarletdesert<br />
<br />
When the application sees the mapchange command it modifies the xml file or tga file (not sure how the maps are accessed in the mods that are out there now) for whatever window you've decided to put  your maps in.<br />
<br />
The application could use the /loc and some freeware scripted image editing software (like ImageMagik) to draw a dot on the image of the map.<br />
<br />
Then do a /loadskin myskin 1<br />
<br />
So..it's doable...sucks to high heaven but CAN be done.   I think the drawing of the dot is the hardest part.  The changing of the map is easy.  It just sucks you have to reload the entire UI and can't just reload one selected window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly, you can't do it from within the game itself, you'd need some outside app to do it.  And then you'd have to reload the GUI every time the loc icon changed position which, on a machine like mine, really wouldn't be worth it.  Also, you'd have to set up the maps on a uniform grid system so that they machine knew where to put the loc icon, which also would be extremely hard given the radically different scales of most maps.<br />
<br />
I guess it can be done, just a major pain in the butt to do it.:p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reflection</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could still do an ingame map.  It would not keep track of your current location, but the pictures could still be used.  This is how I Imagine it being done.  <br />
<br />
Take a window (Like the pet window, or the inventory window) and replace it's contents with a tab sheet.  Say 5 or so tabs on the top (1 for each continent, plus the moon) Then inside each tab add a new tab for each map for that area.  Then on each tab add an image of the map.<br />
<br />
Now remember this would lead to alot of tabs, since there are alot of maps.    But it's the only way I know of that doesn't involve using some external program to get maps, or checks you position. <br />
<br />
You could decrease the number of tabs, by only using the maps you plan on using when you play.   Basically you set like 10 images that would be used for maps (say 'map01' to 'map10' then copy the desired maps before loading.</div></div><hr />
