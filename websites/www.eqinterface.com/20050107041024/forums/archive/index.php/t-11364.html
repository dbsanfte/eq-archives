----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Absor: Welcome to the chat. <br />
<br />
Absor: Thank you for coming. We'll be taking questions about the upcoming enhancement to melee classes. If you haven't read the outline for those changes, please visit EverQuestlive.com Dev's Corner (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=59510) to read up on the proposed changes. Ask us anything you'd like about the new system or melee in general. If we don't have time to answer them all here, we'll be recording them <br />
<br />
Paul Carrico: Evening everyone. I am Paul Carrico, Assistant Lead Game Designer on EverQuest. Or as others have known me, Frizznik the Gnome. <br />
<br />
Todd Schmidt: Hello, I am Todd Schmidt, Assistant Lead Programmer on EverQuest. I am known has Hobart on Test Server. <br />
<br />
John Troy: Hey, I'm John Troy, Game Designer on EverQuest <br />
<br />
Oliver Smith: Hello everyone. I'm Oliver J. Smith, the Lead Designer of EverQuest Live &amp; Expansions. Others may remember me as Valtron. <br />
<br />
Jamey Ryan: Hey, I am Jamey Ryan, Lead Programmer on EverQuest. <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: Hi, I'm Ryan Barker game Designer for EQ, sometimes known as Rytan. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Wilhelm_Lany* Hi. I have a three-fold of questions. 1) Can we expect any changes in terms of agro on demand; instant agro generation, without waiting for an opening.? 2) how will increasing the endurance bar work, in terms of getting higher endurance, and endurance regen? 3) how will accessing these new skills once the opening is available work? <br />
<br />
John Troy: 1) Yes, the system we're getting allows us to create abilities that aren't tied to openings. We will be giving warriors more options for aggro generation <br />
<br />
John Troy: 2) The endurance bar is based on your melee stats and level. Regen is currently based on your level <br />
<br />
John Troy: 3) There will be an extra UI window to put hotkeys for the new skills, which will be accessible with keyboard shortcuts <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: we're still tuning specific values so we don't have actual numbers set in stone yet for endurance costs and regen. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Galidin* How do you intend to maintain the desirability of knights in your new melee system when they already produce far less damage then pure melee, while you fix core issues such as taunt which have been the strong suit of knights? <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: There's several aspects of the melee revamp, one aspect of which is the new opening system. There's plans on addressing other specific problems with melee in addition to the new system. <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: The goal is to create a balance where knights and warriors both have equal desirability in different situations. <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: We're really excited about all the new changes we're making and we're anxious to get them out on test where we can tune them and see them in action. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Coronis* When are you anticipating these changes going live on regular servers? <br />
<br />
Oliver Smith: Our changes are expected to go live during the December 16th update that'll be happening next month. We also plan on introducing them to the Test Server very soon. Feel free to log on the Test Server and use /feedback to tell us what you think about our changes. We'd be happy to hear everyone's thoughts on the systems that are being created. <br />
<br />
Absor: *CeNo65-FOH* How will acumen, zing and others spells with similar effects, pertain to the new changes? <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: We're removing the old invigor type effects that restored stamina entirely for now. It's possible we'll be adding endurance regen abilities later on but for now we don't want melee to be any more dependant on getting buffs to make use of the new system. <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: We decided to do that because it's really an entirely new system, and has very little to do with how the old stamina bar worked. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Hamen* Will these Melee changes effect everyone from level the first level on? <br />
<br />
Paul Carrico: You will be able to take advantage of the new melee opening system when you begin receiving new combat abilities at level 20. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Illydth* As far as openings go, will any class be able to create an opening for themselves or are openings only created by certain classes? <br />
<br />
John Troy: You will be able to take advantage of openings that you create. Some openings will work for everyone, but there's no link between your opening and someone else's. There are no combinations or dependencies on other players. <br />
<br />
Absor: *ScootD* How can you acquire the new melee abilities? <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: The new abilities will be acquired by taking a &quot;skill tome&quot; to your guild master and he'll teach you the skill. Most of the basic skills will be available on vendors, while a few high level ones will be drops. Right now we're planning on giving almost all of the sub 60 skills on merchants and having the 60+ skills using a system similar to the parchments quests in Planes of Power. From there on out we'll most likely make use of the same methods that you already use to acquire any other type of item. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Lendaor* are many openings going to be based on mob placement? Such as from behind the mob as opposed to being in front? <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: None of the abilities currently take advantage of your position relative to the mob, so no you won't have to be behind or in front of the mob in order to take advantage of the new abilities. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Badu* Will pure melee have their current DPS lowered to take into account the extra dps from this system? <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: No, there will be no decrease in melee's DPS to account for the increase from the new system. We're creating the system in such a way that they'll fit in right on top of the old one. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Subayai* Will disciplines be overhauled are or you simply transferring them over to this endurance system? Most melees only use 1 or 2 disciplines, because the others serve no useful purpose in their current state. <br />
<br />
John Troy: We'll be making changes to some of the disciplines that aren't very useful, as well as giving them different timers. You will still only be able to have one discipline going at a time <br />
<br />
Absor: *Flaash* How long will the play have to take advantage of an opening, and how will excessive server side Lag (elemental planes) handle this? <br />
<br />
John Troy: We're still tuning it, but our goal is to make the strategy be in what skill you decide is best to use at the time, not in fast-reaction or twitch gameplay <br />
<br />
Absor: *Sabrosia* HOW will these openings be presented? For instance, will a new window open - and we click a button - will we have to issue a command? <br />
<br />
Todd Schmidt: There will be a UI indicator that pops up when you can activate an opening. And yes, you will be clicking a button as opposed to typing in a command. Once you activate the opening, that same window will show the opening effect. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Dranix* will jumping to negotiate obstacles or people remove from my endurance pool for combat and disciplines?<br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: Jumping will drain a portion of your endurance yes, but it's a relatively minor amount. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Tenludar* How will skill points be handled for warriors that have already progressed in the game? Will a level 65 be expected to spend hours doing nothing but training to get their skills up?<br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: You won't need to use skill points in order to learn the new skills, they're either on or off, there's no period of bringing them up to full power so to speak. <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: The only thing you need to do is give the tome to the guild master and you'll have the full skill. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Drewon-FoH* Will there be any new AA skills that are tied to, or create, these new melee abilities? <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: There will AA abilities that will effect the new system yes. We don't have a hard and fast list for it yet though. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Barney* it was mentioned some openings are available after certain skills go off, like parry. What about classes who do not have certain abilities. Like monks for example who lack parry. <br />
<br />
John Troy: For monks, it's based on dodge, block, and riposte. We're tuning the rate that they happen based on the skills each class has. <br />
<br />
Todd Schmidt: In addition to these melee changes, we have made a few others separate from this. All warriors regardless of level will now mitigate a percentage of all incoming melee damage. Monk will also now be able to dodge when being hit from behind, this should aid their pulling abilities. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Voldeth-BB* How will the new system affect a melee's role? Clearly it will support the tanking of a warrior, but what of the monk? What will their role be? <br />
<br />
John Troy: The melee skills aren't limited to the dps or defense of the player that uses it. There are debuffs and group affects as well. The goal with the skill sets is to provide more of a role for the pure melee during combat <br />
<br />
Absor: *VALBARR* It has been stated by Ryan Barker that position won't affect the skills, but in the chat overview, it states that position can change the effectiveness of certain skills ? <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: The reference to the positional aspect in the doc on the website was an error. We're not going to have skills dependant on position. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Dakkon* how many moves are you planning to introduce? <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: We're planning on over 20 skills for each class to begin with and we'll be adding even more in the future. <br />
<br />
Absor: *KyrosKrane* I apologize if this was asked before; I missed the first half of the chat. Assuming an extended fight (e.g., Luclin bosses), how many openings per unit time could each player of an appropriate class expect? <br />
<br />
John Troy: We're still tuning it. We're looking at a few per fight, though. We're aiming for making each opening more important, not something that is making you hit an extra 20 keys a minute <br />
<br />
Absor: *Avelariel* Can we make absolutely clear, these openings are solely for warriors, rogues and monks? Unless that's not the case <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: Yes we're only adding the new opening system for warriors, rogues, and monks. The discipline system revamp will be for all classes that currently make use of disciplines though. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Woody_GU* How exactly does this re-establish balance? Why does this constitute a &quot;fix&quot;? And not a bandaid on top of a semi-broken existing system? <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: The new system is only one aspect of the melee revamp, there's several other changes in the works for them as well. <br />
<br />
Paul Carrico: You can quote Barker in the comics Woody. <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: One of the major advantages of the new system is allowing us to more easily add new abilities to the pure melee classes. <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: There's several aspects of the existing system that are going to be adjusted, I'd keep an eye on test server if you're interested in more specifics. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Arlos-LOS* If openings are tuned to block/dodge/riposte, what happens if we're not tanking? This would seem to be most applicable to monks &amp; rogues. How do we activate the new abilities if we're, say, fighting a raid mob and doing DPS?<br />
<br />
John Troy: There are other events that trigger openings based on your regular attacks. If you're in a situation where you aren't tanking, you'll get more of those kinds of openings. <br />
<br />
John Troy: You have a chance to trigger an opening on any attack or special attack <br />
<br />
John Troy: NPC's also have a chance to &quot;fumble,&quot; creating an opening that anyone fighting it can take advantage of <br />
<br />
Absor: *Layn* How will the new skills affect aggro if successfully used? <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: There's several new abilities planned that will effect aggro generation. Some might increase your aggro while others might lower it. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Adorae* just fix taunt? LOL <br />
<br />
John Troy: Saying that taunt is the one and only issue is fairly shortsighted, I think. Pure melee have very few strategic decisions to make, don't get new abilities with an expansion the way casters do, and don't get as much from an item with both hp and mana. These are all issues that people have raised, and this system gives us a way to address them. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Razorback* Will debuff disciplines stack, or will having more than one person using that make it a wasted use?<br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: It really depends on the debuff. Generally there will be enough different abilities you can take advantage of that you'll have several skills that will be useful even if you have several of the same class present. <br />
<br />
Absor: *faithcrusher* When an opening exists, you will be offered more than one option? Like one that would be aggressive in nature and one that would be defensive? <br />
<br />
Todd Schmidt: When you are presented with an opening, you will have to make a decision on what type of ability you want to use. There will be many per opening type. And there are a few opening types. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Depen_Hoss* Will class specific items be adjusted to add endurance, or will we need to look for new items? <br />
<br />
Oliver Smith: We do plan on adding endurance stats onto existing items. We plan to have this done at the same time the new system is introduced next month (Dec. 16th). <br />
<br />
Absor: *Kilbane_luc* Will we have to buy a new expansion to use these skills too?<br />
<br />
Paul Carrico: This is a free feature. It will become available to everyone! <br />
<br />
Absor: *Illydth* VERY important question: Since we have a chance to trigger a special attack with every attack, does it then mean that haste and dual wielding and double attacking means more &quot;openings&quot;? <br />
<br />
John Troy: More attacks will help a little, but in general they scale around delay <br />
<br />
Absor: *Aeria* Question, this sounds great and all and maybe I missed this point..but if the openings are part of our text..thats ok for groups but major raids where the text OFTEN becomes sluggish means we will miss the opportunity to strike...is there going to be a visual clue? <br />
<br />
John Troy: The opening is going to display on the UI - you won't have to watch your textbox for them <br />
<br />
Paul Carrico: Another thing for warriors that some of you may have noticed on test is that you will now get a return message when taunt is used, so you will know if it was effective. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Aalek* Will the abilities have &quot;cast&quot; times? Can they be interrupted by the NPC? Can pure melee NPCs use the abilities against players? <br />
<br />
John Troy: No, skills, like bash, kick, and taunt, are instant. <br />
<br />
Paul Carrico: The taunt return message will be for everyone, not just Warriors. <br />
<br />
Absor: *Bumpper-Test* Will Taunt be increased for warriors?...Its a simple question that I know a lot of warriors want to know <br />
<br />
John Troy: Yes, we're giving warriors skills to better gain and keep hate.<br />
<br />
John Troy: We're not changing the way Taunt itself works. We're adding a new skill that doesn't require an opening, as well as others that do, to address the issue.<br />
<br />
Oliver Smith: There have been a few questions with regards to upcoming expansions and features. At this time we cannot go into detail about what's in development. However, please make sure to watch the EverQuestlive.com site for more information over the next few weeks. <br />
<br />
Absor: We're hoping to do this on a more regular basis. It's a lot of fun for us, and hopefully provides some useful information. <br />
<br />
Absor: That's all the time we have. We should have a transcript posted on the site tomorrow. Thank you all for stopping in! <br />
-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Comment as you will :)  But. Please remember too keep comments polite and non-flaming.. I understand some will like and dislike these changes.. but this is not a flame SOE post... <br />
<br />
please just keep that in mind =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am all for change and equalization.  But in my opinion, here lately, it seems that changes have been made for reasons that are really unclear and in some cases slap those of us who have played EQ for 3 years across the face.  Take the recent maxing out of &quot;sense heading&quot;  to all players.  What about all of us who wore out our keyboards by hammering our sense heading hotkey over and over and over?  We wasted all that time and effort perfecting a skill that now everyone has.  When some of us started, we had to fight &quot;Hell Levels&quot; at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50.  Did we get any equalization for the time and EXP we lost when those levels were downgraded?  NO.  Its to the point where Verant/Sony should just make everyone a Level 50 at start up and to hell with the lower levels.  Don't worry about pissing off all the people who bought EQ when there were no expansions, who have well been paying every month for 2 to 3 years now.   Because what we had to do back then has been changed so drastically that  the people just starting are playing a easier, friendlier and DIFFERENT game then we did.  You are making the game easier...too damn easy if you ask me.  You have taken away too much of the charm and adventure of the game in an attempt to make leveling easier and quicker.  And again, you are basically telling all off us who started this game that our efforts, the time we spent going through the harder parts (hell levels and such) was wasted.  Well thanks alot.  It seems to me that the changes have been made in an attempt to get more &quot;adolescent&quot; players.  You are not looking for adult players anymore.  Good strategy.<br />
<br />
And now, lets give all the meleers an edge. Let's not do anything though for the Paladins and &quot;bastard&quot; classes.  I mean, you have give the Paladins such great and powerful spells, right?  And now with our inferior spells, you are going to make us inferior meleers.  Good plan!  Who wouldn't want to play a Paladin  after you do this?  Think about it for just a second.  In trying to make the pure meleers more desirable, you are going to make playing a Pallie unsavory.  Ther is NO REASON to play one after you pull off this end run.  When a Paladin cannot melee with the Warrior, and since a Paladin already cannot heal as well as a Cleric, why would anyone play one?  You are doing to the Paladin what you did to the Druid many years ago...screwing them over totally.  A &quot;tank&quot; and a Cleric in a group make a Paladin totally unnecessary AND unwanted in a group.  Thanks alot.<br />
<br />
Now I understand there is a need to &quot;equalize&quot; the classes, to give no class any advantage over another.  But everytime you guys do one of these &quot;fixes&quot; you totally screw over another.  To be honest, after you do this one, why don't you just delete all the Paladins.  After you totally screwed the Druids a few years ago, you should have deleted them.  You have basically made them nothing more than taxi cabs after all the changes you made.  But when you screw over the Pallies, you may as well destroy the class totally.  No one needs them anymore.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again for giving it to me again..<br />
<br />
Oh and one other thing...before you start adding mor eproblems, how about fixing the existing problems..the lag, the freezing and the ungodly zone time its taking to zone.  I bought a new Sony Computer equipped with hardware above and beyond what is necessary for this game, and I can barely move at times since the last patch.  How about we fix what isn't working before we start adding more stuff that won't work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had written this long retort, but cleared it and decided to not post it.<br />
<br />
Usually when it comes to debating classes with a paladin, there is not changing the paladins mind.  Paladins are a stubborn class.<br />
<br />
The only part I am going to keep is polite advice:<br />
<br />
You know they nerfed monks pretty damn hard to help make plate classes, including paladins, better.  It pissed me off pretty good.  But did I go around griping and whining about it?  No.  I started playing another one of my toons.  After leveing him up 57 levels I realised how much I missed my monk and appreciated the skills that he does have instead of fretting over the ones he lost.  Having so many of my friends in game sending me tells about the monks in their groups and how they rathered it was me helped some too.<br />
Paladins are one of my most respected classes when in a guild group, but also my least favorite to group with in a pick-up group.  Why?  Becasue the paladins in my guild bust their ass and do amazing things and the paladins in my pick-up groups whine when I pull aggro, whine when the cleric heals at less that 50%, whine about the weather, whine about the way the mob sounds...do you see where I am going?<br />
<br />
Intead of investing all that energy into complaing and feeling inferoir, try acting like &quot;the little guy.&quot;  You know take what you do have and do more with it than you though possible.<br />
What made me such a good monk was not the skills of my class, but the determination of my playing.<br />
<br />
Don't take this personally Azrael, but if you really don't think that your class is all that good, then try playing another that is better in your mind.  In my mind, a well-played paladin is a powerful and awesome class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelcrusha</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I have to say in response to the &quot;changes&quot;. There are some good things, and some bad...this is going to change the playing style and overall format of the game drastically for melees. Casters haven't had much to change really, a few minor changes here and there, but their playability remained the same through the years. Additionally, I don't foresee this as being a &quot;fix&quot; per se', more of an experimentation on the game itself. There will undoubtedly be good additions to agro for warriors and dps for other melee and hybrid classes, yet as an overall balancing issue, this doesn't change the fact that their &quot;fix&quot; is turning melee into a semi-casting class now. I did not choose the melee lifestyle so I could become a caster, but then, that's just my take on the whole thing. In the end, it all comes down to whether or not this is going to be more of a pain than it is going to be fun. <br />
<br />
Also, in response to the paladin &quot;nerf&quot; cry I heard in a reply (and this is not a flame, only a clarification), I must say that paladins are still a very viable tank. From what I am seeing, there have been no modifications done to that class aside from possibly a few changes with your disciplines that sound to be a promising upgrade...Basically, you have to look at it from a warrior's perspective. We have had no spells, and thus, we have always been one dimensional. We Tank, we're not dps, we're not pullers, we're not anything except a meat shield. When another class with pulling abilities, healing abilities, tanking abilities equal to our own, and even dps abilities (against undead), we have become second rate in a field where we were intended to be the top dogs. If a warrior is placed in his intended place as lead tank, a paladin is then left with pulling abilities, healing abilities, dps (undead) abilities, and basically a nice secondary tank. No warriors around? Pick up that pally, he'll do the job nicely. No monks, bards, or rangers around? Pick up that pally, he's got pacify and can handle his own in case of adds. Need a backup healer? Pick up a pally, he has LoH and can spot heal in an emergency. You get my point....<br />
<br />
Anyway, I guess everything will have to be seen in a playable field before we can really begin to rip it apart =o)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xylass</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i got out of EQ 2 years ago i was a very good cleric my old freinds on where happy i was starting up once more but thay needed a 65th war for raids and wanted me to do this so i start up and try some thing new <br />
<br />
All i have see sence that time 6 mounths ago is lots of how Bad wars are off in the game the biggest thing is i want to go kill a 40th mob (ps i am 57th) i need to go get a healer of some kind to do it at all <br />
<br />
a war can't fight alone right now at all as a cleric i could do it badly all i hope for is that with this &quot;fix&quot; i can try and kill blues<br />
<br />
Seillican 57th warrior<br />
<br />
PS with all that is bad with wars i can't stop playing my new one i love the Control i now have in a fight ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tafkamb</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a noob by most of your standards as I only started playing EQ in February. When I started I have to be honest a warrior was never going to be part of my playing experience. Looking at the changes I may well change my mind. The thought of just bashing things with no real dimension to the character seemed a bit boring. What they are suggesting is adding a new dimension to this type which sounds kinda cool. From my perspective it isn't a button bashing type as a chanter or cleric is but adds a nice twist to an otherwise stand and bash mode of play. <br />
As for a Pally being unwanted I have to say they will always be welcome in groups, even more so if it involves an undead zone and having a pally in a group to be able to pull a mob off of a caster who gets aggro is always a blessing.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents worth but I look forward to seeing how these changes pan out and there may well be a warrior soon in Team Taf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one thing I notice that concerns me a little is activating the new skills. They talk about a new window that will contain melee hotbuttons... and a pop-up window that will need to be clicked when there is an opening. I may be in the minority... but I almost never touch my trackball when I play. I do everything with the keyboard, and I hope they make some kind of provisions for people with my playstyle. If I'm using my keyboard like normal, and yet have to scramble to get my hand on the trackball and find my pointer in time to click the &quot;opening&quot; window... it could be rather annoying to play my warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onetwo1212</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They said the keys for the abilities will be able to be accesed from the keyboard.<br />
<br />
I for one welcome this change.  IT is about time they did something to one of my char to make it more interesting to play.  My main, being a necro, has gotten the shaft alot this year.  After the fixed the pet exp, they nerf the pet to where he only hits about once every 10 swings.  Then they completly killed solo exp in most places.  I started playing a warrior to have some mindless entertainment.  Now that I have gotten used to playing tank, I can add in the extra abilities.</div></div><hr />

im one of those that has been playing since day 1, and have played everything at least once.   In my opinion if you want to make pure melee a viable class how about this....take away the bandage cap..let pure melee bandage to 100 from lvl 1. I dont think that would be to much to ask. hell while we are at it take the weight restriction of the monks also....probly 1of the 2 main reasons people get tired of playing a melee is having to drag a healer around after ya.  And that crapy weight restriction yeah you can get bags that reduce weight but how the hell do you buy equipment when you cant even loot to much cause it will bog you down...well anyway thats my 2cp's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, a lot to consider, especially for the Wizard who will never have a manaburn that rocks...but wait....maybe after they let warriors and other melee classes start kicking butt and keeping aggro, (I pull taunt off a warrior with one of my half-a$$ed nukes?)  maybe then they can work on giving me an the other classes something that changes our way of life as well...<br />
<br />
Really tho.  I've read a lot into this I think, but I never played a warrior, I didn't want to go auto pilot on attack and every once in a while stop watching TV to press the kick or bash button, but dont get me wrong, give me an opportunity to play Street Fighter and beat the crap outta someone and I'm all over it still.  <br />
<br />
Chun Li &gt; Low Light Kick &gt; High Hard Punch &gt; High Hard Kick &gt; *Stun* &gt;&gt; WOOT Spinning Flying Kick!!!  Just had to wait for my opening.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;  I may finally play a warrior after all.<br />
<br />
And I dont care what anyone says.  Can have your taunt at 250, beg at 250 and the fastest weapon in the game, When I pull taunt off a warrior, I'm always happy to see the Paladin in my group grab it back supah fast.  Imagine the posibilities to improve Pally options once the warrior is once again the Lead Tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah &gt;&gt; Bandages --- I agree totally.  Warriors should start with 100 in bind wound and be able to bind to 50% until 25th and then uncap to 75 then uncap to 100. (course I also think I should be able to find consumable mana potions.):D</div></div><hr />

This kinda sux, but I was in BoT the other MT 65 warrior a cleric necro druid and shammy and me (64 pally).<br />
The warrior couldn't pull and the druids harmony kept failing but being fairly experienced in BoT I can almost single pull  the whole zone. So I was pulling mobs the warrior was tanking, now I did mention that I can almost single pull the whole zone well a few times I pulled adds, the first thing the add did was pounce on the cleric. Let me tell you how happy the cleric was that I was on it stunning that mob and pulling the mob off them. So I guess in reality now we are gonna fullfill a secondary tanking roll but its gonna make us alot less desirable to groups. Heres why, a pally=slim to no dps and if you have a warrior who has more HP than a pally more AC than a pally and can hold arggo just as well as a pally. Well now i'm obsolete the the spot I took in a group was to tank and hold arggo Most groups aim for something like this. Main tank, Healer, Slower, DPS, DPS, off class. The only spot I'll have in this break down is the off class where every other class has a specified spot. Say hi to the new ranjas of norrath. <br />
<br />
Tank (warrior), Healer (cleric,druid), Slower (chanter, shammy, beast) Dps (beast, rogue, ranja, mage, whizzy)(possible exception could be and SK as dps),off class(any of the afore mentioned and add SK and pally to that)<br />

while I understand your posistion as stated above, you are forgetting a few things..<br />
<br />
When I do a Mistmoore Dungeon, I LOVE and almost require a Pally to be Puller/Tank.  <br />
<br />
This is also true of many raid level mobs where they are undead or have minions that are undead.<br />
<br />
You can feel bad that they are going to give Warriors something to help bring their play ability inline with hybrids and casters.. <br />
<br />
Or, you can remember that you are a holy warrior, and that your fight is with those who souls are trapped here, tormented, and want to drag others into their abysmal hell. and for that you are the absolutely best equiped to handle it.<br />

Maybe camping shards in the grey or something. My appeal comes from the fact in BoT the enchanter can slow when the mob is inc and never worry about being hit, and I don't loose arggo at all let a whizzy overnuke I just drop a few more stuns. Upon more thought I don't think this is gonna change much it may cause a bit more hate to warriors but should arggo slip they still have to wait for a proc or opening now to regain arggo while all I have to do is hit a fast cast stun. Yep upon reflection I don't think this will affect me one bit just make playing a warrior a bit more interesting.<br />

<br />
Actually I think its just the opposite, I think you will gain back some of the warriors who have left.<br />
<br />
My wife for example is so excited about these changes she is already dusting off her warrior. She has not played in nearly 3 months, but now with the addition of &quot;something to do&quot; as she put it.. she is coming back.<br />
<br />
in over 3 years of playing, the only common thing I have seen from people who leave the game because of &quot;XXXXXX&quot; is that they are generally not happy in the game anymore, even before the change.  And of the people I personally have seen leave I would say a good 40% have come back to play, either a different class or different server.<br />
<br />
And I would have agreed with you about making the game to easy on a few of the last changes.. but this one will actually make people pay attention, plan thier characters and attacks, and even show some signs of intellegence. When you see a 65th warrior with no &quot;skills&quot; over 60, you will know they are one not to group with.. find yourself a pally.... right Laertise?? (hehehe)</div></div><hr />

As to Paladins loseing their spot as tanks? Wooot! maybe I wont have to wait 4 - 5 hours for a group to give me a tell. I have been told when I finaly get a group that I am a very good warrior. I take pride in what little I can do and do it very well. Warriors cant pull? heh go back to the drawing board. Warriors cant keep agro. Try a fully ubbered out Pali tanking a mob till the group was done with the one we where on and then me pulling the agro off of him immediatly. That totaly suprised that paladin. Try a 65 Shamy pulling with slow and then I watch as he types, &quot; OMG how does a 63 warrior pull off of a 65 Shaman?&quot; Yea I love the changes that are comeing. It will be alot less borring for me. As to Paladins loosing status? Pffft. Those that think that must not play theirs very well. Sorry but Paladins have alot of potential, and not just with undead either. I love a paladin in a group becasue they can grab agro when the cleric or nuker / slower is in trouble. If any of you think I dont know what I am talking about.... well I have been playing for 3.5 years now and have played every class even thoe I have stuck with my warrior. Reason for her only being Leve 63 right now instead of 65 with full aa's. Any way I am glad I wont be falling asleep any more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing I don't understand, is why people believe a paladin has such an advantage against undead?  I mean, we SHOULD have the advantage, but really Sony has seen to it that we are NOT what you believe us to be.<br />
<br />
Case in point:<br />
<br />
Our undead NUKES, ROFL.  If a paladin is casting this crap on the undead mobs, I would boot him from the group and put him on ignore.  Our nukes are a sickening waste of mana.  Our BEST nuke, Deny Undead  (Level 62) costs 250 mana, has a 30 second recast time and delivers a whopping 630 or so damage.  Gimme a break. <br />
<br />
Our wonderful Disc: Holy Forge, reuse time is about an hour.  Grants us three times the chance to Crit against undead..... /boggle<br />
<br />
Our best and only undead advantage is Slay Undead 3:  This AA will give the Paladin a chance to turn that crit into a slay.  I have slayed for over 5k, and my low is 950.  In a LDoN dungeon with a lot of undead, like guk or MM I can get maybe a half dozen slays in the whole dungeon.  Not exactly &quot;bowling&quot; them over.  <br />
<br />
Paladin against undead, it is a myth, a myth that Sony refuses to bring to reality.</div></div><hr />

Theres 2 kinds of players, the ones who will just cry they are nerfed and give up, use it as an excuse. And then there are the ones who laugh at sony for trying to put them down and come out ahead. In xp groups, a paladin is allmost always taken over a warrior as it is now. If this change helps warriors gain faster agro, then maybe that will change. But a skilled player of one class will always be better then the unskilled of another class. <br />
<br />
I dont see why anyone would want to just cry about being nerfed. Take the change and do what you can with it. Sony doesn't have it out for any one class. They are just trying to make the classes more suited to their roles.<br />

<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
And as for the comments about paladins and undead....<br />
<br />
PLEASE! Paladins are the ultimate undead killers. Put a paladin in a mistmoore adventure and watch the undead fall before our might! Ok, Slay undead dont land alot. No where near as much as it did before the nerf, but still, lets see. I can parse a MM adventure, then a Ruj adventure. In mistmoore, a paladin with slay 3 will out damage allmost everyone. Even a high end monk or rog. But in Ruj, paladins will be lucky to come in last place with damage. Even our weapon innate proc buffs are tuned to killing undead, with the undead one not only procing more often, but landing for twice the damage.<br />
<br />
Any paladin who says they are not feared by the undead minions of Norrath is a paladin I truely do not wish to ever group with.<br />

<br />
I think this will be a lot of fun, an opportunity for the player who pays attention to improve their gameplay.  Warriors needed something besides attack/stop attacking.  And all non-casters and non-caster-hybrids needed something to make them more desirable in PoP.</div></div><hr />

But on the pally undead thing thats been brought to light I agree with jlpicard to some extent we are not the slayers of undead we could be but I also agree with Ronandar that we are the best of the buisness. Heres where I see the problem the dd spells cost to much mana and are mana pulls are insufficent for the set task. I generally look for equip that ups my sta so that when grouping the Planes I'm a sufficent tank but if i'm gonna be an undead caster I need to look for higher wis gear. Now don't get me wrong I have a wis of 203 but this still comes up lacking when I'm in mm I can have VoQ on and if I use my dd spells the way I'd like to I burn through mana quick. I can usually cast deny about once per mob maybe twice.<br />
<br />
I think all will agree this should be a good adjustment for the warriors among us. It may give the pally class a little competition in the tanking field among groups but as once said if you know your class people on your server will know you as a good player and you will still be desired in groups.<br />

<br />
Warriors have needed something new for a long while; I don’t think this will be what they were hoping for, as the master of all weapons (read Verant's description pre Sony ownership when most warriors were made). I am sure they hoped for more argo and more dps. I think the excitement, if there is any, over these changes is simply the starvation effect (anything is good when your this hungry) and shocked that they finally are doing something. These changes are not class defining or enhancing in anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Absor: *ScootD* How can you acquire the new melee abilities? <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: The new abilities will be acquired by taking a &quot;skill tome&quot; to your guild master and he'll teach you the skill. Most of the basic skills will be available on vendors, while a few high level ones will be drops. Right now we're planning on giving almost all of the sub 60 skills on merchants and having the 60+ skills using a system similar to the parchments quests in Planes of Power. From there on out we'll most likely make use of the same methods that you already use to acquire any other type of item.<br />
<br />
 Absor: *Drewon-FoH* Will there be any new AA skills that are tied to, or create, these new melee abilities? <br />
<br />
Ryan Barker: There will AA abilities that will effect the new system yes. We don't have a hard and fast list for it yet though.<br />
<br />
They’ve (melee classes) been begging for disc enhancements since Velious. The most defining thing for warriors has been their disc’s (defensive, evasive and to a much lesser extent shield) and now the one thing they could count on is changing. I would very concerned if I was a 300 days plus played 65 warrior with 250+ aa’s that now I need to get more aa’s, find skill tome’s to maintain what I have, then find addition tomes to enhance and acquire the changes that I should have been given 2 years ago, when I first started asking.<br />
<br />
Stamina being replaced by endurance... They really need to explain in more detail what this means.<br />
<br />
Absor: *Adorae* just fix taunt? LOL <br />
<br />
John Troy: Saying that taunt is the one and only issue is fairly shortsighted, I think. Pure melee have very few strategic decisions to make, don't get new abilities with an expansion the way casters do, and don't get as much from an item with both hp and mana. These are all issues that people have raised, and this system gives us a way to address them. <br />
<br />
Yet why not do it, no changes have yet been announced for simply fixing taunt, wanna define warrior class as the meat shield, the BIG HP guy/gal with weapons skills  and without the need to cast a spell FIX TAUNT. This helps every class in a very straight forward way those classes with taunt can now hold argo via the taunt button in direct releationship to thier taunt skill. Sure do the other things you suggest (/yawn) but  FIX TAUNT!<br />
<br />
There are a lot of questions unanswered, and maybe I'll be totally wrong and this will make the melee world a better place, lets hope so anyway, I am really tired of watching my friends leave the game.<br />
<br />
One more point: The bandwagon jumpers and Sony defenders (read Kudane, yes, I know this is your site) actually work against those who actually bring broken issues to the surface, every time someone with a message finally gets their (Sony) attention  you come out of the wood work flying the I &lt;3 Sony flag and Sony reads the good press (even their own press), cheers they did a great job, meanwhile the people who did thier best to bring the issue to light and have the most invested (in this case warriors) end up going away and eventually playing froglok wizards or quitting the game.<br />
<br />
There is an EQ killer out there I don't have a crystal ball to show what it is or when it will happen but when it does, those who championed Sony's defense will be partially responsible for the demise of EQ by stifleing those who have issues and are doing their best to see them addressed. <br />
<br />
If this appears to be a flame its not meant to be its just one more person who is tired of reading the propaganda from Sony and seeing others believe, and replay it like some kind of Amway salesman and then appear to speak for the playing population.<br />
<br />
If Sony wants to know how they are doing they need look no further then then thier own new account subscription and account closure database's or OMG actually speak to the players directly.</div></div><hr />

Secondly there gonna increase there argo. I for one applaud sony for at least making an attemt to make playing a warrior more intersting to play and acctually making them a tank who can hold arggo which seems to be what your whole complaint is, and the taunt thing if Kudane was to knock you in the head and I was to yell at you which of us would you attack. But if when you turned your back on me I stuck a knife between your ribs. Well after all the game is supposed to resemble life.<br />

<br />
ONE other big note you play EQ now I doubt your about to stop playing eq so sony has no fear of loosing there investment in you, so the fact that they are still tring to make the game more enjoyable is a big plus to them in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KelricStormwolf</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Re: the paladin concerns...<br />
<br />
I think what some players forget is paladins/shadowknights/rangers are still (and probably always will be) considered hybrids. Yes, it's true that it's more practical to consider classes from a damaging/tanking/healing perspective for *players*... but never forget that the Devs, whether they would like to shift paradigms or not, are still restricted by nearly 10 years of coding (going back to McQuaid and Co's beginning) from a specific perspective. Changing viewpoints on the surface, so to speak, where all us players float and swim, may make sense, but those that dive deep, they're restricted by the sea floor... waves on the surface won't change the geography at the bottom.<br />
<br />
Having said that: hybrids have always been designed to do multiple jobs, but none as well as a base class. We who play hybrids HAVE to keep that in mind when we evaluate ourselves versus others. Knights have lately been in a position to tank better than warriors, keep aggro better than warriors, and do considerable damage on top of that. While that's great (and I mean that sincerely), that's not where knights should be relative to warriors. Warriors are *designed and intended* to be the ultimate tanks and dangerous damage dealers, but recent changes to rightly inprove other classes left warriors in particular in a limbo.<br />
<br />
I think most long term rangers can sympathize. Back in '99-00, pre-Kunark, rangers were the place to be; we tanked as well as warriors, did as much or more damage than any other melee, and had plenty of utility in downtime or to cope with the unexpected. With Kunark we went from first place to last place (so to speak) in one fell swoop, not getting the skill increases or gear to compete either offensively or defensively. Rangers were manasinks, the scrawny kids that got picked last in P.E. Subsequent changes and expansions balanced things better, thank goodness... but we've been where warriors feel they are right now.<br />
<br />
It's happened with other classes as well (I remember rogues having a bad time for a while), but as much as the later coding changes helped, we (rangers) had to realize that we couldn't play like we had, we weren't the best at everything anymore, that we had a role to fill in a group-oriented game, and while the changes weren't perfect, they put things back towards where they should have been all along.<br />
<br />
The good news (from my point of view) about these new melee changes is that noone's getting penalized or left behind; certain classes in need of boosting are getting boosts, without other classes being 'nerfed'.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, I didn't mention bards in the above, because they're really a unique case, but the same could be said: all hybrids, including bards, can do just about anything another class can do, and well enough to fill in if necessary, but we're not, and *shouldn't* be, able to do it to the same degree as those who specialize. To me, THAT'S what class balance is all about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">11-27-2003, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladins are a &quot;Swiss-army knife&quot; class we may not be the best at a single job but we got a tool for most situations.<br />
<br />
We pull, stun, heal, buff, tank and put out DMG decently but not a single one of those out does any other class. <br />
<br />
As for the Agro issue i think it has more to do with player then class. Yes a paladin can grab agro fast with a fast cast stun and a tuant and bash..but the DMG a warrior will do in that time will almost balance it out and once the pally stops the spells and taunts the warrior will have agro.<br />
<br />
The only reason a pally should be grabbing agro is if a caster is being attacked or if tank is close to death and needs a bit of help.<br />
<br />
The way I have always seen it a Paladin is in a group to die first.<br />
If pally dies while Tank is being healed..tank lives regains agro and casters therefore live..group kills mob pally gets rez.<br />
If pally dies to save a caster (usually cleric)...group can finish of mob and pally gets rez.<br />
<br />
Dieing does suck but there is no way to avoidit...but if your death means the group lives then you have helped you group much more then if you dealt some more dmg.<br />
<br />
Trust me from my experience a dead paladin first almost always means the group will live. It is not very often that a last second LOH to a cleric or warrior does not turn the tide of a battle. And yes once it hits the paladin is in for a beating from the mob..but the group lives and you get a rez so really no harm done.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So really the coming changes can really be getting pally's back to what they are...multi-use class...doer of many master of none..the essence of Hybrid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hybrid never means all of the comonents that make it but rather...a balance of the best parts to make something different yet similar to what made it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin = Cleric + Paladin<br />
<br />
average healer/stunner/pacifyier/buffer/tank/agro is what a paladin should be and once we become the best at one we are no longer what our class was intended to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long rant it's late and I just wanted to say my feelings on the worries a lot of paladins have.<br />
<br />
Learn your class. Do not get PL'ed and you will learn why paladins are welcomed without hesitation at higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gelielian</div><div class="date">11-27-2003, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a lvl 59 war, and a 40 necro.<br />
<br />
As the warrior i always thought that it was kinda stupid that the warrior, the melee class with the most HP and stuff had the hardest time keeping taunt.  We dont have squat for DPS and if there is a pally in the group thats atleast close to our lvl then why shouldnt they tank? if im not mistaken, they get spells that do nothing but add hate.  Seemed a tad bit silly to me.  I would think that having healing spells would be enough for the pally, but i guess SOE didnt see it that way.  Anyway, this didnt keep me from playing, i dont group with a pally every single time so it doesnt effect me that much.  <br />
<br />
But now with the new taunting abilites that warriors are gonna get i see a new group situation that could arise.  Say you have a group that has a War, Pally, Rogue, Cleric, Chanter, and maybe a Wizard or other DPS class.  Now say you pull 2 mobs. I see the warrior taunting one mob while the other runs to the Cleric, so pally goes and starts tanking and taunting that other mob, using his taunt spells even.  Now because the warrior has all these new taunting abilites, he can actaully keep the agro while the other group members go all out on the one mob while pally keeps the other one busy.  Now because the warrior is doing such a good job taunting with the new abilites and such, that mob goes down really fast and the group can turn to the pallies mob.  Warrior taunts off mob and then pally goes to DPS and this mob dies even quicker than the last one. <br />
<br />
In this situation the pally served a very important role, and we even saved the chanter from wasting mana on a Mez spell, which could have failed and got him killed, and now he can save that mana for when the idiot warrior pulls 5 mobs.. And when that happens, warrior agin concentrates on one mob while pally keeps the others off chanter while he mezzes them.<br />
<br />
Now thats just my opinion on what MIGHT happen after the changes, i might not even be close but hey it would be cool if the warrior and pally had such improtant roles even when they shared a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shainaen</div><div class="date">11-27-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i love how everyone is focused on the paladin class for tank and aggro.  That's fine.  Taunt is not broken.  People need to just learn how to control their taunt is all.  Blaming the game is a pathetic excuse and a cop-out.  It is the people that need to learn to control their aggro.  Why do i know this?  I play a shadow kngiht and we are the masters of aggro.  Plain and simple hands down the final truth.  We can take it immediately and we can get rid of it in a heart beat like NO ONE else can (FD is beautiful).  If you disagree then you simply have grouped with really bad SK's.  I have taken and kept aggro from any warrior i grouped with unless i just didnt want it.  I have kept aggro from shaman and chanters who spam debuffs to try to take it back from me.  I have kept aggro from the stun spamming paladin.  Sony nerfed the SK when they killed our ability to fear mobs over L53.  But in the same nerfing they also gave us our best taunt.  Combine fear with a shot of some dark snare and our own Damage shields, throw in a terror line spell now and then for simple color and you have the masters/mistresses of aggro.  Do SK's always need to be MT?  nope.  should we?  nope.  But the shadowknight is the epitome of hate.  We are born of hate.  we ARE hate.  now tell me what is aggro?  Hate.  Hence the wonderful coined term - hate list.  We have specific spells (though basically useless) designed to do nothing BUT generate aggro (Voice line which is a buff for others and Terror line which is a damageless aggro generator.)  Pity they are a waste since our darkness lines cost less, cast faster and generate more aggro as well as our nerfed fear.<br />
<br />
Cry that taunt is broke.  Let me get you a hankey.  Posture and strut saying &quot;my class &gt; your sk for aggro&quot; and i will get you a mirror to drool on yourself all you like.  but that's the most you will do is drool.  The issues of aggro are not that it is broken.  it's that people don't know how to control it.<br />
<br />
These new changes just give warriors something more to do then sit and fall sleep or simply mash their taunt button hoping that mindlessly mashing does some good.  (it doesn't so ya know...  You actually need to know when to hit the taunt button.. mashing does nothing but make a worn out button and youlose aggro more then generate it)<br />

I certainly didn't mean to perpetuate a class vs class discussion... but I'm certainly glad to see examples of hybrid players who aren't crying foul before the fixes are in.<br />
<br />
As a ranger, also able to generate and dissipate aggro easily, I'm really glad warriors are going to get something. It just makes sense to me. Not to mention, it looks like they're going to do it in a way that makes it interesting for the player. I'm really interested in seeing how this plays out, which classes get what abilities, how they work, what the strategies are going to be... but so far, I think it looks really cool! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Direbane</div><div class="date">11-28-2003, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As much of an advantage as Knights already have aginst warriors I think it is funny seeing how much of a stir these changes are causing. The only reason there are so many arguing about this now is the fact that the past several expansions have catered to hybrids while leaving the warriors alone. How can any knight argue that their spells dont help them hold aggro better than a warrior? The knights were built up to make group forming quicker when it came to picking a tank. Well, the side effect was that now with a highly compairable HP ( less than a 500 point difference) and a compairable AC, pure melee can no longer compete for a spot in a group because they cant generate the same aggro. I dont think that there is any danger in anyone losing their spot in a group because of this change, but I do think that warriors will start getting a better consideration than they have gotten. It comes down to, if you are worried about losing your tanking job, then step up to the plate and out tank that warrior. If you are that intimidated by it, step back and let the warrior have it.  The abilities help the characters, but its the player behind the keyboard that determines the outcome.</div></div><hr />

Isn't this the whole point of these changes?<br />
<br />
The fact that the class that is supposedly the superior tank is left totally behind when it comes to aggro. No one is arguing that others can get and maintain aggro.<br />
<br />
Right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
that answers your point Genghiz.  Though i already did as well in my post note this.<br />
<br />
.the class that is supposedly the superior tank is left totally behind when it comes to aggro<br />
<br />
Warriors are the superior tank.  hands down i would take a warrior to tank any raid size mob instead of myself.  Superior tank does not mean master of aggro.  means master of taking a beat down and living to keep taking it.  <br />
<br />
(note:  when term knight is used, it refers paladin and SK)<br />
<br />
Players need to learn to control their abilities.  No knight (less ebayed idiots) will ever want to or willing engage in out aggroing mobs when in a warrior inhabitted group... unless of course the warrior is talking mad trash and simply needs to be put in his place.  Barring idiocy as i said though, knights are happier not being pounded.  On large scale raids, we knights know we have off-tank duty.  Our role is support the MT to protect healers.<br />
<br />
If warriors insist on whining about aggro then either they don't know how to taunt right to begin with (button mashing is not the way) or they continually group with idiots that don't know how to assist.  It is not a matter of ability of the character (or the perceived lack there-of)  it is the player understanding his character ability.  <br />
<br />
These new skills being implimented aren't gonna do much of anything to improve aggro control.  It just give warriors and other non-hybrids a different flavor of game to mess with.   Like someone mentioned earlier, you starve an animal long enough it will appreciate anything you throw at it.  Warriors and rogues are definitely starved and monks... good grief, the ONE nerfing that you had and you act as if the game was destroyed.  That nerf made you what you were intended to be all along.  You all just got used to being over powered for what your class was.  You wear a T-shirt for armor...  Warriors and knights wear truck hoods.  Sorry if you think fabric is supposed to mitigate damage better then plate metal.  Yes i agree monks should DODGE better but 2 things:  1 you are not Bruce lee... get the kung fu movies outta your head, thats not you.  2 you take a direct hit of something, the damage you incur will be and SHOULD be more then if a warrior or knight took the same exact hit.<br />

Aggro isn't broke.  Players just don't know their roles.</div></div><hr />

hybrids really get left out with this new change it seems. instead of requiring people to mindlessly look for tomes to enable this ability it would make more sense to make them trainable at your class specific trainers and if said person has used all their training points THEN make it so they can use a tome instead. with PoP it's clearly evident that they can base abilities by level so why not do that here?<br />
my 2cents anyways.<br />

I want to point out that I have Played EQ on and off for 2-3 years now ... I first started off by playing a Human Warrior.... I got so bored with it.. I saw My wife play a druid and fell in love with it and that is all I have every played until here recently.. I have seen many changes with EQ... I played a druid for so long that I almost fall asleep playing it lol. So I decided to make a warrior again. This time I made a DE warrior. I have to say I have played alot of classes but this is my all time favorite. My druid was 48 and my Warrior is now 51... And only started playing him about 2 months ago. One thing that I want to make clear.... People assume when Playing a warrior you will fall asleep and drool all over the keybored. WRONG!!!!! I don't have time to go to the bathroom alot. I have to focus so much with the mobs that I can't breath at times. Trying to taunt and hold mobs and watch everyone else if an add comes along. Manily I have been puller and MT.... When everyone is screaming chain pull..... How can a warrior be so boring. Why I fell in love with my warrior. True we only have bash taunt disarm and kick but being a tank is being responsible for the whole group.... Got to watch everything... If you have played a warrior and you think there is nothing to do ... than you have been playing it wrong. I have played 6 hours straight with no breaks cause of pulling and being MT... I do not whine about buffs etc... Why I quit playing my druid....  I had a hard time healing buffing and snaring doting nuking and only 8 spell slots to mem spells. They should change that to aleast 10....<br />
I for one welcome the change.... I do see what alot or talking about... I had a 38 Pally and i was 50 at the time out taunt me and he was hitting harder than me. They have spells to increase there abilitys... Unlike warriors..... I don't know why people whine... Warriors are way out in the dark and this is why i can't wait for the change..... This new system from what I gather is something that they will aprove apon over time..  I do not think they are making it easier for players after all it's the person behind the toon that makes it or breaks it for a group. Learn how to play a toon before whining about it lol... But I do agree on one thing though they should fix things before starting a new project... After this last patch I have been crashing right and left... and the Lagg omg... What ever they did they need to fix that first or they will loose customers.... because of the down time instead of playing the game..... But then again it's all about the money and this is why they make the changes to aquire more people..... Just my two coppers worth.... Peace<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jadn</div><div class="date">11-30-2003, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but being a lvl 51 tank is sort of different from being a lvl 65 tank in BoT.  SK/Pally is practically a must when you have an ench slowing.  Playing a beastlord I also slow, and I can usually slow a mob around 98% with no problems with a sk/pal tank but need to wait until around 92% with a warrior.  Sure it's only a 6% difference but during that span of 5 seconds tanks can get destroyed and clerics run oom quicker.  I think the changes are needed on warriors to make them balanced but this is gonna make monks and rogues so out of whack with the rest of the DPS classes it could start alot more whinning from all the other classes.</div></div><hr />

so as for all you knights out there you have nothing to worry about your jobs will always be there cause you are the uber hate mongers.<br />
<br />
as for these new additions i'm not really up to date on them yet but it will give me time to learn more about the game.  the way i see it if someone falls asleep at the wheel they should a)go to bed or b)not play the game  cause its obviously not fun for you anymore.  if your a melee char and your not the tank then turn on some music grab a beer or glass of wine and sit back and deal out damage. <br />
<br />
wanted to say more but everything has been said allready so quit your whinning and play the game.<br />

I'm so happy you all are upgrading the pure fighter classes.. specially the Warriors.. see my 2nd char is a 58 RNG with some pretty nice gear.. and id give my right and left leg to not have to cast jolt every 3 1/2 seconds (takes my DPS down to like 45) LOL .. ive seen the tanks change over the years from WAR to half-breeds and now im guessin back again.. as i see it WARs should be king of the hill when it comes to aggro in most situations! seeing all they CAN do is wack wack wack..  Pallys/SKs will still have there place of course.. just now a warrior can actually do something..<br />
<br />
now i wanted to know is there gonna be any changes to the RNG class.. we have some STA buffs that really help.. and im guessin those are gone :/ .. so now do we get to go watch dancers someplace like in SWG? id love to see some hotties in towns struttin there stuff :P LOL.. ok im a lil lost on the whole STA thing plz post more on it so it gets thru my thick skull THX!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">B_Delacroix</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a paladin and built up my reputation over the last four years.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact that I am useful for more than just undead.  Our guild tried to follow the &quot;guidlines&quot; people set out for doing mobs.  We end up doing things our own way, though.  In so doing, rather than being a cookie cutout of a paladin, I am very versatile.<br />
<br />
What I am trying to say is, this change should make warriors happy and stop them from feeling sorry for themselves in the middle of an encounter.  Yes, I have run into warriors that were so stuck on their inadequacies that they failed to use what they did have.  It bugs me to see people do that.<br />
<br />
On the other side of things, we can hopefully work with the warriors rather than have to hold back.  When we get adds in an encounter or the MT happens to go down because of some mistiming of heals, we or another tank can step in.<br />
<br />
Before we had the warriors we have in our guild, I was the MT.  I did it very well.  Sure I didn't have defensive, but I used the tools I had at hand to do the job required.  The way I see it, paladins and warriors will be interchangeable each with a different benefit to give but neither one limited in what encounters they will be asked to help on.  Except by the min-maxers, but they will be looking for the perfect group long after you and I and our friends have finished the encounter using what we have rather than what we wish we had.<br />
<br />
Now, if I'm wrong and we are pushed back to the usefulness of the kunark days, then I'll join you.</div></div><hr />
