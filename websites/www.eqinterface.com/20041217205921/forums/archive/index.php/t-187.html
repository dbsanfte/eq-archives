So while I am learning, I am asking some of you &quot;professionals&quot; out there to help me create a Player Window to my liking.<br />
<br />
I used to play MUDs way-back-when and they never showed XP or whatever in gauges. I like the idea of having XP displayed in % without a guage. =)<br />
<br />
Anyway..<br />
<br />
Could someone PLEASE help me create something like this:<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
| Saibyn Etherealfist <br />
| 1542 / 1542 HP      <br />
| l==Hp Gauge==l     <br />
| l==Sta Gauge==l    <br />
| XP: %      AAXP: %<br />

<br />
The name is always set up as first line first name second line second name and ther is not a damn thing we seem to be able to do to change it.<br />
<br />
Other than that it would be very easy to complete something like this.</div></div><hr />

For example, if someone where to make this exactly like you wanted and just wrote something like &quot;Put Name Here&quot; in text where your name would be, then everyone that downloaded the xml file could open it and look for &quot;Put Name Here&quot; and delete that text and put their name in, however they want to see it. Then it would show it like that in the UI.</div></div><hr />

That is the one that I used and got the idea from =) But if anyone could remove the HP from the middle of the bar and make it seperate (show it as Current HP / Max HP) above the HP bar, that would be cool. This is because when the numbers are in the middle of the fekkin bar, it's hard to guesstimate how much HP I have, and since my Max HP isnt in the guage too, it's even harder =\<br />
<br />
*EDIT* By the way, Nijk. I like your idea =) Really cool</div></div><hr />
