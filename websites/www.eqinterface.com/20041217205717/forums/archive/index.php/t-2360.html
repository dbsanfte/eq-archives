VERY IMPORTANT NOTE<br />
W32.Nimda.A@mm has been detected on your computer. This means that it is<br />
possible that your system has been accessed remotely by an unauthorized user.<br />
For this reason it is impossible to guarantee the integrity of a system<br />
that has had such an infection. The remote user could have made<br />
changes to your system, including but not limited to the following:<br />
Stealing or changing passwords or password files<br />
Installing remote-connectivity host software, also known as backdoors<br />
Installing keystroke logging software<br />
Configuring of firewall rules<br />
Stealing of credit card numbers, banking information, personal data, etc.<br />
Deletion or modification of files<br />
Sending of inappropriate or even incriminating material from<br />
customer's email account<br />
Modifying access rights on user accounts or files<br />
Deleting information from log files to hide such activities.<br />
For this reason, if you need to be certain that your organization is <br />
secure, you must reinstall your operating system, and restore from a backup<br />
made before the infection took place, change all passwords in your<br />
organization that may have been on this machine or accessible from it.<br />
This is the only way to ensure that your systems are safe. For more<br />
information regarding security in your organization, contact your<br />
system administrator</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you get that from a zipfile you downloaded here? If so witch one I would like to delete it asap?<br />
<br />
Onlything that should be inside the zipfiles are  *.xml *.txt *.tga *.gif *.jpg *.png witch cant be infected with virus's. Looks like the one you had some dll's and other naughty things.<br />
<br />
With those eml files it looks like you got it from an email though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">meior</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes i got it from here,  I know i did not get it from email as i do not have email configured on this computer read all mail from a computer at work and i never open any attachments.<br />
<br />
As for the name of the file I wish i could tell you what one it was but i have download so many.<br />
<br />
I blame no one but myself well maybe symantec as it was not detected when being unziped</div></div><hr />
