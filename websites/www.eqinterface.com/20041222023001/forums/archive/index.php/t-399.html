<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melosa</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly don't know if this can be done or not, so please forgive my idiocy (at least this time ;) ). Some of my friends and I were discussing the placing of all of our nifty new boxes and what not, and one thing that always seemed out of place or in the way was the window selection box. I've seen this moved all over the place, and what I was wondering is whether or not this can be made into a vertical format, or even into a small box format so that it doesn't take up space. The vertical would fit nicely next to a lot of the spell gem formats; a small box might fit into one of those little corner spots that always seem to be left over. Just a thought however, especially since I'm not even sure any of this can be done. <br />

Thanks tons for all of these posts and this board, btw. As one who is clueless, I can say I really appreciate all of the help from those who know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Temaculim</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I've done is I grabbed the &quot;slim&quot; menubar, and set the Normal Transparency to 75% (or 100, your choice) and then put the Faded Transparency to 0%.  So when you're not hovering over the bar, it disappears.  Just move your cursor to where it was, and it reappears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I do since I got used to doing that with the velious interface. I don't need no stinkin window selector!</div></div><hr />

What I did was took the Vertical Window Selector from here:<br />

It is in the &quot;Infectar's Window Set&quot; image #1.  I hope this helps.<br />
