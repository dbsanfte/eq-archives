Just yesterday they were having lag issues making our site very slow. I don’t have much of the details as of yet but I will post them as I get them.<br />
<br />
EQInterface apologizes for the inconvenience this causes every one. To say the least I can tell you I am very frustrated at the moment. Although our current datacenter has proven in the past to have a very stable network we are looking into moving our servers to a new datacenter if any more down time occurs. <br />
<br />
We do understand when working with any computer hardware downtime will happen as failures will occur. Normally they don’t all happen in the same week or month. To put things in perspective the network we are on still has had 99.3% uptime this month and 99.9% in the past months.</div></div><hr />
