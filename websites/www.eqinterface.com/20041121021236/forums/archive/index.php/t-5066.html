<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so we all know that Statix Method of referring extra animations/templates etc far exceeds the old school break-everytime-sony-patches method, but I need to know, Is there an advantage to placing the textures/animations in a separate file as opposed to inline with the actual mod?<br />
<br />
I haven't noticed much lag difference coding templates and animations in a separate file or inline on some of my others.  It seems that the advantage would be that no matter what file anyone would want to use, the inline method always guarantees that the file is complete and can't be broken by other updates to an outside file like extra animations.xml.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?  Does the extratemplates/extraanimations option cut down on memory overhead/lag or is it simply a 'best practices' type of thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its more of a best practices - however, a few mods require using the &quot;old-school&quot; method of editing within file itself - depends on the particular mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, what we really are getting to here, is that if Sony releases a new ' updated version' of a currently existing window and it has new required aspects, then it's going to break our in-line coding or statix method anyway.<br />
<br />
But in the long run it may be easier to mod up the outside definition files, rather than going through each mod to update individuals?</div></div><hr />
