<br />
However, I would like an explanation of how to freeze windows in certain places, while playing with this.  I am not loading a whole skin set like Quartz, rather I am using things like compact spellbooks, altered spell icons, pet windows and the like.  <br />
<br />
I keep all this in a folder called &quot;newui&quot; which originally was a copy of the &quot;default&quot; folder.  The problem I have is evertime I reload the &quot;newui&quot; skin all the windows are back in default VI positions and I have to redo alpha levels and background tints. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to set these items permanently?</div></div><hr />

Its really annoying that I can't change mods without having to retint and move all the windows around.</div></div><hr />

The formula used for those numbers is also staggeringly complex/convoluted.  It's explained somewhere on this board... Has something to do with the first 320 equals up to the first half of the screen (scaled to a 640x480) but for some reason past the halfway point, it then goes to a one greater is one pixel further system.  I.E. Although 320 X coordinate is 512 pixels across a 1024x768, 370 X is 562 across.  Weird-o, and also makes it about impossible to hard code good positions in the XML.</div></div><hr />
