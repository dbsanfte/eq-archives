I'll be using this for one or more of my toons.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oops, forgot suggestions.  I'm a monk as a main, and if you release a melee only version (without casting stuff), could you make the Current HP/Maximum HP a bigger font and/or bold.<br />
Also, add the current/maximum weight.  In between your levle and class, put a little space.  That's about all I would change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">12-29-2002, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok Aedily here's a player window with the things you asked for.<br />
<br />
I added current weight (WT) next to STR (max weight), put a space between class and level and made the hits/maxhits BIGGER  :D<br />
<br />
I like the looks. I will add it to v1.1 of the mod when the bard buff box comes out, but you can D/L here for now. Just unzip it to the Oldschool directory.<br />
<br />
Edit: Removed attachment.. It's now an included feature of the mod!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">12-29-2002, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I started, I was trying to recreate the old UI. That turned out to be a technical nightmare.  So, I scrapped my work.  I restarted from scratch and kept the old UI in mind.  I didn't set out to make it exactly like the old UI.  I just wanted it to resemble it.<br />
<br />
In the beginning the marble color was blue.  I decided to change it grey so that ppl can change the windows to any color by right clicking them and playing with the rgb tint values.  (even though every thing won't change color;  It still looks semi-ok because,  grey matches everything) Plus, I like grey. It's easy on the eyes. The only black backgrounds are the titlebars.  The chat windows can be lightened by raising the tint values from 127.  <br />
<br />
I know it can look a lot nicer.  I'm not the most artistic guy around.<br />

Isn't so much technical as it is artistic though. You could just replace the right art files and pack them into the set. Hell i'd prolly do it myself but i can't draw worth squat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lutz</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since those &lt;insert bad word here&gt; disabled the old UI and in my opinion it was the best, this interface at least allows me to play EQ without wanting to go kill everything in sight.  It would be nicer, however, if the chat window texture resembled that of the old UI.<br />
<br />
I also wonder why all of your stats need to be displayed at all times on the top right... some people too lazy to use the inventory button I guess...<br />
<br />
Can't be perfect though I suppose... good job overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">01-15-2003, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks...  Now for the reasons I did things the way I did :D<br />
<br />
Chat Windows:<br />
If I used the original graphic..  I would have to set it up as a &quot;static animation&quot; and display it on the chat window.. But, I think,  the window would have to be set to unsizeable. I'm not sure if a static animation can be resized in game.. Otherwise, I don't think it would be static.. Not to mention if it did resize it would look horrible!!<br />
<br />
If someone wanted to open more chat windows (nice for sorting info ingame and chat channels): They wouldn't be able to resize them and make it fit in.. <br />
<br />
Player Info Window: (this one's easier to explain)<br />
A.)All that info is on Mafoos player info mod. The most downloaded player info window on this site :)<br />
B.)It's player info :p<br />
C.)I'm one of those lazy people ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chiasma</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great work, Tal. This UI is close to what I need, I think. I wondered though if you had ever been asked to do the following (or even can):<br />
<br />
a) Move (or make the window moveable) the spell icon window to the right side (below the buff icons perhaps)<br />
b) Make the spell icons replaceable with the ones with labels (either with icon and label as most mods are, or, just the labels - found one like that though each spell icon is huge)<br />
<br />
Because I am right handed and I cast spells using my mouse, it is better ergnomically for me to have the spells nearer the bottom right corner. Buffs can be on the left side, or even along the top. That was really my only major argument with the old hardcoded window UI, and really the only thing I need changed to be able to actually play again. I have experimented with many UIs and mods now - and none is doing it for me.  At the present time, due to not having a UI that is workable for me, my 'playing time' is limited to about half an hour every few days when I go online to say hi to my guild and try out another two or three UIs.  I tried once to play and I killed my whole group due to not being able to find anything or click on it fast enough. <br />
<br />
I like to play in 800 x 600, but, I might be able to play in higher res if I have a clean, bordered window UI like this one. <br />
<br />
Thanks very much for all your hard work.<br />
Chiasma</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure you can move the spell gems.. It's actually quite easy:<br />
1. Right click the gem window and a popup menu will appear<br />
2. Click Lock<br />
3. Move Gems<br />
4. Repeat 1 and 2 to relock it<br />
<br />
For a spell gem window with names there are quite a few available for download that you can copy to your oldschool folder and use:<br />
<br />
Mafoo's:<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=114<br />
<br />
Chronwaas':<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1059<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1058<br />
<br />
Plus many others here in the spellgems download section:<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?catid=19<br />
<br />
But, If you choose another one from there make sure it doesn't contain a EQUI_Animations.xml or it will mess up the skin.. The 3 I listed don't contain a EQUI_Animations.xml :)<br />
<br />
Moving the buffs window around is a little tougher but they can be put anywhere too.. To do that:<br />
1. Type /loadskin default 1<br />
2. Unlock the window by right clicking the titlebar<br />
3. Move and/or shape. <br />
4. Relock the window<br />
5. Reload oldschool skin by typing /loadskin oldschool_purple 1 (for the purple one) or /loadskin oldschool_grey 1 (for the grey one)</div></div><hr />

I almost quit the game when they disabled the old ui.  I always played it in small screen mainly because my eyesight isn't the greatest and I just couldn't read the type and the large screen hurt my eyes.<br />
<br />
I play in 800x 600 reso.,  and my viewport is set at 120, 1, 550, 400.  A couple skins overlap, but it doesn't bother me.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to say THANKS heheh.</div></div><hr />

Is this cureable at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chiasma</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Talyns knows he is MY hero too. He made the game playable for me as well. He is a magician par excellente and I cannot say enough about how generous with his time and talent he has been. /bow /kneel<br />
<br />
Maxxius - Perhaps you need to ask Talyns for a look at the skin he created for me for much the same reasons you listed. I took the Oldschool_purple UI and loaded it in 800 x 600 and played with it, deleting some stuff and adding other components till I had a concept (which I could work with if I had had to get used to it but there were overlaps and it framed the window in a messy fashion, and I still had the 'text too small' issue with any text not in the chat windows).  I don't know what kind of character you are playing but if it is a caster, you might like the UI Talyns created for me from my concept.  <br />
<br />
I posted my UI on a quickly made homepage - if you want to look at how I have it set up now see the URL at the bottom of this page. It's not a great image but you can get the jist of it I hope. <br />
<br />
Using my version of the oldschool UI, I didn't have the shifting problem after the patch yesterday by the way - though I heard a lot of people in my guild did with the UIs they are using - everything from the default to complex custom ones. <br />
<br />
Talyns - Thanks so much again. Your work was brilliant. :)<br />

Talyns one problem I am still having now is that whenever I zone some of my skins keep moving out of place even tho they are locked.  I gave you my reso and viewport setting above.<br />
<br />
Is this cureable at all?  <br />
<br />
This was a disease that SOE transmitted.. I believe it was cured  today.. Let me know..<br />
<br />
Also, take a look at the pic on Chiasma's page.. That mod is good for casters and will be released soon.. I want to get a Grey version working, too, before I do...<br />
<br />
If you're a melee let me know what you think should go in the right corner..  I was thinking move the hotkeys over and make the chatwindow bigger..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxxius</div><div class="date">02-08-2003, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chiasma your set up wouldn't work well for me as a ranger.  I do like the inventory skin set up in Talyn's ui.<br />
<br />
And today they finally fixed the shifting problem so I am happy hehe.<br />
<br />
And Talyn's your set up is almost perfect for me.  Because I went 800x600 reso I do lose about an inch or two off my left screen, and I have to overlap the menu skin under my chat window (as well as the pet command for when I play my druid), but I just don't have the room otherwise.  In 1024 reso I had no problem but the type was too small for me to read.<br />
<br />
Also when I am over like 12 buffs, the remaining ones keep going down the screen behind my chat window.  I don't know how to make the buffs double column instead of single column.<br />
<br />
But all in all I can live with it, I get the benefit I had in old ui, plus the added bonus's of the new ui.<br />
<br />
P.S.  what I like about the inventory skin is that it makes it easy for me to swap out items fast.  As a ranger I tend to swap out weapons alot.<br />
<br />
P.P.S., Chiasma what reso and viewpoint are you using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">02-08-2003, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chiasma's is 800x600 with a viewport of 556x417..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chiasma</div><div class="date">02-08-2003, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maxxius - <br />
<br />
I use this modified oldschool UI that Talyns made for me for both my cleric and my druid, just fyi, but, I understand what you are saying about the inventory swapping. I never switch weapons so that was not an issue for me. <br />
<br />
I play in 800 x 600 - see above for Talyns reply about the size (I(didn't know). He set it for me when he cleaned up my mess from using a 1028 x 768 UI (the oldschool one) in 800 x 600 res.  He increased the text and guage sizes for me because I could not read/target them either, in a hurry anyway. He simplified everything for me according to my needs and desires. I know it looks a bit different now - but it really is based on the Oldschool interface in 800 x 600. I changed the spell icons out for Mafoo's set (but those got modified too in the end by chopping off the numbers on the side) because I don't find the icons very intuitive and needed the labels. <br />
<br />
In order to change the width of the effects window (and most other windows in the oldschool UI) by the way - you need to load the default UI, change it there and then reload your custom skin. It will be changed when you do that. <br />
<br />
You can change your viewport yourself to any size you like. I did that a number of times while trying to fit in the pieces before I finally gave up and begged Talyns (a way too kind soul) to help me.<br />
<br />
Good luck, Maxxius. I hope you get everything working so you like it - that is what is important.</div></div><hr />

This is not possible.  The EQ Servers don't send the information needed to the client. <br />

I do have one small thing I would like to do to customize this for myself but have no idea where to start.<br />
Instead of having the marble colored background on everything, is there anyway I could make this a solid color, and make the color lighter..<br />
TKing has a few backgrounds on the everquestlive website that I was able to down load into other UI's ive had before and it changes the look of the whole thing, when i did this with this one, It just changed inside chatboxes and inside other small areas.<br />
Thanks for any help you or anyone can give on how to customize this or if its possible :)<br />

Each of the main windows around the viewport has it's own background... They are named AW_Back.tga, HB_Back.tga, PW_Back, Etc.. <br />

Did you have a color or texture in mind.. I can probably skin it for ya later tonight...</div></div><hr />

You dont have to do this if you dont want..but if you are capable easily then these are the choices I wanted to try (if you wanted to pick just one that is more than fine)...<br />
1) a solid color black<br />
2) a wood texture instead of marble (like the one tking had on everquestlive site<br />
3) not sure if this texture is posted anywhere..but drakahs metallic look on it seems though it would look nice<br />

Solid Black?  Black around the viewport (like when you hit F10) with the labels, buttons, gauges floating there?<br />

<br />
First anyway you can make it so background color option is enabled again?  I picked the green one, but I would like to be able to change the skin colors in game.  Your old UI allowed this, you new ones don't.<br />
<br />
Second, and I don't know if you can help.  But the other day all of a sudden when I picked up something on my mouse pointer it was invisible.  The item is there, you just don't see it.  If you place it in the inventory slots it appears, but then goes invisibile if you carry over the viewscreen.  People been saying maybe it is the UI I am using, but it only happens on one character, I have no problem with my other characters.</div></div><hr />

Yea I lost that feature in version 2..  I was gonna put it back in to version 3 but that evolved to my Tablets UI..  Maybe, when I make version 3 I will get that back in there..(don't know when this will be.)  <br />
<br />
Second.. I've never experienced this..  If it keeps happening I would suggest to reinstall a clean copy of OldSchool_2_1 from the download section..</div></div><hr />

If you're talking about the tinting feature.. I removed it in version 2.. It only works on 3/4 of the windows.. none of the main windows can be tinited(Compass, Group, Player, HB, etc).. I will try and fix this when I can.. It is sorta a major fix and at the moment I have very little spare time and am working on the next version of My Tablets UI.. I have quite a bit left to do with that one..<br />
<br />
After I get done with that I will do a newer version of this UI.. But, I will look at it and see if maybe I can fix it with a patch :)<br />
<br />
For now All I can suggest is using the purple version in the download section..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have one problem though.  I'm not sure if it's the UI or not, but maybe you can help me anyways.<br />
<br />
I've been getting this problem where when I open a new window, like an options window or opening a bag, or when I click on an item to put it on my cursor or to click it to get it off the cursor, I get a 1/2 second pause on the game.  It gets quite annoying and I would love to fix it, the guide I talked to didn't know anything about it so I didn't get any help there.  <br />
<br />
It also sometimes gives me trouble when I'm moving my character where it will just stop sometimes, but maybe that problem has to do with having a cordless keyboard (bleh).<br />
<br />
If you could help I'd greatly appreciate it! And once again I love the UI!  I'm a monk using the Wood format =)  Thanks!<br />

Your computer is running slow (having to think/load data/etc.). This happens when you open a window because it has to think to show the window. I suspect you have your settings too high for your computer to handle well.<br />

<br />
The first question:<br />
Yes enok is right... That is caused by cpu/video lag...<br />
<br />
Only things I can think of are:<br />
Turning Texture Quality Down..<br />
Turning your clipping plane down..<br />
Only have windows you need open..  <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm curious of what your system is... I ran this on a UI on a 366Mhz(550 MHz overclocked) Celeron 1 w/ 192 mem and geforce 2 w/ clipping plane at 5.. It ran pretty smooth.. But I did notice the pauses every now and then<br />
<br />
Also, Is it only my UI this happens with?<br />
<br />
Second:<br />
I think the stoping is your keyboard..  Maybe replace the batteries..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also the  buttons are semi transparent .. so changing the background to certain colors will look really awful..<br />
<br />
I will start working on the rewrite but have very limited free time right now.. In fact in the last week I've been home only for about 6 hours a night.. I have to use this time to sleep!!  <br />

I have one request though.  Is it possible to place a Percentage ( like the ones for group members and myself ) for the pet window when you have a pet? ( I know I'm a monk, but I have other characters too haha )<br />
<br />
If you could add that easily that'd be great.. if not no problem heh.. just an idea. =)<br />

It works for me.. So, I don't really know what could have happened..<br />
<br />
The only things I can think of..<br />
1. Make sure the window is open (CTRL-E)<br />
2. You might of shrunk it some how to the point where the icons won't appear.. <br />
To fix this,  before you enter the world recopy the UI_Oldschool_##.ini to your ui_charecter_##.ini.. Enter and reload the UI(w/ Use INI Depressed).. Everthing should be in place and the right size..<br />
<br />
Or, You can load the default UI (w/ Use INI Depressed)and resize it then reload oldschool ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excellent job, one thing and im sure you know already but to be honest i didnt read every post to make sure noones said it but..id like to see Shared bank slot, i wouldnt reccommend doing it just yet as Shared Platinum is coming soon but when shared plat is available would like to see both made available...(if i need to us shared bank atm i just /loadskin default 1 and use it, then /loadskin oldschool 1 to restore it back lol)<br />
<br />
one other thing id like is the windows are not tintable...i love the wood skin but im a darkwood kinda guy and though ive tinted my inventory, chat, backpacks etc to resemble a dark wood would like to tint the other windows as well, any sugestions on how i can perhaps edit the XML to allow tinting of textures?<br />
<br />
Thanks for a spectacular UI, honestly dont see myself ever switching cause this one suits my needs to a tee, <br />

I will be updating the bank window again probably later today.. Until I release it you can just delete the EQUI_BankWnd.xml and EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml from your oldschool directory..  <br />
<br />
As for the tinting.. Making a UI that is interlocked this way makes tinting hard...  I can make the windows tint but not so they will look right all together.. I will take a crack at this feature again eventually but it's staying that way for now.. <br />
<br />
I wish they would give us a switch in the context menus to tint borders that would fix my main issues with it..<br />

Look at the tablets mod wood look..  (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?<br />

So I saw your patch on your most recent reply to this thread and downloaded that and unzipped.  Then the wood look would load but my actions and hotkeys windows both had bars and screwed up the spacing of my windows.<br />
<br />
Then I was starting to get frustrated and nervous.  So I looked at your original post and it said all those links were up to date with todays patch.  I removed every bit of your UI on my cpu.. then downloaded from scratch.  Now it works!<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!  Great job!<br />

On that note if, the patch doesn't work for any one just do a fresh install like Tegedan.. Don't know what happened there..</div></div><hr />

Was just curious if this UI is going to need any patching done for the LDoN patch (9/9)?  Just wanted to get it done early so i dont have a problem again.  Thanks =)<br />

It has something to do with the compass being wider than the default.. There is really no way to fix it with this UI.. Sorry..<br />

Hopefully SOE will fix it for all of us who use wider compasses :)<br />

i hope u can manage the new pet window, i really wanna check that out<br />
<br />
been using your UI for my mage first, then ALL characters... just have 1 minor problem... my pet heal now does ~36-37% of my pet's HP so i like knowing his HP, and my /pet health hotkey doesnt work when casting (of course)<br />
<br />
just a request: can you get pet HP % in the pet window, like the HP/mana % on the player info? would be a big help to me<br />

<br />
PotatoFarmer:<br />
<br />
1st: I hope I can manage the new pet buffs in this UI.. Dunno how Im gonna do it yet.. <br />
<br />
2nd: There's a patch somewhere in this thread that will do it for the current version.. But I will add it to the main UI downloads since that patch will be obsolete and I don't know why I left it out to begin with :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adding the pet buffs to this UI is a PITA... I'm thinking, I may have to just leave em out but make it error free.. <br />
<br />
Or, take the pet window off the side panel there and make it like the default pet window... Only problem is then you'll have a giant blank spot there and I don't know what to fill in the gap with..<br />
<br />
Would empty marble or wood look ok there?<br />
<br />
I can probably do both and leave it up to the user to decide also..<br />
<br />
Any Ideas as to what to fill it up there with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vectorr Ris</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about leave the pet window where it is but nest the buffs and the pet info/buttons in separate 'pages' like the Actions menu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I decided to put the pet buffs under your buffs..<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=56237 <br />
<br />
<br />
Only problem is only way to turn them off is by closing the pet window..  I included a pet window with no buffs if you don't need them there..<br />
<br />
I also darkened the wood version a bit this time around... <br />
<br />
Check it out here. (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=2133) <br />

Sorry to say it but:<br />
Really I have no plans for this UI besides keeping it updated for the patches..  If anyone wants to mod the graphics or tweak the UI feel free.. :) <br />

I originally created this mod for myself to use.. But I have moved on from it and created Tablets.. (which was originally going to be oldschool 3.0)<br />

Any one who uses this UI should check out Tablets set up with the 1024x768 viewport ini..</div></div><hr />

I've seen the size of the combat abilities window.... and with smaller hotkeys it can be made a little bit smaller. Is there any way that combat abilities can be a tab (like inventory/clickies) with pet commands? I have 4 chat boxes (2 original that came with oldschool Main Chat and Melee/Spells, and 2 100% transparent windows above: Tells and Spam) so i have no more space for windows. It's too bad the window can't be minimized and have it flash when  an ability is available.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope that the new window can be tabbed in (or maybe if it needs to be its own number, when you click on the II in pet window it goes 100% transparent and brings the abilities window to the front, and same for the abilities window when you click I).<br />

Potato Farmer: I wish I could add it to one of the existing windows.. But the way they do it, certain things are hardcoded to the window they belong in.. <br />

If they keep adding windows, I won't know what to do with them anymore.  :)<br />

Love the positioning of everything and the total set up of it all.  <br />
<br />
On my old computer I had no issues installing your UI and using it.  I have since then moved and no longer have access to that computer.  I have downloaded the UI again through the download section and cannot get it to work correctly now on my new computer.  I follow the instructions to the letter, which worked fine on my old computer, but it doesn't work correctly now. <br />
<br />
Any thoughts or ideas?  I really want to use your UI again. :)</div></div><hr />

I have 2 computers and I have your Old School UI on my old one.  It loaded just fine per your instructions and I have enjoyed it for years.  A few months ago I bought a new computer and decided recently to use your UI on my new computer.  I downloaded the zipped file and unzipped it just as your instructions said to.  I followed the directions exactly as I did before and when I hit load skin and it trys to load the Old School, nothing happens.  I don't get an error or anything it just stays on the default UI.  I had no troubles like this on my old computer loading your UI and have reloaded it onto that one several times after wiping and reformatting.  I have done everything exactly as I have on my old computer and it just won't work on my new computer.  I cannot think of anything else to try so figured someone else might suggest something that I couldn't think of.  <br />
<br />
Also was wondering if you will make any changes after GoD comes out to keep your UI compatible with the new expansion?  I hate to lose your UI on my other computer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just had to tell you that I downloaded this mod tonight and tried it out and I LOVE IT! I am using the wood version which I think is great. I always liked the wood look. I remember using the wood skin in Final Fantasy 3 and Chrono Trigger too. Up till now I've been using the long forgotten and rather broken classic UI by FaBBe. I'm so glad though that I can now use all the new features. I'd still love to have it look like the original with parchment style message boxes and such but as far as what I'm looking for... this is 99% perfect. <br />
<br />
You are the greatest and I have to thank you soooo much because this UI will make EQ so much more fun to me. Don't ask me why but having a nice UI makes such a huge difference in how much fun I have. <br />
<br />
If I had one wish though... I'd love to see the parchment chat boxes implemented. Perhaps you could use FaBBes work help make it.... I'm happy with the UI as it is but that would be great.<br />
