Screenshot (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=1502).<br />
Available for download...  Here (http://www.eqinterface.com/list.php?skinnerid=5344).<br />

My goal with this UI was to provide quick access to bags and clickies, display vital information at all times, and yet take up as little screen as possible.  I also wrote a couple of utilities to (hopefully!) make it easy to customize both the Loc and Clickies windows...  All by editting simple TXT files.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />

Overview of features:<br />
<br />
1. Bank - Now modified to have two columns of eight slots rather than the default four by four with wasted space inbetween.<br />
2. Buffs - Now includes numbers for each buff slot, allowing assessment of slots avaiable at a quick glance. Actual name of buff also displayed.<br />
3. Clickies - Turned the unused (by KeizUI4) EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml file into a window for right-click items. Fully customizable through the use of the KeizRCW utility.<br />
4. *Compass - Now includes directional indicators for /loc: increasing when green, decreasing when red.<br />
5. Container - Now includes Primary/Secondary weapon and certain inventory/armor slots for easy instrument/weapon swapping and right clicking. I am soo spoiled by this!<br />
6. Hot Buttons - Now includes Primary/Secondary, and all eight inventory slots. This allows for easy instrument/weapon swapping as well as quick access to your bags.<br />
7. Inventory - Now more like the classic inventory. Charm slot, face-pick button, and armor dye button also now included.<br />
8. Loc - Built a loc referance guide into the Feedback window (also works in Help window). Fully customizable through the use of the KeizLoc2 utility.<br />
9. Songs - Same changes as for the Buffs window.<br />
10. *Spell Book - Now using the t.King Elven spell book.<br />
11. Target - Now includes the spell casting-time bar and target health percent. Also flashes with Autoattack engaged.<br />
12. *Tracking - Has now been stripped of Ranger-only features, for use by Bards and Druids. Rangers may delete the EQUI_TrackingWnd.xml file to retain full functionality.<br />
13. Vitals - Now includes both the Player and Group information. The game thinks this is the Group window. I did this to allow me to use the Player window as the Target window so it would flash with Autoattack. This also freed up the Target window so I could turn it into the Clickies window.<br />
<br />
*Please note that I did not code the Compass, Spell Book, or Tracking Windows.</div></div><hr />
