<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kommon_Xev</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to load a custom UI file (EQUI_Playerwindow) wich has percent's numbers for hp/mana/stam and percent for XP/AA all in one area. My problem is I cant seem to loadskin any UI file I try. Here is what I do: I make a copy of default skin, name it something short. I then unzip the UI file I want into that one and proceed to log into Everquest. I type /Loadskin custom (what I named it) and it then freezes for a split second, then returns the Default skin settings, as if I were to make a new character. I have talked to many friends that have done it. I dont see what I'm doing wrong, if anything at all. Is there something I am missing..? Please help, post step by step what to do Please. Dont leave out anything No matter how un-important it may seem to you, I am an idiot with this stuff. Thank yu in advacefor your help :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
First... one thing most people do, is go into your eqclient file (a configuration file) in your EQ directory.  It's split into sections, the first being [Defaults] at the bottom of that list, you should have NewUI=True... under that is UISkin=default.  Change the default to &quot;custom&quot; (the name of your skin).  Then try again.  (Tip: when you do it, do /loadskin custom 1 to keep your window-settings... unless you're just going to move them all around after you load anyway :) )<br />
<br />
Second... when you do /loadskin and it jumps back to the default, do you get a message &quot;could not load custom, trying to load default&quot; or some such?  Even if you don't, check this file... Also in your EQ directory is a text document named UIErrors.  Open that up and see what it says.  It should list all of the errors that occurred during your last EQ session, but will over-write any previous session errors.  Even if the file is gibberish to you, you may notice something that seems wrong - and someone else may know what it is.  It may be something as simple as two different items on your screen have the same label and one needs to be renamed within the EQUI file (I had that problem yesterday... hehe).<br />
<br />
Anyhow - hoped most of that made sense to you &amp; can help.  Gluck and lemme know what ya find out.<br />

Check your main chat window after you attempt to /load. If there's a message, check UIErrors.txt in your Everquest directory.<br />
<br />
Also, I noticed this sentence:<br />

<br />
<br />
I assume you mean you made a copy of the default skin directory and its contents. If this is the case, as far as I know, it is unnecessary, and possibly harmful.<br />
<br />
First, if you don't modify one of the files, you don't have to have it in your 'custom' directory. Everquest will look in the default directory for any files it cannot find. Leaving the copy out will help you if that (unmodified) file gets changed in a subsequent patch.<br />
<br />
Second, ... did you copy the Everquest/skins/default directory, or the Everquest/uifiles/default directory?  You should be placing the new directory under Everquest/uifiles.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
