<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Molz</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure what is going on.  Today I logged on another char on the same account and computer that uses the EXACT same UI  as my main.  The 3D target ring was not the same it was some funky fire looking thing.  I logged on another char from a different account on to the same computer and got the same funky 3D target ring.  I reloaded the UI, same funky ring, I relogged all the way out and came back in, same funky ring. <br />
<br />
On my main char I am using the pinwheel 3D target ring and love it.  So why am I getting a different ring showing up when I log on any other char?  Everything else from my custom UI is loading exactly the same except for the 3D target ring.  It's the only ring I have dl'd btw, besides copying the default files over in the beginning.  I have no clue where this other ring is even coming from.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes...you can have different rings for different cons.  Just have to have multiple .tga files (one for each con) and then edit the .ini file with the correct names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 3D Target Ring only lods once when you first log in, and if you load any other skin afterwards it stays the same.<br />
<br />
You have to log out completely to change it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The statement about the target ring only loading once isn't totally true...If you are in game and have a target ring, but you want a different ring, you can make it change while in game.  Here is the sequence that would be followed:<br />
<br />
1.  You're in game and have UI1 loaded and running...it has TargetRing1 loaded and you see that in game<br />
<br />
2.  You want to load UI2 that has a different target ring (TargetRing2) ... do the following command to change interface: /loadskin &lt;UI2&gt; 1<br />
<br />
3.  The interface has now changed, but the target ring is still the same!!!  Now you have to type in the following command (this needs to be typed in... clicking the button will not work!):  /indicator off<br />
<br />
4. You will lose your target ring until you type in the following command:  /indicator on<br />
<br />
5.  Target something and your new target ring should be visible!<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 2 above is not actually needed.  If you are in game and have a target ring loaded, then actually change the TargetIndicator.tga file that is located in your current UI folder, you can skip to step 3 without doing step 2.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I just went in game and verified the above information to be true.  This should work.  If it doesn't, then there is something else wrong with the indicator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Molz</div><div class="date">11-27-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the problem is I only use ONE custom UI, that is it.  I have only downloaded ONE 3d custome target ring.   Where in the hell is this other target ring coming from?  It isn't the boring default one, its some funky fire looking thing.  It is only popping up on my other chars  I log on this computer, not my main char I play every day on the same computer.</div></div><hr />
