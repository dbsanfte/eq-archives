<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eqinterface.com/images/sections/network.gif&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;The Network EQInterface is on has become the target of another multi-hundred megabit  DOS attack. I say “another” because the same thing happened very late at night a couple days ago. To clarify we are not under a DOS attack but the network we are on that provides our server with bandwidth along with thousands of others is under attack. <br />
<br />
 There is atleast 800MBPS of inbound traffic attacking us, probably more, as that is the capacity our transport lines can physically carry currently. Whoever is doing this has access to a ton of bandwidth, and due to the limited number of people with access to such, we hope to track these individual(s) down. We are going to legally pursue them, and make an example of them to the public of what will be done to such offenders. The fact that individual(s) would do such a thing, and cause damage to over 200,000 end-users, is just plain disgusting.<br />
<br />
I’m sure there will be connectivity issues through out Today. I know it couldn’t have happened on a worse day with last nights patch.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the Inconvenience and the site will return to normal once the attacker stops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archfeld</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">not that hard to heist for a short period of time....given the nature of Versign's database and the number of abandoned networks out there, if you know the right info Northpoint's backbone is still running. Hope they catch the SoB's regardless, DoS'n the MAN is one thing, not that I approve or participate mind you, but burying general users is another totally. Ya gotta wonder what the real purpose was, and if they succeeded under the cover of all the DoS....Wonder who else is hosted by your provider, and who is or was trojan'd, 0wn3d to provide the front...<br />
Best of luck and thanks for all the good stuff you guys have put up :)</div></div><hr />
