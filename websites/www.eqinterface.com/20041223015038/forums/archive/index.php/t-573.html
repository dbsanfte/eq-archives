<br />
Love the work people have been doing to the UI, some really great stuff.<br />
<br />
Some things I want but haven't found. :nana: <br />
<br />
1) As a bard I don't use a pet, but I do use melee/instrument switching.  Turn the pet window into a six slot box with the top two as Primary, Secondary, The next four below as the top four slots of the Inv.  I've seen similar but not that exact.  And if it could be made small, that would rock.<br />
<br />
2) Small hot buttons. Preferably same size as #1. =)<br />
<br />
3) Small buff Icons.  I see people with nice small icons, but they have that damn name tag attached.  I don't need to see the names of the icons.  /shrug<br />
<br />
4) If it possible, Fit all 8 spell gems into a square window, the same width as the hotbutton and pet window, in a fashion similar to the keypad on your keyboard.  With &quot;9&quot; being spell book or something. /shrug  <br />
<br />
5, 6, 7) These I can find else where, but I'll list em. No invite/devite buttons on the group bar (With percentages on all the group members names), Smaller spellbook, and old style inv screen (preferably smaller).<br />
<br />
:nana: :nana: :nana: <br />
That is such a cool emote:nana: <br />
<br />
I don't expect anyone to hop out of thier chair to put these together.  But if someone sees one. please post a link. :nana: <br />
<br />
