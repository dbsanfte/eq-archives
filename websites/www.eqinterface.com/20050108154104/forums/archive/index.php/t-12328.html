<br />
I've seen other people have asked this before, but no one had any specific instructions on how to try this myself.<br />
<br />
I use a Heavily modified Compton UI.  Some of which I have modded myself, other parts in which I have just grab bits and pieces from other UI's or standalone pieces from the Download section.<br />
<br />
In the Compton UI the original maker turned the Pet window into a giant stone bar that is used to separate some of the screen and makes it look a little better.  However I would like to be able to reclaim the pet window, but still retain the stone bar for its looks.<br />
<br />
Is there a way in which I can meld the Target window and the stone bar together so that the target window would have the bar attached to it's top, and I can reclaim the pet window for a pet?<br />
<br />
I have some limited programming skill.....but I currently don't have the time to mess around and try 600 different attempts to get this to work.  So if anyone could help me out with this it would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Here is the Screenshot of the Compton UI (http://www.moresoda.com/eq/ui/compton/current.jpg) for reference of what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
So I shall ask something else....I've been trying to make my Compass window into the bar recently yet every single combination of things that I try either results in a Blank Bar of the right size but without a compass on it, or EQ crashes while loading up a character that uses the UI.<br />
<br />
So....my replacement favor would be could anyone either Make me a bar using the stone graphics that was in the Compton UI, or help me figure out what the heck I am doing wrong with coding these damn things.<br />
<br />
If anyone just wants to make the thing here are some specs for the bar:<br />
<br />
Must be 1280 by 26<br />
If possible have the same graphics for the compass as was in compton.<br />
Use the stone graphic or something similar that looks good with the rest of the UI.<br />
and that's pretty much it.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any help in this matter....<br />

SOE has the compass hardcoded to always start at 0,0 of the window.<br />
<br />
Do you use your selector?  I converted it to fit this role, and have this look.  The buttons are all still useable, but invisible until hovered over.  At least that is the theory.<br />
<br />
I have not tested this in game.  Let me know if it gives any problems and I will load it up and debug.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for taking the time to do this.....I really appreciate it.<br />
