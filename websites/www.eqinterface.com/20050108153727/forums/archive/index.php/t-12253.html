I'm closing in on end game, playing as much as I can, when time allows (usually when the soon to be ex p1$$3$ me off) or really late at night PST when no one is around, or all groups have already been established.<br />
<br />
Being a 64 Shaman I don't get to fear kite, or snare kite... so I have to Root DoT... what zone is best for that type of soloing? i.e. a zone where the mobs are DB that won't resist root too often... I've tried in PoV against the Frogs and even if I've slowed them they chew through my armor and hps like a hot knife through butter<br />
<br />
Haven't tried Dillos Camp yet in PoStorms... anyhow... any suggestions??<br />
<br />
Or.. if you are on Zeb server late and night and looking for a shaman for your group/adventure drop Sthikik a tell if I can get into the zone I'll come running.</div></div><hr />

But make sure to watch out for their poison, and it drains your life QUICKLY. I have a few strats for fighting rats out front of Freeport, but its rather drawn out and am currently working on a book titled &quot;PL'in your 60th + lvl shammi in North FP&quot; which should be out later this month, and do not want to give out to much as of now.<br />
<br />
but for a tip to get you going, when fighting the rats, stay at a distance, and if you have a high lvl enchanter friend, they can mez ANOTHER rat and make it fight the one you are. great exp here, but don't let this out..<br />
