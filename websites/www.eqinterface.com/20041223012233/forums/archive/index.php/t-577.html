<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ryan</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, just found the wonderful world of the UI skin and downloaded Barshs' &quot;Caster&quot; skin. This skin has everything I want. Most importantly being the name of the spell that has been cast on you. Now, my question is this.<br />
<br />
How do you add the pet window to this skin?<br />
<br />
I have tried Alt F1, and it seems as if it were taken completely out of it. Where would I look to see if he hard coded the UI to NOT allow the pet window?<br />
<br />
Or more over, how to I get the pet windows with this skin?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
Will</div></div><hr />

We're not allowed to add new windows, so we need to take over one of the existing windows if we want to do something.<br />
<br />
Personally, I used the friends window first but would use the pet window next if I need another window to cannibalize.<br />

<br />
Do you have a screen shot of the UI? Most likely we can tell from looking at it if he did or not.</div></div><hr />

Go into the petwindow.xml file, scroll to the bottom and make sure both LOCATION coordinates are NOT negative. Also make sure both SIZE coordinates are NOT 0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ryan</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all.<br />
<br />
The SIZE was in fact set to 0-0<br />
<br />
I set it to the default settings and POOF there it was.<br />
<br />
You guys rule.<br />
