King and Remelio have done some amazing work on the spell books and spell gems, Both have agreed to make a home here at EQInterface.com as a Featured Artists. You will see their work here in the next few days as they post it, and expect to see new stuff here first :D<br />

What you have seen with my recent artwork for EverQuest's new user interface, is a glimpse of things to come, I plan to give EverQuest's user interface the roleplay/fantasy world look-and-feel overhaul that it so desperately needs, my mods of the the user interface will not be modern looking, with sleek high-tech buttons, windowsesque guages and circuit board background textures, to me those detach a person from the &quot;immersion factor&quot; of a roleplay/fantasy world of dragons, swords, and sorcery, my goal is to tie the interface and world together better, to this artist -- form and functionality go hand-in-hand, just think along the lines of tolkienesque -- and we'll be on the same page, expect very elaborate t.king artwork, and fantastic mods by  Remelio, assuming  Remelio and I can manage to scrape up enough sparetime to do it all.<br />

Welcome To EQInterface.com T. King we all look forward to your work!<br />
<br />
<br />
Its been a pleasure working with t.king recently re-doing his spell books and working on making his spell bar ideas come to life.  Hopefully together we can bring everyone some excelent interfaces.  I myself prefer a mixture of style and functionality.  While some of my mods might not be the most compact out there, they still get the job done while looking good ;)<br />
