<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">infinity9</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been wanting to make a ui I can use during patch days that shouldn't break very easy.  Also for a friend that wouldn't use a ui unless it didn't break really.  Of course they can always change anything at will and break our ui's but this should avoid most problems.<br />
<br />
One note - TT inventory included but not yet updated for the charm slot.  Without the TT inventory, using default inventory it should be more unbreakable, but i just love it )<br />
<br />
Any thoughts would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Theres just one thing i need to know... How do i use it? Im not entirely sure how to put the inventory into my interface, and the F.A.Q. only has how to insert UIs as a whole. Id appreciate it very much if anyone could help me with putting it in.</div></div><hr />

He didn't make it, he just updated it... but I agree it's awesome!<br />
<br />
As for installing it, it's not ready to be installed yet... it needs the dye buttons and whatnot added to it since the 2/24 LoY Patch.<br />
<br />
But to answer you question, you open your EQ folder (like where your screenshots are stored), look for a folder named &quot;uifiles&quot; and then open that.  In there you will see a folder named &quot;default&quot; which you dont wanna touch.  So in the folder that you're in (which is the &quot;uifiles&quot; folder) you make another folder and name it whatever you want (keep it one word and all lowercase).  This folder you make is where you will be putting your modded UI Files.  So say you named it &quot;myui&quot; you would put the inventory files from this thread in &quot;myui&quot; along with any other modified UI files.  Then when you enter the game you can type &quot;/load myui&quot; and it will load it up.<br />
<br />
That's it... enjoy! :)</div></div><hr />

Nothing special, anyone could mix and match this from the downloads section and &quot;pre beta&quot; this ui.  Back to the drawing board IMO</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the update man... works great!  Small suggestion, no biggy... just thought that the new buttons might look better if maybe you stuck them above the others... like right above the &quot;skills&quot; button.  Not like it's a big deal or anything, just thought it might be even cooler that way *shrug*. :)</div></div><hr />
