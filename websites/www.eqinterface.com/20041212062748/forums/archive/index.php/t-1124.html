<br />
I can't change any of my skills that are currently in my hotkeys, and I can't change them on the actions window either...<br />
<br />
Being a rogue and having many skills to choose  from and only a few slots to put them in, I find I am always switching them around depending on the current situation, and as such this is extremely frustrating for me.<br />
<br />
I have tried altering the details in both my UIfiles folder, and also the UI_Char_00 file, but still nothing has changed, any suggestions as to what will fix this will be greatly appreciated!<br />

<br />
Also, what happens that doesn't allow you to change them? You mean you can't right click on them to get the nifty little pop-up?(or what ever it is now)<br />
And the Hotkeys just doesn't allow you to click and hold?<br />
<br />
Be more detailed as to what you did, and what it's not allowing you to do so we can figure out what the problem is.</div></div><hr />

I downloaded it from http://www.eqskins.com/mod.php?mod=downloads&amp;op=viewsdownload&amp;subid=7&amp;min=21&amp;orderby=dateD&amp;show=7 - second one down on the list &quot;Advanced Targeting&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as your questions go, yes I can hard-click on the hotkeys to pick them up and move them around, but I can't right click on any of the skills ones to change them at all.  If they are hotkeys I have made myself, then I am able to change them (such as an inc message or my evade macro), but I cannot change the regular EQ skill ones, such as Hide, Sneak, Backstab, Disarm etc etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Advanced Target/Group window is irrelevent in this issue.<br />
<br />
Has this happened since patch? or pre?<br />
<br />
And how did you create your mod dictory? If you copied your Default dir and renamed it, then do this:<br />
<br />
Delete your mod directory. Create a new dir with the same name. Then redownload/unzip the advance target/group window mod into it.<br />
<br />
The only files that should be in that directory is the EQUI_TargetWindow.xml and EQUI_GroupWindow.xml. Right? Aside from maybe any ReadMe files, etc.<br />
<br />
Once done, start up EQ and see if that fixes it.</div></div><hr />
