<br />
anyone think I should add the new T.king spell icons?<br />
<br />
Sorry I have no screenshots at this time....  I just did a reinstall of windows.. patching should be done in about 3 hours I will post some screencaps of the UI tomorrow<br />
<br />
Also I am starting a new account,<br />
which means i still need to pick a new race, class, and server<br />
<br />
if anyone has any suggestions I am listening... though I WILL NOT PLAY A FROG!!</div></div><hr />

:Edit:  if you are refering to the &quot;the files in your UI are not compatible with current everquest files&quot;  that error only goes away if you put the EQUI.xml and SWIDL.xml file in your modded UI.<br />
and still it will give that error,, I haven't been able to truely get rid of it but at least adding those two files will keep that error from showing after you zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
my UI looks very similar to the default, look at the player window to know if it loaded at all   or check the inventory for the FU version number</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skarlett</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, deleted my other download and redownloaded. Voila...it does load with the .xml file error, but at least it loads. I like the window background, the selector window, the pet window and the bags (monogrammed?).  I'm one of those likes the hotbox with inventory though, so, that's one suggestion. At the moment, I'm using the ZwFucr UI that I love mostly because of the color change for health as the health is lowered (or increased). Any possibility of your adding that feature?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinkfu</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen the inventory in the hotbox but I am not sure how to do it, I might consider it on FU5 course if you look at the version number of this one it is almost FU5... started out to be FU3.1<br />
<br />
on the backpacks, I wrote SWAG, after watching Futurama when bender was blown out of a space pirate ship with a giant bag that said SWAG, I was going to put that on the large back Icon but it looked like I had tattooed SWAG onto someones ass so the backpack worked ) also some shields say FU on them<br />
<br />
ok on the colour changing bars, I have not figured this one out, I am probably going to have to steal that out of someone elses UI<br />
<br />
and yes I know it's stealing, but hey, I'm EVIL REMEMBER (insert evil laugh here)<br />
<br />
and I do want to put that in this version of my UI, <br />
<br />
Post Poll: did anyone ever like the black leaf background I used on the pervious versions of FU?Link to what they looked like (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=2113) <br />

<br />
Now I go to patch test....  My server is uber spiffy we even have our own patcher :P<br />

Nothing better then seeing a Gnome in full plate with a big old sword (okay it is big for a gnome geessee :D ).  After all your very name talks about Tinkering and the gears :D<br />
<br />
oh btw I am a Gnome Warrior level 63 on Tarrew Marr :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tinkfu, check Enoks UI v8's pet window for the best color changing gauge code. Seeing as I made color changing gauges, I can assure you that has the best coding for one.<br />

<br />
<br />
Haliken I will look at your UI for the code... but now I play /tip hat<br />
<br />
:EDIT: <br />
I am stoping work on v4 and I am starting to refit it with all the uber stuffs they are doing on test, so if you like the UI as is be warned after june 11th it will no longer work.. I should have a working (on test anyway) beta of version 5 by the 9th<br />
<br />
Version 5 will include<br />
*colour changing gauges<br />
*vertical Breath and casting Bars (j/k) (but still working on it)<br />
*ingame Clock <br />
(I have a idea on this one, I know how to make translucent symbols appear over the game, I just can't get them to move yet)<br />
*T.king's standard v3.0 spell book<br />
*a FU pointer<br />
*sony's version of my memory keys<br />
*expanded spellbar (for the Underfoot Expansion)<br />
*many more tweaks and easter eggs to keep you guessing the condition of my sanity<br />

I'll be looking and waiting for that new version. Thanks for working on the color change gauges. They really make life easier, especially for healing.<br />
