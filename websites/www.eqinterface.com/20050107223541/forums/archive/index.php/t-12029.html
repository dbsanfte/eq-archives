I apologize in advance if this is elsewhere, but I used the search and browsed for a while and didn't see anything that matched.<br />
<br />
1. I use a slightly customized version of the Infinity UI found here: http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2586<br />
<br />
However, I have loaded to default and other UI files (such as Aya) as well - and all have the same problem for me at this time.<br />
<br />
2. I've had the UI installed with no problems for over 3 months. I installed it, used /load in game to bring it up, moved everything where I wanted it, and it worked fine.<br />
<br />
3. UIError log follows:<br />

4. Basically, the UI WORKS just fine - but I can't right click anything, meaning I can't Lock or Unlock anything, can't create a new chat window, or set transparency.<br />
<br />
This wasnt a huge problem really until today when I decided I'd try to load Aya as my full time skin and use it for a while - and it loaded up with only one chat window and I cant move it or make more of them. Any ideas?<br />

I went back, deleted my UI_Sharv_Marr file, and re-ran EQ. It scrambled everything back to default, including exactly that - the context menu reference.<br />
<br />
Here I thought that was just for spell gem loading. Shows why I play a warrior, I suppose.<br />

Thanks.<br />
