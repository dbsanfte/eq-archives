<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rshields</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I have just recently begun learning how to customize the EQUI, starting with other's mods and using that code compared to the default code as my learning material.<br />
<br />
I am getting pretty comfortable with the XML coding (I have some VB and HTML experience so the code itself is not too challenging)but I keep running into problems trying to do things that cannot be done.<br />
<br />
For example, I recently took a mod that added your inventory slots to your hotkey window and tried to alter it so that it also included the Destroy button and plat button in the hotkey window.  To me it made sense that if I could take inventory slot elements from the inventory window and have them function in the hotkey window, then I could do the same with other elements from the inventory window.  But alas, I was wrong. After some frustration with this (the buttons would show up, but would not be functional) I posted here and was told those buttons simply cannot be put in the hotkey window.<br />
<br />
So that leads me to my big question.  Is there any rhyme or reason to what can and cannot be done with regards to what elements can be included in what windows?   Does it follow some logical pattern?  Or is there at least a reference source that can help me?  It is tough for me to simply try it and see, because as a newbie I cannot be sure if it is not working because it can't be done as opposed to it being xml errors on my part. <br />
<br />
Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.  <br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />
