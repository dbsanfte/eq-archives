<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bluevine</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have taken a browse through the fantasy sections and others and I really have only found 2 that I like/work for me. Delta and the one I currently use nightelf-LDON which I wouldn't mind if a sta bar was added to it somehow. Anyway my request if anyone is interested is a more mystical abstract elvish looking ui. It would use light browns and greens possibly like the colors of harmony and protection of the nine and would have a feel to it like floating sort of. Basically I want it to feel like I'm watching a movie. I know it is a lot to ask but I bet it would be a hit if ever made and basically I just want a color change to nightelf.<br />
<br />
PS. Can anyone actually explain to me what that huge window that has the spellbar attached to it does in nightelf? It has two parts separated by a brown line and looks like a comat text box but I cannot filter any text to it.</div></div><hr />
