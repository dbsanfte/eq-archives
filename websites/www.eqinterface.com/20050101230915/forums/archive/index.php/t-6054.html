I also have my desktop cursor smack in the middle of my EQ screen.  This just started tonite and I don't have a clue what is causing it.<br />
<br />
I seemed to recall a similiar problem posted a long time ago, but I can't find the post.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
First off, thanks for the tip on the cursor.  I don't use the windowed mode, so I wouldn't have thought of that.  Second, that hotbutton window is one my crazy creations (from t.king's artwork - of course), but didn't think anyone would be interested - my stuff can seem 'busy' to some ;) so I never posted it.<br />

Using WinXP, I have updated to DirectX 9 and no longer have this particular issue. <br />

Now if I can just get my UI to work.<br />

This is the first patch that has really sucked for me and left me scratching my head thinking &quot;who are these retarded monkeys that program this game?&quot;<br />

I use 98se<br />

No other issues that I can see atm...just this annoying flash of start button and a chunk of the tool bar that shows the time.  <br />

Any ideas anyone? <br />

Am thick, so please tell me, how do we fix this refresh rate? (ie.where?)<br />
<br />
Only my clock bleeds through, and when I see the curser in the middle of the screen it is too late, and I am already looking at the desktop with a nice EQ Screenshot (I hit refresh and it clears the screen, from the frozen view)<br />

More aid would be greatly appreciated :)<br />

That seems to have helped quite a bit.  I don't see my clock ect.. in the lower right hand corner.  The cursor still shows on occasion but going in and out of the windowed mode makes it go away.  So for now, I can live with it. <br />
<br />
One question on EQ video, what would cause EQ to default to 16-bit?  I fix it and it is fine and the game works great.  I log off for the night and come back and somehow it has reset.  Any ideas?<br />

<br />
1.  Computer:  go to your control panel, then double click on display.  Go to the tab 'settings', then click on 'advanced'.   Then click on the tab 'monitor'.  That will give you the refresh rate of your monitor, which you can either leave alone or reset.  (watch the warning about setting it to too high of a refresh rate).<br />
<br />
[alternately, go to your start menu help - and type in &quot;refresh&quot;.  That will take you to where you need to go as well.]<br />
<br />
2.  Everquest:  go into your eq folder and find eqclient.  Near the bottom (on mine, at least), it will tell you what your refresh rate is.<br />
<br />
My eq refresh was faster than my monitor refresh, which for some reason was really slow.  I changed my monitor refresh to be the same as my eq one, and when I logged on, I didn't have anymore bleedthrough.   <br />
<br />
wooot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nidisa</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">[VideoMode]<br />
Width=1024<br />
Height=768<br />
RefreshRate=0<br />
BitsPerPixel=0<br />
<br />
<br />
My refresh rate is at adapter default for my computer, and I have no clue what the above refresh rate from my eqclient.ini folder means??  So, I don't know if they are set differently?<br />
<br />
<br />
**edit**<br />
I switched refresh rates from the desktop to optimal and logged in,  still getting the bleed through.  Switched it back to default, and still bleed through.  Those are the only two options I have, and adapter default worked just fine pre Tues patch.</div></div><hr />

 Using the in-game video mode tab, change the resolution to any other supported mode then change it back to what you normally use and click &quot;accept&quot;.<br />

Now start EQ and in-game under display choose video mode, check that resolution and refresh rate are the same as desktop settings, then click accept and then yes.<br />

Actually been doing that all week.  Even cooler was when my silken green drape (and every other robe in the zone) Bleached white when I changed the bit rate.  Everyone else saw the right colors but my robe was a beautiful pearl grey.  Took it off and put it on again and it was back to green, but another interesting effect of the latest patch (and the bodytint window) I think.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to hear about your computer problems.  That hurts.  As far as the hot button bar,  I am working on a standalone version.  However, over the next week my access to the internet is sporadic, EQ not at all, and towards the end of the week I won't even be able to access a computer :(  So......at best it will be towards the end of the following week.  Be patient, I never dreamed anyone would be interested.<br />
