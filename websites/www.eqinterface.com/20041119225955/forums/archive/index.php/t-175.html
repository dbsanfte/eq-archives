<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you changed the cursor graphic by adding a new image to window_pieces01.tga, then you need to rebuild the alpha channel. I dunno how to do this in anything but photoshop atm.<br />
<br />
First, open your graphic in photoshop and open the channels window, then look at JUST the alpha channel. Transparent parts are black, solid parts are white, and anything between is semi transparent. In order to rebuild your alpha channel, delete this one first.<br />
<br />
Use the magic wand tool, select everything you want to be transparent, right click or go to the selection menu, save selection as new channel.<br />
<br />
If you look at the new alpha channel, it should now match the altered image.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cntl-Click on the Layer in the Layers Window. ( this will select everything )<br />
<br />
Select -&gt; Save Selection -&gt; Okay<br />
<br />
That's it. If you click on the Channels tab, you'll see you have a new Channel.<br />
<br />
Then just save the Image as a .tga file uncompressed at 24 or 32 bit, doesn't seem to matter. 32 would be best for people using 32 bit, etc.</div></div><hr />

I did manage to load the alpha channel, I don't know how to edit it though.</div></div><hr />

I'm having a HELL of a time making a new cursor and this doesn't work for me.<br />
<br />
I created a new file with the cursor I wanted.  Followed the instructions you posted, but it won't let me save as anythign but PSD unless I flatten the image, and when I flaten the image I lose the transparency :(</div></div><hr />
