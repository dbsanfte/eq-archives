Recently downloaded the vert mod to extend the target bar; and in doing so i think it may have eliminated the player stats/ resist/ hp/ac window.<br />
<br />
Is this possible and /or what did i do wrong?:D  <br />
<br />
Is the window gone? If so find whatever setting you have to turn on/of the player window in the options menu.<br />
<br />
If just the images are gone, and your getting lag you may have removed the tga (art work file) by accident. <br />
<br />
If all else fails refresh Vert.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zatriz Archange</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried a few of the things you said as I couldn't get the player window with the stats and such on it to work with cleric...<br />
<br />
...And after all that, NOTHING:( <br />
<br />
But earlier today, I was 2 boxing my SK, who has that player window and the Luntar working properly, I noticed that once my lil pet died, that the window p00fed.<br />
<br />
So in short, the reason why the cleric's player window wasn't working was b/c i had his pet window off, since he has a few more levels to gain before he can use a pet of his own.<br />
<br />
Then i toggled it on and  Voila!!! Player Window works.<br />
<br />
Silly me.:D :cool: <br />
<br />
But thanks for your quick tips and possible solutions; and of course it was the obvious easy reason that suggested.</div></div><hr />
