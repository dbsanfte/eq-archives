<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">09-06-2002, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I borrowed some graphics while trying to figure out that end of things, but the xml coding I worked on for the most part myself, taking a few hints and ideas here and there and combining or rethinking them.<br />
<br />
contact me with any suggestions, comments, or ideas.<br />
<br />
thanks for bearing with me, hope i figure out the graphics part for the full effectwhen I get done :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Well, it's in the download section under the old version, and I wanted to take a moment to credit Tadashya as it was her graphics files I included inadvertently.  My mod was mostly for the XML at the point when I released it, and I did try to remember whos graphics I borrowed (I did at least state I borrowe the graphics.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, been working on new tga files for the re-skinning end, will put up a new post for those.</div></div><hr />

Have you done anything with the Tracking window? Didnt see any pic's of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing I really did was put the list to the top and moved the color filters down with the others as that seemed more intuitive.  I also put the filters below the track button, as again ti was more intuitive.  I shrunk the font in the list, making room for more mobs in view.<br />
<br />
Ither than that, I couldn't really think of anyting to change, unless I go about shrinking it.</div></div><hr />
