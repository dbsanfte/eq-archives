<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xeatau</div><div class="date">02-02-2003, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded the patch (thank you) and put the three files into both my default and my customized ui folders (the latter being based on aeluin's blue fantasy). I'm still having trouble with being dropped to the desktop trying to use the custom ui. Any thoughts? Appreciate any help you could give, I really love this ui, even though I find I spend a lot of time on it :)</div></div><hr />

I suspect your EQUI.xml file is custom so besides the three files you need to do the following from Caireen's post in another thread:<br />
<br />
IF you have a custom EQUI.xml file, open using a text editor (Word, WordPerfect, NotePad, etc.) and:<br />
<br />
Using the text editor's Search or Find function, find:<br />
<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_StoryWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
Immediately after that line, ADD:<br />
<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_BodyTintWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, you should delete those files from your custom ui folder.  They only need to be in your default folder (at least until somebody here mods them!)  If the patcher updates them in your default folder your ui might break again if you still have them in your custom folder.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xeatau</div><div class="date">02-02-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, trying this now. One question though. I'm confused why I'm only copying in 2 of the 3 missing pieces into the equi.xml. Shouldn't there also be a<br />
<br />
 &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_CharacterCreateWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
line? Just a guess on this, but just wondering. Also, couldn't find the other thread that you refer to, could you direct me?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!!</div></div><hr />
