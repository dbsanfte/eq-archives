You'll want to head to the windows update center as soon as possible. The jpg file format is used on just about every webpage on the internet today.<br />
<br />
Edit: If your have installed Service Pack 2 (SP2) you should already protected against this kind of attack.<br />
<br />
Quote from cnet:<br />
Security professionals expect the release of the program to herald a new round of attacks by viruses and Trojan horses incorporating the code to circumvent security on Windows computers that have not been updated. The flaw, in the way Microsoft's software processes JPEG graphics, could allow a program to take control of a victim's computer when the user opens a JPEG file.<br />

You can find it here (http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/200409_jpeg.mspx) it includes a scanner and repair service.<br />

<br />
yes just visit the windows update manager and look for the GDI security patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They had a similar bug regarding png files.<br />
<br />
Unfortunalty, it's unknown if netscape browsers has this same problem.<br />

Obviously, they had a couple of &quot;funny&quot; programmers in there...I've always said Microsoft had to be filled with whitecoats.<br />
<br />
1) Download a program called Opera (latest version is found here (http://www.opera.com))<br />
2) Hover your cursor over the Internet Explorer icon.<br />
3) Right-click it, select Delete, and confirm until it's gone.<br />
4) Repeat this process on your Desktop, in your start menu, and wherever else needed until the only way you can manually load it is by digging deep into your Program Files or Windows folder.<br />
5) Install Opera.<br />
6) The first time you start it, a confirmation box will ask you if you'd like to set it as your default browser.<br />
7) Click yes, and giggle manically (I *know* I did.  Heh)<br />
Haha, obviously, you don't have to do it...but for the majority, once you try out Opera as a browser, you'll never want to look at Internet Explorer ever, ever, EVER again.  You know that feature IE just put in to block pop-up adds?  Opera's had that for over three years.  Oh, and Opera allows you to open seperate windows to browse more than one web page simultaneously (obviously) but the best part...they all remain *within* the Opera window itself, instead giving tabs for each individual page.  I highly recommend it as a browser...I don't think many would be disappointed in trying it out.  /nod<br />
<br />
As such...please, if you haven't already, download Service Pack 2 or follow-up on Kudane's link for the GDI to check your system for the proper patching to prevent this little coding problem from having you tear your hair out.<br />

And SP2 took out my network and decided it didnt like my aspi layer as well and SP2 thought it would be fun to do a raid on the rest of my system as well causing bad fraction with quite a few of my programs, I would recomend that you use a program like Norton Ghost to make an image of your system before installing SP2 guys,, forget about about using system restore thats only good for putting trojans back on you system that you thought you got rid of months ago lol, Wooopee good old microsoft gave me more interesting bugs to play with  :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same experience that Aramil Dannodel went through, but with Mozilla's Firefox (http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/)!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">random7</div><div class="date">09-26-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have used Mozilla for 2 years now and swear by it. i never get any popups... ever. i am bummed that they had an issue with the png files, but thats 1 compared to the hundreds of security violations that MS builds into its programs. <br />
on a side note, the mozilla on my Linux box gets popups a lot, weird...</div></div><hr />

Cannot say ALL will have this Problem ..but ONE (ME!) is enough ,so be careful.hehehehe  I myself ,would rather have a virus,I have cleaned those out afore with less difficulty and annoyance  than  I have had  with  XP SP2 in the last 4 days .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Svafnir</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i always install all of the MS security updates except the graphics driver (because it is not the one EQ uses.)  Anyone know why they list the graphics driver as a security update, instead of say a driver update?</div></div><hr />
