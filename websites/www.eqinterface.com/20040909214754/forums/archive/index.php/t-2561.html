<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've released the spellbar you can see in the Bones spellbook I released already. I also released a second spellbar as well... they should be appearing in the download section under Spellgems in the near future! Enjoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jordaan</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love that second spell bar except... can you make it smaller? It's friggin huge!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No... I won't be making a smaller version of this one (exactly). I may decide to creat a spellbar similar to it and will take that into consideration :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so where is it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madea</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol look what i did to your image! lol, i never made an alphashader.. cant believe it worked first time = )<br />
heh sorry had to remove that skull heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's quite a compliment... someone modding my mod :) Grats! :) The skull and crossbones is something my guild is kinda into... so I try and include it in a lot of stuff. I'll be making more spellbars and books in the near future. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galanin</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ABSOLUTLY love the spell bar! The ticker is a great idea and its clean look is JUST what I have been searching for!<br />
<br />
I must agree with a previous poster and plead for a SMALLER version, please. On a 22” monitor playing in 1600x1200 resolution it is the single largest item by far, in my mix and match UI. <br />
<br />
Any chance of us seeing your work further and possibly getting the ticker spell bar in a smaller form someday?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another Drive By cleaving from Sonavaa aka sc2kmayor.  Have read the posts about Thangor's TickerSpellBar and saw some people wanted a smallerized version.<br />
<br />
I personally think Thangor's work is on the quality caliber of Tking and believe you shouldn't have to live without just cuz of size.<br />
<br />
75% Size of original.<br />
(Hopefully my crude ability with PSP hasn't destroyed the quality of the graphics.)<br />
 -- http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=857<br />
(although I retested last night and found the spell gems off center a bit and need to correct that.  Prolly wont be able to upload that fix til Saturday.)<br />
<br />
Enjoy :)<br />
<br />
OK...The posted ZIP file has a nasty issue with the Spell Gem Locations.  I did not notice before, but you need to replace a section (8 times) in order to better offest the spell gems.<br />
<br />
ORIGINAL<br />
    &lt;/SpellGemDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
    &lt;SpellIconOffsetX&gt;18&lt;/SpellIconOffsetX&gt;<br />
    &lt;SpellIconOffsetY&gt;6&lt;/SpellIconOffsetY&gt;<br />
  &lt;/SpellGem&gt;<br />
<br />
Replacement<br />
    &lt;/SpellGemDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
    &lt;SpellIconOffsetX&gt;10&lt;/SpellIconOffsetX&gt;<br />
    &lt;SpellIconOffsetY&gt;2&lt;/SpellIconOffsetY&gt;<br />
  &lt;/SpellGem&gt;<br />
<br />
I got too busy this weekend to update the file and retest it, so you may need to tweak this to get the gems just right.<br />
&lt;bonk&gt; Bad drive by cleaver...Bad &lt;sorry for the bad QA on that one.&gt;<br />
Pic is here - Link to post is couple messages below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Managed to get some time to test the smallerized hack-n-slash in game and corrected the Gem Offset issue that I created when I missed the Offest Tags.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ticker bar is still wavering, kinda like an ekg.  Cant seem to get the pixel offsets right to make it smooth, but got rid of the old-style TV roll that was created when I first posted it.<br />
<br />
/em is really hoping that Thangor is not ticked off that I cut up another one of his excellent works.<br />
<br />
Should be posted in spellgems once through moderation will edit with link.  Highly suggest holding off on d/l of first post cuz I butchered it bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3/4 size - Version 2 is now in release. -- This is Thangor's Ticker Bar Reduced for those who wanted it.  It is far from being as clean as his original, the ticker part would need to be completely redone and I only reduced it's size.  Hope this helps those who wanted to use it.<br />
<br />
And BTW: Kudane finally posted TTInventory in the Inventory Mods section so Its easier to find.<br />
