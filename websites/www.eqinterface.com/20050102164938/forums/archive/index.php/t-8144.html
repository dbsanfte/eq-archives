<br />
Hey,  I have been looking over your Gauge layout and making some changes and I have been able to figure out most of it and have used parts of it before.  If you don't mind I would like to ask you a couple questions about it.<br />
<br />
1. I see you have it setup so that you can use pretty much any graphics file for it.  I assume by defineing the size of the graphics with-in the &quot;Ui2DAnimation&quot; code and I can see where this is defined but I am wondering whether a change in the over all size of the graphic for the gauge would cause a change in the &quot;Gauge item&quot; size definition?  Currently you have the &quot;Gauge item&quot; defined with some pretty big numbers and some small numbers but, I am not seeing how the size in the &quot;Gauge item&quot; definition relates to the size of the &quot;Ui2DAnimation&quot; definition.  I looked at the three versions you have there and they all seem pretty close to the same for the &quot;Gauge item&quot; definition sections.<br />
<br />
2. I see that you have defined them with Tabs.  Since you cant see the tabs while in the game I am assuming they are invisible tabs.  My question is: are the tabs needed to make the gauge work or are they just left over from the window being used.  Also if the tabs are being used as part of the gauge how is the window knows what to do with the tabs and all?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just making sure you know I saw this post. Give me a sec to figure out the answers to your questions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, answer to question 1:<br />
If you changed the size of the graphic (made it 200 pixels wide, is this what you mean by change the size?) you'd have to make the &quot;Ui2DAnimation&quot; numbers and the &quot;Gauge item&quot; values bigger also.<br />
The reason the numbers are so big is you want to show only portions of the graphics, so you have a 10000 pixel wide gauge but only show a 100 pixel wide fragment of it. The reason the gauge's values are similar is because they are similar gauges, they're just the different colors.<br />
<br />
Q2:<br />
The tabs are used to constrain the left and right boundaries of the gauge so it's only 100 pixels wide. I've, since the posting of that code, developed a cleaner method for multicolored gauges that doesn't need tabs. They were not just left overs, they were necessary. I'll post the new code if you'd like it. It cuts back the required code for a multicolored gauge significantly, or rather, the complexity of the code, probably runs a tiny bit better, performance-wise, also.<br />

P.S. - I swear I know how to spell gauge, I'm jsut (&lt;-- see?) a sloppy typist and mix letters up quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clarify something for me for question 1: when you say change the size of the graphics, do you mean change the width and height of the graphics file or change the size of the graphics for the gauge?<br />
<br />
If the width and height of the graphics file change, this doesn't matter so long as the gauge graphics are 100 pixels wide, 8 pixels tall and a the XY location 110, 20. When you have a 256x256 pixel image, and you ask for something at XY coordinate 256, 0, it would grab the pixel at 0,0. EQ wraps the graphics files when you query for data past the edges. That's why I can grab a 10000 pixel wide slice of graphic from a 256 pixel wide file.<br />

P.S. - Got stuff I gotta go do, I'll check back at this thread in an hour or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok,  Now I understand it a little better.  Not sure if it will work for what I want to use for the gauge though.<br />
<br />
As far as the graphics size I was referring to the Graphic itself.  Instead of the standard graphic, the one I am using is about 125, 50.  I have attached a sample of the gauge that I am using.<br />
<br />
But because of the way that the code is done with the gauge I have a feeling that it will not work with a gauge that looks like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want that gauge to change colors? No sweat, same principle as with the standard ones, just the math'll be, uhh, a little harder, but not by much. Hrm.<br />
<br />
If you want that gauge to be color changing, finish whatever it's apart of (target window, etc.) and post the XML and tell me at what percents you want it to change to what colors and I'll add the coding. I'd explain how, but since this is an irregular gauge it'd really be just much easier to do it than to explain it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx Haliken.  Here is the zip with the Target window in it.  I think I have included all the files that it uses.  The percents should be at 50 it changes to yellow and at 25 it changes to red.  The base color for the HP gauge can be green.  Currently the HP gauge that I am looking to get modified is the Player Health Bar.  In the target window it is the one that is the upper left bar in the window.  The gauge item is called &quot;Target_PlayerHP&quot; in the file.  The way it is designed right now it is only using the fill pattern for the gauge but if that needs to change then that would be fine too. <br />
<br />
Thanx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, using the files you gave I am lacking a visible mouse cursor. =D<br />
<br />
Not like I need it, I'll have this ready lickity-split...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">K, I made a slight change to one graphics file (window_pieces051.tga), the gauge one, since it had duplicate gauges up top, and I needed some black space, I removed the alpha channel from the top 50 pixels, hope that isn't a big deal.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I didn't modify a single thing in your target XML file, I just added, so look at it, I clearly marked the new areas.<br />

Kinda hoping for a reply like &quot;this is perfect&quot; or &quot;could you fix this one little thing&quot; or &quot;what the heck you moron, that's all wrong&quot; =D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry I did not make it back last night after downloading it and trying it out.<br />
<br />
It is great.  It will take me a little time to go through the code and figure out just what you are doing in there but it is just what I wanted.  Thanx.<br />
<br />
Haven't quite figure out how everything is being done in this yet but I am getting there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Haliken,  Can I get you to make a small change to this file?  I am trying to understand how you are calculating the gauges in this file.  Can I get you to edit the file and make it so the gauge changes color from yellow to red at 30% instead of 25%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and by the way,  I love how compact you have made this code and how well it works.  Great job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG I just figured it out.  Now that I see how you did it, it is so simple.  This is great.</div></div><hr />
