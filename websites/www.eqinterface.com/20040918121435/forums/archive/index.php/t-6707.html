<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fryfrog</div><div class="date">02-16-2003, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my custom UI that i use.  It is a mix of me taking some of the default .xml files and editing them so they are as small as possible and also other people's ui mods.  I have edited each one at least a little bit, i think.<br />
<br />
Includes:<br />
*T.king artwork (buff icons, gem icons, spell icons) because his work is the best.<br />
*modified t.king druidish inventory with charm slot (which i think he has already made himself anyway)<br />
*compass window with the loc thing in it by someone else, streached it to be the same size as my target and group window.<br />
*target and group window with % made by someone else, but shrunk as much as possible in size by me<br />
*default hot buttons, but with title bar removed and excess space removed.  i made the page left/right buttons a little bigger since there was room.<br />
*self/player window from someone else, the really big one with tons of stats.  personally, i don't really care about the stats as they are FAIRLY staic.  i did leave all the resists in because they are small and can be VERY important/interesting on raids.<br />
*bags... i think i modified them some to make em smaller cause that was in the dir.  been a while though...<br />
*chat boxes have no titles and very small borders.  i hate wasted space.<br />
*buff and short buff.  i used someone else's buff box, but then when the short duration buff box came out i made it identical to the normal buff box.  the short duration buff box is entirely done by me!<br />
*pet window (not shown) was shrunk as much as possible and a yellow % for pet was added.<br />
*selector window is as small as i feel possible.  you really have to work hard to move it (by clicking between the icons).<br />

<br />
I use pretty much the same UI with a touch of T. King art, except I use Remme's player, group, and long target window.  They are very crisp and easy to see.<br />
<br />
I would also reccomend that you play around with Drakah's TGA window files.  Anyways thanks again.</div></div><hr />
