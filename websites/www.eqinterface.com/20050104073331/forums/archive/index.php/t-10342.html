<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ctbrew</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to install just one patch, Shelsy_Playercombo.zip (found in Downloads, category Player Info, page three).  The UI loaded correctly but crashes, and I get the error message.  K here are some questions:<br />
1. In the Things to Check First section it says my EQClient.ini should have a line NewUI=True, UISkin=Default.  I only  had the UISkin=Default, so I typed in the other, should I have? Also I put thenb on two different lines, was this correct?<br />
2. In the Forum, in the PatchFixes/Summaries, do we do ALL the patch changes under the different dates?  Or just the latest?  <br />
3. My patch has the .xml files EQUI.xml and EQUI_GROUPWINDOW.xml, and I noticed that these files do not have all of the files mentioned under UI Changes.  For example it does not have the file Include&gt;EQUI_AdventureMerchantWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
but some other files sorta close to it.  If it does not have the specified file, should I ignore that change?<br />
4. Lastly I did not understand wraith098's post on INI files and UI's, does it pertain to the patch I am trying to run? thanks<br />
K I apologize if these are stupid questions, I am a total newb regarding patches and any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks and take care-ctbrew</div></div><hr />

All you should have to do after you make your new custom folder and unzip the items into it is in game type /load then select the new item and hit load. You shouldnt have to edit your ini.<br />

<br />
In our downloads are the file should have a last updated date. You will most likely need to apply any paches that effected that file after the file date. Post the contents of your uierrors.txt here and we should be able to tell you what needs to be patched.<br />

You only need to update the code on the files you have. Any files you dont have get loaded from the default folder witch Sony has already patched for you.<br />

The errors you have are the result of sony changeing the labels for the percentage tags back in May.<br />

You will need to update the effected XML files using the information in this patch: http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8467<br />
