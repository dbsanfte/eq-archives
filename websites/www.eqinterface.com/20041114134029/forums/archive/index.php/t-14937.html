<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rykahna</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometime today, hopefully, an upload for this UI will be approved in the Minimalist section (though it may be moved to the mix &amp; match section, I'm not sure.)  I can't post the zip file here, as it is too large.<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate some feedback on this UI, as I know it has a few issues to be ironed out, and I can't get a few minor aspects to work on it.<br />
<br />
This is a complete UI package I have been working on, with an emphasis on compact window elements and transparency of window elements, so as not to occlude the viewport whenever possible.  Simply put, I hate clutter.  I like to keep everything tucked off as compactly on the bottom and the sides as possible.<br />
<br />
It has been tested and includes a UI_playername_server.ini file for 1600x1200, 1280x1024, 1024x768, and 800x600 resolutions.  Simply change the name of the .ini file to include your characters name and server.<br />
<br />
There are two Combat Ability Window options--one with four slots for hybrids and one with 8 slots for meleers.  Simply rename the appropriate one EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml.<br />
<br />
***IMPORTANT NOTE***: This UI was designed to use the following elements other people have created:<br />
<br />
Spellbook graphics by TKing<br />
http://p206.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=217.topic<br />
<br />
Spell Gem graphics by TKing<br />

<br />
Class Animations by TKing<br />
http://p206.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=220.topic<br />
<br />
Keilha's Compact Map Window<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/showthumbs.php?id=2697<br />
<br />
Rax's AYA Media Player<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=2866<br />
<br />
I didn't upload the files for these modifications, because I hadn't altered them, and to save space, however some of the other files in this package may reference them and cause failures if the above graphics and modifications are not installed.  Of a certainty, the Book and Spellbook modifications will fail.<br />
<br />
This UI has the following issues (that I am aware of):<br />
<br />
The borders and/or titlebars are missing on the following window elements, despite the fact that the XML files have been modified so that they SHOULD be there, and the borders/titlebars show up when viewed in SidlWidl..<br />
<br />
Hotbutton Window<br />
Combat Ability Window<br />
Loot Window<br />
Alarm Window<br />
Tribute Benefit Window<br />
<br />
The background on the spellgems in the Spell Bar and Hotbuttons is black with a thin slice of the appropriate shade around the edge, rather than being entirely the right color.  I am sure this has something to do with the way I fiddled around with the TGA files, but at the moment, I can't determine how to fix it.<br />
<br />
The SocialEditWnd is supposed to be sizeable.  I set it to be sizeable in the xml file, but for some reason, it's still not.<br />
<br />
The Buttons on the Adventure Leaderboard window are missing.  They show up in SidlWidl and disappear in game.<br />
<br />
The offsets for inventory item graphics on the hotbuttons are off, so that the items look horizontally stretched.  I am trying to figure out what these settings are, but they are different than the offsets for most graphics within buttons or spaces.<br />
<br />
When you right click on a window to change it's settings, lock it in position, etc, the menu that appears is completely transparent, as is the menu that appears when you right click on the spell gem bar.  This gets to be a bit of a pain, making the text in this window very difficult to read.  I am still trying to figure out the settings that will make this window the transluscent gray of the other window elements.<br />
<br />
<br />
The follow elements are untested as of yet:<br />
<br />
The Health of Target's Target window.  Ideally, this window should end up being like the Target window, in that it will only appear when a Target is selected.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to put this to the test as of yet, seeing as I have been too busy designing the UI to group with someone with the HoTT ability.  So, as of this moment, I have no idea if the HoTT window works, or where it is on the screen.<br />
<br />
The Book window.  I haven't had a book to open yet to test this.  Ideally, it will look like the Spellbook window when opened.<br />
<br />
The Note Window.  I haven't had a note to test this element either.  I fiddled with the TGA files a bit, and if all goes according to plan, there should be no &quot;window&quot; around the note scroll--just the scroll with a tiny &quot;DONE&quot; button at the bottom edge.<br />
<br />
PVP windows.  I don't play on a PVP server, so I haven't had a change to test these.  Looking at them, it looks like maybe these windows are identical to the default Adventure windows, which means my mods for the Adventure windows could probably be applied to the PVP windows as well.  But I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
Please send feedback if you can confirm or deny that the untested elements are working, or if you know how to fix the aforementioned issues.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
Attempting to activate HoTT caused my client to crash, so I am guessing that there is a problem with the ToT file in this UI.  Will try to figure it out.</div></div><hr />

I screwed up when I added notes accrediting the originators of a few of the mods I used, formatted the notes improperly and caused XML errors.  Mea Culpa.  Will be a new version in a few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackwolf</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will be constantly refreshing this page until then.  :D</div></div><hr />

Last week I got some interesting remarks because I wasn't playing because I was too busy working on my UI, so I am making up for lost time.  It's still coming, though...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackwolf</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The updated version seems to work fine and I really like it so far, have a couple minor issues though. I play in 1280x1024 and this makes the bazaar trader window very hard to use, I really like the layout of it but it's very difficult to tell what items have been priced and what hasn't. Also, the bags themselves are just a bit small. Here's a link to a scrennshot (http://img68.exs.cx/img68/256/eyestrain.jpg)  I took earlier to show what I mean, this was on a 19&quot; monitor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rykahna</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Blackwolf and thanks for the feedback.<br />
<br />
I understand about the trader window being hard to see what has been priced.  My biggest problem is that, while I PLAY on a machine using 1280x1024 resolution and a 19&quot; monitor, my trader runs in 1024x768 mode in the background to keep lag down.  So if I made the trader window any larger, It would be really too large to be &quot;no scroll&quot; in anything less than 1024x768 mode.  Not sure what I am thinking of doing about this yet.<br />
<br />
As for the bag, pretty much the only thing that I changed about the bag was to make it a bit smaller (22x22 slots) Here is my last version of the bag, which has 24x24 slots, so it's slightly larger: http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3487<br />
<br />
I guess I just like the bags smaller.  Right now, it's the perfect size for my purposes, I can keep them all open and not occlude my entire screen with them.  And they are simply too difficult to modify for me to bother with doing them if I am not going to be using them myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackwolf</div><div class="date">08-28-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right, the trader window is a bit more usable at 1024x768, still a bit small for my taste but usable and it's a minor thing to change my res for trader mode. Everything else is fine though and no xml errors when I load it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rykahna</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">updated version of this posted today, pending approval.  Link is the same as above.</div></div><hr />
