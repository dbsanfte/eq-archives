I don't understand what to do, to use the subfolder windows.  I tried just deleting the main file and using the substitute one in the subfolders, and it didn't work =/<br />

Alternatively, preferredly...is there any way to substitute a Remmy-modded combined player/group window instead of yours?  I really love your UI, except for that one window, I'd much rather use the other one.  This is the window I'd prefer to use, if you could tell me if it's possible and how: <br />

<br />
i did the normal ui installation, changed the ui_name_servernumber like you said, changed the animation to rogue instead of ranger, normal stuff, changed UISkin to new one in the eqclient.ini<br />
<br />
i log on to my account and at the character select it is different because of ui<br />
<br />
i try to log in and i crash after character select, sooo for some reason or another i decided to replace your equi.xml with the default one from default folder<br />
<br />
i can now log on but instead of all the pretty ui stuff around the border of the screen it is just black with crazy boxes everywhere on the screen ( where they would be if the i was making the ui work properly ) sooo the moral is i think i'm having a problem with taht file as it lets me log on when this file is changed and doesn't when i have the equi.xml that came with your .zip<br />
<br />
just trying to narrow down what might be wrong, if you have any info plz let me know<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

Errr ... you are missing all of the graphics files.  Check your folder to make sure that they are there.  If they are, check your UIError.txt file in your main EQ directory and see if there is anything there.  If there is, post it here or PM it to me and I'll take a look at it.<br />

Yup, you got the attachment from the very first post of the thread (when I had them here) but didn't grab the rest of them.  I figured that was what had happened when I looked at your SS.  I had only dropped them here until it got authorized in the Download sections, at which point I deleted all the attachments on the thread itself.  Glad it's all working right for you now. :)<br />

Neither a stupid nor an annoying question, no fear.  Yes, just unzip them into your new custom folder and you should be gtg.  :)<br />

<br />
Sorry, no.  See the lovely frame across the bottom?  That's the target window.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there are only so many &quot;static&quot; (always show on your screen) windows to work with to create the frame.  The actions, hotbuttons, window selector, music player, group, target and pet windows are all part of the frame, in one place or another.  Replacing any of them will end up with you not having a section of the frame.  You can, however, replace the player window, if you wish, just make sure that it is a combined target/self/group mod.<br />

ROFL!  I'm still trying to figure out why it won't work for some folks but does work for most.  Plus, I promised that my next version would be for 800x600.  After that, I will try working my way back up to the higher resolutions.<br />

<br />
<br />
First of all, I want to congratulate you for this wonderful UI: I'm sure it's very good; according to the screenshots, at least. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's my problem: I downloaded your skin, unzipped it into the UIFILES of EverQuest, transferred my UI_Character_XX, did all the things you said to do in the Readme file. But when I try to load it, all the UI is placed correctly, and EQ doesn't say to me that the UI made an error. But here's the screenshot of my UI after I load EQ:<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can help me, I'd be very glad 'cause this UI is just the best for my resolution (1024 for sure).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
~Randy<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. I use WinXP, and I haven't downloaded the Microsoft fix for EQ Window (Official Verant version) yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Randy, check your UIError.txt log file in your main EQ directory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've followed the instructions to a T, went in my eqclient.ini and make sure resolution and skin name it was loading was right and it was though I did notice that the skin name was 'new2' in the .ini file that comes with the download, so I changed that to 'cairenn' which is the name of my folder inside 'uifiles'.<br />
<br />
Went through some of the XML files (web developer so its not foreign to me) and didn't see any problems.<br />
<br />
All that UIErrors is telling me is that some of the files it looks for aren't found in 'uifiles/cairenn' and that is attempting to use files from the default skin.<br />
<br />
I dunno.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Making changes I found in the Patch forum now.<br />
<br />
EDIT2: Didn't work. Oh well. Will just use basic skin with t.king gems and books like I did before. Thanks anyway.</div></div><hr />

When I unzipped your directory into UIFiles, I named the folder CairennsUI. But in the file UI_Character_XX, the UI location is set up as new2. It was why it didn't work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway; it works perfectly now ! It's so beautiful and classy. Thank you for the great and quick support ! Keep up the awesome work.<br />

I went through and deleted my eqclient.ini, re-pasted the .ini you include and renamed it 'UI_Tiir_70'.<br />

Deleted the files in the 'cairenn' directory and extracted all the files back into the directory. Made sure UISkin=cairenn in both the eqclient.ini and UI_Tiir_70.ini.<br />

Totally awesome! I thought I posted this somewhee else but I can't find it now.  Everything works perfectly except the chat window... THey are see through instead of black and the tint color/texture options will not work.  Also if I want to switch the class icon, do I just copy in the druid symbol from t.king or is there something more? THanks a ton!  <br />
Aye, I had deliberately made the chat windows transparent, so that text would be against a black background.  To get them so you see the texture and have the option of tinting them:<br />
<br />
Open your EQUI_ChatWindow.xml file using a text editor (Word, WordPerfect, NotePad, etc).<br />
<br />
Do a Search/Find for:<br />
<br />
  &lt;Screen item=&quot;ChatWindow&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;RelativePosition&gt;false&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
    &lt;Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;X&gt;95&lt;/X&gt;<br />
      &lt;Y&gt;280&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;421&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;200&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Transparent&gt;true&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
    &lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Def2&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;true&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;<br />
<br />
Change the line I have in bold to read false instead of true, save and you are gtg.<br />
<br />
Changing the class animation is explained in the Readme file.<br />

You are right, those are &quot;error&quot; messages that you can completely ignore, because they are telling you that they are doing exactly as you say, which is correct.<br />
<br />
It would seem that you are one of the folks that are leaving me totally and completely baffled and confused.  I don't know *why* this UI won't work for you folks.  Everything is right.  I've even had someone that couldn't get it to load zip up their files (including their eqclient.ini, charname.ini, UI_charname_servernumber.ini files), dropped them into my own system (changing names/server number to my own), and loaded up my character.  It all ran just fine on mine.  I don't know what the problem is.  :(<br />
<br />
I'm trying to figure it out, please trust me on that, but I'm obviously missing ... something ... :(<br />

Are you sure that was the regular buff window and not the short duration (bard) buff window?  It starts near the middle of the screen.  If it is, in fact, the regular buff window, there is a very skinny border across the top of it, that you can right click, unlock and then drag it over so it lines up at the righthand side of the screen and re-lock back into place.<br />

When you go to the link I provided on the first message, it takes you to the Download section of this site.  There you should find the download option.  /edit Duh, I'm an idiot, as I seem to keep proving over and over with this.  Download link fixed now.  /sigh<br />

Not a mistake on your end, a mistake on mine.  After I took the screenshot of the combined target/player/group window with the stamina bar, I forgot to put the casting/mana bar back in.  You will find it in the Caster/Hybrid folder.  Sorry about that.</div></div><hr />

Basically, I wanted to try this out on a fresh character, so I set it up for a char I havent played for a long long time on Tholuxe Paelles.  So...anyways...it turns out that all my characters on that server crash even with the default UI.  I tried your UI on a character on my native server, Tarew Marr, and it works fine.<br />

I'm going to have to contact a GM and find out whats wrong.</div></div><hr />

It seems like *most* of the folks that are having problems with it are using W2K, but there have been a couple of exceptions, which is why I had been ruling that out as the problem, but maybe it is, after all.  I don't know any more, and I don't know enough about programming and whatnot to know for sure how to verify what the problem is and how to fix it.  I've asked some folks that (I think) have a lot more programming knowledge than I do (well, hell, just about anyone has more programming knowledge than I do, I just hack around) to see if they can figure out what the problem is with it.  In the meantime ... I'm sorry ... I'm still trying to work on it. :(<br />

Yes, the EQUI_StoryWnd.xml file was introduced in this last patch here in NA.  That the answer you needed?</div></div><hr />

Your UI however is far superior to that already very good UI and youre working so hard to help the people that enjoy it, my thanks for your wonderful artwork and hard work in assisting us.  I have a few questions....<br />
<br />
I use WinME right now and i use the latest version of EQW, for some reason EQW would only work with WinME for me or else i might be using win2k.<br />
<br />
1.  the skin loads beautifully in its default form but when i try to replace the UI files for the hybrid windows so i can see my mana bar i crash to desktop.<br />
<br />
2.  is there a way we could put an xp bar with percentage on one of the main screens, there is plenty of room and im so used to seeing it now i almost need it.<br />
<br />
i havent changed the class animation yet either so i will let you know how that works, also i didnt notice whether there was a pet health for members in my group so i'll be back here after i play with your UI a bit, thank you so much again.<br />

1.  The only thing you should have to change to see the mana bar is to drop the EQUI_Player.xml file from the caster/hybrid folder into the main (custom) folder.<br />
<br />
2.  The exp bars are on the mp3 player window, across the top of the screen. ;)<br />
<br />
3.  Details to change the class animation are in the Readme file.</div></div><hr />

makes sense sort of, since when you have sounds off you can't open the mp3 player window...<br />

I sent you an email and forgot a few things so here you go.  Do you plan on implementing another version of your skin with another chat box for guild or tells, etc.?  I go afk in bazaar a lot, and I have to put tells in a separate window so that they do not vanish.  Perhaps you could implement this on a larger res version when you get around to making that?  Also, I was wondering if you planned on modding the give window and the purchase window.  I have seen some mods that show all of the merchants slots in one screen which takes care of scrolling.  I would download one and implement it myself, however then the borders, etc. wouldn't match your skin, and I'm quite fond of yours :)  Thanks again for the great skin and the time you put into it, and reading all of our replies hehe.</div></div><hr />

I think I'm switching over from Drakah's to this one. I altered his to work pretty well in 1024x768, but yours is simply better.  The only problem I have is with the background color in inventory bags.  Why are they green? It simply clashes with the overall look of the UI.  I know its picky, but any reasons? And how can I change ti myself?</div></div><hr />

Morgannara - YAY, at least one person fixed!<br />
<br />
Scriplin - The combined Target/Player/Group window and the two chat boxes can be moved anywhere you want along that row, including adding (or deleting) chat windows as you want.  They are &quot;floating&quot; in the frame, moving them within that area to suit yourself won't mess anything up.<br />
<br />
Hmerly - heh, sorry about that ... because you used my .ini file, you got my settings for things like that as well.  Just right click on your bag, choose tinting and change it to whatever colour you want.<br />
<br />
primal65 and CergeProtector - I have *no* idea why it would be dropping you to desktop when you log out to char select screen, as I made no changes to those files, and it isn't happening to me.  Weird. =/<br />
<br />
Viscompt - that is because you are using the wrong .ini file.  You need to use the one for the pet owner.  Either that, or just right click on the two windows that are out of place (group and pet info), click off the lock option, drag them into place (above the chat and player window for the pet bar, and in the lower left-hand corner for the group window) and lock them back into place.</div></div><hr />

Ahhh...I looked in the subdirectories that you had for each of the petowner etc and there were no .ini there.  The only .ini that I found in the zip was the main one which I changed to my characters name and server.</div></div><hr />

Hrm, not sure why, you may have gotten an early upload before I had included the ini's for the pet owners.  You should be able to just drag the two windows into the appropriate place though, pretty obvious where and how they line up. ;)</div></div><hr />

Now, being the tinkerer I am, I immedietly started tinkering away at the files, having on the foggiest idea of what was going on. I noticed at once that the file EQUI_TKMusicPlayerWnd.xml was not in any of the directories. (Not that I'll use it, I just want it to work so it looks complete.)<br />
<br />
Chopping off the referrence in EQUI.xml worked. . .but caused two ugly slashes of black on my screen where it was supposed to be. Ditto for trying to rename the files, and cutting huge chunks from here and there. But I rant. . .<br />

Sorry I mauled your UI so badly. :D <br />

Oh, UGH, I *am* an idiot some days!  I was fooling around with the new mp3 player window he has out (in the supporter's forum), and forgot to delete the reference to it.<br />

PS: Oh yes, that's right, I turned off sound ages ago, but the mp3 player should still be there, no?  <br />
That depends ... did you turn off sound within EQ using the option window, or did you disable it outside EQ (ie the customization before you even log in, or elsewhere in your computer configuration)?  If you turned it off outside of EQ, the mp3 player won't show ...</div></div><hr />

Aye, I had deliberately made the chat windows transparent, so that text would be against a black background.  To get them so you see the texture and have the option of tinting them:<br />
<br />
Open your EQUI_ChatWindow.xml file using a text editor (Word, WordPerfect, NotePad, etc).<br />
<br />
Do a Search/Find for:<br />
<br />
  &lt;Screen item=&quot;ChatWindow&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;RelativePosition&gt;false&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
    &lt;Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;X&gt;95&lt;/X&gt;<br />
      &lt;Y&gt;280&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;421&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;200&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Transparent&gt;true&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
    &lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Def2&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;true&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;<br />
<br />
Change the line I have in bold to read false instead of true, save and you are gtg.<br />

The only problem I've had has been with attempting to load the newer T. King class animations... specifically the wizard.<br />

Perhaps that's something someone a bit more *.xml literate could help me with.  Running the Remmy.exe file changes the animation xml and breaks the UI.  If anyone knows a fix for this please pass it my way.<br />

At the moment, I've been working on getting it so that it will fit for the various different resolutions.<br />
<br />
Allissiya and Skarlett - Did you go into the Choices folder and pick one each of the group, petinfo and player windows?  ;)  The readme explains how to decide which of each you need.<br />
<br />
Primal65 - I've had folks commenting on that before, and all I can say is ... I don't know why it does that.  It doesn't do it for me, or for *most* folks, but there are some that are having this problem.  I've also noticed from reading in various other places that folks are having this problem that are using other custom UIs as well, and it all started after the 9 Jan 03 patch.  What changed that is causing this ... /shrug, your guess is as good as mine.  Sorry. =/</div></div><hr />

I'm having a problem though, I can't get the combined player/target/group window. Actually, there's no target window, and the group/pet window are the default seperate boxes. I went in and put in all 3 window choices, tried different combo's to see if it would work, no luck yet. I'm not getting the lower left corner graphic either.<br />

There are three choices for the PetInfo and Group Window.  XXX - Blank Side means you are choosing the one that creates the bottom left-hand corner graphic.  XXX - Healer has the F1-F6 Sphere gauges as well as the Invite/Disband or Pet Control buttons (depending).

Change the class animation in the EQUI_SelectorWindow.xml file as explained in the README file.<br />
<br />
 another is how do I get the mob targeting thingy up  alt + isn't working<br />
?  Not sure what you mean here?<br />

also how do I get the spell icons that are shown in yer UI picture <br />
Download spell and buff icons from t.king's site, there is a link on the first post of the thread.<br />

along with My HP number<br />
Your HP number is on the combined target/player/group window, right under your health bar.</div></div><hr />

As for the chat window at the bottom, make as many or as few as you want.  Neither the chat window(s) nor the combined target/player/group window are required to stay in precisely those places to make the frame.  You can move them around along that bottom section to best suit yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buildabob - When you can see the buff window in the higher resolution, does it have the bar across the top?  Did you use one of the .ini files I included? Also, for the chat windows, right click on the existing one and say Make New Window (or whatever it is, it's pretty obvious), then place it whereever you want.  Then you filter into it the things that you want there (ie combat, spells, etc).  Again though, if you use my .ini file, it'll set the chat windows up for you as well.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm....for us it was more that the readme didn't have everything that the post had in it and we did not understand that one of the choices was not what it was labeled as (a pet window or a group window)....<br />
<br />
Maybe something to the effect of - Choose if you are a healer with pets/healer/ if you are THIS then choose this combo....<br />

<br />

Well, that is kinda up to you.  If you are a pet owner and want the pet control buttons, etc, then you want the Pet - Plain and the Group - BlankSide.  If you aren't a pet owner, then you don't care about having those buttons, so you'll likely get more use out of the Group - Plain (with the invite and disband buttons) and sticking the Pet - BlankSide in the corner.<br />
<br />
sc2kmayor - Eh, new to figuring out how to label various choices so folks can understand them.  /shrug<br />
<br />
I had said that there were three choices each for the Pet and Group windows:<br />
<br />
XXX - Healer<br />
XXX - Plain<br />
XXX - BlankSide<br />
<br />
Where XXX = either Pet or Group.  And then described what the three options meant.<br />
<br />
My explaination wasn't great.  I'm figuring out how to re-word it for the next upload.  Sorry for the confusion folks. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you did great with labeling, I just didn't get the idea that one of the options wouldn't create a useable window (that it would be the corner) til after rereading both the readme and the post.  I chose the healer/pet pet window, then chose the healer group thinking need to have pet, need to have healer bubbles.<br />
<br />
<br />
You did a great job with this, I just got myself confused when explaining in the previous post.</div></div><hr />

If you are running it in 1280x1024, then yeah, the &quot;frame&quot; won't fit.  If you are running it in the 1024x768 (or 800x600) that it is currently supporting, then the &quot;frame&quot; should fit around the viewing area nicely.  Remember that this is set up using the viewport command.</div></div><hr />

If you are running it in the 1024x768 (or 800x600) that it is currently supporting, then the &quot;frame&quot; should fit around the viewing area nicely.  Remember that this is set up using the viewport command.  <br />

Lol Yep that would explain it, due to lack of sleep I'm sure i would have seen that before I posted it...Ah well :o</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you made your GROUP and PET window selections from the CHOICES file you used the &quot;Healer&quot; version of the Pet Window - and the &quot;Healer&quot; version of the Group Window.<br />
<br />
Replace your current EQUI_GroupWindow.xml file with the one called &quot;EQUI_GroupWindow - Blank Side&quot; in your CHOICES file. Be sure to rename it first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have mix-and-match UIs for most of my toons - except for my Cleric and my Shaman...I cannot think of a better UI than this one for these classes.<br />
<br />
The only possible change I can think of would be an optional compass alternative in the CHOICES file. One that had the &quot;+,-&quot; indicators on it. I use Athee's Loc Wizard with all my UIs but remain a hopeless &quot;Loc-Tard&quot;.<br />
<br />
I tried swapping out the windows_pieces_04 file with one from a compass that had the +/- indicators...but it didnt work.<br />
<br />
Other than that this UI is perfect. Great job.</div></div><hr />

Are you using the 800x600 resolution files I provided?  There are two seperate sets, one for 1024x768 and one for 800x600.  I know the 800x600 fits, as that is the resolution my daughter is running in.<br />

Working on it friend, working on it.  Get bogged down on days like yesterday and today when things go haywire with patches and whatnot, not to mention my life outside the computer *grin*.<br />
<br />
That will be one of my next tweaks, to make sure that the various classanimations and spellbars of tking/remmy will all play nice.  However, at the moment, some of them won't.  Sorry =/</div></div><hr />

Okay, given that you are a necro, I'd say it is a pretty safe bet that you want the pet control buttons.<br />
<br />
So, you have two choices:  Pet - Plain, and Pet - Healer.  The - Healer has the additional F1 M(ana) F2-F5 sphere gauges to help healers see when group mates are in trouble and get them targetted fast to throw heals at them, as well as the pet control buttons.  The - Plain has the pet control buttons, but doesn't have the healer-helper gauges.<br />
<br />
Either way, you are going to have the Pet bar across the center of the screen above the chat windows, so you then want to pick the Group - BlankSide to make the bottom lefthand corner graphic.<br />
<br />
Re the spellbook, aye, I said that I didn't include spellbook or any spell/buff icons.  There is a link on the first post to t.king's site, where you can choose what you want, or you can choose spellbooks and icons from others as well (many options posted here at EQInterface also).<br />
<br />
Hope that helped explain it a bit better.</div></div><hr />

PetInfo  Healer has all of the pet control buttons, pet name and hp bar, PLUS has the additional F1-F6 Sphere Gauges for ease of targeting to heal self or group members.<br />

I tried to install the newest T King inventory today... his updated g2 one... and it made your UI revert to the default UI. I was just curious if I did something wrong, or if that the two just arent compatible yet.  <br />
<br />
They aren't compatible, yet.  That is, in fact, exactly what I am working on today, now that I have the 1280x1024 released.<br />

<br />
I am a Druid and I heal and use a Pet.  Is there a way to have the line bar with F keys and still have a pet box that gives the bottom left hand corner?<br />
<br />
I now have the bottom corner graphics but I no longer have access to a pet box.  If I choose a pet box I either get another line bar with F keys and no bottom left hand graphics or I get just a pet box and no graphics... <br />
<br />
I am so close and this is a great interface, just need some hand holding I guess to work out the kink.<br />
<br />
I would like the Group bar with F keys, and a pet box that still gives me a bottom left corner grahic.</div></div><hr />

1 and 2 go together.  Either the Group - BottomLeftCorner or the Pet - BottomLeftCorner ... makes the BottomLeftCorner graphic. ;)<br />
<br />
3.  Open your EQUI_ChatWindow.xml file using a text editor (Word, WordPerfect, NotePad, etc.)<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the file you will see:<br />
<br />
  &lt;Screen item=&quot;ChatWindow&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;RelativePosition&gt;false&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
    &lt;Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;X&gt;95&lt;/X&gt;<br />
      &lt;Y&gt;280&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;421&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;200&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Transparent&gt;true&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
    &lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Rounded&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;true&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Closebox&gt;true&lt;/Style_Closebox&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Minimizebox&gt;true&lt;/Style_Minimizebox&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Border&gt;false&lt;/Style_Border&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Sizable&gt;true&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;CW_ChatOutput&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;CW_ChatInput&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
  &lt;/Screen&gt;<br />
<br />
The line I have in bold, change that to read &quot;false&quot;.<br />
<br />
4.  To move the lag meter, you have to adjust the /viewport settings.  What resolution do you run in?  I can tell you what to change them too, when you tell me your reso, but realize that by changing them, the entire view will move up and left, and hence be hidden behind the music player across the top, and the selector window down the side.<br />

Right click on whatever window you want to change the font in.  Choose &quot;always chat here&quot;.  Then use the in-game command to change it.<br />

I'm also glad the spell cast bar and buff windows are not part of the &quot;frame&quot;, as I can't stand buff names being cut off and I like having a casting bar that shows the spell names next to the icons.  Hopefully I'll be able to just replace these with the ones I'm used to having.<br />
<br />
BTW this was asked about 8 pages ago, but...<br />
primal65 and CergeProtector - I have *no* idea why it would be dropping you to desktop when you log out to char select screen, as I made no changes to those files, and it isn't happening to me. Weird. =/ <br />
My guess is that these people have their SoL models off, and were camping and forgetting to get rid of their horse before doing so.  I've done it a lot myself as I sometimes forget.  The result is a LD/crash to desktop or to server select.<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks again for the awesome UI.  Is the main download updated with today's changes, or do we have to also download your above patch?<br />

*Edit: another question:  I notice you have the file window_pieces04.tga included in your download.  Won't today's patch (which changed this file) mess up something with your UI?</div></div><hr />

Neat, never knew that about the horses, that'll be something for me to suggest for folks to check.<br />
<br />
No, the main download isn't updated with today's changes, you *will* need to grab the patch above.  Set it up first with the main download, then replace the one file (EQUI_Animations.xml) with today's patched one.<br />
<br />
(Heh, patch day, Dolby, Kudane, Sokol, Kelric and I are swamped.  Last thing I'm gonna do is ask one of them to update a mod in the download area, easy enough for folks to grab it here.  Plus, with another patch coming on Thursday ... ;) )</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I also have another thing you might wish to look at.  I've been looking for a more recent screenshot, but all the ones I've seen seem to have an error in the window selector box, replicating the &quot;buff&quot; icon (arm) instead of the &quot;bard buff&quot; icon (musical note).<br />
<br />
Make sure all the references to that button in the EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml file read A_SongBtnNormal, A_SongBtnPressed, etc. and it should fix it (if you hadn't spotted it already).</div></div><hr />

Aye, I will be making sure that this works, however I have been out of the house the entire day due to family needs, so I haven't even had a chance to log in as of yet and see what the problems may be.<br />

Re your mp3 window, do you have sounds turned off outside of EQ?  If you have sounds disabled using anything other than the in-game options window, you can't open the mp3 player.<br />

I know you're busy and I'll try to get this brief.  I hope I'm not doing something stupid but I followed your directions in the readme file to a 'T' and just have a quick question.  Is there a group window without the little Romelio color circles?  I tried everyone on that their the same for me... did I screw something up?  I use the circles in the Pet Window and the ones in the group window are a little redundant, that and they take up part of each groupmember's name.<br />

If you have sounds disabled using anything other than the in-game options window, you can't open the mp3 player.<br />

Not that I know .... in all other games Sound works bin in EQ no Sound at all. Even after I turned it on again with ...  /music on ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1- Using the group healer window, those invite and disband buttons don't work for me. When I click them I simply lose my target.<br />
<br />
2- The window selector and pet bottomleft pieces move a few pixels left every time I zone. Wheter I lock them or not. If left alone for to many zones they go completely off my screen.<br />
<br />
Last, using 800x600 what would the viewport command have to be? annoying having the net stats over the other things.<br />
And would recommend finding a smaller cast window to go with 800x600 this one takes a lot of space.</div></div><hr />

It is happening to just about everyone.  The only thing I can say is to right click on the edge of any windows that are sliding, choose &quot;unlock&quot; and slide them back over to the right a bit.  SOE is aware of the problem and hopefully a fix will be coming soon.<br />
<br />
Re smaller castspell windows, Version 2 should be much kinder in the support of other cast windows, it will be out shortly.  In the meantime, post your UIError.txt log file in the Help forum and we can try to figure out where the difficulty lies in switching in a new one.<br />
<br />
dethnyte - If you are talking about the combined target/player/group window, no I don't currently have one out that doesn't include the sphere gauges.  You say that they are overlapping the name somewhat ... did you get the updated one?  You can find a link for it in the first post.<br />
<br />
- re the hotbuttons.  I know a lot of folks are used to using them on the left side of the screen.  I was that way myself.  What I was attempting to do, however, was to keep anything that people mouse-click in one general area of the screen (right and bottom) to make that a bit easier.  In order to move them to the left, I'd have to alter .... ummm .... at least 3 different windows, possibly more, I'd have to really look into it to know for sure.  At this point in time I can't promise that I will change that, but if time allows, I'll consider it.<br />
<br />
Xaraz - That is rather strange, about the group healer not accepting the invite/disband buttons.  They work fine on mine.  :confused:<br />
<br />
- re the /viewport, did you use one of the .ini files I included?  Instructions on how to use it are included in the ReadMe file.  It'll set up the /viewport for you.<br />
<br />
Imp666 - If you have sounds turned off outside of EQ, using the /music on command in game won't do a thing for you.  Do you have sounds turned on here:<br />

Buttons really don't work here, so I use the ones with sit/stand button list or my keyboard. Not much of a big deal but rather strange that they don't work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am using tk_vert4spellbar.zip from Remelios site.  I read the changes to animations.  I then edit your animations.. I remove the parts that look similar to what is in the changes to animation file.  I put the changes to animations in your animations.  <br />
<br />
I then copy EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml, Tkspellbar.tga and tkspellgem.tga to the folder with your UI in it.<br />
<br />
I load up and I get thrown to default.  I get this from my UIErrors.txt file (disregarded the normal stuff goin to default for files)  I am sure this is something stupid on my part.  I am not a programmer but usually I can get mix and matches to work.. I think though that yours if the first complete UI that I have worked with is where I do not know the interrelations (like why hotbuttons are in the error messages) between all your files and this one change.    I also cannot seem to get an inventory to work in here either but that is less pressing until more get the Inventory window up to EQ snuff.<br />
<br />
Any help you can offer me to help me understand this stuff and make this work would be MUCH appreciated....  Great work and thank you in advance.  Let me know if you need my email for any reason.<br />

<br />
You did replace the UI_CharacterName_Server#.ini file, not the CharacterName_Server#.ini file, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaraz</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep UI one. But just noticed on other chars friend list is wiped to as well as hotkeys. I think someone here is gonna get a lesson in flying...<br />
Will see if I can find information for viewport in the ini and type it in eq itself....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/nod, that's what I thought the problem was.  It'll behave much better in version 2, but in the mean time:<br />
<br />
Okay first, you don't need to change anything in the animations file.  Instead, what you need to do is to modify the hotbutton file.<br />
<br />
Open EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml using your text editor.  Do a Search or Find function to find:<br />
<br />
    &lt;SpellGemDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
      &lt;Holder&gt;TK_SpellGemHolder&lt;/Holder&gt;<br />
      &lt;Background&gt;A_SquareBtnNormal&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
      &lt;Highlight&gt;TK_SpellGemHighlight&lt;/Highlight&gt;<br />
    &lt;/SpellGemDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
  &lt;/SpellGem&gt;<br />
<br />
You need to change it so that it is this instead:<br />
<br />
		&lt;SpellGemDrawTemplate&gt;	<br />
&lt;Holder&gt;A_SpellGemHolder&lt;/Holder&gt;<br />
	&lt;Background&gt;A_SquareBtnNormal&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
&lt;Highlight&gt;A_SpellGemHighlight&lt;/Highlight&gt;<br />
		&lt;/SpellGemDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
You will need to do that 10 times, one for each slot that you could be putting a spellgem hotkey.</div></div><hr />

I see what you mean about the group names now, I'll tweak it a bit, look for an improvement in Version 2 (will be out shortly).<br />
<br />
That pet sphere gauge is rather messed up, isn't it?  I'll try to figure out what the problem is with it.<br />
<br />
(You see Cairenn running off calling &quot;Ohhhhh Rrrrreeeeemmmmmmyyyyyy?!&quot; since those sphere gauges are his to begin with)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PingGuy</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I was originally running 800x600 but it's just so darned small.  Since I have an old Geforce2 card I can't really run 1024x768 because it's dog slow.  My compromise was to run in 960x???, I forget the exact res but it's something like that.<br />
<br />
I didn't even try using a custom UI until last night and I found the lastest update of Ssoth's UI to work pretty well.  It's actually not updated by Ssoth anymore but there's a person on shadowknight.org that keeps it going.  Since I'm an SK it just made sense. :)<br />
<br />
I'm tempted to just start poking around here and learning so I can piece one together myself.  I like most of what I have now but I have yet to see a spell bar that I liked in any of the UI's I have viewed.<br />
<br />
It seems like you do a lot of work around here, you still get time to actully play the game right? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gilantril</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, thank you.  I really like this UI and use it now on both my accounts for my mains...Druid and Warrior.  <br />
<br />
Second, I want to apologize beforehand if someone has pointed this out to you and it has been corrected prior (25 pages of posts are a lot for me to sift through hehe).  Since I only downloaded it last night I will assume that it is still an issue.<br />
<br />
Issue:  My druid uses the Pet Bar with the 6 healing gems designed to enable fast targetting and has 1024x768 for the resolution.  The second healing/targeting gem (ie F2) does not point to the second group member but rather to the MANA BAR.  Can you tell me how to correct this please?<br />
<br />
<br />
Again thank you and Well Done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasus</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow Cairenn You are GREAT!<br />
<br />
I did a Find and replace on those lines that needed replacing and POOF it works!  Thank you for taking the time to show me how to fix it myself -- That is how I learn..   So the reason for my erro was because the names associated with putttin a spell icon on a hotbutton were different.   Now it makes sense.. <br />
<br />
I am learning slowly but surely.  Thank you ever so much.<br />
<br />
(I too have the same problem with the names and the pet bubble... I just figured I had donesomething to cause that.. glad to know it wasnt anything I did)</div></div><hr />

In your screen shot you have the newer spell icons, the cooler looking ones, but in my UI I have the ugly original ones. Is there an option I missed somewhere? or do I download them seperatly. Sorry if someone has asked this before, but there were 26 pages to look at :D).<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: I just went back to the first post and saw in BRIGHT red letters that spell icons were not included. sorry :p</div></div><hr />
