<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benevelent</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I have done this only a few times but the problem is I haven't attempted and succesfully succeeded doing a custom UI load in forever b/c I've been to busy working.  Now I have a wizard skin that we had on our guild site(before things hit the ditch), and I love it but b/c of the new patches I am forced to get a new one.  Not a problem, I'm ok with that.  The problem is that when I try to load the AYA UI I don't know what I'm doing wrong.   I download the file.  Create a new file in my UI folder under Everquest.  I take the default UI and copy it over to the Folder, then I extract the new UI into the folder and &quot;yes to all&quot; for replacing the files and boom, as far as I know I should be able to load it now.   NO JOY!!!  Not working... don't know what I'm doing wrong... HELP HELP HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... sigh... Ty for your time.<br />
