<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roger Sewell</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well after a few days of looking over all the problems with the Target Indicator, this is what I have found.<br />
<br />
1)  Target Indicator is not going to work with these Video Cards:  (All Unsupported with EQ)<br />
<br />
     A)  ATI Rage Pro<br />
     B)  Intel Onboard  (828**)<br />
     C)  Rage Mobility  (Laptop)<br />
     D)  TnT2<br />
<br />
I'm sure that I'm missing a few, but you can find a complete list of supported video cards HERE (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/ts_video.jsp)<br />
<br />
2)  We're looking into an issue with the Radeon 9600 cards that dont' seem to be displaying the Target Indicator.  If you have a Radeon 9600, take a look in your DBG.txt file in your EverQuest directory and see if you have this line:<br />
<br />
Forcing No TnL in t3dEnumDevices().<br />
<br />
If you do see this line, then you have what we're looking into at this time.  Please be patient with us as we try to resolve this problem as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
At this time, if you have a Radeon 9600 card, I'm suggesting you add the line:  UseTNL=1  ...to your EQClient.ini file to see if that helps.  Thank you all for the assistance in resolving this matter.</div></div><hr />

The error line above (force no TNL) occurs in my dbg.txt file, no matter what I set UseTNL to (tried TRUE, FALSE, 1 and 0).

<br />
Not to be a stickler, but does that quote include all Radeon Mobility chips, because:<br />
<br />
http://www.ati.com/products/comparisons/mobilitycomparison.html<br />
<br />
The original Mobility doesn't support hardware TNL it seems, but it looks like the m7500 (which is what the poster had) and m9600 do.<br />
<br />
Although, it looks like the ring indicator is an ATI specific problem, and usually when these things get fixed up for the desktop cards, the laptop cards follow in suit, regardless of their supported status or not.<br />
<br />

It sucks to be a broke white boy nowadays. I've had a Riva TNT2 for a good while because it's played all the games I wanted it to.. But it's not supported, and I can't get a better one.<br />
<br />
You're telling me there is NO possible way it can run the 3D Target Ring? I even went and designed my own, hehe... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Appears to be an issue with the ATI Radeon 9600 series and the target ring. Roger started a thread at the EQ Live tech support forum regarding this. He has requested that anyone with issues with the target ring post the video card that they are using and the drivers that they are using in this (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/048067.html) thread. He has also posted a possible fix and asked that we try the fix before posting (link for the fix is in his post.)<br />
In some kinda famous words from Roger, Tech support is aware of the problem and is looking into it. (Not an exact quote, but pretty darn close.)<br />
<br />
On the same issue, a separate but possible fix is using a program called 3DAnalyzer, the discussion is in this (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/048051.html) thread. Haven't logged in myself since before the patch due to other issues, but I will probably be adding myself to the list (using ATI Radeon 9600 PRO.)<br />
<br />
Well GL all resolving this issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did copy the important files to my custom UI, reboot, click option to show ring in options of course... ring does NOT show...<br />
<br />
I load default UI, make sure right options clicked, I reboot, ring does NOT show...<br />
<br />
I delete default, repatch to get new files... I reboot... Ring does NOT show...<br />
<br />
I download latest video drivers from NVidia, latest DirectX etc... Reboot... ring does NOT show...<br />
<br />
I delete all the other UI's with only default left... reboot.... ring does NOT show...<br />
<br />
I pull all my hair out depressed about all the lost time fooking around with this feature, which obviously does work for other GF4 Ti4200 users... the ring does NOT show...<br />
<br />
Any advice? Obviously it isnt all about the type of your graphic card...<br />

One thing you may want to look for, this has been happening tome.  My target ring is appearing only in the wrong place.  <br />
<br />
My target ring doesn't appear around what I'm targeting but way out in space either above or below me.   In air tonight on the bride leading towards Avatar of Smoke I targeted something and noticed the yellow ring hovering in the air above me to my left.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will allow people to gain more insight.  I've had this happen a number of times tried every post I read on tips to try and no change.<br />

It WORKS on:<br />

Windows98 with Radeon 7200<br />

The problem may platform specific (XP Vs. 98-ME) for ATI users at least.  The only time I've seen the target ring fail on Windows98 was with an old ATI 128 Pro with 32mb video ram.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catweazel</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like many people I have been unable to get the target 3D ring working until today.<br />
<br />
The solution for me was to use the 3D Analyze utility (http://www.tommti-systems.com)<br />
<br />
Need to enter the Device ID and Vendor ID number obtained from the ATIInfo utility ( http://www2.ati.com/drivers/ati-util-may2003.exe) in decimal format - the ATI utility reported the deice ID info for me in hex format which I had to convert.<br />
<br />
Other settings:<br />
Force SW TnL setting checked (3DA prog)<br />
Application executable - eqgame.exe<br />
Application pre-start - EverQuest.exe<br />
<br />
UseTNL=TRUE (eqclient.ini)<br />
<br />
This fix apparently works fine for other ATI cards.....<br />
Not perfect but it works ok<br />
<br />
Without this 3D-Analyze software I was unable to get any 3D ring at all with a lot of playing around. The ATI Mobility Radeon 7500 card I am using has 32Mb memory.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps somebody else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EliasCZ</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I know lots of things I tried was prolly silly stuff, yet by now, I believe its about something silly really...<br />
<br />
My comp = AMD XP 1900, GF4 Ti4200, 1gig Ram, Win XP<br />
<br />
3D targeting circle does NOT work after I tried all this :<br />
<br />
note: in between all these actions I did reboot my computer and customized the files offline AND online (just in case it would matter)<br />
<br />
1. copy new patch UI files to custom folder<br />
2. running only Default UI<br />
3. using a custom UI with which people see circle<br />
4. copy the new .xml .ini .tga files from someone who can see the circle<br />
5. delete all my chars setting just in case it would somehow matter what char you log in to test it with *shrug*<br />
6. getting all the new video drivers and directX<br />
<br />
And THEN I figured out why it DOES NOT WORK....<br />
<br />
I went to my eqclient.ini file (which is located in your main EQ dir.... you open it and scroll down the the line which says ....<br />
<br />
UseTnl=FALSE<br />
<br />
you then change it to <br />
<br />
UseTnl=TRUE<br />
<br />
it seems that the button in options is bugged and for some reason doesnt change this option (dont take my word on it, but according to people, this should be the one option in your eqclient.ini that should be changed when you switch the 3D targetign circle button in your options)<br />
<br />
Either way, after I did this, the 3D targeting circle appeared right after I logged in, I hope this will solve problems for all that cant make it work....<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<br />
UseTnl=TRUE<br />
<br />
mine was located right above ShowGrass=TRUE and below Useumbral=TRUE<br />
<br />
If this still doesnt help you, you have prolly one of the cards currently not supported (my friend tried what I told him, yet it didnt work for him with his Radeon 9000 Pro)<br />

It should be a soft swirling halo effect under the target's feet.  What it does at times is become a hard edged solid-colored donut instead.  <br />

If I log totally out of EQ and restart it, I can get the soft swirling halo back, but it's very annoying to have to keep doing this.</div></div><hr />

I have no Idea if this is in any way related to the target problems people are having, I am REALY new to custom UIs. Its just another posability that may or may not be worth looking at.<br />

<br />
Additional Information<br />
The DirectX 9.0b runtime cannot be uninstalled. We recommend Windows Me and Windows XP users create a &quot;System Restore&quot; point before installing. <br />
<br />
So basically, I can't even TEST to see if it's DirectX causing all my frustration.</div></div><hr />

This of course was after I tried the suggestions here to get the 3d targeting ring to work.  After installing the driver, restarting, etc., I tried to log on to EQ.  I got an error message saying no 3d devices available.<br />
<br />
I ran dxdiag and there wasn't even an option to test 3d drawing.  So I looked around in the ATI settings and sure enough 3D acceleration and all that stuff is there.<br />
<br />
Basically, ATI said 3D was going and working fine but dx9 didn't notice it!  I tried a rollback to the previous driver and I still had the same problem.  I ended up having to use Restore (Win XP Pro) to the previous day to get the old driver working again and to get back on EQ. <br />
<br />
Anyone else with DirectX 9.0b upgrade their Radeon 9600 driver and have this problem?  More importantly, how do I fix it?  Even if it doesn't fix the 3d targeting rings, I'd like to have the latest video card driver on my machine.<br />

Running AMD 1700+ with ATI 9600 Pro and DirectX 9.0b under Win XP Home. Video driver version 6.14.0010.6368 (not the latest, the late June/July driver version. This was the recommended driver from the EQ Live site, at least it was last week.)<br />
I am able to get the target ring when I run EQ through 3D Analyze (w/ Vendor ID 1002, Device ID 4150 and Force Software TnL checked under DirectX 8.1 and 9.0 Options, performance.) I do have some graphic anomalies that seem to be related to the target ring when in melee range (very occasional flickering) but it does work.</div></div><hr />

In your 'default' directory, there should be TargetIndicator.ini and TargetIndicator.tga files. Just copy them to your custom directory, log in to EQ, and make sure the target indicator is on. It should be there.</div></div><hr />

My shrunken horse and I are pushing up against a wall to see beyond and into the sky, that's where the targeting halo appears.  That computer is running at 800x600, so yes it's small :p... but it changes color with the target, it's definitely the targeting ring out in space.<br />
<br />
When the player behind me was walking closer to me, the target halo moved SW on my screen until it fell off altogether when he was close.<br />

I am using the card in a Sony Viao Desktop using a PIV 1.7Ghz chip and 512 megs of ram.  I'm using the very latest release of the nVida driver set.  I'm running DirectX Version 9.0b (build 4.09.0000.0902). <br />
<br />
I'm sorry that my earlier post irritated you.  <br />
<br />
I've not seen any of the misbehavior that plauges so many other users.  I offer the specs above in the hopes that one of those items will be different for you, and help point the way to a solution.</div></div><hr />

i used the 3d analyzer fix it fixes the rings but cause intense screen flicker .. not really a solution if it causing a flicker problem like that...<br />
<br />
hope Sony has found a fix to this issue .. maybe sony should contact ati and work at a fix together for this ..<br />

Ring works fine on my Nvidia machines but looks terrible on the ATI.  Funny thing is, I logged on to test and the ATI machine looked like the Nvidias (i.e. displayed the ring and drew it correctly) and when I patched back to live it is broken again.</div></div><hr />

I have a 9200 card, and have the same problem. The error line above (force no TNL) occurs in my dbg.txt file, no matter what I set UseTNL to (tried TRUE, FALSE, 1 and 0). I placed it in the [Defaults] section, this the right place?  <br />
<br />
I have this card also and the same problems. Tried that with other fix's including reinstalling after deleting even the hidden files and folders. Still no targeting ring.</div></div><hr />

I have an ATI Radeon 7500.  It is NOT a Mobility card.  I play on a desktop.<br />
<br />
I can see the 3D target ring...sorta.  I see part of it, the inner part, the outer half of the ring is sliced off.<br />
<br />
Has there been any progress toward fixing this particular problem?  Because I am not seeing anything here that seems to address this card and/or problem.  <br />
<br />
I've got the same card, with EXACTLY the same problem. With something targetted ( even myself ) I get flashing white as I turn, and if I switch to 3rd person view I can see long shards of light ( pieces of the outer ring I imagine ) shooting off into space.<br />
<br />
Just to reiterate: this is the DESKTOP Radeon 7500. <br />
<br />
I tried UseTNL=1 , I tried 3D Analyze, nothing seems to help. 3D Analyze actually made the problem more visible, if anything.<br />
<br />
I wish Sony would at least SAY if they're looking into it or not. If they're ignoring it, let us know and we'll all shut it off and wait till we upgrade video cards. If they are, they could toss us a bone or something. <br />
<br />
There have been very few replies on the Tech boards at Sony, at least when I looked today I didn't see anything new posted from Sony reps in quite awhile. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rykahna</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My problem isn't that I use a Radeon because I need to upgrade my video card.  The Radeon IS my upgrade, because ya know those NVidia cards?  The ones that are actually supported for EQ?  The damn game wouldn't RUN when I had mine installed.  Would crash every 5 minutes, and that is NOT an exaggeration.  It had something to do with the combo VIA Chipset mainboards and Nvidia cards and 3D games using DirectX, according to what research I did, but EQ Tech Support pretty much washed their hands of me and said it must be a &quot;hardware problem.&quot;  Heh.  Yeah, the problem was that I was using the video card they DO support.  Installed a Radeon and voila! no crashes.<br />
<br />
However...now it means lopped off target ring and yes, flashy, streaky lines all over the place.  But at least I can play...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't mean &quot;upgrade&quot; in the sense of &quot;change from Radeon&quot; ... I did a lot of research before I bought my Radeon and it was my upgrade as well. Bang-for-Buck, you get a lot more out of a Radeon then NVidia ( assuming you use your system for ANYTHING else aside from EQ ). <br />
<br />
I meant more like &quot;eventually I'll need to get something new, and hopefully by then whatever I choose will work better&quot;.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

I wasn't.  The word &quot;upgrade&quot; just stuck out at me as being ironic in light of my own circumstances.  If I &quot;upgraded&quot; to the card EQ does support, I wouldn't be playing EQ anymore.  Unless I also &quot;upgrade&quot; my mainboard, and if that happens, its going to be an expensive process, because at such a time as I do that, I'm going P4 rather than AMD and going with DDR RAM, so it will entail a new processor and memory as well.</div></div><hr />

Yes, and I actually have tried that fix, changing the TextureScale to 1.0.  It is now a REALLY small ring, and very pixelated, but its there (using The One Ring mod) and somewhat blurred.  But the pics Togras and Darkmatil posted where the outside of the ring is just shaved off?  Yeah, that would be the problem.</div></div><hr />

In the message that starts :<br />
<br />
Here's the way my majestic ring and default ring looks on my ATI 9800 pro without the &quot;fix&quot; above. This is how they look without me doing anything to them:<br />
<br />
<br />
The second picture with the smaller &quot;default&quot; circle with the hard edge... that's what I see. <br />
<br />
I haven't tried a TextureScale fix, but I'll give it a quick shot. My bet is that it won't work though :( <br />
<br />
EDIT: Tried it and had no effect at all... am I missing something? I copied the TargetIndicator.ini to my custom UI folder and made all the changes and completely restarted EQ<br />
<br />
But thanks for the pointer!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I patched and ran on the Test server today for a few minutes to look at the new melee skills window, and lo and behind, the target ring worked there. Not perfect, I still get some flashing, but it worked.<br />
<br />
I noticed a new TargetIndicator.ini loaded and a new graphics DLL ... <br />
<br />
I'll play more tomorrow with that... off to bed for now. Just thought I'd point that out...</div></div><hr />

<br />
the problem is my 3D inicator but also my drivers i guess ,<br />
 i could see the 3D indicator with my old drivers on my Radeon 7000 video card , then something happened and i had to reinstall windows 2kpro and all of the programs including EQ , downloaded the new drivers for it and my computer would totally reboot itself if i tried to move in game or traget anything . After ALOT of research i finally found a kit from microsoft that lets me play now and changed the name from radeon 7000 to radeon 7000/ radeon VE . I can play now but the drivers are not micrsoft  digitaly signed now for some reaason and i cant see the 3D target indicator. Is there a driver anyone knows about that i can use that will get me back to the way it used to be ? or anything else i can try to get the 3D indicator to work ? I've tried all the suggestions above , EQ chat help and alot of different sites just cant get it to work .<br />
<br />
Thanks ahead of time for your time in reading this and for any help i receive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dantilus</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, <br />
<br />
Based on a post on EQLive tech support site, they seem to have a fix for ATI Radeon 9600Pro cards as well as probably others. If You havent tried this yet you may want to if you are having the previously mentioned problems.<br />
<br />
Patch the Test Files by running TestEverQuest.exe - Allow it to download the file &quot;eqgfx_dx8.dll&quot; then you can cancel the patcher if you want.<br />
<br />
Browse to your Everquest folder, usually C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest, find the file named &quot;eqgfx_dx8.dll&quot; and Right click and choose Copy. Paste that file somewhere you can find it easily, because atm the Live patcher overwrites it with a older non-functioning for ATI Radeon cards version. Keep both Folder windows open for the next step.<br />
<br />
Run your Live everquest and allow the patcher to run. When It completes copy the eqgfx_dx8.dll that you saved in the past step BACK into the C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest folder and choose to Overwrite the existing folder. <br />
<br />
Now choose Play and go check out that Targetting Window.<br />
<br />
Just some information - I am running a 2.0ghz AMD XP+, 1gb PC3500 Ram, and ATI Radeon 9600Pro in 8X Agp, DirectX 9.0B, and one version Previous for ATI drivers and the targetting ring works fine for me now.<br />

1) Target Indicator is not going to work with these Video Cards: (All Unsupported with EQ)<br />
<br />
A) ATI Rage Pro<br />
B) Intel Onboard (828**)<br />
C) Rage Mobility (Laptop)<br />
D) TnT2<br />
<br />
I'm sure that I'm missing a few, but you can find a complete list of supported video cards HERE<br />
<br />
I must be missing something very simple here.  TnT2 is listed as one that will not work and unsupported.  BUT, when I click the link to view supported cards on the SOE website, it lists the TnT2 card.  <br />
<br />
Obviously, my target ring will not work or I wouldn't care.  Anyone care to point out the obvious to me please?</div></div><hr />

I just used it to make the targeting ring on my mobility card. just because someone dosnt have many posts dosnt mean they dont know what they are talking about, also just because someone has 3000+ posts dosnt mean you should trust them. if you think the file is a virus use a virus scanner like mcafee or nortans, or if you are cheap use a free one like Trend Micro (http://housecall.trendmicro.com/). as for spyware I just install whatever damned the spyware and run adaware nightly to do an anual cookie clean along with spyware checkk make sure I havent picked up any, though I am paranoid and you can probaly run it just after you install something.</div></div><hr />
