<br />
We have all the seen the large amount of fake items in EQ lately. Tonight I was introduced to the fact that you can actually fake a link in game. Maybe you could do it for a long time, but I just saw it today.<br />
<br />
I can see how to create the fake info window, what I do not see how to do is hijak the button that creates the link.<br />
<br />
From what I see the only 2 pieces to the item info window are the description (presumably a text box generated by the server) and the link button (whose function is generated by the server as well I assume).<br />
<br />
So how are people able to manipulate what data that button links to?<br />
<br />
I ask because it seems to me a pretty big security hole in EQ if you can cause the server to perform a function it wasn't designed for. Opens up some nasty doors that IMO should be fixed.<br />
<br />
So my intent here is to find out how to do it and submit a (or possibly just A-nother) bug report to get it fixed. Any help would be appreciated..</div></div><hr />
