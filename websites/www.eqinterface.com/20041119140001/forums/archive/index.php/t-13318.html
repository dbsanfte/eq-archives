<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mafoo</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As most peopel know my mods are normally code related and don't normally come with graphics mods, however i am turning my hand to creating a complete set *gulp* specific for the two classes i use and the 1600x1200 screen res i run in as i have lots of screen realestate i want to use it best i can.<br />
<br />
My problem lies with Corel's Photo Paint 12 (came with corel Draw 12 that i have to do some of my DTP work)<br />
<br />
i very much like corel applications  (dispite the ocational bug) and would like to use photo paint to do my tga work, however i have run into a problem that i hope someone can help me with<br />
i cannot seem to get the images to export with a correct transparency, i have remove the background as a layer and when exporting as anyother transparency supported image format it works however when i save out as tga it does not do the transparency. my esential question is can someoen tell me what i am doing wrong when exporting/saving out the tga, or of any command line app (similar to the Gd2 tools) that i can use to convert the file (although i would prefer to beable to correctly export in photo paint)<br />
<br />
if you can understand my rambles i would apreciate any help</div></div><hr />

There are a few who have a figured it out, but from what i understand it's a painstaking problem.</div></div><hr />

When I export or save as, I make sure I have the area masked out properly and export.  When asked, make sure you select &quot;normal&quot;, not enhanced mode.<br />

Hope that helps.<br />
