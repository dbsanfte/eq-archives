<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I was monitoring the serverwide.eqgui:eqgui channel and got a cry for help.  The person was having problems with the new bug window.  Since they were running a small network, they were using 1 machine to swap the files on the other.<br />
<br />
However, the bugwindow.xml (12/4/02 version) was still causing an error and failing to load skins.   <br />
uierrors.txt -  ERROR - CLASS::ITEM A_CHECKBOX_&lt;I forget- there was more :)&gt;<br />
<br />
essentially, the EQ executable had started (using the old bug window),  the person then swapped in the new bugwindow.xml.  However, because the EQ executable did not START with the class definition it was UNABLE to make the new assisgnment at the /loadskin event.  Therefore, even though the person properly replaced the XML file on the fly, they still needed to actually leave and restart Everquest for the CLASS::ITEM to be initialized.  Once the person quit and restarted, everything loaded just fine.<br />
<br />
Since I myself don't have 2 computers networked, could someone else here verify/confirm this behavior.</div></div><hr />
