I made a hotbutton window with custom graphics.  Then I made a combat ability window with custom graphics.  Now, separaetly, they work just dandy.  If I try to load them at the same time though, it switches to the default skin.  My UIErrors.txt log shows a &quot;duplicate item&quot; line referencing the first &lt;TextureInfo&gt; set I have declared.  Now, these two windows share a lot of the same tga files.<br />
<br />
So, am I right in thinking that because one xml file declared the textures, the other xml file cannot/doesn't-need to declare those same textures?  Or do I need to just break down and make a custom EQUI_Animations file?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct.  You only need to define each TextureInfo item and Ui2DAnimation item once.</div></div><hr />

SO I can either have one magical XML file with the declarations, and force people to use the UI as a whole instead of being able to use it piece-meal, or I can modify the Animations xml file and scramble to fix it every time a patch comes out.  Crumbs.<br />

Thank you though for the fast response! :)</div></div><hr />

Each window could load its own copy.  It's a waste of memory since the two files are actually identical, but it does work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">supafly</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a similair idea last night when I was pondering what to do to make the UI parts interchangeable and still avoid customizing the animations and templates files.  I'm going to try make two copies of each XML file.  One copy will contain the texture info and animation tags for EVERY piece in the UI; the other will only contain the window pieces like buttons and gauges and such.  That way if someone wants only three parts of the UI, they download the master version of one of the parts, and then the bare bones versions of the other two.  I'm not sure how big that XML file for the master version will get though... I'm afraid it may be too big.</div></div><hr />
