Guild Wars (http://www.guildwars.com/) <br />
<br />
Supposedly its an MMORPG with no monthly fee(which is amazing considering the ingame screenshots). Anybody else have any information on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathos</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I think that looks awesome.  Can't wait for it to come out.<br />
<br />
Dangit, looks DX9-ish...new video card time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also linked to this through the main site: <br />
Here (http://theguildhall.itwasgg.com/index.php) <br />
<br />
look under early screenshots for more view of the actual gameplay. i'm still deciding whether i like it or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow this game sounds great. So far my favorite part is how good you are is based on skill on how to play not how much you leveled or what you got on your char. Seems to be more action based from what they say. The graphics look pretty forgiving on computers considering when its supposed to be released, except for the particle effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My experience with non pay-play games is that they are severely hacked, overrun with immature players, and poor customer service if any at all.  This game looks way too good for all that not to happen.  Don't get your hopes up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks a tad too good to be true on the surface of it. I want to keep an eye on it though. Very nice graphics, imho... much better than some upcoming games. If it does end up being a  hacker's paradise, it would be a shame.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spider</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wierd theres a server on EQEmu that is named Guildwarz wonder if same ppl run it?  Its one of the popular servers to choose from.  Just fyi hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read a review about this game in PCGamer last night. They (PCGamer) too are looking forward to the game. It was started up by three members of the Blizzard team. They said that they plan on releasing an additional expansion (if I recall correctly) every six months to keep the material fresh and exciting. They wanted people to experience the game to the fullest extent possible after seeing what current MMOG out in the market and improve on the faults to make a great game world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I imagine theres either a hidden cost of a fee or they will indeed release expansions every 6 months for like $20-$40. Hidden fee I suspect is like a service that connects to multiple online games including that one kinda like sony is doing atm if you play eq:oa, EQ, PS and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raynsmajic</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm, looks interesting, though i dont have any time to read into it as of yet...<br />
but on quick browsing, all i can say is<br />
HOT DAMN (http://www.guildwars.com/images/JPG/artwork/gwrender-004-lrg.jpg) <br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GhostRaptor</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys.  First up:  thanks for dropping by my fansite.  What I'd usually do now is answer the questions as best I can using the publically released knowledge.  But the restrictions on alpha testers talking about the game have recently been relaxed so I can do better than that :P.<br />
<br />
Firstly - there will definitely not be any hidden costs.<br />
<br />
Second - it will be extremely difficult for hackers to ruin this game due to the patching structure they've adopted.  Once a hack/bug/exploit is identified they can immediately patch the game to eliminate it.  I've seen it working, and it works very well.<br />
<br />
Third - the game is very fun, even at this stage of development.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thanks for coming by with information! That's pretty cool of you. :D<br />
<br />
If you wouldn't mind, please stop by again and give a shout when they start the enrollment for the beta test. I'd love to try this one out.<br />
<br />
fozz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GhostRaptor</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should say as well ... the graphics really are that good.  Better.  Stationary screenshots can never do justice to something that moves.<br />
<br />
The streaming content technology works exceptionally well.  Log in in the morning and run through a mission and you see a new tree type has been added, but it isn't complete yet.  Log in again in the afternoon, run through the same mission ... and those trees are complete and looking totally awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sokol</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure about guild wars, but there are now several massively multiplayer server systems out for various software developers to buy and use, this sounds like one of them, one world capable of supporting more connections then you could ever whant in one game map. So network wise it may not be bad, customer support wise may be entirely another matter, but for zero monthly fee, well worth a look I'd say.<br />
