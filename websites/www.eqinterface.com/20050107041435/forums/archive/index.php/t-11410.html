<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redmage</div><div class="date">11-28-2003, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've decided to alter a few things on a skin that I've been using for quite some time now.  Currently, I'm working with adding a small box to the left of my HP guage in the target box that will serve as the con indicator.  <br />
<br />
When working in SIDLWIDL - Everything looks A-OK.  But when I load EQ, and target something..  The color is out of the box, and seems to be defaulting to a location of 0,0.  The actual Location of the box is 3,3.   Whats going on here..   Any pointers on what I could be doing wrong?</div></div><hr />

The target indicator seems to be an auto fill type of graphic, similar to the flashing border.  <br />
<br />
To make it work, you must manually adjust the graphic definition to the size and shape (alpha channel) you want.  Then when you call it using the static animation lines, it is sized 1,1.  This makes it only show when you actually select a target.  No matter where you move it, it seems to be hard coded to start drawing (displaying) the graphic from 0,0.<br />
<br />
To see what you will get in Sidl, resize the static animation to your definition size.  This will show you how it will look in game.  But make sure to change it back to  1,1 or you will see the graphic even when you don't have someone selected.<br />

Hope that helps.<br />
