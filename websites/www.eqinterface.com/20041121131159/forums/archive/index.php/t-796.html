Thought I would post some current ss's with some mods I pulled from this site of it in action just to tease you all ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celesta</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is very nice. Two questions.<br />
<br />
1. When do you plan on a release? (Getting tired of hard coding these mods.)<br />
<br />
2. What are you using to code the editor? (Visual C, VB, Somethig else)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gendal</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The closed beta is going to be fairly short no worries, mostly just testing it on as wide variety of machines as I can so most of the gapingly large bugs are caught.<br />
<br />
It might be shareware, it might not be, I am undecided at this point. I am almost positive I will be releasing a free version at first till I feel confident in it's quality, and even after/if I make it shareware there will always be a version useable to the public. Not sure if I want to go down that road though, since that leaves me with certain obligations. Basically that's a conversation for another day, which will be quite a bit after an open beta. <br />
<br />
This is NOT a small project, the amount of code stopped being trivial a long time ago. There are a lot of features I am pretty proud of, and its wrapping up nicely atm. Short of fixing all the bugs all thats left to do before I release a buggy version to the public is the code to handle gui events(button pressing, etc) and an in program method to handle the addition of new items (not sure how I want to handle that yet really).<br />
<br />
You will need the .net framework for microsoft (about a 20mb download on windowsupdate.microsoft.com), its all been built atop that using c# with a few custom c++ dll's to handle various things. I am worried about speed/memory usage since its using gdi+, which while a high quality drawing enging, is also very slow. Actually the program runs great on my amd 1100 with 256mbs of ram, but I have no idea how it performs on lower end machines. A shareware version would probably include a directx rewrite if performance is that horrible for people. Guess we gonna find out soon =)</div></div><hr />

I am trying to learn xml, but all the tutorials i look at seem to only talk about documents, not graphics, so it's very difficult to understand what i am doing.. <br />
<br />
I only want to make small changes in some of the mods I see, but when i've tried to load what i've done.. won't load.. so I'm missing something that I should be doing....<br />
<br />
Can't wait to use something like this though.. bravo to you for undertaking such a huge task for the sake of helping others... It's so nice to know that people like you are out there!!<br />

<br />
Right now, people just use Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, UltraEdit, Notepad, XMLSpy, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dregor</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">is there any chance you could make a complete view in your viewer program as well? looking at the individual components (while helpful) doesnt really give a feel of how the whole thing is going to look.. let alone if you screwed up window locations... etc.<br />
<br />
just a thought :) <br />
<br />
btw, it looks good so far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gendal</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first thing I did was make a control that loads up several screens at once, so there will definatly be a window where you can set the screen resolution, then check or uncheck what windows you want to show up and then move/resize them to your hearts content. <br />
<br />
Actually its one of the last things I am going to do, since its also the most fun and probably easiest its driving me along to finish up all the boring mundane crap thats left. All the fun/hard stuff has been done, its just work now :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faille</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just curious how you managed to parse out the graphics from the .tga files and apply them to the skin windows (this is for visual representation in the program, not in game).  I've never done anything with skinning and am unsure how to approach that.  Is there a way to tell the program to only display a portion of the image, or does it have to create temporary copies of just that portion.  For example there is one .tga that has eight billion little interface buttons.  Do you have to create eight billion temporary files to then display, or is there a simpler way to do it.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this makes no sense, I have plenty of college-level programming experience but haven't found any reason to take it to the next level until now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gendal</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All most all graphics api's will include a function for copying a bitmap section to another bitmap, so no, you don't create tons of temporary files heh. You could always write your own if they didnt, not hard just tedious. <br />
<br />
I would start with learning games programming since they cover this topic in depth usually, with an ear towards 2d sprite management.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xguix</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow!  Verrrrrry nice!<br />
<br />
Being a developer myself I gotta ask... <br />
<br />
Is this your first .NET project?  How is C# as compared to let's say VB.NET (which I'm familliar with)?  Are you making any enterprise features (e.g.  built-in sharing of mods/skins), or is it a strictly desktop application?  What is the most difficult component for you (XML parsing, Graphic handling, etc.)? <br />
<br />
A friend of mine wrote a very similar application on VC++ for another company.  Well, it wasn't very similar, for instance the data was drawn from database (SQL Server), not XML.  But the overall structure of that application was very close to what you're creating.  It took him over a year co realease a version 1.0 (with countless betas before that of course), so I'm wondering how long you've been working on this project.<br />
<br />
From the looks of it this editor will be everyone's dreams come true.  I know I can't wait to play around with it  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ohhh. Binn wants! Can't wait for this to go live. Maybe then I will make my own mod :D  :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gendal</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been working on it about 2 weeks after the SIDL.xml was available on test. Its my 4th or 5th .net project, which includes a website (www.talismanguild.org), and several internal enterprise apps all in c# (c# = vb.net for the most part, just I like c# syntax and some minor abilities, nothing that you couldn't replicate in vb) If I was writing this in c++ with out the .net framework I would be no where near the point I am now, as of now the hardest thing was getting alpha transparent tga's into the framework. Was using a dll I found but because of licensing considerations I had to spend some time and rewrite my own c++ dll which has lost me some time. <br />
<br />
I have lots of dreams of skin sharing/filesharing/net enabled apps floating in my head but I am forcing myself to put those aside till I get something basic out and working. Right now I am concerned about gdi+'s performance. Its useable but slow while using the graphics features on less than top of the line computers, and it doesn't have to be. A solution would be a directx or gdi rewrite but that would take quite a bit of time so I have put that on the back burner. GDI+ is slow but its very nice and easy to work with. Figured I would get something usefull out first then go back later and redo the graphic part if necessary (which it probably will be).<br />
<br />
This is my first xml project, I usually work in sql too heh. This was a learning experiance to get some xml knowledge under my belt, and its gotten way out of hand =p<br />
<br />
Overall its progressing nicely, should have something basic very soon for you all to break.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gendal</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently you can add tabs, open an individual page, and add items to each page via drag and drop from a toolbox. You can click on the tabs on a tabbox and it shows the correct page etc (double click on each page to open the page editor etc). It doesn't handle scrollbars atm though, that will probably be much later.<br />
<br />
Things left to do before I release a version to the public are finish up the autostretch handling (it renders correctly, but it doesn't respons to user drag/resizing like I want it to, though you can atm set it fine using the properties editor) and finish implementing the command layer (so you all can have undo/redo/cut/copy/paste etc). Hopefully should be 1 week before private testing, and if all goes well a public release shortly (less than a week?) after that. <br />
<br />
That's assuming my work (real work =p) responsibilities don't interfere like they have been :mad: <br />
<br />
Web site is up at www.sidlwidl.com but atm there is little to no content, and will probably remain that way for awhile.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gendal</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the good news is I released a copy to some testers, and if it's even miledly useable for them I will be realising a copy to the general public. <br />
<br />
The bad news is my work load just changed drastically, and I can't devote as much time as I would like to SidlWidl. It also means I had to either sit on everything for a few months or release an early alpha now. I chose the latter, in the hopes of what I have now can be of some use. Its just not anyway near finished or optimized to the state I want it to be. Still, you can do a lot with it, even in it its current state I hope. <br />
<br />
I will still be around, and if anything is horribly broken or a quick fix could result in a lot of improvement i can do it, but for the most part work will be halted till I can catch up with 2 massive new projects at work =/</div></div><hr />

The original editor in this thread was sidlwidl - built using the .net framework from Microsoft.<br />

I still have the 0.2.9 release of the sidlwidl eidtor, and though it has it's bugs, its makes so many things very easy, though I only have one system it currently works on since I've done some .net security patches.<br />

Quite disappointed that this never went any further, because once you figured out the quirks, it made whipping up detailed customization very quick, even if you did have to hand tune it a bit afterwards...</div></div><hr />
