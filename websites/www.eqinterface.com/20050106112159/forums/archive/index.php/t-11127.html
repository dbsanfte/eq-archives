<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Son-of-a-Gun</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well here is what the gems and casting bar would look like , i will see if i can find something to stand in for a book and a delay bar. What do you guys think , if i can figure out how to make gems and to program all this i will release the gems . Finally a nuke spell icon for a nuke :D.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this is a pic made in flash and not something in EQ i need a programmer for that , help .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Son-of-a-Gun</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pls comment tell me its good or tell me it sucks . If it sucks i can stop working on it if its good i can continue just pls comment !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ziamo</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well to give comment - I like them, they are original and original is always a good thing (i.e I would never use those Pokemon gems.. but they are vry cool and original). The only thing I would suggest is using a &quot;very tiny&quot; bit more color, thoe whole thing is running together like a big bottle of mustard :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than the color thing (and yes I realize SC was not colorfull on the interface - but still), it's good stuff. I for one hope you continue and get someone to help with getting it all together, XML wise. <br />
<br />
<br />
One final note though - if you are only going to do this because others want you to, then I really dont see the point in doing it at all. Most UI developers have a passion for thier work, with or without the public consent they continue to pump out some of the most fascinating UI's around. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Son-of-a-Gun</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your comment , i made this in accordance to the real starcraft so im sorry it looks mustardish if this works i will make zerg and terran which should be much more colorful.<br />
<br />
Well i don't play Eq anymore so i want to do something to help the people and to make eq more fun . I might return to eq but for now modding seems interesting.<br />
<br />
On a side note im considering changine the gems from the spell ones to unit portraits for the sake of color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Son-of-a-Gun</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i've changed the gems so that they are colorful and easier to understand . <br />
<br />
For example you see the marine with stim pack , stim pack makes ur health and attack increase , a buff in eq . It might be a symbol for a spell which takes your hp and gives you mana still haven't decided.<br />
<br />
The fire bat with the attack symbol represents a fire spell , attack symbol to show that units attack. The symbols change based on what the spell is if i had given the bat an armor symbol it could be shield of flames.<br />
<br />
The medic with the heal symbol shows healing , simple enough.<br />
<br />
The medic with the flash bomb signifies a blinding spell or flash.<br />
<br />
More to come soon , what do you think ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steppin</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">now, those look kind of sharp  :)   <br />
try to do one with spell names too.... for us dislexics who like to see icons AND names without having to hit that alt key</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">t3t0ca19</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make the ui. So i can dl it :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Son-of-a-Gun</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i made some more gems, its a bit difficult since there are some things i that aren't in SC such as summon food so i might use a droid and put a picture of food as its icon or maybe the crystals .<br />
<br />
I added some more pictures of what the spells should look like these are the spell books which are 40x40 the gems would be the symbol by itself. I know i put the cloaking on the Dark templar that because he is always cloaked and it could represent an invisibility spell. The flying object ( forgot the name) has an eye that could be the spell which summons an eye or it could be a spell which improves eye sight.<br />
<br />
BTW im still looking for a skilled programmer to help me since the most i can probably make is gems at this rate,  i know very little about how to make a ui .<br />
<br />
Gems are updated with some more pics.</div></div><hr />
