Is it because of the attack the other week? Is it going to get better or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its been fine here... was even pritty fast when the DOS atk was going on... I've been getting 700KB/sec downloads off my roadrunner. Might want to check the status page on your ISP see if they are having any peering problems with bandwidth providers.<br />
<br />
I know XO is having some trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dkratzer</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having the same problem.  Been waiting 15 mins on one file and it's only gotten 180KB of 2.75MB....not exactly what i'd consider broadband expectations.<br />
<br />
All page loads and downloads are super sluggish for me as well.  No problems noted on ISP page and seems to be only limited to this site because rest of the web i try to access seems to be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks like the datacenter is haveing some connectivity issues ever since late last night. <br />
<br />
I'm only getting 30 - 40k/sec vs. my normal 500 - 700k/sec download.<br />
<br />
I have put in a ticket about it but no word yet.</div></div><hr />
