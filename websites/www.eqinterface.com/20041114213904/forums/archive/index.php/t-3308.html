<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggun</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I created this Skin using Abattoir and T.King graphics.<br />
<br />
I changed the layout and added abunch of things.<br />
<br />
1) All of the Inventory slots.<br />
2) Right Clickable boxes, that can be changed to any slot. (just read the rightclickys.txt<br />
3) Moved the Timer to the Group windows WITH the regular group window items. (This way you don't loose any windows for a timer)<br />
4) Made both Caster and Non-Caster versions to run in 1024x768 and 1152x864<br />
5) Made a Config Razors.bat file to do all the config work.<br />
6) Made it were you can have a stadard or Razors Edge target bar.<br />
7) Made it PATCH RESISTANT. (Should not be effected by most patches)<br />
8) Weapons slots and Ranged and Ammo.<br />
<br />
I was wondering what you peeps think of it. The zip file can be downloaded HERE (http://www.sigs.henryetta.net/eqskins/Razorsv4.zip)</div></div><hr />

<br />
first off, the thing on bottom right with stats is nice, but the thing i do not like is all the pictures of your iksar monk :p <br />
<br />
inventory screen is rather large, also. since i play on Rallos it'd be hard to bag your stuf when you know youre going to die.<br />
<br />
other than that is cool, i undertsnad how you can love your character and youre just showin him off to everyone!<br />
<br />
i'd like to see your next one, if you try at it ! POW dancing banana:nana:  POW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggun</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your kind words. To let you know, the Hotbutton window and Inventory window in the skin are WITHOUT the Iksar monk in it, that is just how I customized mine and explained in the Readme.txt how others could do the same with their toons pics. I was just showing off that you could do with the unused space in them. I understand the Inventory window being to big for a PVP conflict, but sense I am on a Care Bear server, I didn;t think of this. I will look into a smaller PVP designed Inventory and see if I come up with something nice.<br />

Again, thanks for the nice words and A Dancing Banana.<br />

I liked the graphics and thought it just needed a twist on the layout and *poof* I started to learn XML and once I figured it out, I was quite exited. I work for a week to get v1 done, and then after using it for a day or two, I come up with some changes and I had requests. So I tweaked till it became what it is today. I even brain stormed and found a way to help make it more patch resistant. Now nothing is 100%, but it would take a direct major CHANGE from Verant, in one of the windows I have moded, to make the Skin NOT work. So far it has passed all of the PoP patches unharmed. And you still get the benefits of all the additional windows &amp; changes Verant is still making for the PoP release.<br />
<br />
Glad you like it and hope it makes the game more fun for a lot of people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorndike</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the mod, but I have just one real issue.  The buff icons.  I've been using a Vert mod for a long time and I find it infinately more convenient to see the full name of the buffs listed.  This is especially helpful on raids when you need to know exactly which buffs wore off or were dispelled so you can ask for rebuffs.  Clicking on each buff to find out is annoying.  Is there a way you can seperate the buffs and list them in picture AND name?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Libbiy</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any chance you can do this in 1600x1200?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggun</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can open the spell book by using CTRL+B or /book and you can do /book (page #)<br />
<br />
ALT+M Should work for the Actions Menu, if not, you need to use ALT+O and open the options menu and go to the keyboard tab and remap it.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps you out.</div></div><hr />

It is compatable with almost everything. If you get errors, just e-mail me your  'UIErrors.txt'  file from your Everquest directory and tell me what mod your using and I will make it work.:D :D :D<br />

as far as making a 1600x1200 i don't even think my Monitor could handle that, lol sorry. :( :( :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive read around about transparencies omg what are the steps in doing that, how do I resize it or better, would a psp7 genious please resize this attached picture to make it fit the &quot;WIDTH&quot; of a 1280x1024 resoulution please I am begging you!<br />
<br />
And PLEASE make it so the white parts in the picture do not show up in game. I would praise your name forever. <br />
<br />
Bah it wont let me upload it<br />

Anyone who has seen abbitoir or Razors UI knows what Im talking about. Its the long target bar that goes above the rest of the mumbo jumbo. Please resize that bar.<br />

I only wish that I was smart enough to figure out how to make it run without the batch file (I use XP) and to work in 1280x1024.  I don't know %&amp;#^ about XML and don't plan on learning...<br />

I love your UI.. dled it and was using it fine, then comes the patch yesterday..log in and no mouse control at all. Left click does absoultely nothing..right click brings up a menu. Asked a few friends who dabble with XML and they say that they are stumped.:confused: <br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

anyway, i have a 60mage, and was thinking it would be cool if you could incorporate the Pet Window into that dead spot next to the clickies.  Tried to just lay the window on top, but anytime you click a clicky or hotkey, pet window drops behind.  Any Ideas?</div></div><hr />

You might try that, but i have yet to hear from him to find out if that worked yet. :(<br />

as far as the pet stuff, I shall mess with the xml and see if that is doable, i kinda like that idea. (Thanks) If it works out, I will added to the skin for good, lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have noticed that alot of graphics troubles have been reported from Voodoo users. Mainly Voodoo 3000 cards. Looking into the issue, the 3dfx drivers are not 100% complete do to the company shutting its doors, and the drivers getting pieced together from alot of people try to get it to work. If you have a Voodoo card, and even better if it is a Voodoo 3000 card and your drivers work fine and the skin works perfect for you, please post or e-mail me a copy of your drivers so that I may share then with the people who are haveing troubles and hopefully help them out.<br />

Had no problem gettign anything to work. But i have a few questions. Well, really only one, I woul dlike to free up some more chat area, and would like to move the buff bar and the compass to some place else, that would allow me to extend both chat box's alittle and give me the extra room I need. Also, I would like to replace the buff window with another one that I really like, is it as simple as just replacing your with the new one? Never used a mod where I was not able to move some box's around, so at a lose here. All in all a very good mod :-) give ya a danceing banana but dont know how ;-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiradok</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it is possible to put in a dofferent buff window, but you have to make the right changes to the EQUI_Animations file.  You can usually puzzle this out by looking at what files are in the buff window you want. For example, whit Geddines window, you'll see the file buff.bmp. This is the graphic for the red and blue bars in the buff window.  What I usually would do is open the Razor's animations file in note pad, then open geddine's animations file in another notepad. now in the one from Geddines, go to the edit menu, click find, and type in buff. It will bring you to the part of the code where the animations file looks for the buff.bmp image, which is under the heading &quot;Blueiconbackground&quot; and &quot;Rediconbackground&quot;. Now on the Razor's animations, click edit, and find, and type in &quot;rediconbackground&quot; (or whichever on it is that comes first) and it will take you to the same part of the animations file. Now all that's left is to change this section of the razor's file to match geddines.  You should have to change it so it looks for buff.bmp, and the x,y locations. click save in the file menu, and last but no least, copy the buff.bmp and EQUI_Buffwindow into your Razor's file. Make sure you don't copy over the animations file, or you'll put geddines over the work you just did, and nothing will load!  If you did everything right, now you'll have a new buff window, which you can place wherever you like. :) <br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem ...<br />
#1...  the Target bar problem is with the file wnd_bg_target.tga in Game at Resolution  1024x768 it doesnt fit correctly its to large and hince is half on screen,   How can i fix this ?<br />
(note: i ran the setup bat and answered all questions correctly)<br />
<br />
Request.<br />
<br />
1.  if theres a Fix posted here is there anyway to get the Text  NEXT VICTIM  where the Target window is so instead of saying (for example:  Target  a frenzyied Ghoul  ) it will say NEXT VICTIM a Frenzyied ghoul  .<br />
<br />
2. ive posted and heard this cant be done but ill ask THE man that made this UI  is there a way to Put  the Coin boxes for Plat/gold/silver/copper   next to right clicky bar where some put there  Character picture (as im not going to add a picture of myself here) and the Destroy button .<br />
<br />
this feature whould allow Monks to be able to access there Coin and destroy  unwanted coin to keep under weight .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiradok</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">cyrus, one way to get the text there, is to replace the targetwindow, with a normal one to get the title bar back, then edit the file so that it says &quot;Next Victim&quot; instead of &quot;Target&quot;.  However this will take out the nice graphic, so i'd only do it if you also plan on setting your faded level 0.  <br />
<br />
Also, another question, that kind of goes along with yours.  Is it possible to put an auto equip box in the hot button window, or is that hard coded to the inventory?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggun</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, Cyrus, leave me your e-mail and i will send you some files to try to fix your target bar.<br />
<br />
Yes I could add the text your ask to the target bar it would just stand out.<br />
<br />
Not sure about the money but thank it is do-able, but the destroy and Auto Equip box are hard coded into the Inventory window</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cyrus1469</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here ya Go  Daggun<br />
<br />
cyrus1469@hotmail.com<br />
<br />
is it possible to put the NEXT VICTIM on both sides of target bar  kinda like this<br />
<br />
<br />
    NEXT *Target window here* VICTIM <br />
<br />
?or  Slightly above the Target window so you can still see the targets Health and name ?<br />
<br />
or slightly below the target bar</div></div><hr />

For those wondering...NO there is NO VIRUS attached to any of my skins. I have been rapped up in work and Holidays to get the skin posted like I wanted too.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggun</div><div class="date">01-05-2003, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">to reset the timer, just /load re 1   to reload the skin. This is just a timer now, starts at 00:00 and goes to 59:99 then starts all over. It is like an animation to get it to function so it is not really attached to anything and is uncontrollable. It just keeps recycling. I find useful as a referance for spawn times and mezz timers.</div></div><hr />

Grats on the mod, but in 1024 X 768 (or the other, I don't remember) the target bar was too short, didn't fill the screen, and the other resolution was taking too much space on the screen (too big)...<br />
<br />
Is there a way you can make it with 1280 X 1024? That would be AWSOOOOOOME!!!  <br />
<br />
<br />
I still have the same problem, target bar doesn't fit and I have the RE v4.zip that's on the beginning of the thread...<br />
<br />
Maybe one thing is wrong, when I have to run that little thing in kinda DOS mode, the window flashes like 1 second, and I can't see anything in there, and don't have time to answer of course...could anyone help me please?<br />
<br />
And, 1280 X 1024 would be really really really great...Or at least make the target bar fit...Am I the only one with this problem?:(</div></div><hr />

Thanks to ThirdStarr, there is a faster and easier way to get the batch file to work with Windows 2K / XP users.<br />
<br />
Just download the choice.com file from<br />
<br />
http://daggun.get-local.com/choice.zip<br />
<br />
and unzip the file and copy it to you c:\windows\system32 folder and the config will function normally.<br />

well actually i'm on 2000 and XP so i just used your step by step instructions rather than the bat file. the ini is in place.<br />

so i figured out how to get it to appear but the reason behind  it puzzles me. at initial login with the .ini provided in the RE folder, i can't see the main menu as i described.<br />
<br />
however if a loadskin RE 1 - they all come up , albeit completely out of order so i'll need to take time to put them back correctly. =(<br />

I do however have a few comments, questions, requests, etc.<br />
<br />
Problems noted, may have been fixed but not sure which download. <br />
-Title bars on bags and most windows seem to be a bit off graphically. I can live with this just thought I'd bring it to your attention.<br />
-Inventory window, not real fond of original layout I did some mods which helped me to learn quite a bit, would like to see a compact version.<br />
-pet hp bar is on the same bar as mana, not under health. I can probably fix just thought you'd like to know, unless this was deliberate.<br />
<br />
*Request: I would like to see a hotkey window mod that would add the short duration buffs there. there is plenty of real estate, I just can't get it to work. *this is the request I would really like input on*<br />
<br />
Request: I may be alone on this but I HATE the timer. Can we remove code? I have tried several ways but when I do it casues UI to crash.<br />
<br />
Last request: I can't figure out how you made the crinkled paper background, I have asked several Photoshop users and read through every book and Magazine I can find without even a hint. Would you mind sharing this technique please?<br />

Again I want to say I think this UI is great and if you dont make any changes or offer any custom mods that ok, I know it's free and your hard work, so thanks for the great mod</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drazzen</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will do so soon as I can. I am still toying with the spellbar.  The red oval in the center just above the compass opens the spell book. If you look carefully you see that the right side of the bar overlaps the hotkey bank. So when you use the hoykeys it will slide under. Not this this is a major issue but I am going to fiddle with it a bit to place it more on the target bar. I never have a reason to click on the target bar so it should not slide behind it from there. I had to find a use for all that blank space on the target bar. I wish I could add the spellbar slots right onto that bar with 4 on each side but I have not attempted that as of yet. Maybe I will later tonight. My compass is usually to the right of where it is with a transparent Hitsmode window on the left showing me others hits.<br />
<br />
Also am moving the LFG button on the group window over more to the right.  If you think of anything else that might be nice I am also open to trying new things. Over all its a great skin with plenty of ways you can utilize it. Great work again Daggun.<br />
<br />
Also of note I have moved the pet health from below the mana bar to the health bar on the player window, added the charm slot, an armor tinting button and a facepick button to the inventory window.<br />
<br />
Daggun I have a question...<br />
<br />
I have been toying with the idea of putting a DESTROY button on the UI outside of the inventory window. Seeing as the UI has inventory slots on it will that function work on that window?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carousel</div><div class="date">03-01-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">take a look at this link http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2267<br />
<br />
some of the requests mentioned in this thread can't be done. Add to the list: that buttons can only be made in the window the originaly started in.<br />
<br />
and for a quick fix to the spell book button, you can map a key to it. I use keys to open it anyway, it actually took a friend to point out that the button was missing.:) <br />
<br />
If you like a paricular window you can always add it, someone mentioned a different inventory window, you can just copy the appropriate inventory XML into the direcory where your modified UI files are. Caution, some windows do come with companion graphic files which you will have to copy over too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Outlaw</div><div class="date">03-01-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok whats the command for the spells book to open it only way i have found out is by making a hotbutton with /book in it the drawback to this is unlike the normal spell book icon you can click on and it will sit you an open up the spell book then click it again and close the spell book and stand up - with using /book you sit and open the book but reclick the hotbutton /book you do not close the book and stand up..so you now need another key as a hotbutton for sit/stand or use the alt m window to stand..</div></div><hr />

and coping the stand key from youe main alt main windows by holding left mouse button down while over the stand/sit button will let you make a hotbutton for standing and when you hit it your book closes and you stand.<br />
<br />
what i was after is there a command that acts like the spell icon gem in the spell window that when you press it you sit open book then when you press again you close book and stand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the window selector toolbar you can click on &quot;options&quot; looks like a nut, or press alt+o<br />
<br />
click the keyboard tab.<br />
<br />
in the &quot;select category&quot; box, use the drop down and choose &quot;UI&quot;<br />
<br />
look down about 4 lines to Toggle spellbook window, it has two keypress options &quot;Keypress&quot; and &quot;Alternate&quot;, whatever they say are the keys or combination of keys you need to toggle this window. If you wish to change it, click on either one and then press the desired key or combination of keys you would like to use.<br />
<br />
*note* if you open the spell book while sitting, you will not automatically stand by closing the book, but if you open the book standing, you will stand when you close it. Also choosing to stand will close the book and stand. You can do this by using the sit/stand button or typing &quot;/sit off&quot;<br />

Now, just left-click and hold over the spell book icon and move it to your hot buttons.  That's what I used until the UI I used came out with a new CastGem bar with the Spell Book icon in it.  Now when I make a new character or lose my configuration or such, I don't have to go back to the default UI and back again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really like the look of both v4.1 and v4.2, but I can't seem to get them to run correctly.  I am running Windows xp for one.  This is what i have done.  <br />
<br />
~I created a folder named &quot;RE&quot; in the everquest/UI directory. <br />
<br />
~I then extracted all the files into this new folder <br />
<br />
~I took the choice.com file and pasted it to my system 32 folder<br />
<br />
~I made sure the resolution was 1024 x 768<br />
<br />
~I ran the Config Razor.bat file<br />
<br />
~I pressed the necesarry buttons and saw folders being copied due to buttons i pressed (like 1 2 or 3)<br />
<br />
~I then took the .ini file in the RE folder and changed it to UI_Lactic_84.ini   (84 being Tallon Zek PVP teams)<br />
<br />
~i then copied the UI_Lactic_84.ini to the main EQ directory and said yes to overwriting.<br />
<br />
~Then i loaded the game up, but the new UI skin was not there<br />
<br />
I repeated this with the 4.1 just to see if it was the version but i had the same problem.  I really think this UI skin looks cool and would like to get it working.<br />
<br />
Also i looked in the mods folder and saw that you had some of those .ini files w/ your name and server on them.  Am i supposed to change these too?  And if screen shots would help please tell me.<br />
<br />
Thx for all your help.  <br />
Lactic<br />
<br />
PS.  My e-mail is claes_14@hotmail.com so if you would like to e-mail me with a solution that would be great.  THX so much guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggun</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 04:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, sounds like when you unzipped the files that they may have made another folder called RE in your RE folder. You will need to make sure that the UI files are in your /Everquest/UIFiles/RE<br />
and not /Everquest/UIFiles/RE/RE folders. This should fix the trouble, and renaming anything in the mods folder will cause the config.bat to not work. So please don't do this.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't fix it, let me know here and I we will go from there.<br />

<br />
I checked, and i only have one RE folder.  I had deleted everything before and restarted so the files changed in the mods was corrected aka when i deleted and started over i didn't mess it up.  So this time i didn't even make a RE folder and i am going to see what happens.  If you wnat, since you quickly responded, and I can see your online, my S/N on Aol instant messenger is Call Red Sea if you wnat to IM me.  I will post my results of doing this w/o a RE folder</div></div><hr />

Another note, you have to have the files in a RE folder in your UIFiles folder in Eq in order for it to work. Another thing you can try is to load eq after doing the config and copying the files in the appropriate places and type &quot;/load&quot; and use the Skin loader window and load the RE from there and see if that does it.<br />
Let me know if it works.<br />

<br />
Well, as you prolly guessed the plan to put the files in w/o the RE folder did not work.  And also it was late so i shutdown and went to bed =).  (was 5am and got up early that day b4).  I still have had no luck on this, but am persisting on it.  When i put this in you were not online, but i will check agian in the morning.  I am gonna try it again now.  Gonna delete everything and try it.  BTW i did try doing /load lactic 1 and it gave me the same setup.  I then tried /load lactic and all my setup was messed up, I know that is not your skins fault i belive it warned me of that in hte readme.  I will try just /load next if it doesn't work. Thanks for your help man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lactic</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey,<br />
<br />
<br />
Well still no Good luck hehe.  I tried the 4.2 again, and it said to make the file called Slayer instead of RE, so i tried it.  Heh well as you can tell i am still doing something wrong.  I tried doing /load and a Skin window came up, but the only folder or name whathave you was default.  No SLayer or RE ect.  I really apriciate the custom help your giving me =).  Hope to talk to you soon man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggun</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, here we go.<br />
<br />
Download the skin Razors or Slayer, which ever you prefer. (Slayer is designed for a pet class, only real diffrece is the pet bar and spell book)<br />
<br />
1. Unzip the files into a folder named &quot;RE&quot;<br />
<br />
2. go to &quot;My Computer&quot; and double click. then &quot;C&quot; then &quot;Program Files&quot; then you should either have an &quot;Everquest&quot; folder  OR  a &quot;Sony&quot; folder and in it you will have a &quot;Everquest Trilogy&quot; folder. Once here you will find a &quot;uifiles&quot; FOLDER and inside it you should find a &quot;Default&quot; Folder.  DONT OPEN THE DEFAULT FOLDER  this is just for refrence.<br />
<br />
3. Now copy the RE folder (with all of the files in it) NEXT to the Default folder.<br />
<br />
4. Run the config.bat file from the &quot;RE&quot; folder and copy the UI_Charactername_server#.ini into your &quot;Everquest&quot; folder  OR  &quot;Everquest Trilogy&quot; folder (which ever you have) and make sure you rename it to the first name of your character your going to use it with and the correct server number that you play that character on.<br />
<br />
5. Load EQ<br />
<br />
6. IF you load and the skin is still not active, then type &quot;/load&quot; and choose the &quot;RE&quot; selection and click the load button.<br />
<br />
This should do it, if not, please let me know and we will work further to try and get you up and running.<br />
<br />
Thanks for choosing my skins,</div></div><hr />

1) Try right clicking the upper left corner of the buff bar and see if it is unlocked, then try clicking the upper right corner to move it.<br />
<br />
2) I am just hiding them to hot key them as needed.<br />
<br />
3) to get rid of the pet bar, just simply Alt+F1 (or what ever you have hotkeyed for Toggle Pet window in you r options)</div></div><hr />

OK, You will want to look in your Options window and use the pop down to &quot;All&quot; and look down for toggle pet window and see what you have setup for it. Default is Alt + F1 (F1 meaning your F1 Key at the top of your keyboard) also, make sure your at the right resolution in game in the Option window, my skins are designed with 1162x856 but also work at 1024x768 if you tell the config.bat file that you want it like that.</div></div><hr />

Did you run the config.bat file first and then copy the UI_charactername_server#.ini  ? Sounds like maybe your not using the correct resolution or not run the config.bat and told it the right resolution that you play EQ at...</div></div><hr />

I am very new to UI's This will be my first one and was wondering if u can answer a few questions. Looking through of course i didnt see the actions toolbars and the others as u would see in the default. Was wondering are all the cntrl and alt key combinations that bring up these boxes on the default UI the same for a Downloaded UI? Does everything have the same basic functionality as the defualt version? Also you say that yours is pretty resistant to patches. What do you do if a patch does cause it to Crap out?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time and cant wait to get this UI downloaded and up ad running.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, sorry, didn't mean to leave the iksar in the last patch. but there should be some blank replacement .tga's included in the files.<br />
<br />
Yes all the Alt and Cntl commands work the same, no changes and the skin buttons and such work the same.<br />
<br />
And if the skin does get crapped on, i will fix it again and post the fixed version or message on how to repair.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps ya, and thank you for choosing my skin.</div></div><hr />

2nd can you add the spell gems like Drazzen did? If you could that would be all I need in a ui. I like to have things stream lined and all fit together.<br />

Drazzen If you could post your mod to Daggun's UI that would work too. Ether way I would be happy:)<br />

You should beable to download ANY spell gems you prefer and just simply add them to the Razors folder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks again for Razor UI. Still loving it. However I seem to be having a problem atm. Not at all good with this stuff so will try to clarify as much as possible. I left for vacation on June 8th. I returned June 16th. Before that I had no problems with UI. UI version did not have charm slot etc but no biggie. Kept an eye out for new version and just loaded your latest about 2 days ago. Deleted old version. <br />
<br />
My setup is that I have 1 folder for every character in the UI Files  even though they all pretty much use RE UI. For some reason now however, my main, Aroidan, cannot use your UI. I have installed and reinstalled following you directions, ( and I have done it before plenty of times with NP). I click load Aroidan1 to load RE UI in game and I get default still after game freeze. ATM the only way for me to use your UI is load an alt's version of RE UI in-game. I have even copied and pasted that version into my Aroidan1 file in UI folder and tried reinstalling it. I have copied/pasted over UI_Aroidan_25 in Everquest folder tons of times. All with no result. It works fine for alt but useless so far for main. I can continue to do this and keep your UI. However I had downloaded a few little changes and wanted to try and integrate them into your UI. For ex. a horizontal spell bar/ reduced track window / enlarged bank window etc. However I am afraid to try and tamper with original now. <br />
<br />
Sorry for all the junk but trying to give you all the info possible. Might you have any ideas? I have no clue at all and would love to clear this up. Thanks so much in advance and thanks again for best UI I have seen. It really P_sses me off to not be able to use your UI lol. :mad<br />

OK, try loading your RE folder again like normal, with the newest version. (RE v6)  Then if it doesn't load again, open up your &quot;UIErrors.txt&quot; that is located in your Everquest main folder, and post it here. Another thing to look at is to make sure you only have 1 Everquest folder on your PC, some ppl have &quot;C:\program files\Everquest&quot; and some have &quot;C:\Everquest&quot; and some have &quot;C:\Program Files\Sony\everquest trilogy&quot;. And there are some people that have more than one of these. SO make sure you messing with the right folder and let me know if your still having problems.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woodenway</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the lower of the 2 resolutions....1024 x 768. sizes and such are all fine....The Color bar is to the left edge of the screen. causing it to basicly block the target health. (not good as healer). and a minor thing seems have to run the config bat a couple times to get the right parts loaded......or i just messed it up more than once but i can switch thouse out easy enough.....oh and i deleted that bmp to make the bufffs clear couldn't read them, aka bad eye sight so need 1024....and easy to see buffs.....<br />
<br />
anyway. if there is way to shut it off or add that to the config it would be cool.....not really into the big white bar all the time.<br />

Thanks....<br />
