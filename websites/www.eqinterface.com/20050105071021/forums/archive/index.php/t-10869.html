<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">narrwin</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have a good idea for new UI for Ranger class (or anyone else who may be able to use it). This UI would be based off of Enok's mini UI he has made but with some interesting modifications and additions. The layout would be as follows...<br />
<br />
Overall UI color to be Ranger color green to stick with Ranger theme<br />
<br />
A mini spell bar in the horizontal position with the book button in the center with 4 spells being on both sides of the book.<br />
<br />
Combine the Compass and the window selector in the horizontal position with the compass being in the center with 7 window buttons on both sides of the compass.<br />
<br />
Combine the Target and player windows together as one window and add 2 tabs to the window having one tab named Player and the other tab named Buffs for a mini buff window sorta like Tiniest.zip but make it into a rectangle to fit player/target window size.(Another idea for Pet users maybe also add 3rd tab for pet window)<br />
<br />
Modify Enoks group window to include Invite and disband buttons (or clickable text)<br />
<br />
I will be Cut and Pasting the images i have and creating new pictures of what im describing, e mail me or PM me if you need these images to help you, though i think most of you UI creators are very cleaver and very sharp :)<br />
<br />
Hope you all like this idea, if i had a lick of EXP in UI design i would be making this UI on my own BUT you guys are way better then I.<br />
<br />
This is how the screen would be set up (will look different after UI is done)</div></div><hr />
