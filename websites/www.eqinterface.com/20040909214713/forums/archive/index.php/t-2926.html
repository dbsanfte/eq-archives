<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">10-14-2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The UI layout is designed for 1024x768 resolution with /viewport 0 0 813 600 set. I play at that resolution to avoid any framerate drop, even in the harshest 60+ person raid conditions, so I haven't expiramented at all with it in other resolutions.<br />

<br />
Hotbutton window gives full access to inventory by using tab windows. <br />
Tab 1 is all 8 general inventory slots, primary, secondary, ranged, ammo, and my most common swap and right click inventory locations.<br />
Tab 2 is all inventory locations exept neck, and general slots 6, 7, and 8.<br />
<br />
Group window includes player info as well as all player stats, exp, AA exp, and unspent AA points to the right of the group portion of the window. The group lifebars and the player portion of the window have large clickable areas for targeting self and group members.<br />
<br />
Spellcast window is very compact to fit neetly beside the group window.<br />
<br />
Buff window is very small and compact, but the buff names are easy to read and have a very visible graphic indication that they are positive or negative effects.<br />
<br />
Container windows have primary, secondary, ranged, and ammo slots added to them.<br />
<br />
Selector window is sized to fit to the right of the buff window and does not have visible buttons for the hotbutton, spell cast, and buff windows.<br />
<br />
Inventory window is from Vertmod1.1 with no changes to it other than graphics.<br />
<br />
Target window is long and allows for even the longest of NPC names over the target lifebar. Spellcast timer is directly under the target lifebar. (Modified version of Crag's target window)<br />
<br />
Functionally it is the same as the previous version, but due to feedback I got, and my own feelings on it, I gave it a massive graphics update.<br />
<br />
All the gauge, border and titlebar graphics are from Vertmod1.1.<br />
All buttons, inventory, selector window and background graphics are from Raxthorn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">10-14-2002, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I intend to do something with the blank area at the bottom of the hotbutton window. I'm thinking of shortening the window so its not there, and placing a compass down there, but I havn't been able to figure out how to make a compass take up the entire area, and still look and work properly.<br />
<br />
All feedback on the UI, or how to make a compass bigger, are welcome, thanks.</div></div><hr />

I'll be fixing that soon. =)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
