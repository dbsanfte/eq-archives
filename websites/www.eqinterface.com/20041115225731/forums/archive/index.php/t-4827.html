<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Logancreed</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had three goals when I made this UI:<br />
<br />
1.)  Put everything button or clickable think in a single area of the screen.  I hate roaming all over the place with the cursor, trying to target the right thing, especially during lag.<br />
<br />
2.)  Put has much info on the screen as possible.  I'm an information junkie.  I look at my stats a ton, to check buffs and decide on loot, so I wanted it up all the time.  Not only that, but I have two group windows....  One just for targeting and one for the hp of group mates.  I took this idea from Romelo.  ;)<br />
<br />
3.)  Do both of the above, while keeping most of the action visible.  I like to see everything going on.  I need see corpses, mobs, adds, etc so that I know how to act.  I made a ton of stuff transparent, so I think I accomplished this, even though there is a ton of stuff on the screen.<br />
<br />
The screen shot is attached...  I don't think there is much more to work on, so here goes.  Give me some feedback, please.  ;)</div></div><hr />

Just one question........what's up with the numbers on the buffs?  And no, I'm not talking about the 'slot' numbers, but where the buff names should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lasagna</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that those are your stats not buffs -- I may be mistaken though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lazaru5</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahhh, yes.......you're probably right, Lasagna.  Maybe I should have got a little more sleep before looking at it the first time!  :eek: <br />
<br />
Oh well<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xndor</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok for the buffs i think that the buff ecffectrs he is actusaly using Tking pictures for replacement stas pics and then the buffs to the left are numberd so u kno whatplace gthe buf is in ( im 100% shure im right about this one)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Logancreed</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clarify some questions...<br />
<br />
1.)  The stats are not in the buff window.  They are actually in the Target window.  I just like to have them next to each other because I look at my stats a ton to figure out what buffs I need....  just feels quicker to me than decyphering what buffs I have...<br />
<br />
2.)  The icons are T.Kings, but are not part of my UI.  It just happens to be my favorite icon set.  :)   The labels for each stat are pulled from the icon library, so depending on what icons you use, you'll get different labels.<br />
<br />
3.)  Yes, the numbers next to the buffs are the slot numbers...  I added a little extra tab next to each so that the negative/positive effect can be seen quickly, but it's not over the buff name so that it doesn't obstruct the view a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Logancreed</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forgot...  When I release it, I will have different styles for the stat bar.<br />
<br />
And, I will put the inventory crap that is on the spell bar into the friends window for melee to have quick access.</div></div><hr />

<br />
now now now ... hmmm can you tell I have no patience?  Please, pretty please, pretty pretty please with sugar on top?</div></div><hr />
