<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently downloaded a program that lets me make animated .gif files. I started off simple. I turned the nana blue! Here it is. My very first try.<br />
<br />
Gonna keep trying. Hopefully I'll get the hang of it someday :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting..... Are you aware that there's a rather annoying company by the name of Unisys, who has the copyright liscense for the LZH compression format that is used in .GIF graphics, and for the last couple years has been suing people for unliscensed use of their compression format?  While they do focus more now on large buisnesses, they have freuqently in the past, charged people $50 grand per unliscensed use (each graphic made by a program that generated a .GIF file without their explicit permission).  That is why I personally avioid .GIF files like the plague.<br />
<br />
There is another animated graphic format in existence, however Microsoft's [worthless] web browser, Internet Explorer, still does not support the international network graphics formats that have been in existence for about a decade, while browsers that support these well-defined and thought out standards (like Mozilla/Netscape Navigator) do.  The graphic format is .PNG, and the animated format of those graphics is .MNG.  Those, as well as the .JPG formats are the only graphics I use (exclusively).<br />
<br />
I'd just be careful about making a .GIF format unless you can be 100% certian that the program you are using to make the animations is legit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was really easy to make, but as you can see from the blue nana, I accedently made the top of the pic stay at one level, when I should have made his feet stay at the same level. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, and I think turning the nana blue made him umm....... look like he was on speed ;)  Might want to slow the frame pauses down just a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made another one from a few screenshots I took while fighting some kobolds in steamfont. This one was very easy. I'm still trying to learn though. It's easy enough, but doing the graphics and stuff may be hard, that's why I'm starting off easy. The only things I can edit pics with is MSpaint and MS Picture it 2001. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dillomjm</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont see how that is possible that people are getting sued over usage of GIF files.  Even microsoft's paint program allows you to create GIF files.  If there was a company sueing people for illegally using their compression format, it would be all over the news that Microsoft lost millions, and as of yet I havent seen that.  So, I dont think that your information is correct, although I could be wrong (its been known to happen) =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Averad</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sueing people for using gif? Bah thats a bunch o crap. Yeah it would be all over the news and programs like pain, Pain shop Pro, All Digita Calera programs would all be sued or charged a obsorbant amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">10-11-2002, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Companies like Microsoft have a paid a developers license fee which allows them to create software which utilizes the LZH compression - it does not require additional licensing by the end-user.  However, if an person or company were to write a program that converted a GIF image to another format or vice-versa and failed to obtain license, then there would be trouble - and it would be aimed at the devleoper not the user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">10-14-2002, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They were sueing people for about the first 5 months after they finally got the legalities worked out (took them about 10 years to get them they way they wanted) primarily using those people as examples.  Now however, they are simply nailing the developers of unliscensed software (Microsoft isn't stupid, they liscensed their software about 2 weeks after Unisys started raining hell on everyone).<br />
<br />
As GIFs are very low-quality graphics with a minimal number of colors, I personally don't see why people still use them.  Lack of alpha channel (only having a single transparent color instead) and 256 colors makes for pretty low-end graphics IMHO.  Add in the fact that the LZH compression algorythm is way outdated, and there are far superior compression routines that are available, some of which are free software (GPL'ed), GIFs should just lay dead and buried.</div></div><hr />
