****************************************************<br />
What had happened was target nearest NPC had somehow gotten the key I was using for target last loaded into the alternate keyboard command spot /boggle<br />
<br />
2.  I loaded Celtic's 1.1 UI to see how it works.  Very very customizable for a bard to us by dragin around windows.<br />
<br />
Thanks all<br />
Grinin<br />
****************************************************<br />
<br />
<br />
I use the Default EQ UI, only options I've made is adding buttons and links to my bag o bardy goodies.<br />
<br />
1.  In the last patch the EQ Default UI munched the Target Previous Mobby &quot;&lt;Set up&gt; &lt;Targetting tab&gt; &lt;Target Last 2 mobs&gt;&lt;pick a key&gt;  Function.  <br />
<br />
It now targets nearest Npc rather than letting me pop back and forth between the last 2 mobby's keeping them mezed easier etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Should I try one of the custom UI's Floating around?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
2.  I've considerd some of the custom UI's out there but I live and die by the simple hot key's I've set up on the left side with the link to bag's and item slots.  <br />
<br />
3.  On these custom UI's are those things still available.  Can I pop up to the Set up uitlities, default top center of screen and make simple changes to sound graphics etc still?<br />
<br />
4.  Am I able to make changes between characters as to how the UI works, or should I have a UI for say my magi and my bardi?<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Is there any place that tells the XML commands you'd need to write to make things happen?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
5.  I used to be a programmer, in a former life when DOS 1.6 and a 286 CPU were the things to have and COBOL and Main Frame's ruled.  Is there any kind of resource out there that lists the different line commands and valuses you can manipulate and what they effect?  I might consider trying to hack out an actual For Bards UI, though keeping it runing would make me nuts with patches whacking UI's even the default EQUI.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Angarth&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
6.  If ya feel like helping an old friend, I'm pretty sure you still have my e-mail from all the 7D stuff <br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
Check your keyboard mappings under the in-game options.  Find what key your 'Target last mob' or whatever its called command is mapped to, or if there isnt one, set it up to be a key.<br />
<br />
I just hit the 'L' button to switch between targets, it shouldnt have anything to do with the UI.</div></div><hr />

I dont play a class that requires this but I'll ask a couple of my enchanter friends if they noticed this with the default UI. It may be a bug and you may wish to do a /bug report in game about it.<br />

<br />
A custom interface will not change the way the game functions only the location of the interface features and the look &amp; feel.<br />

Just browse through our downloads area and look at the pictures. You can download the ones you think you like and install them. If you dont like them you can always go back to the default interface. <br />

Yes you can have a different interface for each of your charaters. <br />

There are many webpages on XML programing as well as books. Once you learn XML it should be easy for you to understand EQ's XML interface. You can get some insight from microsoft word doc in your default interface folder. You can also browse through some of the tutorials in our forum. You can also download a program called Sidlwidl to help you modify the interface files. Just do a search on sidlwidl on our forums and you should find the new download link as sidlwidl.com is down.</div></div><hr />

Yes, this is a general Keyboard mapping issue in normal set up features targeting tab.  Problem is it won't reset.  I use the ` key for target last, always have.  after the patch it wasn't working so I remapped it, reassigned the value to another key then back to the ` key.  That worked 1 time before zoning into LDoN in a test right after re-assignment (but it could have been a fluke)  <br />
<br />
End result is I have F-8 to target nearest npc and also the ` key which should target last but act's just like F-8.<br />
<br />
2.  Can I delete the default UI files and force EQ to reload new ones.  Yea me, I get to re-set up all of my hot key's etc, but would that fix the bugged EQUI that I have?<br />
<br />
Thanks alot for the info.<br />

It will show F8 and `  choose the ` and just hit ESC to set it blank.  Now it will work as it did previously.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I use the same UI for almost all my characters.  The only special case is a separate UI for pure melee since they lack the spell casting window, which is an integral part of the layout.<br />
<br />
You can keep different windows up for your different characters and you can lay out the windows differently for each character.  Message filters are per-character as well.  If you want the UIs to differ more significantly than that you will need to maintain a separate UI directory for each character.</div></div><hr />
