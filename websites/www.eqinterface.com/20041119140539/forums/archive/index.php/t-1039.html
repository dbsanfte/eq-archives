<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanolar</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heya everyone. I LOVE the work done by this site and all you fine people. I was able to get my skin working ok after the last patch except for the spell casting bar I use. I use the &quot;Compact Spellbar&quot; hosted on EQskins.com made by a person named Veearus. Its 2 horizontal rows of 4 spell gems, and the book icon on the far right edge. I love this mod and now going back to the old one is killing my twisting (I am a bard). If anyone can get this to work I would be eternally gratefull. here is a link to a pic of it.<br />

<br />
The person who made the compact caster bar &quot;excluded&quot; the equi_castingwindow from equi.xml. You should be able to copy the new equi.xml to your uifiles/myskin from the uifiles/default and find the line and make it look as below... that should fix it.  <br />
<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
&lt;!--        &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_CastingWindow.xml&lt;/Include&gt; --&gt;<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_TargetWindow.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
If you look I bet there is an error in ui_errors.txt in your eq directory that says something like unable to parse or some stuff about equi_castingwindow....<br />

<br />
For future reference when you exclude a file from being loaded in equi.xml and include it in another file every time vrant makes a change to equi.xml they of course break your mods.  You might consider editing the equi_castingwindow.xml directly and removing the item that is in conflict with your spell icons file so you can change equi.xml to it's default state. Then if vrant changes this file which they will about 10 more times over the next 6 months... you wont have to make this change.<br />
<br />
Developers are new at this so some of their changes are very nice but are done in poor places. We didn't know which files would be changing and how often.  I am sure future mods will get more resistant to version problems since vrant will probably never change some of the windows like backpacks and hot buttons etc...  I doubt they will be changing equi_castingwindow.xml. So changes to this window are way safer than changes to equi.xml.  Ahh time to hit eq!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stabbzy</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've read a ton of your other helpful replies in other threads in this glorious forum, and you seem extremely knowledgeable in this xml thing, me on the other hand have only heard about .xml around the time VI patched the new ui into the live servers...(i dont go to test servers much).<br />
<br />
Anyways, i have that same problem with my spell bar, as described in the root thread, but the only thing is, i have no clue how to add that line, or where to look.  Now i may possibly be able to find that area between the 2 lines where you said to put the addition, to make it work right, but i'm confused on what it is supposed to look like.  Should the addition i make look like the above and below strings?  Or should i put that !-- thing before the new string i'm adding, i dont know much about xml, but from what i've read of your other posts, about how to make the actions tabs into possible alchemy tabs, i think i can get the basic jist of how it's supposed to work...considering i've never messed with html either, i just want my spell bar to work again, and you are definatly, in my mind, the one who can make that happen:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sokol</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, I made the changes, and just made the old casting window &quot;invisible&quot; and removed the EQUI.xml from the equasion, so this should work for future updates to, unless one of these 2 files is modified.<br />
<br />
EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_CastingWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Any way here's the zip just place them where you had the old bard cast mod, and REMOVE the EQUI.xml file. <br />
