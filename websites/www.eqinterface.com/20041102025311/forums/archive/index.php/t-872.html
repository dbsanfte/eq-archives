Extract these files to whatever directory you use for your User Interface. <br />
<br />
To restart the timer, type /loadskin &lt;YOUR UI DIRECTORY&gt; 1   <br />
<br />
The &quot;1&quot; switch is very important, this is what keeps your window positions.  <br />
<br />
The Ui Directory is the directory for whatever Ui Directory you extracted these files to.<br />

Select the different timers with the tabs on the Actions Window.<br />
<br />
When each timer reaches its limit, it will restart. <br />
<br />
The timers do remain acurate through zones. In other words, they keep counting while yer zoning.<br />

I hope you like it. <br />

Future Releases may include timers for more intervals. (15 min, 45 min, 60 min, etc etc.) But I think that this would majorly croud the Actions Window.</div></div><hr />

I had your 90 count up timer.  It is incredible!  I just downloaded this new timer and put it in my skin folder.  When I logged on it put me to my default folder saying it was unable to load my skin.<br />
<br />
I changed back to my original ActionWindows.xml file and everything works fine now.<br />
<br />
hmmmm......was just thinking I may need to switch back my original friends list.........will have to try that.<br />
<br />
*EDIT*<br />
<br />
Ok....If you have one of your original timers that uses the Friend List window.....you have to change it back to the original window by copying it from the default folder to your skin folder.  I did this and everything works great now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalink</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is correct, you must return the friends timer to its orriginal friends window, or this timer will not work. some of the code is duplicated from the Friends List timer and EQ UI doesnt like that. <br />
<br />
If you have any of my other timer mods, you must revert your friends list (just delete the EQUI_FriendsWnd.xml file, and it will use the Default one) in order to have this one work.<br />
<br />
= )   soory for not explaining that..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not all that bad, but having to reapply the fade for all my windows kinda makes this not an option for me.<br />
<br />
Anyone know how to use /loadskin and not have to reset the fade for each window every time it is done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arantius</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/load name 1<br />
<br />
The 1 makes it keep all your settings saved in your UI_name_##.ini .  Including window position and fades.<br />
Somone really needs to sticky this info somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalink</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, someone needs to sticky that info somewhere.. hehe, kinda funny too, as the posts above mention the /loadskin &lt;skin directory&gt; 1  trick... as does the readme included with the zips.. <br />
<br />
hehe, Go figure..<br />
<br />
Oh well, at least people are getting use from the timers..  :p</div></div><hr />

Was camping HWL in KC today and used this timer.  As soon as we killed the first hand I hit my hotkey for &quot;/loadskin rogue 1&quot;.  I use the count up timer and 26 min later that hand popped again.  Everybody in my group was amazed.  I sent them here to download it.<br />

Nice work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalink</div><div class="date">08-12-2002, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A simple edit of the XML could add these timer tabs to the map mod. What map mod is everyone using? <br />
<br />
I tried the one from EQToolbox.not.net and chose not to use it due to the map loading times and the fact that I use a second computer and EQ Companion for my maps. (nice that it shows you exactly where you are)<br />
<br />
If I knew what map mod you were using, I'm sure I could post an add on or somthing. Just the new xml file and the Digits.tga file. Just post and let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wolja</div><div class="date">08-13-2002, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice ui. From a chnters point of view a timer that counts down in seconds would be very useful, ie 60 seconds for enthrall, 90 secs for dazzle etc. <br />
<br />
The others are good as spawn timers but an in game mez timer would rock.</div></div><hr />
