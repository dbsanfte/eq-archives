<br />
I will be naming it infiniti2 vs infiniti 2.0 because its really a redesign..<br />
<br />
Lots of major improvements over version 1 including reduced number of graphic files to help with memory usage and lag.  I would recommend setting the master transparency under options to 100 normal and 100 fade-to.  Then if you want to set non infiniti2 style windows, manually adjust them by right-click on the window.  I set my chat windows to 75% normal and fade-to.  All infiniti windows are transparent no matter what setting.<br />
<br />
Tking G2 icons and spell gems are included.  Much props to him, amazing graphic work.<br />
<br />
Inventory and Spellbook are based on vert 2.5 and vert2 respectively.  Basically converted them to infiniti2 with minor adjustments.  Inventory now includes the class animations. ** Highly recommend downloading the custom class animations TKing has done.  They look fantastic with this inventory **<br />
<br />
~~~~~ New update is up for 5/14 patch including new infiniti2 music player window.  Alot of minor fixes.  Please download infiniti2 again and delete the old version.  I have optimized the graphic files once again eliminating 3 more files.  ~~~~~ <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there, been using your first infiniti ui for about 2 weeks now and i think it's great. Just downloaded version 2 and am still quite impressed. <br />
One thing I've noticed in version 2 is that you've put the mod in with the sta bar sort of attatched to the hp bar, which was originally designed per a hybrid's request to have both mana and sta I believe. I play a monk and don't have a mana bar obviously, so now there's that empty space where a mana bar would go, along with a &quot;0&quot; to represent the % of the missing bar. In infiniti1 before you made an alternate player window we had the mana bar if we had mana, or the sta bar if we did not, perhaps you could release a version 2 player window in that fashion?  It's really a matter of aesthetics but I thought you'd like to know about it ;) <br />
Thanks for making a lovely UI!<br />
<br />
Edit: OK I decided to replace the version 2 player window with version 1 and boom i have my sta bar back, though the new texture isn't a perfect fit and the %'s are sort of riding the line on the border. Doing this reminded me of another little thing I'd noticed with version 1...the % for the sta bar doesn't function, always says &quot;0&quot;. Hope I'm not buggin' ya with trifles :D</div></div><hr />

Looks great! Thanks a bunch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cragzak</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice... only suggestion I have is to number the buff-box along the right side of the icons.  <br />
<br />
Also, would be nifty if you were to make the numbers graphics (think original vert group-box f-key labels) where the number would start white (so you can see where the empty slot is) and turn blue or red depending on whether it was a buff or harmful spell in that slot.  But that's just eye candy... just having numbers there would be enough for me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">infinity9</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well honestly the buff window sucks to mess with.  I don't see many changes to it in the future.  I really dont even look at my buffs much anymore, just watch stats to know what spells I need.  What would having the number help with?  I'm not a buffer so I really haven't put much thought into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could ya possibly bring back the auto-equip ability of your new inventory? Would greatly appreciate it :D <br />

Nice smoothing of the box edges...makes it much smoother to look at.  I will have to agree with previous poster ..can there be some auto-equip spot? Is it possible to have T-kings animation (which works great in Inventory) to also be the auto-equip? ...<br />
<br />
Wonderful job!<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I have one problem thought, I've downloaded three of the zip files - infiniti2.zip, equi_playerwindow.zip and equi_inventory.zip.  I've unzipped all three into a new folder, ect.  I ran EQ, loaded the new UI, and I have no mana bar in the player window.  I'm playing a paladin, stamina bar is nice, but I would like to have the mana bar also.  Any suggestions on how to fix my little problem?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

They are all still separate windows and can be placed as you wish.  Some people at 640 and 800 might have trouble cause some of the boxes are larger than the default (hotbox width and group/player width) but haven't been redesigned or require any viewports.</div></div><hr />

I dunno if this is something easy that I could fix but I don't feel like thinking about it atm :p <br />
Also with your new window_pieces01 file you have replaced the small white boxes, one empty and the other with an X in it, with a dark blue/black set of boxes that cause things like check boxes and color boxes to show up incorrectly. That particular piece of that texture file must remain white for some reason. Just a heads up.<br />
Thanks for an awesome UI,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">infinity9</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Melee player window is now posted in top post.  As for the white check boxes, I've checked everywhere with the blue boxes i made and haven't seen anything wrong yet.  Could you provide a ss or something to show this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm afraid since i pasted the default transparent white box/check box over yours, it would require me to &quot;un-fix&quot; it to replicate the results I got with your boxes. So you haven't had any problems with say the armor dye window or the color pick window for chat colors? Odd, I wonder why I did. Divining totally from conjecture I'd guess that the boxes would need to remain transparent since either a color or the window's background would need to show through for its purpose. That's why I knew to change that piece in the texture file to fix my problem. It's no biggie now and I guess it's just me lol.<br />
<br />
Thanks for a great UI,</div></div><hr />

Here should be a fixed version.  Let me know if you have any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GridVector</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way for the window_pieces01 file I was able to fix the problem with the color chooser, but I wanted to keep the blue filled checkbox since I think it looked better with the ui. You can just change the outer border of the 2 boxes to white but keep the second box filled with the blue gradient. That way you get the best of both worlds, a blue checkbox and working windows. My 2 cents :) By the way great UI, keep it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just about done picking at your UI ;)  but one last thing bugs me....I like Sar's cursor a lot (the cool blue arrows) and wanted to use it with your UI, but I can't seem to make it work. I get errors in the UIerrors.txt that don't make sense and I can't figure out why. It's a simple change in the animations file and the addition of a .tga file. Any idea what's preventing me from changing this?</div></div><hr />

By the way, you know how in the uierrors.txt file it refers to the number of the line of code containing the error? Wordpad/Notepad  isn't advanced enough to count the lines for me but does something like Microsoft Works have that ability? Been a while since I've had to create a document so I wouldn't know hehe....would be helpful to be able to locate the line containing the error.<br />

The only problem I have is with chat windows.  I can't move them no matter what I do.  I read the text you posted with the download about needing to resize the window before you could move it ( is it just me or is that a very weird feature?) .  I resized it all kinds of different ways and it won't move there's not point on the border where I can get the four arrows cursor.  I also can't seem to close a chat window once it's been opened.  Like if you open a chat for one conversation and when you are done you'd like to make it go away?  No sorry you're stuck with it.<br />

Is there any way I can remove the 'names' of the spells that are put up on the spell slots and on the buff / song spots? Oh yea, using the Infiniti2 UI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">infinity9</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes its easy for the spell window, however the buff window isnt so easy.<br />
<br />
for the spellcast bar, open your EQUI_CastSpellWnd.XML and scroll to the bottom.<br />
<br />
Look for:<br />
<br />
  &lt;Screen item=&quot;CastSpellWnd&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;!--&lt;ScreenID/&gt;--&gt;<br />
    &lt;!--&lt;Font/&gt;--&gt;<br />

    &lt;Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
      &lt;Y&gt;25&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;164&lt;/CX&gt; &lt;---- Change this to 58 should eliminate any text<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;292&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />

Unfortunately you would be better off looking for another buff window mod to remove the text.</div></div><hr />

2 8<br />
3 9<br />
4 10<br />
<br />
5 11<br />
6 12<br />

Change the EQType to the slot you need and you should be set.<br />
<br />
DONT CHANGE ONES like ...     &lt;InvSlot item=&quot;HB_InvSlot10&quot;&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyndam</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, bitchin' UI.  I switched from drakah's tking, tking_min, and tking_steel UIs to this last night.  Noticeable improvement in rendering performance, I must say.  Major kudos.<br />
<br />
There's some stuff I want to tweak for the specific classes I play.  I'd like to resubmit them and make them available for everyone, but I want to make sure you retain the credit for making the original.  I'll figure out some way to do that at some point...<br />
<br />
The Modifications I'm thinking of making:<br />
<br />
In general<br />
+ The Buff Window - I'd like to add a side-bar, very slim, to this window with the numbers of buffs from 1 to 15.  The problem I had when I swapped to this UI was that I had no idea where the window started.  I moved the windows into place, and then when I cast a spell on myself, it was on top of another window.<br />
+ Short Duration Buff Window - perhaps similar to the buff window, but I'm not sure just yet, as I don't play a bard.<br />
<br />
Pet Classes<br />
As a Mage, I tend to have a pet-centric focus when I'm fighting.  As a Beastlord, I tend to have the same focus, though my own health is more likely to change than my pet's since I am actively in melee.  So, the things I need to know fast-fast-fast, are the target's health, my health, my pet's health, and my current mana.  To help with this:<br />
<br />
+ Target Window - Adding player health and pet's health to the target window.  This might make things too tall, in which case I'll use the overlay bar for my pet's health, and add the percentage to the side.  I'd like to add player mana to this as well, but once again, I think it might make the window too tall, unless I arrange the window in a horizontal fashion.  I'll have to see how it looks in practice.<br />

Healer Classes<br />
For a Cleric, I tend to have a group-centric focus, and a buff-centric focus.  So, my primary focus would not typically be on myself, but rather on my party members.  This means I will tend to be paying attention to the group window the most.  In this respect, the existing group window works wonderfully.  The only proposed mods:<br />
<br />
+ Add player pet health percentage.  When I party with mages and beastlords, their pet is often a key part of the group, and will often off-tank adds.  So, I need to be able to see how they're doing, as accurately as possible.<br />
+ Add my own health to the top of the group window in a different color.  This means I will know if I'm having problems without having to peek at another window.<br />
<br />
I may work on the mods this afternoon and evening, and see about how to post them back so Infiniti can look at them and see if s/he wants to incorporate them as patches or alternate mods.<br />
<br />
Once again, kickass UI!<br />
<br />
 *** Edit *** <br />
Oh, I forgot to mention: for UI mods that don't have title-bars on the chat windows, you can load the default skin with your INI, and move the window roughly where you want it, and then load your custom skin, and resize it to the exact size you want.  A pain, I know -- but it works.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you could add that to move the caht window you have to move them by resizing them to the position you want. Because I can't select one to move it.<br />
<br />
It is the only remark I have, beautifull and very usefull UI (the second cast bar behind the target is great idea).<br />

After all it is an interface and meant to assist the user in playing the game so anything you think would help you or others better, go for it!  I've actually started working on a new UI so probably don't see myself making many changes to Infiniti2.  BTW Pet health % is in the latest version posted, err it should be hahah.<br />
<br />
For chat windows, there is a border along the edge that you can use to grab to resize.  I've loaded my UI without saving positions a few times so I've done it a bit now.  Also once the cursor turns to a resize-style you can right-click and pull up menu.<br />

Infiniti2 has been, by far, my favorite UI and I was very much looking forward to going home later. Firing up EQ and checking out the changes. Looks like I'll have to find another UI now. :( <br />
<br />
Well, best of luck on the new UI. I look forward to seeing what you bring to us later and I'm confident that it'll be great. I'll guess I'll just be stuck with using something else I like less in the meantime.<br />

I thought maybe I was lagging but as I tried out my other hotkeys, they didn't work either. wtf!<br />
<br />
So I thought relogging would fix that - but I couldn't freakin /camp out either. And the button for Camp wouldn't work either! The only way I could get out of EQ was to /q. Oh yeah, and I couldn't communicate with ANYONE, not through tells, say, gu, or any of that. I logged back in and found out that I could use my hotkeys again, yay, then I pulled again, and they stopped working...again. It seems everytime I get hit or something, it disables all my hotkeys and commands. I don't get it...<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and my guild manager is broken with this too or something. I loaded it up to see who was on but it was blank...then one of my guildmates zoned and he popped up on my manager. It seems the only way I could get guildmates on that list is if they zone. Also, whenever I tried to sort out my list, it'd clear itself until someone zoned, then they'd be re-added.<br />
<br />
I've never had any of these problems with any other UIs...does anyone know what's going on?</div></div><hr />

I dont even think this is your problem but I was hoping you could help me. All is good with the UI after the last big patch except for one thing. I wanted to be able to filter the new spell damage messages coming at me from my DOT's, but when I right click a window and goto &quot;Filters&quot; I dont have the same entry to filter spell damage as my guildmates seem to have.<br />

One thing I'd request though is some sort of lines on the HP and EXP bars.  I'm a visual person and not always sure where the last thing was at a glance and need something to guage it on.  (like if something gives you under 1% of exp, you aren't going to be able to tell if it's almost 1% or no noticeable gain, etc.).  Also, I use everything on this except the Buff box, its too large for my 1024 x 768 layout, so I use Maxx Win (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1183)  which helps reduce lag tremendously and gives more viewing area, plus the tubular design fits in with the overall layout.  I just saw the new beta version one and I'm not feeling it as much as I love this one but nice work so far hehe.</div></div><hr />

Any other suggestions friend on what might cause the bar to be solid other than the missing window_pieces_i2.tga file?<br />

And I have checked many times that file is not in the zip that I download.<br />
<br />
Is it the window_pieces_i2.tga file that sets what the xp/health/sta/etc bars should look like?<br />

If so is it possible to just upload this file?</div></div><hr />

What I am getting is a solid bar for heatlh/mana/etc, instead of the segemented bars that you show in your screenshot.<br />

I looked into it, its not that hard to do. You need to edit the file EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml<br />
<br />
Under the sections CSPW_Spell*_Name <br />
Change the occurance of <br />
   &lt;AlignLeft&gt;false&lt;/AlignLeft&gt;<br />
with <br />
  &lt;AlignRight&gt;false&lt;/AlignRight&gt;<br />
<br />
To move the bar, book, and text over, its a bit more tricky. You need to  change:<br />
<br />
A_Spellbar_a and A_Spellbar_b<br />
   &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt; to &lt;X&gt;105&lt;/X&gt;<br />
<br />
CSPW_Spell*<br />
   &lt;X&gt;9&lt;/X&gt; to &lt;X&gt;114&lt;/X&gt;<br />
<br />
CSPW_Spell*_Name <br />
   &lt;X&gt;58&lt;/X&gt; to &lt;X&gt;9&lt;/X&gt;<br />
<br />
CSPW_SpellBook<br />
   &lt;X&gt;14&lt;/X&gt; to &lt;X&gt;119&lt;/X&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are still using the Spell_label_* text, then you need to move it from &lt;X&gt;40&lt;/X&gt; to &lt;X&gt;145&lt;/X&gt;   But I dont use it, so did not test this part...  Also, the same sort of trick needs to be done to EQUI_BuffWindow.xml but I dont have the numers as I did not play with it.  <br />

The above patch was for infiniti (version 1) turns out the others use different numbers.  Are you using: infiniti, inifiniti2 or infinitum?  Also. so you need the spell, buff, or both converted?Let me know and I will mail them to you.  <br />

PS: if all you want is the labels gone to save space, you can delete the line:<br />
<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;CSPW_Spell0_Name&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
there are 8 of these (0-7), and form the BuffWindow file,<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;BW_Buff0_Label&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
there are 15 of these (0-14)</div></div><hr />

For those that would prefer a textured background to the inventory window, you canto edit: EQUI_Inventory.xml<br />
<br />
Find:<br />
    &lt;!-- IS_L_EAR         1 --&gt;<br />
<br />
Add before this line:<br />
  &lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;Infiniti-InvBG&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
    &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
      &lt;Texture&gt;window_pieces_i3.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
      &lt;Location&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;128&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;40&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;Size&gt;<br />
        &lt;CX&gt;40&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
        &lt;CY&gt;40&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
      &lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
  &lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
  &lt;StaticAnimation item=&quot;A_InvBG&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;ScreenID&gt;A_InvBG&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
    &lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
    &lt;Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
      &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;290&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;334&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
    &lt;Animation&gt;Infiniti-InvBG&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
  &lt;/StaticAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
Find (End of file):<br />
    &lt;Style_Sizable&gt;false&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;InvSlot1&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
Change to:<br />
    &lt;Style_Sizable&gt;false&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;A_InvBG&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;InvSlot1&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Good lock :-)<br />

There is a custom window_pieces01.tga.  The reason is there was a bug with tabbed windows.  The default animations actually pointed to an area inside the recessed box for the right side of the tabbed window piece.  I really havent looked to see if they have fixed that, but with the graphic, the 200 location is correct.</div></div><hr />

Actually I moved the graphic in the file.  There is a custom window_pieces01.tga......  I really havent looked to see if they have fixed that, but with the graphic, the 200 location is correct.  <br />
<br />
That would explain it. I was using and older verison of window_pieces01.tga which I had patched in the &quot;?&quot; marks.  In the older version, the graphic is at 180.  You are correct, in the lastest code you supplied, the graphic is at 200<br />
<br />
Sorry for the confusion. I will edit my original note and delete first part of it to avoid confision :-)<br />

Here's a screenshot of what it looks like. If anyone would like it, let me know. Not sure where I would post it, it's not mix and match... just infinity2 with lots of changes.<br />

If it doesn't load, hit refresh a few times. My web hosting sucks really bad. =(</div></div><hr />

But it's nice... there is no NPC I've ever seen where the whole name won't show. <br />
<br />
I will put it up soon. I want to do a couple add-ins like a vertical version of the buff windows and a couple other things. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have 3 interfaces released now (infiniti1, infiniti2, and infinium). Do you have any plans to discontinue support for any of them? Id certainly like to make sure I was using one that keeps getting updates :)<br />
<br />
Thanks heaps for the effort you've put into these UI's. I think the number of downloads and people using them speaks volumes for how cool your work is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">imezru</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok =( Infiniti I know you are probably busy, so this request will go out to anyone that has the l33t skills to figure out that coding...<br />
Change this...<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1972<br />
<br />
To this....<br />
http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2003-9/378363/p.jpg<br />
<br />
And then just email me the changed files and i will be forever in your debt =)<br />
