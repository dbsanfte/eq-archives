<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sebas</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, have noticed this problem:  When I cast a spell/song, the casting bar gem fades right away.  After a slight delay, the hotkey spell gem will fade accordingly.  When the spell/song ends, the casting bar gem return to normal right away, but the hotkey spell gem has a slight delay before returning to normal.  This delay is variable, sometimes it is on time, sometimes it is very noticably not synchronized.<br />
<br />
To best see this, arrange your casting spell gems right next to the appropriate hotkeyed spell gem.<br />
<br />
As a bard, constantly starting and stopping songs, this variable delay drives me batty and I have not been able to figure out a way to get both the casting gems and the hotkey casting gems to be in sync.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this problem?  I'm wondering right now whether it is a function of my older pc and newer pc's might not have this ui issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give your description, I'm not &quot;shocked&quot; that this is happening.  Basically, hotbuttons have alot more processing to thru.  Could you post what you have in your 10 hotbuttons... this would make trying to replicate the problem alot easier.</div></div><hr />

I've got 9 /who hotkeys and 1 spell (Selo's Accelerando) hotkeyed.</div></div><hr />
