<br />
As the artist for GU Comics, I'm making extensive changes to the UI so I can't just save over the new file change one line and continue about my business. I have to do a seek and destroy... er seek and alter... mission and hope I didn't miss anything.<br />
<br />
I've already requested that exact changes be logged officially and outlined on the EQ site, but I doubt GU has enough pull to swing that.<br />
<br />
SO... while you're fixing your files... could you try to keep track of exactly what has been changed? And, keep track of them here?<br />
<br />
It would really help a good number of us out.</div></div><hr />

I keep a &quot;reference&quot; copy of the default directory and just compare it to the standard default after patches.  The program will highlight any files with differences, then with a simple click will take you too a side by side comparison with all differences within the file highlighted.<br />
<br />
 I had all my mods updated and re-installed rather painlessly within a few minutes using it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm..that's just my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
What we need to do is get Verant to create a seperate folder in the UI folder. Label it updates. When we patch and get a UI update it should update both the Default and the Update folder. That would make hunting down all their changes alot easier.<br />
<br />
The biggest changes in this patch that we should really be concerned with are to the Ui.xml and the animations.xml as well as any tga files. <br />

----- Update -----<br />
<br />
Eilim, I downloaded that program, ran it and started doing file comparisons and it's great.<br />
<br />
I owe you one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pini Uldar</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Non-file notes:<br />
It seems like the tga files are cached now. They don't seem to be changing on zoning. This means that window_pieces01 that gets loaded on character select stays loaded even if you have a custom version of it in your skin.<br />
<br />
Also new, if a file isn't found in your skin directory, it uses the default version. So if you haven't changed EQUI_BankWnd.xml for example, you can just leave it out of your skin directory and it will fall back on the default one.<br />
<br />
File Change notes:<br />
<br />
[window_pieces02]<br />
Edges of the Spell gem background in the lower right corner were cleaned up.<br />
<br />
[gemicons02]<br />
The files aren't binary match, but I couldn't find a visual difference.<br />
<br />
[EQUI_TrainWindow]<br />
Minimal width readjustment.<br />
<br />
[EQUI_TextEntryWnd]<br />
Fixed up. I believe this wasn't used at all before and was a cut and paste job from QuantityWindow. Now it is used for renaming Chat windows (right click on title bar - Rename Window).<br />
<br />
[EQUI_SkillsWindow]<br />
Minor anchor offset changes make the window layout change a bit, but nothing major.<br />
<br />
[EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd]<br />
Had the listbox changed from absolute sized to being autostretched. Note that the listbox contents that are hard coded request A_DividerVertical. If EQUI_Animations doesn't contain this, then you will crash to desktop when doing /bazaar.<br />
<br />
[EQUI_Animations]<br />
Had A_DividerVertical added. This is used by the new resizeable multi-column listbox in the Bazaar Search Window. If this is not added, you will crash on /bazaar.<br />
<br />
[EQUI]<br />
Had EQUI_TextEntryWnd.xml added as an Include. <br />
<br />
[SIDL]<br />
[EQUI_SocialEditWnd]<br />
[EQUI_SelectorWnd]<br />
[EQUI_OptionsWindow]<br />
[EQUI_BazaarWnd]<br />
[EQUI_ActionsWindow]<br />
I couldn't find any actual changes to these files except for whitespace and carriage-return changes. diff -b -B said the files matched.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woody</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on the program Eilim linked me to, I see those same cahnges Pini.<br />
<br />
The main problem I had was, I've been skinning the UI since it was on test, so my gem icons were COMPLETELY different. So in order to work everything out, I had to change the way I was displaying the gems. Honestly I like my old way better, but Roy told me most casters prefer the changes Verant made to the gems just before the new UI went live on all servers. <br />
<br />
So... I grudgingly gave in and changed my graphics.<br />
Oh well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and Eilim... I had to do some major 'manual alignment&quot; in the Animation file. **grins** That's what happens when you make major changes and add a good many graphics huh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Zoning for updates like these were unrealiable before the patch for me at least... however the load UI command works just fine.<br />
<br />
Zoning for updates was a waste of load time IMO use the /load directoryUI 1 command and you can just sit there for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pini Uldar</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never seen /loadskin cause the tga files to be reloaded. If you're just doing XML layout sure. But if you're dinking with titlebars or spell icons, then you need to do something to cause the tga file to be cached.<br />
<br />
Before this patch, zoning would accomplish this for me. After this patch, it seemed to me like they weren't reloading. This was evidenced by window_pieces01.tga being the default one even after I loaded my skin and zoned. I then put a big red splotch in the middle of my koa icon and zoned and no big red splotch. Thus I think the graphics files are being cached now because it would explain both those things.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong though.<br />

<br />
I'm still playing with things tho so I don't know it all and am probably mistaken on alot :p<br />
<br />
On the irritating side... Shownames is still not working.<br />
<br />
What about asking for an update folder in the UI folder so we don't have to dig and compare and figure out what files were changed?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any idea how to circumvent the caching, so it loads the mod you want, rather than keeping the original graphics?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that the UI is bugged with this. I mod'd the same file and then started EQ. Nothing.<br />
Moded the Dark_bg file and started EQ, I saw it.<br />
<br />
From what I was playing with the window_pieces01.tga and the light_bg.tga files are not loading at all.<br />
<br />
Maybe others?</div></div><hr />

What's that load UI command and does it differ any from the /loadskin command?</div></div><hr />

The hard part is finding the changes within a file, which now that we have the above-mentioned probram is purty easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it's not. Just pay attention to your patcher as it downloads.<br />
<br />
And uncheck Autoplay. :D</div></div><hr />
