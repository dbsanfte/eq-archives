<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iigg</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this is no way an original, however it's not a downloadable UI either. This UI was created using the following individuals work and/or ideas: CenthenaUI, Anatis, Ghesta, Yasoldat, Kel, Kilamon, Kuvasie, Trallos Drachen, Sabrine, eqvalgrim, and TK and Remelio.<br />
That being said here's alook at it. Please tell me what ya think. I was going for practicality, looks and ease of use. As a Shaman I really don't have much use for bard spells, they're on-off-on-off.....etc. I can't stand the constant changes in my veiwing area. So while I did include one in the UI, it is not pictured for that reason. <br />
Centhenaui is the base model for almost 90% of the pop-up items ie. map/guild/journal except for the spellbook which is TKDraconis. Icons are nice for me a little more vibrant colors than the standard ones. <br />
One important note, the windows and bars pictured are not what is depicted in the Downloads pages, I have the texures turned off on almost all of them for cobat effectivness. Inventory page (also not seen) is TKdraconis as well with Anatis' shaman pic in Autoequip area.<br />
Now be rude, crude or mean, but please be honest. this was my 1st attempt at anything UI related. Even being a Mix-and-Match this took 3 days to assemble/sort and work through the bugs in compatiblitly. My hat goes off to those of you who are brave enuff to do this for months and months. If this UI bug stays in my system, I might just have to learn how to do this myself. Thank you and I hope with enough positive feedback I'll probably include which files were used as I could't upload it anyway 9megs+. <br />
