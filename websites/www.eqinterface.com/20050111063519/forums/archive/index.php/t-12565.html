He created some life/mana/etc. meters or gauges that i saw in one of your complete UI's Cairenn. He has a pic shown on his boards, but no place to download them as a stand alone mod. I only use a few mods for specific windows and had to hack out the window_pieces file that contains these meters from one of your UI's. However in doing so it has slightly messed up a few portions of things because its using parts of your custom UI. Is there anyway to get this TGA file with just the meters modified? Thanx in advance for any help.<br />
<br />
P.S. im not good with TGA files, so i dont really wanna mess with it myself.</div></div><hr />
