All files are updated for the GoD Expansion and patches as of 3-6-2004.<br />
<br />
This UI is designed for someone running EQ at a 1280x1024 resolution.  The layout was inspired <br />
by an old UI that Grimthorn did back when PoP was first released.  It hasn't been updated since<br />
then with some of the newer options, so I modified GrimUI7 so it looks like the much older version.<br />
<br />

If I miss anyone, I apologize.  Please let me know and I'll add you to the list.<br />

Grimthorn              - for GrimUI7 which was used as the base for this project, and for the layout<br />
                         inspiration from one of his older UI's.<br />
Ultrax                 - for the Bazaar Search Window<br />
