<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lhyrica</div><div class="date">06-06-2004, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After a clean install of windows you wont have an antivirus or a firewall installed (assuming it is windows you use). And alas all the nasty little things have a free ride into your computer if the cable is connected during this time. It doesnt matter what you do and m$ still havent fixed this. You WILL get a virus directly. Usually with the cute &quot;shutdown-in-30-sec&quot; effect. Quite easy to assume that the first file you download is infected if you notice a virus afterwards. (Ofcourse if you are behind a router, have another OS etc this wont be the case.) Hope you sort it out sir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">06-06-2004, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You did not get the virus from this site. <br />
<br />
1. we dont have a &quot;randal's Ui&quot;<br />
<br />
2. we check every file before they are allowed to the public to be downloaded, and we have never let a virus get by<br />
<br />
3. our sever does a virus scan every night just to verify that no virus have gotten by an admin.<br />
<br />
In two years and 192,000 people we have never let a virus out. <br />
<br />
So I can say for sure... it didn't come from here!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">06-06-2004, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also gif's can't be used as a trojan. If it could be we would all be in major trouble as a large amount of websites use the gif format for their website graphics.<br />
<br />
Every time I get a report like yours I run a manual scan on the filevault with the latest version of clamscan (linux anti-virus). Nothing has come up.<br />
<br />
I'll always investigate any virus report but the likely hood of it being from us is almost nill.<br />
<br />
Moving this post to the correct forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Camar</div><div class="date">06-06-2004, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe Dasler was referring to the new Bard Themed UI by RandelFlag (http://eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3335) .<br />
<br />
And no, I'm not even hinting that his new trojan came from EQInterface.com.  I find that highly unlikely considering the amount of downloads that happen on a daily basis.  There'd be hordes of people screaming if something on the file server was infected.</div></div><hr />

Thanks I like to personaly tripple check with my home scaner, theres no gui.gif file let alone any other files in that interface that can harbor a trojan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">06-06-2004, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as the admin that approved the file, I can also guarantee you (on top of Kudane and Dolby already doing so) that there is no virus in that UI.  Every UI we approve is virus checked and also manually verified as having no inappropriate files.  We don't even allow .exe or .vbs files, just to make damn good and sure that nothing gets through.  I also (as well as Dolby, as previously stated) just re-checked the download, and there isn't even a file in that UI named gui.gif.  The virus did not come from here.  Not a chance.</div></div><hr />
