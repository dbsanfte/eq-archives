I keep EQ loaded up on my other machine while I am working on my UI's, and after loading the UI a number of times EQ crashed with a GUI XML error - Check your UIErrors.txt file (or something like that).  Now there it never anything wrong with my XML, and the UI loades fine when I start EQ again.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if I am missing something somewhere that might cause this.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Only happened about 3 times thus far but hasnt been too inconvient so I didint look into it deeply.</div></div><hr />

Probably just gets fussy because we are confusing it by /load'ing so many times.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it has something to do with memory, as most things in Windows tend to not be very tidy with the RAM. Reloading the UI probably leaves reminents in the RAM, and after so many times... there's bound to be a general protection fault as something tries to access some memory that is already in use. Yet another of those things that we just chalk up to that fancy OS we're all stuck with. Horray Windows.<br />
<br />
It happens to me too, but I never thought much of it. I'm sure if I was still using windows 98 it would tell me that EQ had performed an illegal operation and would have to be shut down... considering that's what it says about any program that is running when windows mishandles the RAM.<br />

The computer that I use to view my UI's is pretty crappy 450mhz and reloading EQ takes longer that I like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Genghiz Cohen</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">isn't there some handy tool for viewing UI's somewhere?... you know, on a screenshot background or whatever... would be very handy... <br />
<br />
personally I want an XML editor that works like HomeSite.. that would be saweet... if anyone knows of such a proggie, let me know hehe =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of us are using either SidlWidl or Sidl Fiddle (you can find links for both down in the Developer's section).  They let you see your windows out of game, but many folks (self very much included) like to see how they look in game to tweak them.</div></div><hr />
