<br />
Does anyone know what has happened to the Warcraft 3 UI's that were floating around before? I found the Undead, but really wanted the Orc + Human ones.<br />
<br />
I searched both the archives, Beta and Released forums but couldn't find them.<br />
<br />
Also, knowing how old they are, does anyone have a current and updated version of these?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

They have been moved to our archive downloads. The archive downloads section does not keep pictures (so the picture link wont work) of the mods only the zip files. Click the downloads link at the top and then scroll down to z_archives and you will see them in there.<br />
<br />
Feel free to update the code and take them over and upload them to our site as new versions. I'm sure many people would like to see these mods working again.</div></div><hr />
