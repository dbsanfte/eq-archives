<br />
Something I was thinking about and wondered if anyone knew the answer cause i cant find any documentation on this on the web anywhere.<br />
I have Everquest, Kunark Expansion and Luclin Expansion, but i never bought Velious. I was recently thinking of buying Velious but the thought occured to me that it might not like having the old velious files running with the new luclin updated graphics ones. Would I have to uninstall luclin, install velious and then re-install Luclin? Or would Luclin just automatically use it's own updated velious graphic files once Velious was installed?<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any thoughts on this?</div></div><hr />

He never saw the use for it (but eventually envy about those of us who went there and did things got the better of him)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dyllwindw</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure, but I don't think the patcher would overwrite the texture files...if it did then anyone who still used the old textures would have them overwritten everytime they logged in. If the person is using the new textures I would think they *may* need to reinstall Luclin textures afterwards. If nothing else it certainly can't hurt :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does overwrite the texture files.  however the &quot;old&quot; textures, the &quot;velious&quot; textures, and the &quot;luclin&quot; textures are in seperate files, just like the &quot;old&quot; models and the &quot;luclin&quot; models are in seperate files.</div></div><hr />
