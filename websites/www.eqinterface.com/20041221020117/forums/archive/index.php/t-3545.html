If it goes over well without too many pot holes, then maybe I'll try something a little more permanent. But for now...<br />

I have set up a temporary 'live' chat site for UI help and general UI discussions. If you want to check it out, hop over to http://irc.zyberwerx.net and take a peek. There is a provided web chat interface (ugly looking but it's atleast something) as well as details for using your preferred chat clients.<br />

P.S. Kudane, Dolby... if this does not sit well with you, perhaps we can work out some better arrangements.<br />

Oops: Sorry about the faulty link, DNS server wasn't configured for the hostname. Should be working now.</div></div><hr />

I'm working a graveyard shift at the office every other night for a while, and have little to do to occupy my brain. So as long as I'm there, might as well try to help a few people with UIs. <br />
<br />
Also, others are more than welcome to stop in a chat. The server is up and running 24/7 and is open to anyone who can get on.<br />
