<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellyana</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">reposted from EQLive  Upcoming Updates (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp) <br />
<br />
Here are some things we're working on for the November update: (Please note: my producer is making me tell you that in addition to this list, we'll still be bug fixing and maintaining the live game and that, while we hope to get each of these features in, nothing is certain. But this is what we're working on at the present time.) <br />
<br />
<br />
New LDoN raids will go Live - We be moving the two new raids that were introduced on Stormhammer to the Live servers. These raids will prove an interesting challenge for the best of guilds. <br />
<br />
Another new LDoN raid - We will also be bringing one more new LDoN raid to Stormhammer with our next update. This raid will be created with Elemental capable characters in mind. <br />
<br />
Font changes - Since EverQuest was launched, there has only been one font available. With the next update we plan to introduce the option for players to choose the font for their interface. <br />
<br />
Targeting - Sometimes it can be difficult to tell which NPC you have targeted. With the next update we hope to add a targeting indicator of some sort (something like the ring that surrounds your target in EQOA). The exact form hasn't been decided, but the goal is to make seeing what you currently have targeted much easier. <br />
<br />
Consider - Along the same lines as the proposed improvement to targeting, we want to add a way to distinguish the /con color of your target. We plan an indicator that will be easily distinguished once you have a target (probably someplace in the Target window), that should remove the need to use the /con command. <br />
<br />
Other interface changes - We are also working on some other changes that will help you to organize your information. We plan to add a new text color option for damage shield reports that will allow you to pick what color those messages use. We also want to split the &quot;My Pet Attacks&quot; filter into two separate filters, one for hits and one for misses. <br />
<br />
/tell windows - It is very easy to lose /tells in the confusion of combat. We want to add an option that would work much like an instant messenger. Each time you get a &quot;tell&quot; from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window will only display &quot;tells&quot; from the particular character, and any message sent from the chat window would automatically be sent as a &quot;tell&quot; to that character. Obviously this would be an optional feature. <br />
<br />
Help for new players - New characters will start with a bag. This will give them a little more storage space and the opportunity to learn how storage containers work earlier rather than later. We are also working on removing one of the more tedious &quot;features&quot; of the game, the need to practice Sense Heading. Most folks have that skill mapped to trigger along with one of their movement keys. Not an exciting skill to practice. So we plan to have all characters start with a 200 skill in Sense Heading. This will allow new players to navigate more easily, and will reduce a bit of tedium over the course of gameplay.<br />

The only thing that concerns me is if it's a blanket change... you want a different font in the chat windows, and it changes all the fonts, including the names over people's heads. I hope they give a decent amount of control.<br />
<br />
What's the deal with all the help for young characters?!? In my day we had to walk to and from the merchants... uphill both ways! We didn't have bags or a compass... and we liked it!! hehe. <br />
<br />
Looks like good stuff. If only fixing old bugs was a little higher on the list... I love new stuff, but problems that have been around for years in some cases are kind of a bad mark on SoE. They need to know their own game well enough to get the oldest bugs out eventually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this a really dumb.. why not have the newbies hit sense heading like we have for over 4 years....why would anyone want to level up if your going to give them all the options that higher level have??<br />
<br />
In my opinion if there to dumb to know how to hit a button then they don't belong in this game..<br />

Other wise it looks good =)</div></div><hr />

Help for new players - New characters will start with their epics, and 30000plat.  This will give them a little more twink ability and the opportunity to learn how to handle the stress of getting to level 65 in 2 weeks.  We are also working removing one of the more tedious &quot;features&quot; of the game, the need to practice anything.  Most folks don't have the time to work on their skills.  So we plan to add a macro into the game that will let you raise your skills by 200 points all at once, untill they are all capped.</div></div><hr />

Font changes - Since EverQuest was launched, there has only been one font available. With the next update we plan to introduce the option for players to choose the font for their interface.<br />
I've posted in the Test forum (as per usual) the changes as they currently stand.  What I've determined thus far is that it allows you to choose any font you have installed on your computer, via a drop down list on the first tab of the in-game Options Window (alt + O).  It currently affects all text that you see on your screen, including NPC names, PC names, even the lag meter.<br />
<br />
Targeting - Sometimes it can be difficult to tell which NPC you have targeted. With the next update we hope to add a targeting indicator of some sort (something like the ring that surrounds your target in EQOA). The exact form hasn't been decided, but the goal is to make seeing what you currently have targeted much easier. <br />
Didn't notice this right off the top, I'll have to go back and look again to see if I can &quot;see&quot; it.<br />
<br />
Consider - Along the same lines as the proposed improvement to targeting, we want to add a way to distinguish the /con color of your target. We plan an indicator that will be easily distinguished once you have a target (probably someplace in the Target window), that should remove the need to use the /con command. <br />
Currently this shows up as a border around the target window, without any changes to the EQUI_TargetWindow.xml file.  ie, no EQ Type number, ie no moving it to another window, it goes around the target window and that's it.<br />
<br />
Other interface changes - We are also working on some other changes that will help you to organize your information. We plan to add a new text color option for damage shield reports that will allow you to pick what color those messages use. We also want to split the &quot;My Pet Attacks&quot; filter into two separate filters, one for hits and one for misses. <br />
These are both in as changes to the EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml.  The two dealing with the pet are on the &quot;filters&quot; tab, and the dmg shield reports is on the &quot;color&quot; page along with the rest of them. ;)<br />
<br />
/tell windows - It is very easy to lose /tells in the confusion of combat. We want to add an option that would work much like an instant messenger. Each time you get a &quot;tell&quot; from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window will only display &quot;tells&quot; from the particular character, and any message sent from the chat window would automatically be sent as a &quot;tell&quot; to that character. Obviously this would be an optional feature. <br />
No sign of this, but I was only on very very briefly, just long enough to get the xml file changes.  No option in the Options window to turn it off, so not sure how you choose.  Will post when I find out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I SERIOUSLY hope this is how it goes live. It'd go perfectly with my target window. Sucks for all of you that use the player window as a target window, but that's why it's the player window...<br />

Some noob should not be able to walk out of their little shell into the world and know where the hell they're goin.  I didn't get to, and I know half of you were just as frustrated when you started as I was.  Think of it as hazing for a new player.  Now they're telling me all my effort was useless!!!!

Quite a few games have already implemented this aside from EQOA. About time that they figured this out. EQ may be ahead of its times in some areas, but its still first generation in others.</div></div><hr />

The MP3 window doesn't close when you hit ESC on test server. Yay!<br />
<br />
My newbie had 200 sense heading and a bag. Boo. Super boo, I hate SOE for this. I worked up sense heading to 200 years before there was a compass window, or new UI, or anything.<br />
<br />
The font options suck. Anything except Arial looks horrible. I mean, Times New Roman and OCR A Extended I &quot;liked&quot; but f'ed up parts of my UI that depend on the font being Arial. I wish I could force the font using my UI. Maybe I'll just cut out the font change options or put a big warning label near the option.<br />

Oh, also they made &quot;/load uiname&quot; the same as &quot;/load uiname 1&quot;, if I wanted to reset window spots I had to use &quot;/load uiname 0&quot;<br />

<br />
Just get rid of the sense heaidng skill altogether furthermore, those with 200 keep steady compass, those that never reached 200 are forever stuck with an inaccurate compass.</div></div><hr />

No &quot;you might survive&quot; or any other con. Just a simple &quot;Death&quot; or &quot;Life&quot; The results are already destined for you before you attack it, so you know what to avoid. Theres no combat, if you are destined to win you just click attack and boom, you have your experience and loot, and move on your merry way. And if you attack an &quot;you will die&quot; creature, the game automatically ports you to your bind location without even throwing an attack.</div></div><hr />

It could be that the color of the target's text name, the color of the target's hp gauge or a little square (or circle) by the target's name would all be good ideas for this feature.<br />

The con box is indeed horrible. I tried it with several different mods and it's going to make quite a few of them very hard to live with. We can only pray they add it to the xml so it can be moved and resized... or something. I like the idea of the target name... maybe if nothing else put a 1 pixel box around the target name.<br />
<br />
I tried out all the fonts I have on my computer.. it doesn't actually reload the UI, just all the fonts change. I'm not sure how it's done. A lot of the fonts on my computer ( I have tons) defaulted back to arial. It looks like most fonts that are to far from normal text will default back. It shows the name of the font you picked as the current font, but all the text on the screen stays in arial. The difference between size 4 and 5 in the chat windows is still just as huge with most fonts... it's like fontsize 4 is 8 point and fontsize 5 is 20 point or something. =(</div></div><hr />

WHen you target something a colored circle appears on what you have targeted, and the color of the circle is the &quot;con&quot; color</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;con&quot; border around the targetting window is ugly ugly ugly and is going to completely destroy the appearance of many custom UIs.  Also, make it or the red flashing &quot;attack border&quot; movable.  I want them on the same window.  Consider how many folks have completely swapped the player and the target windows, in order to have the flashing border around the &quot;target&quot;.<br />
<br />
In all practicality though, I too like the idea of the mob's name being the color it cons.  I think that would be a much better implimentation of it.<br />
<br />
As for the targetting circle ... what targetting circle?  Has it not been implimented on Test yet, or am I just not seeing it?  Because I certainly don't see it.<br />
<br />
I'd also love to see them impliment the ability to change the font size.  It's nice that we can now pick and choose whatever font we want from what is installed on our computer, but give us the ability to scale them, too.</div></div><hr />

Targeting - Sometimes it can be difficult to tell which NPC you have targeted. With the next update we hope to add a targeting indicator of some sort (something like the ring that surrounds your target in EQOA). The exact form hasn't been decided, but the goal is to make seeing what you currently have targeted much easier.  <br />
<br />
<br />
my suggestion (and I have done feedback on it) was to combine the ring that surrounds your target with /con making the ring be the color of the /con. So that the /con of the mob appears around the target instead of around the target window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LiamLee</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the unfortunate happens and they leave the /con feature as it is on test then I have an idea for those of us that have our target info in another window.  Make the target window transparent and size it down to 1x1 pixels and move the target window next to where the target info is in the UI.  When something is targeted then a small box should (Mind you I have not tested this) appear next to the target info.  I still like Ellyana's idea better but I think this might work if it stays as it is now on test.</div></div><hr />

What will they give new players next? Part of learning the game is dealing with tedious tasks. Hey why not let me max my smithing skill, something REALLY tedious as well expensive for less than a gazillion plat!!<br />
<br />
Yah it was awful being new and losing my corpse, so now new players don't have that worry. Good, good. So they also now get a whole stack of food and drink. Fine, fine. And lest they get lost in the bazaar looking for merchants to spend their 'hard earned&quot; **cough** plat, they now have a mystical path lead the way. So far so good, but really, &quot;Sense Heading??&quot; Come on SONY! Kids aren't born with perfect sense of direction and we survive. Heck we aren't even able to walk!! and still manage to do just fine.<br />
<br />
I think it is a better play environment if the game is not 'dumbed down' to the point of being &quot;EQ for IDIOTS!&quot;<br />

Ok, newbs start with a bag.  When I made my first character, I looted everything off mobs I killed, and by level 2, which took like 15 minutes, I had 8 gold to buy a bag.  Second, Sense Heading.  This IS NOT gimping the game at all IMO.  Why should noobs have to suffer through clicking the button while they med over and over?  Does it build character?  Not in my opinion.  It's not going to affect the player's skill if they don't have to tediously click a button over and over trying to raise a skill that isn't that useful anymore.  Think about it, the map is a compass in itself, up = north, down = south, so really, everyone has Sense Heading at 200, if you can read directions that is.</div></div><hr />

I think this a really dumb.. why not have the newbies hit sense heading like we have for over 4 years....why would anyone want to level up if your going to give them all the options that higher level have??<br />
<br />
In my opinion if there to dumb to know how to hit a button then they don't belong in this game..<br />
<br />
Other wise it looks good =)  <br />
I don't think its dumb.  What is dumb is the way it currently is.  I have played since day one, and have never once built my skill up in sense heading due to the fact I didn't care to click that dang button 10 million times.  And the fact you can buy a compass  from a merchant and save yourself the sore fingers, for 3p.<br />
<br />
DAOC has had this instant compass option since day one, and thats the way it should be in Everquest.<br />
<br />
There is nothing to gain by making a person click a button 10 million times, except perhaps to lose their sanity, and waste their time.<br />
<br />
PS: After reading more posts in this thread, obviously many here aren't aware of the fact that you can buy a compass from some of the merchants in the game.</div></div><hr />

Pardon my brashness, but ummmm... hasn't anyone heard of key mapping it to your left and right arrow keys, and assign a hotkey to it? Everytime you turn you do a skill check. It's really not that difficult, and before you know it. Your score will be maxed for the level. So what's so difficult about that?</div></div><hr />

It may not be entirely fair that we had to max out Sense heading the old way.. but its an Improvment! it doesnt harm anyone. Its not Unbalancing in anyway. Honestly with the Introduction of the map; sense heading and the compass are pretty much obsolete.<br />

I was very happy to get sense of heading maxed out on my two main characters, because the compass would stay still and you'd get that nifty arrow on your map making it much easier to tell where you were headed. <br />
<br />
Their reasoning for taking this skill away seems faulty to me too. If they're doing it to make things easier for newbies, then why bother getting ANY skills up at all? Why not start everyone out with max swimming for example? Why should newbies start out with such poor melee skills? Why not let them start out at 100? Or why don't we just elimate the lower levels altogether? <br />
<br />
Ah, well ~sighs~ I also had to walk to school uphill both ways in the blinding snow. I'll stop now before I start sound too old. :) I do think dwarves should be given a new racial bonus though. All dwarves as a racial ability automatically start off with 50 in sense heading, which I actually found useful and really liked on my level 7 dwarf.</div></div><hr />

In my short time in Norrath I've hit level 55, gotten one AA, bought a horse, earned 90% of my gear, brought baking to 148, fishing to 190, sense heading 200.<br />
<br />
Anyway back on topic, it seems people aren't mad about the sense heading skill being chucked but that next batch of new players will have the game handed to them on a silver plater.  It seems that way for me actually.  I got my main from 1 to 55 in about 5 months.  My alts only have to get to about 20 before I can just do nothing but LDoN crawls and get uber loot and XP.

<br />
<br />
 After thinking about it -<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, after ranting about it, THEN thinking about it -<br />
<br />
<br />
These changes aren't really all that unreasonable. I've played other games where you start with storage and a 100% accurate compass. Heck, in RL, you get a compass and it works, you don't have to train to use it, and there are plenty of decent RP reasons for a new character to start with a bag. Heck, they start with food, drink, armor (well, a tunic), a weapon, and casters with 1 or 2 spells... heck, they need a bag just to put it all in. If one can live with that, a bag is no stretch.<br />
<br />
Having said that... I hate it. The 'dumbing down of Norrath' continues apace. It's not a matter of &quot;I had it this hard, they should too&quot; (well, only a little ;) ), it's more about integrity of design. The game was designed to move at a certain pace in a certain way (personal creativity aside)... one of the selling points was you actually had to USE your skills to improve them. What equipment you got you had to earn, one way or another.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is just one more small step in that endless vicious cycle... established characters/players twink new characters/players, devs make new opponents that much more difficult, devs are 'forced' to make the reward appear in line with the greater risk, making established characters/players more powerful, leading to twinking new characters/players with more powerful equipment... while those of us attempting to play IN the world get left further and further behind.<br />
<br />
Some of my characters have 200 Sense Heading (my ranger, my bard), some have next to none (my rogue, my cleric); this is for RP reasons. I don't WANT my rogue or cleric knowing exactly where they are at all times, it's not their nature. They have to depend on others to find anything or get anywhere. My ranger and bard SHOULD know where they are and where to go, it's part of who and what they are.<br />
<br />
I don't play a game for it to be work; neither do I play it for a quick fix of success. If I want to destroy all enemies with no risk or effort, I'll go back and play Half-Life in God Mode (at least it had a consistent story...). Easy isn't always bad... but easier and easier is not better and better.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion. I won't quit EQ over it (obviously), but I reserve the right to be sad about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, re: the targeting border: great idea, bad implementation! :rolleyes:  Devs, back to the drawing board, but DO go back and try again please! :)</div></div><hr />

That was what I was talking about and that had me so excited.  That being said ... You can put it in another window, but it doesn't change colour to the con, it stays white.  So I was right and wrong, all at the same time.  Bleh. =(<br />
<br />
However, the way they have it implemented now is a definite improvement over what it had been.  It looks much better now than it did.<br />

I have editted the targetbox.tga file and think I have come up with a solution to my problem.  Here is a picture of how I fixed this:<br />

Now I can actually read it when playing with a black chat window. :D</div></div><hr />

Several windows in my UI needed rebuilds to fit the text.<br />
<br />
Cool to try but doubt i will use any other.</div></div><hr />

It is rather helpful, there are a lot of different fonts too. When you change the font, it will show the new font in all your windows, hotkeys, macro's, socials, etc...<br />
At least that's how it's happining there.</div></div><hr />
