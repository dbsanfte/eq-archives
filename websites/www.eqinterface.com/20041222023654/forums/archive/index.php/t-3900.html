<br />
These two boys are my wifes cousins, so actually mine as well. As I said this is a shot in the dark, but If they are indeed headed somewhere other than Ohio, what better place to get the message out other than on EQ message boards where there are people who play all around the country and around the world. As I said please at least give the poster a look, thou chances are you wont see them, but I am asking for everyones help.<br />
<br />
Also please feel free to copy and post this on any other message boards or someplace people can see it. Thank you all for your time.<br />

I'm not in Ohio, but Maryland isn't too far, and..well, the more people who know about it, the better. There's nothing scarier than children going missing, and I hope as i'm sure you are that someone will see something that can lead to their return. I wish yougood luck, and offer my prayers for their safebeing in the mean time. :(</div></div><hr />

I'm in the South East corner of Ohio so probably not to much help but will keep an eye out for ya as much as i can.  I'm sorry to hear about this and my heart goes out to you in hopes of a safe return</div></div><hr />
