<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draw1more</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I attached my idea concept for a custom UI.  Now the base of my design is the UI used in the WoW SS I have seen, just modified for EQ.  I was also hoping that maybe someone who likes the design and knows how to use XML really well might be inclined to create a real UI out of this picture.  I myself am just starting to learn how to code XML and this design is out of my league.  Also I was hoping to add some type of more interesting textures to the windows, plain colors are boring, but have no ideas of what they should look like.  Any and all opinions are welcome, Thanks in Advanced!<br />

Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - Interesting layout though. Get someone to code it. I'm busy with ACUI else I'd offer myself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Needs a target bar. Period. I urge continuity in gauge size; all should be equal.<br />

<br />
Otherwise, it looks very nice.<br />

I really wish I could say yes.  But things have gone a little south for me atm, and I am behind on what I need to do for Thomus.  I am sure Enok would take you up on it.  ;)<br />
<br />
Kuv<br />
<br />
Edit .. Well now I see that Enok is busy also.  Hmmm?  There are lots of people here who can help.  Just start one piece at a time.  We can offer lots of advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dedara</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice idea, but some things could be difficult.<br />
<br />
currently the pet window disappears when u loose pet.<br />
instead of inventory in bottom right i would use window selector.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draw1more</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 01:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just kinda put this together quick, lots of stuff is missing.  I just put what I had done out there to get some feedback, I'll try and work out the stuff I left out in there somehow too...Thanks again for feedback =)<br />
<br />
*EDIT - Attached new image with the stuff I forgot that you guys mentioned above, hope that looks better =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dravun</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow very clean and very nice, I just pray someone does it in 1024 x 768.<br />
<br />
I would run a higher res but I have tons of graphics lag as is trying to move around.<br />
<br />
Maybe I need more than a 9700 pro and 512mb ram.<br />
<br />
But back to topic, very clean and very nice. Really hope someone does the xml on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Care</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this idea myself (though for me I would like it  mirrored, switch target for pet space ,and am addicted to horazontal buffs.) I really hope you get someone to do this for you and post it . Definatly think it would be be such a clean look for cleric's like myself.</div></div><hr />
