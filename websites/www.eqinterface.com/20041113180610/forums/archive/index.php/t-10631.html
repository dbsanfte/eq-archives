<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geln</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, but I hate R3. Please, please gilve us a patch for R2 to work with SOE's latest &quot;improvements&quot; on the UI. Or please tell me how to do it myself. I've been trying for the last 2 hours and EQ seems to crash every 2nd UI change. Very frustrating. It certainly makes me appreciate what you do, but it makes it hard as hell for me to get what I want if I don't use exactly what you do.<br />
<br />
1) Inventory slots have a weird &quot;ball&quot; in them instead of a blank box. VERY hard to see at a glance if the slot contains something or not.<br />
<br />
2) Casting. I'm a bard. I need to know exactly where my casting timer is at. I got used to it being combined into the target window with your UI, but I needed the pink color that flashed over the pet health bar. The dark blue long casting timer that is above my health is just too indistinct and too large. When I'm twisting, I need to know at a glance - usually out of the corner of my eye - how long until the next pulse. I cannot do this with only the long, thin, blue casting meter left over for R3.<br />
<br />
3) Sorry, but I didn't lay out my screen as you have yours. My effects are on the right. This worked well with two columns of squares - one for easily visible icon and one for a legible description. But with R3, in order to see the tiny names which stretch much futher into my viewing area, my icons have to be on the left of the screen or their in the way. R2 could go on either side. R2 icons were much easier to see. In R3, they've been shrunken to an indistinguishable blob. If you're going to use such great graphics for the icons, please don't diminish them to just a few pixels.<br />
<br />
4) Same thing goes for short duration buff (song effects) window. It was laid out horizontally. It was (and still is) a pain in the butt to move to where I wanted, but at least once it was there I thought it would stay there. Now it's vertical. I have to say, unless you're in a raid or group with more than one bard, there just is very little chance that thing will see more than 3 icons at a time. Please let me use the horizontal layout. It was nice in the center of my screen next to my casting bar for twisting.<br />
<br />
5) MP3 Player. I do like R3's player. The script font used for the wording of the R2 version was pretty illegible and I like the streamlined change. It'd be nice if I could mix and match to add this to R2.<br />
<br />
6) Same goes for compass. Much nicer in R3. Much easier to read at a glance.<br />
<br />
Overall, I chose your UI as it had a lot of information in a clean, neat, compact layout that left room for customization. I'm disappointed that R3 doesn't have that same room.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no wish to be rude, but I do wish to take issue with you on the tone of your post. <br />
<br />
Aya provides the UI as a labor of love, not as a retail product.  The effort is purely voluntary on their part.   To make demands of them as if you were a paying customer is ... impolite. <br />
<br />
If you simply need patches to the previous version, Carenin has made the base-line changes available elsewhere on this site, and fairly clear instructions on how to add them to your current set of files. <br />
<br />
Pointing out enhancements, or sugguesting changes is fine, really.  But don't demand that someone do something because you don't like their current creative offering.  <br />
<br />
I'm almost certain to step on some toes with this post (both intentionally and unintentionally) but I felt that something ought to be said.   <br />

Thanks for All comments, but please understand. I'm still busy and<br />
I cannot support 2 of my UIs, so i selected R3.<br />
<br />
1) You can install R2 Skins from R2skin folder.<br />
2) already remake in R3.1 Pet Window.<br />
3) I cannot support another layout, thats why , not enough time (<br />
4) We are in Plane of Time and I need to know what Songs Now I have. So need to remake Shortduration buff window.<br />

According to some replies, this help in patching R2 is out there, I just need to find it. Thank you for that. <br />
<br />
Of course I realize that you do this for free and that you don't have to adapt to my wishes (hardly demands). I didn't mean to offend. Rather I did hope to show you the problems I'm having with the changes you've made and what I liked about the previous version. I had thought the feedback would help you make something more versatile and appealing to more people who maybe don't have the same layout or priorities as you have.<br />
<br />
As a designer, I offered the kind of feedback I like to hear on my work - not just gushing praise (which is deserved for the hard work you do, but really doesn't offer much back to you), but feedback and insight into how someone else uses your work and ideas on what works and what doesn't.<br />
<br />
Thanks for what you do.</div></div><hr />

Danille<br />

Ok i finally got the chat windows to work and now realize that my monitor wont work at 1280X1024. I get a big black border on the bottom ( really takes up too much of the screen) and the font is so faint that i cant read the chat windows, spell names and  buff names. <br />

It's too bad cause this is by far the best UI I have ever seen and really want to use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was wondering why in R3 you put the buffs and song windows to the left and the spellcast bar to the right. No offense I love everything else about it but 2 years playing with the spellcast bar to the right has kinda thrown me off. Try as I might I can't get the lables to face the opposite as they are so I can have my Left Castbar and right buffboxes. Can you or anyone help me out on this.<br />

Everything is perfect except the new Pet Buff / Player Window. The problem I am having is that I can't grab and move this window on the screen like every other window for this UI. Its like the window is frozen in that one spot and no matter where I place the mouse pointer, it wont let me grab and drag. Yes, I don't have that window locked, so I should be able to move it as I have been able to in every other version.<br />

<br />
I really like this UI, good job !<br />
<br />
I do have a little problem...it seems to crash the EQ client and it seems to make EQ chew up a lot of resources.<br />
I go back to my old UI, for testing purposes, and I had no problems.<br />
<br />
Does anyone seem to have this problem? Yes, I'm running the latest version, btw :)<br />
<br />
Even with those pesky errors I get....I still use this UI..very very nice :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ccharnle</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love this UI. :) <br />
<br />
1) Can someone explain the blue and white tick timers. It's obvious they are timers but exactly what they are timing eludes me.<br />
<br />
2) Can someone explain the four slots at the top of each container. It appears that two are the weapon and chest slots. Unclear what the other two are.<br />
<br />
3) Is there a GUI way to target yourself on this UI? I haven't been able to find one and having to hit F1 to target my character is not what I'd like to do.<br />
<br />
4) I had some questions on how to resize chat windows but it appears that they were answered in earlier emails. I'll have to go try the load default 1, change, load aya 1 trick and see if it works.<br />
<br />
Small complaint - The container graphics are rather tradeskill unfriendly. Sticking the combine button above the four slots mentioned in 1) above makes working on trade skills a PITA compared to having the button at the bottom of the container. I can live with it but ... :) <br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the wonderful UI.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.  What's happening is that if I do /bodytint and bring up the window, all of the color buttons are shaded dark grey (presumably from the UI).  If I click on an armor dye button to play with the colors, the &quot;Choose a color&quot; dialog has a problem.  All of the 15 buttons there are also dark grey.  They aren't showing the tints assigned to them.  As I pointed out in my original post, if I click on a button, the color values and sliders do adjust.  However, that is a very difficult way to do your armor tinting.<br />

<br />
Just one comment, I noticed that there is no LFG button. Are there any plans to include this. Also want to comment concerning the small size of the equipment icons. I believe they are just to small to be of much use because of the small size.<br />
<br />
Also I did see a bit of redundancy. When casting a spell, you have a spell casting line appear on the target health and at the same time you have a similiar bar just to the right doing the same thing.<br />
<br />
A suggestion would be to drop the spell casting line from the target health bar.</div></div><hr />

Finally using this Ui now did the /viewport reset                        and it adjusted to the correct size.<br />

Now i have one question I changed the cursor to the &quot;flashing cursor&quot; in the options folder which works, but both of them are very tiny. When on raids I have to have the spell effects off in order to be able to see the cursor.<br />
<br />
I tried to use the &quot;sceptre cursor&quot; in the options folder and when I copied the animations file and the sceptre file into the AYA folder as the instructions say... the Animations file (kind of an old file) messes up the  interface and EQ defaults the whole thing back to basicaly EQ's setup<br />
<br />
Any suggestions as to how this can be done? I tried several of the cursor files that you have posted on this site and I run into the same problem.</div></div><hr />

^-^.   I just started playing EQ and there were a few interface quirks that really bugged me, and this fixes all the major ones (big one being I want to see my EXP without having my inventory open. adding exp to the compass was a brilliant idea).<br />
<br />
However, I have one major bug that I think is a result of the interface (like I said, new to EQ so I'm not sure).<br />
<br />
I can't seem to cast Pendril's Animation.  Every time I do with Aya loaded, the client crashes.  I've tried switching back to default, casting Pendril's Animation and then switching back and it seems to work fine.. until I cross a zone transition when it crashes.<br />
<br />
I'm using &quot;AYA UI Version 6.50 Plus R3 Build2&quot; at 1280 x 1024 resoloution mode.  I have Everquest Evoloution, and do not have Dungeons of Norath.. so if there's something in that needed to make it work then you might want to put a note in the instructions, some people actually do read them ^-^.<br />
<br />
Also, one more thing I just realised might be part of the problem...<br />
<br />
I didn't quite understand instruction #4.. <br />
&quot;4) If 1280 x 1024 mode , Rename UI_Character_Server.ini &gt; UI_(YOUR CHARACTER NAME)_(Your Servercode).ini (i.e. : UI_Kxes_40.ini)&quot;<br />
<br />
How do I find out what my Servercode is?  I did a web search and came up with no information.  I'm on Bristlebane.   I figured this just had something to do with the 'default layout' and wasn't overly concerned...</div></div><hr />

Example mine says UI_Icerina_mithanie.  Whenever I want to copy instructions for a UI file I just rename it like it is. <br />

Hope that helps. I am not that great in giving instructions.</div></div><hr />

Okay yeah that's what I guessed.. I put UI_Caileach_bristle becaue bristle is what some of the files were appended with.  The example given said '_40' so I was wondering if it didn't have to be a number.<br />
<br />
So.. that's not the problem then =(.  It still crashes whenever I summon a pet (both the first level and 4th level enchanter pets).  or when the pet dies or is unsummoned for any reason.  I don't know if its specific to enchanter pets or not because I don't see this specific problem in this thread.</div></div><hr />

I love this UI, but I have stopped using it because I am having the same problem.  Everytime I summon a pet (Shaman, any level pet) with this UI since the last patch, EQ crashes.  I will post my UI Error file as soon as I get home this evening.</div></div><hr />

I have used your UI for nearly a year now, the last change to R3 was a change that took some getting used to but now that I am used to it I love it.<br />
<br />
Figured I would post what bugs I have found so far, Pets auto suicide (I may have to play around with this one, I am a cleric and rarely use pets anyways) when cast, Num-Lock (My autorun key) is sorta bugged, it works fine when going straight but you have no left right control while in autorun, also likes to do what I used to use my shift-up down arrows to scroll through sent messages.<br />
<br />
And last one I have yet to figure out is alt-tabbing isnt working for me anymore while using the new version.<br />
<br />
Keep up the great work, great UI!</div></div><hr />

Im just having one issue which i dont know if its something im missing or not please assist where able<br />
<br />
i downloaded the .zip file and extracted all files into a folder i created in the UI folder called AYA so thats now in there with Default and others.<br />
<br />
I got the default .ini file renamed it to my main characters name and since the changes kicked in it now names the servers as opposed to numbering them so it sporneh_nameless.ini<br />
<br />
i then loaded into EQ where i was still met with my old UI, i did /loadskin aya and the skin loaded but all the windows were all over... am i doing something wrong or is this normal i dont mind moving wondows about but some of them are quite difficult to manipulate..<br />
<br />
just to say again though luv the looks and functionality of this skin.<br />

<br />
Did you copy the INI file to your EQ root directory?<br />
<br />
Did you do /loadskin AYA 1?  The 1 tells EQ to use the preserve your window position settings if I recall correctly.  I've been using AYA so long I can't remember what it is like to switch from default to AYA anymore.  I do know that the AYA INI files have already been configured for 1280x1024 resolution. <br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zumbenn</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The key point is that the INI file provided is only for 1280x1024 since that is the res the skin creator runs at.<br />
<br />
Also, all the windows start out *locked*.  And some of them don't have resize edges on them.  There are replacement XML files in the BorderWindow directory if you want resizable windows.  <br />
<br />
FYI the chat windows do NOT have a title.  If you want more chat windows or want to resize them, you must get the resizable XML out of the BorderWindow directory.  I love this UI but I do run with more chat windows to isolate group chat, guild chat, and melee spam.<br />

The problem is, when I give or recieve tells, my Tell window pops up over my chat windows with no way to move or close it. I'm not sure if it's just me or an actual bug. If it is a bug, will you be fixing it soon? Or did you already patch it and I overlooked it?<br />

<br />
Well... everytime I tried using the windowed option by using the files in the BorderWindow folder, I would get the EQ has detected your client has crashed message.  When I would go to just the plain outta the zip pkg for the plain un-windowed style, it works fine.<br />

In either case, I'm crashing out, and XP is giving me a 'BUY MORE RAM, YOU STUPID BASTARD' message. This is actually very, very odd, considering my UI is larger sized, and has a larger sized graphics set. Oddly enough, mine works fine, while AYA does not. Maybe it's a memory leak inherent to the client that something about AYA pokes at. I couldn't tell you, but AYA, as it stands, is not working for the dude above me, for myself, and probably for a lot of other people =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the longest time I was trying to figure that out too... well... found out I had to do the following changes to the bottom of the <br />
EQUI_ChatWindow.xml file in AYA's UI:<br />
<br />
    &lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;true&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Closebox&gt;true&lt;/Style_Closebox&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Minimizebox&gt;true&lt;/Style_Minimizebox&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Border&gt;true&lt;/Style_Border&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Sizable&gt;true&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt;<br />
<br />
Make sure those lines say 'true' (without the quotes) and you will be able to close tell windows and minimize and move them around.  Though, it does provide a little less lines of visible chat, but I think it is worth it if tells are going to separate windows anyway.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...</div></div><hr />

The group window should be self explanitory. There are five Globes that also function along with the Group window.<br />
The Target Window is VERY COOL.<br />
The Box will show the CON color of the Target selected. You then have the name of the Target followed by the %, (this is in numeric). Followed by &quot;Life&quot;. This is YOUR current HP, followed YOUR max HP (Green), followed by YOUR % of HP.<br />
Below all that you will find YOUR % of Mana and Endurance followed by Mana rod Timer.<br />
The Stats window also functions as your pet window. You'll see a stamina cage (Yellow) and three buttons. The first button dispays your inventory, the second your pet commands and the third pet buffs.<br />
There is also a mana rod gage (Blue) and your hot buttons below all that.<br />

Im not sure if this all helps. Just play with it and it all will become clear. This is by far the BEST UI I have used.<br />

I downloaded the latest version today and discovered that the &quot;standard&quot; files work fine, but if I try to use the vertical spellbar (Verti_SpellGems\EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml) it causes the EQ client to crash hard, with not even an error message in the ui error log. <br />
<br />
Because the horizontal spellbar makes the spell help texts (when pressing alt) illegible, I would really like to be able to go back to the vertical alignment. Any suggestions?  <br />
<br />
<br />
I too am having the same problem you describe with the vertical spell gems.  It crashes EQ hard on my machine.  I tried plopping in my old EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml from a previous version of AYA UI and it still crashed.   *sigh*<br />
<br />
I REALLY love this UI, but I'm baffled that an xml file is crashing EQ.</div></div><hr />

There is a PET Health gage in the Pet Command Window. I think  that is why the Author removed it in this last Build.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danille</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your quick reply danny,<br />
<br />
I will explain why this change does not work for pet classes.<br />
<br />
The problem is that you cannot see the pet buffs and the pet health at the same time.<br />
<br />
With the last interface we could. <br />
<br />
It is very important for pet classes to see the pets health and the buffs at the same time.<br />
<br />
That window on the right side (three in one window) will only show one of three things at a time. <br />
<br />
1- equipment<br />
2- pet health and commands<br />
3- pet buffs <br />
<br />
With the old interface you could keep that window on #3 pet buffs... and watch the left/other side (Small window with pet health bar, percent and invite/disband keys) for pet health at the same time.<br />
<br />
If you have the window on pet health...which you need it on when soloing or fighting in a group or using your pet as the tank...You can't tell when the buffs are fading or have faded.<br />
<br />
I have had to heal my pet a lot more often not knowing what the problem is until I click over the window..often in the middle of a fight...to find that the buffs have faded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gee... Jober is losing health or not causing damage fast enough, I guess his Haste/HP/DS buffs have faded let me check&quot;<br />
<br />
Then I have to struggle thru the fight healing Jober instead of nuking  or leading the group until the mob is dead. <br />
<br />
Anyway is it possible that  author can provide assistance on how we can get the old (small pet health bar on the left side) one back again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danny91643</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree completly. Be even better if the Pet Health gauge were in the same window as the Pet Buffs. <br />
<br />
First: Send a PM to Kanon. The author is VERY good about getting back to people. Just keep in mind the author is Japanese.<br />
<br />
I am going to fool around with the XML to see if I can make the above described MOD. The author has about 20 slots for buffs in that window and I think there would be room to cut the buff slots down and insert the PH gauge. <br />

danille the pet health is permanenlty just above the invite button, on left side.  which is probally why its not in same window as pet buff anymore,<br />
<br />
<br />
For some reasoni cant resize chat windows.  Anyone else having this problem?  <br />
<br />
Sorry but the new AYA dated 12/20/03 does not have the pet health bar on the left side just above the invite/disband buttons<br />
<br />
The old one (prior to 12/20/03) did. That is exactly what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
As far as resetting your chat windows, I can help you with that.<br />
<br />
1) log your character into EQ<br />
2) once online and in the game, open your options window and select display and load the default (old) EQ user interface. <br />
3) Once it comes up move those chat windows to where you want them in the NEW interface. Dont touch or fix anything else, even if it looks wrong.<br />
4) now go back into options/display and change the user interface back to AYA.<br />
5) Once it comes up the chat windows will be exactly where u put them in the default (old) interface. This may take a few trys to get it perfectly lined up but it works well.<br />
<br />
<br />
GOOD LUCK</div></div><hr />

I agree completly. Be even better if the Pet Health gauge were in the same window as the Pet Buffs. <br />
<br />
First: Send a PM to Kanon. The author is VERY good about getting back to people. Just keep in mind the author is Japanese.<br />
<br />
I am going to fool around with the XML to see if I can make the above described MOD. The author has about 20 slots for buffs in that window and I think there would be room to cut the buff slots down and insert the PH gauge. <br />
<br />
;)  <br />
<br />
Danny,<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for taking the time ro read my post completly and also for understanding the problem. I took your advice and PM'ed Kanon today.<br />
<br />
I will continue to double check this forum for a possible solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your consideration.<br />

<br />
Go into the AYA\OptionalXMLandTGA\BorderWidnow (yes the directory name is misspelled in the zip file) directory and copy the .tga files and whichever .xml files you want for resizable windows.<br />
<br />
There is also a new INI file there but I don't know the particulars about it.  I've been running AYA so long that I just use a difference/merging text tool to pick up the new info I need from Kanon's changes.  I'm not running Kanon's absolute latest (I'm still running a late Nov/early Dec release) since it crashes EQ.  I haven't taken the time to research the problem though.<br />

<br />
I posted about this in response to Karmatic not too long ago, but here... of course, you need to use the windowed chat files also.<br />
<br />
For the longest time I was trying to figure that out too... well... found out I had to do the following changes to the bottom of the <br />
EQUI_ChatWindow.xml file in AYA's UI:<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;true&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;<br />
&lt;Style_Closebox&gt;true&lt;/Style_Closebox&gt;<br />
&lt;Style_Minimizebox&gt;true&lt;/Style_Minimizebox&gt;<br />
&lt;Style_Border&gt;true&lt;/Style_Border&gt;<br />
&lt;Style_Sizable&gt;true&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt;<br />
<br />
Make sure those lines say 'true' (without the quotes) and you will be able to close tell windows and minimize and move them around. Though, it does provide a little less lines of visible chat, but I think it is worth it if tells are going to separate windows anyway.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tencor</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few questions regarding this UI:<br />
- Are there any remedies to the pet window that other people have been referring to?  Is it possible to obtain one with buffs and the hp bar visable?<br />
<br />
- After loading this UI, all my confirmation boxes in the default UI's have lost their yes/no indicators and resize abilities.  Anyone know what may have caused this and if its possible to fix?  As you can imagine this is quite an issue with rezzes, tl's etc..<br />
<br />
- Is it possible to have all the old spell gems in the spell book, the buff windows and the spell casting bar?  When i copy the old spell gems file into the ui folder, it only changes the gem icons in the spell casting bar and not in the spell book nor the spell window.<br />
<br />
- Any plans for modifying the targeted name's text color to match the color con of the targeted npc/pc?  All names are listed in white text.  Red, blue, yellow, etc.. text would also be nice.<br />
<br />
Lastly would just like to say i think this is a great UI and look forward to using it.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Also is it best to PM the author of this UI, or does he check this thread frequently?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />

Yes, checking sometime but work hard and not enough time.<br />
Sorry for long long delay =( tried my best, but update my ui is<br />
hard for me now. <br />
<br />
Gem icons are<br />
<br />
gemicons 01 - 02.tga<br />
spells 01 - 05.tga<br />
<br />
You need to overwrite them from default folder.<br />

EQUI_ConfirmationDialog.xml from default.<br />

First question - I still get the &quot;Your UI Files are incomaptable blah blah blah&quot; red message when I first log in, but it seems to work fine. Is ther ea way to get rid of the message so EQ thinks it is working properly?<br />
<br />
Second question - With R3 all my windows are nice and lined up all at the bottom of the screen and I love it, but I notice when I hit F10 to go full screen to take screen shots, the portion of my screen at the bottom where the UI is before I hit F10 is solid black. Is there a way to make it transparent again so I can get full screen screenshots? <br />

Only two issues, the new tradeskill interface, obviously we don't have it for AYA in the release I have, and I seem to have the one still listed for download. The other issue is more like a wishlist/suggestion. I'd like to get the pet buff info somewhere, it's handy to have even if the icons are fairly tiny. Even just a + or - in each box color coded by type so we can see if our buffs are in place or if the pet's still been debuffed or poisoned....<br />
<br />
Thanks for a great UI, I certainly will be using it and have recommended it to a number of people as well, all that tried it loved it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">remyrw</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, so there was a slight error on the character UI file, it has AYA4 instead of AYA for the UI choice. But that was easy enough to find and fix, I imagine that's just from playtesting with multiple versions and not changing it back in the hurry to get us such a great UI.  :)<br />
<br />
I still want buff/debuff icons for the pet, but it certainly doesn't detract from how much I love this UI.<br />
<br />
Oh, just noticed, the music player is no longer on by default and there's no easy button for it. Once I post this I'll go look up how to get it back but the previous default with it already there was handy. It's such a small and slim item that leaving it on by default doesn't get in the way.  (edit) Found it, for some reason some of the characters had it set to show and some didn't, I just switched the &quot;show&quot; option for all of them to &quot;1&quot;.  God only knows why they weren't all identical, since I started with the file that came with the UI and just copied it over, changed the name to reflect my server then made dupes and fixed each character name. Somehow in there it changed a few settings between them. Lol, posessed computer.</div></div><hr />

You need to use Kanon's UI file and change the name to match your character name and server. This is a carefuly layed out UI and you'll have issues if you don't use K's file. You can edit the file later for specific changes, but try it exactly as he has it first. Changing to and from AYA ingame is a mess, it's just not designed to work that way.[p]<br />

Being able to End an an ability not only saves endurance but gives me greater flexibility switch to different ability more quickly.<br />

I will continue to try to make your UI to work because I really like it  :D   I'm afraid I'm gonna have to try another Ui however  :(<br />

Couple more Questions:<br />
<br />
1) Is there a combat abilities window I can copy into the Aya folder?<br />
<br />
2) can the &quot;target of you target&quot; window be used as a mix and match piece.  I think this will become invaluble tool.  Even as a warrior I would love to be able to monitor who my target has targeted and what their health is.   That is very very cool.<br />

3)  forgive my  newbness but I don't know what Tst Ability is?<br />

Thanks Again for all you hard work,  and thanks for your previuos prompt reply.  I got the windowed mode working now.  I will redwnload later this afternoon to get the &quot;target of your target&quot; window.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tempystorm</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need help. I just installed this skin and I really like it.<br />
<br />
First issue: how do I move the buffs and bard song 'windows'? I have tried to click on different parts but nothing seems to work.<br />
<br />
Second issue: for the first time in forever, I decided to use the MP3 player. As soon as I zoned, my entire system crashed. It has to be the player as I had previously zoned without a problem before starting it. What can I do to fix that problem?<br />
<br />
There is only one part of the UI that is missing for me and that is the part that shows the GoD stuff (only because I don't have that expansion yet)....hehe<br />
<br />
Anyway, wonderful job! Any help you could provide me would be greatly appreciated!  :)<br />

Ok, I think I can make a correction. Not sure it is the MP3 player that is making me crash. Everytime I zone into Shadow Haven I crash. Does that mean I should go into my EQ file and delete SH and let the game repatch it when I log on next?</div></div><hr />

Still can't get the &quot;target of your target&quot; window.  The file is in my Aya folder.  Just cant find it.  I guess it has something to do with the Tst ability.   And I still havent figured out wht that is. :(<br />

If only I could get the blue line on my compass to work, I could still use this UI. But with GoD trials and raids, and being one of the corpse run people, I need to know where to head (very twisty areas). :( On a side note though, aside from the blue line, this is one of the more useful UI's I've come across. Great work! :D</div></div><hr />

There is probably and easier way, but this worked for me.  <br />

I have the HoTT working on my 2nd box which is a wizard.  The window is tied to the spell book.  So since my warrior has no spells i cant get the HoTT display on him.  <br />
<br />
I have not only changed my 4 toons I play to this UI but the firends I play with have all changed to this UI.  IT IS THE SHIZNIT.<br />
<br />
I do have one more humble request:<br />
<br />
If the Warrior combat abilities could be treated just like spells and put in the same spell window.  I would love that.  I hope that would also have the HoTT (Health of Targets target) graph attached to it.<br />
<br />
Once again I'm definately not complaing I LOVE this UI.<br />

You should be able to get Just The Target Ring under Downloads/ Featured / AYA/  AYA Rune Target. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of tga. files connected with this target ring in the UI. So your best bet would be to go to the downloads section for JUST the target ring.</div></div><hr />

I seem to have lost the ability to right-click on the book button to bring up the &quot;quick mem&quot; spell list, also cannot right click on any gems to mem spells. Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koushirou</div><div class="date">05-01-2004, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question about editing:<br />
<br />
I wanted to switch the group gauges with the background used in the breath and endurance gauges.  I took the background I wanted and put it overtop of the original gauge and that worked fine except for one thing: the breath gauge is one pixel longer than the group gauge.  So, I guessed that all I had to do was just goto the Animations (AYA) file and change the size of that whole group piece so it would incorporate that extra length of pixell, but what that did was shrink the image and it never picked up that extra pixel.  So, what is it that I change to get that texture to be one pixel longer?<br />
<br />
This was the part I edited:<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;GaugeNewBack&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Cycle&gt;false&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
    &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
      &lt;Texture&gt;AYABuffSlot.png&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
      &lt;Location&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;363&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;60&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;Size&gt;<br />
        &lt;CX&gt;123&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
        &lt;CY&gt;27&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
  &lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
to<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;GaugeNewBack&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Cycle&gt;false&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
    &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
      &lt;Texture&gt;AYABuffSlot.png&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
      &lt;Location&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;363&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;60&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;Size&gt;<br />
        &lt;CX&gt;124&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
        &lt;CY&gt;27&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
  &lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I never found where to edit these pieces in the group window which I think might be where my problem is:<br />
<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;A_Gauge_bg01&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;A_Gauge_bg02&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;A_Gauge_bg03&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;A_Gauge_bg04&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;A_Gauge_bg05&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;A_Gauge_bg06&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Endeidra</div><div class="date">05-02-2004, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a small feature request, Kanon, if I may.  The window that has all the right clicks on the first button, and the pet controls on the second button, has a blank page on the third button (I believe this is the pet information window + your customizations).  I feel a great use of that blank third page would be for the melee combat discipline window.  This would allow melees to click over to the third window and click the discipline they're interested in.<br />
<br />
One small &quot;bug&quot; that I noticed -- the first two icons in the spell book are out of order compared to the default book.  This can cause some confusion for folks that swap UIs and have ordered their spells a certain way.  The correction is as follows:<br />
<br />
What is there now:<br />
<br />
Spell 0 at 52x46<br />
Spell 0 Name at 1x46<br />
<br />
Spell 1 at 52x2<br />
Spell 1 Name at 1x2<br />
<br />
What would correct the &quot;misordering&quot;:<br />
<br />
Spell 0 at 52x2<br />
Spell 0 Name at 1x2<br />
<br />
Spell 1 at 52x46<br />
Spell 1 Name at 1x46<br />
<br />
While I know enough about these XML files to correct the spell ordering for myself, I don't know enough to impliment the combat discipline window!  Overall, this is the most amazing UI I've used to date and I've used a lot!  Thank you for all your hard work and dedication to this beautiful project and thank you again for your consideration. :)</div></div><hr />

I've not used this UI on any pet classes (my mage is dusty!).  Perhaps it's a good idea for a 4th button then. :)  Thanks for the pointer!</div></div><hr />

I have 2 problems, on 2 accounts it won't let me move the box that has the Find, Who, Invite, Disband, Camp, Stand, Walk buttons on it. The box IS NOT locked. It's like I can't grab the inv area on the left that lets me move it around. Is there a way to make it bigger or whatever? On these 2 characters it is stuck in the bottom left corner and can't be moved. Resizing the screen, moveing it, locking it in a new place does not work when I go back to the correct screen size BTW. My second problem is that when grouped with others using defaule UI's of other UI's if I call out a compass direction...NW NE SE SW they always say I am backwards...is it possiable that the East and West directions might have got flipped during creation? If so how do I flip em back....have been in full groups where 5 others say a direction is NE or NW and my compas says the opposite when we are all staring at the same damn brick in the samn damn corner..LOL...Just asking. Besides that I love the UI along with the 20,000 plus peeps that have downloaded it.  Since I'm asking...can anyone point me in  a direction for spell timers that work, or that don't require a degree to make work.. I 3 box all the time and I run a Pally, Cleric, and a Chanty.. I'd love to have timers like the ones for the Pally disciplines that are bar graph and count backwards for say VOQ, VQ, Guard of ZDruzzil, Virtue, BSS on each toon...just have no idea how to make it work or if it can be don.t Thanks in advance for whoever take the time to read and respond.<br />

<br />
There is no friends window on this interface.<br />
<br />
You can accomplish the same things as the friends window though by just typing the command /friend. <br />
<br />
You can list them, you can add them and you can delete them.</div></div><hr />
