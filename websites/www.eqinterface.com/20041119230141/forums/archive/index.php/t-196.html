When I changed some thing around and saved it.. I would go into the game and I would have either a blue box sitting in the spell box or a red bar with no picture in the spell bar.. Do I need to change something in the XML doc to read my new spell icons?</div></div><hr />

Then I took a shield copy and pasted it over another spell and add a crown over that. I merged it together and saved it.. I figured that the XMl would pull it from there and still read it. Though all that comes up is a blue box with nothing there. I am new to all this and I was checking what I could do..</div></div><hr />
