<br />
In order for them to see youre are, you will have to send it to them (by e-mail, FTP, diskette, this web site... :-) so that they could put it in they directory and see it in-game.</div></div><hr />

nope what tchernobill was saying is correct. You must of had the graphic files and xml for that already Or you were imagineing it or remembering it from a different game then EQ.<br />
<br />
EQ does not have the ability to share graphic files. If it was possible it would be so easy to lag some one out of game by inspecting them. You would only need about 10 people to right click on you and the bandwidth ussage would be so great (since the tga file is fairly large atm) that you would get the message &quot;You have been disconnected&quot;.</div></div><hr />
