this would lead to more scripting in VI eyes, (or so I have been told)<br />
<br />
I played a game on a BBS (major BBS) called &quot;Major MUD&quot; and when using the &quot;mud&quot; client someone wrote it would auto heal, auto attack, auto roam, etc.. while this does seem like a good thing on the surface... it got to the point where i was never playing.. just scripting while at work..<br />
<br />
I hit the max level in about 2 months, and had earned enough experience to re-roll and still be max level (it takes about 2/3 of your XP)<br />
<br />
<br />
I am sure that at some point someone will figure out a &quot;heads up&quot; for when health drops... but I don't know how to do it given current constraints =)<br />

I have Friends that use it. I have personally seen it in action, and it's AMAZING with the MCS, (Master Control Script). You can WULLY automate your 2nd box. (his is a 60 druid that buffs, then recasts buffs, nukes, and auto-heals at 40% life)<br />
<br />
VI will ban you for using it. So I refure to use it on my 2-box. I use hands on one, and voice commands on the other.</div></div><hr />
