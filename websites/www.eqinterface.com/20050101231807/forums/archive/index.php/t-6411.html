<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bagg</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having a recurring problem with the custom ui's, any help would be greatly appreciated. Every time I log off and log back on, my compass dissapears. The last ui I had was a mix-match of a bunch of different things from different places, so I thought maybe something was conflicting and that was the problem. However, I have just downloaded Ssoth's ui, and am using it exclusively, and am having the same problem. <br />
<br />
If I reload the ui, it reappears, but it's a pain in the ass to do this every time I log on, because I have to put everything back where I want it and such. If anyone has any suggestions, or has had the same problem, I would be extremely grateful for any help you can offer. Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Edited to add- This is not related to the new problem with things moving around. I have been having this problem for a few weeks, like I said I thought it was conflicts in my mix-match ui, but even then if I reloaded the ui it would be there again.</div></div><hr />
