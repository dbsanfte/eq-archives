<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">over the last half year since my return to EQ I had been doing various feedbacks one of them I did in january for a reformat of the bazaar to include micro zones that the traders could go into without causing lagg for the buyers..  now I wont take credit for the hide trader button in the bazaar window.  I just want to point out I think they have started reading the feedbacks again..  so..  here are the /feedbacks I have started with my guild in the past week..  If everyone does similar feedbacks we might just see this stuff put in<br />
<br />
<br />
 Tracking should be changed to work like the Find feature so that rangers and other trackers don't get text spamed.<br />
 all future expansions should be purchasable from ingame useing plat, about 40 to 60K per expansion.<br />
 A CLOCK ( game time or real time, I just don't care anymore )<br />
 upgrade the XML code for the interface to allow more flexability in coding...  ( a Rclick on screen context menu like the one used in NWN comes to mind )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellyana</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1- a good idea although Im sure it would create more technical problems than its worth.<br />
2- doubt this will  ever happen wheres the monetary benifit to SOE? Not Eveyone has 40-60k p to spend. which could lead to more Plat buying..<br />
3- would be nice. but how hard is it to go into windowed mode for a sec and look at the clock on your task bar. or to keep a real clock near your computer. /time typed in game will show you eq time and real world time.<br />
4- Very much agree and Like this suggestion. I would also add that I think its time  for an Updated Default Ui.<br />
<br />
I use feedback all the time and I also encourage everyone to do so. It seems  like SOE is ready to listen.. so lets be sure to speak up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would be nice to see more flexiblity in the UI. Clock would be great as whenever I use windowed mode to check time I start getting graphic errors when I come back from it.<br />
<br />
Also a nice one would be to be able to switch from Old models to new models on the the fly then have it change when you zone...a lot of graphoc features can be altered this way why not this one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bikther, did you choose your Vah Shir's name Kuroii randomly or are you Finnish? The reason why I ask, is that Kuroii means 'gather' in Finnish...<br />
<br />
If it was a fluke, my apologies then...<br />
<br />
Journey well and travel safe!</div></div><hr />
