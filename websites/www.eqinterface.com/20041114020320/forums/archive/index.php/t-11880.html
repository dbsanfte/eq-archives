<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't posted any UI stuff since way back when the UI changed from the &quot;Old&quot; version.<br />
I mainly discovered the Spellbook - Spellname Change font color, and did some other goofy things like an Indiglo Compass.<br />
<br />
Well, enough of that =)<br />
<br />
My favorite UI has been by Kaoriv and Kudane has been keeping it updated.<br />
However, I just loved some other various Window mods that came out and I also made some personal changes.<br />
<br />
Here are two quick screenshots, and snap of Combat Window ALT + C (Discipline):<br />

<br />
Pure Combat Window (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/PureUICombat.jpg) <br />
<br />
I'd like to see how many may be interested in seeing this on EqInterface.<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
Target Window - My favorite mod is the Target Con Indicator around that window. I also added the guild name above which can be changed easily to whatever name you like. Working on cleaning graphics up some.<br />
<br />
Player Window - Shows Attack around window personal graphic used not same as Target Indicator. Also, I like to see full name so I removed HP info and placed in Target Window.<br />
<br />
Bank - Modified Evytyn (Evy_bigbank_v2)window to show ALL shared slots<br />
<br />
Combat Abilities - They show Horizontal to give more room.<br />
<br />
Action Window - Before you had to change on every character. On this UI you will not have to. If you leave all info in the xml as Warrior it automatically changes in game. Also, added Find to Slots.<br />
<br />
MP3, Spellbook, Spell Icons - T.King<br />
<br />
Inventory - Kudane<br />
<br />
Container - Aviendha101 -Avi container 3.0<br />
<br />
Selector - Lunakin<br />
<br />
Tracking - Armengar<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; Most everything is noted on original Kaoriv UI from what was used. &lt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Roflmao!<br />
<br />
Basically just wanna know if worth any effort to make public and place for all to download.<br />
<br />
I still think my oversized Target Con Indicator Rocks!<br />
<br />
Also, I like my Horizontal - Combat Discipline Window :D</div></div><hr />
