<br />
I've heard that if you want to make slight modifications to the default UI, that you should make a copy of the default directory in the uifiles directry and give it a new name before copying new files into it... this is not the case.  To modify the default UI, simply create a new empty directory in the uifiles directory and give it the name you want, then create or copy new or changed UI files into that directory.  Any standard UI file that doesn't appear in that new directory will cause the game to read the default information from the files in the actual &quot;default&quot; directory.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope this helps... personally I've been lazy too and looking for a Ranger UI that's already been made... but I think I'm gonna try my hand at making my own.<br />

Wish me luck! :D :nana: :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
i didn't notice this, until i noticed i had lost hard drive space for no apparent reason.  when i checked all the log files for EQ...my UIErrors log was 100+ MB.  and every entry was just saying it was going to use the default file for an object.<br />
<br />
despite all the instructions not to copy anything into your custom ui directory besides the files that are customized, i recommend otherwise.<br />
<br />
i haven't had any problems with doing so, i may have to manually edit a few more files when SOE changes the UI files; but to me that's not much of an issue.</div></div><hr />

Don't do that!<br />
<br />
If your UIError.txt log file is getting huge, it's because there is a problem.  My log file is about average size, at 12 kb.  If yours is getting huge, you need to find out why, not just copy over the default directory.</div></div><hr />

I don't think this statement is true.  The UIErrors.txt file only gets updated once when you load a new UI or log into the game.  If you load another UI, it will overwrite the file with a completely new one, not add to the end of it.   This file is not  updated everytime a new window is opened in game.  If your UIErrors.txt file is getting very large, there is probably a graphics problem (can't find a graphics file that is being called for) or something to that nature.</div></div><hr />
