<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After AGES of trying to figure out problem solutions and doing copying and pasting and changing sizes of pokemon pictures (Thanks, Pokemon Elite 2000!) I finally finished them! And here they are! I'll include a screen in my next post!With time I'm going to try to make a Pokemon Spell Bar, so wish me luck and enjoy! :DAlso, special thanks to Dolby, Taleisin, Kudane, and Cairenn for their encouragement and (more often than should have been offered) help! :D Thanks, guys! This is my first UI mod so I'm quite proud of myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a pic of them in-game. Any feedback is appreciated! :) http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=58437</div></div><hr />

Now I'm going to try to make a background of pokemon for the light_rock and dark_rock tga files. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are some pokemon Collages I just made! They show up best (and clutter chat less) if you turn the Tint Color to GREY for the windows with them. (to do this, right click on the window in EQ, click WINDOW, then click TINT COLOR, then choose the grey on the middle right) :) Enjoy!NOTE: ** PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE BACKGROUNDS A FEw POSTS DOWN FROM THIS ONE! **</div></div><hr />

But I think you really need to know these guys to use it well :)<br />
<br />
Really good job though.</div></div><hr />

Really good job though.  Pokemon used to be my FAVORITE thing in the world. :p Ask me a name of the pokes and I'll tell you it right off the bat. I did the characteristic thing on purpose :) (charmander with fire spells, articuno with ice, pidgey with levitate/wind) :) Did you mean to say I didn't do it well enough? :(But there were some pokes and spellgems leftover that I couldn't find a great match for, so I just paired them up in a semi-methodic way. :p<br />
<br />
I realized the backgrounds made some windows (lfg window, bazaar window) hard to read, so here are some updated ones that make it much easier to read.<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />
