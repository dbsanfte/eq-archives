<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cerinity</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*sigh* I have worked for days trying to compile a UI I am happy with, but every time I try, it crashes my EQ. I have searched this entire site trying to find one already made that I am happy with, but I guess I'm too picky cuz I can't find one. I have about 4 different UI's with one or two things on each one that I want merged into one. --I be da**ed if I can figure out how to do it. &gt;&lt; SO my question is .....if I were to make a picture in photoshop or something showing what I want done, and post that along with the UI's I have downloaded, is there anyone willing to put them together for me?!?! I give up at this point lol I just can not figure out what I am doing wrong. Plz feel free to email me, or reply if you are willing and I will post what I have and what I want. I won't post it yet cuz I'm not gonna bother making a pic if nobody is willing to help me with it lol. Thanks to anyone willing to help with this as I am at the end of my rapidly fraying rope! :mad: <br />

<br />
Use loadskin on one of those compiled UI's, then open up your everquest directory (usually C:\Program Files\Everquest\) and look for the UIErrors.txt file. Open that up, and copy everything, and post it here. There will be someone, if not me, that can help you figure out which files are the problem. What I am suspecting is that either 1) one or more of the files you want to use is out of date or 2) one of the files depends on the EQUI_Animations.xml file coded in that specific UI.<br />
<br />
It may also help to compile a list of the files you are using, and what UI they come from, if they are not a stand alone file.</div></div><hr />

It is posted below. I have also posted a link to a page I made explaining what I would like to have done. I figured it would be much easier than posting it all on here. Feel free to take a peek and join my nightmare!  :( It has illustrations and links to download the files. Thanks for the help with this and /hug &amp; /applaud to anyone who can get this crap to work! :p<br />

Which things from which UIs are you trying to combine?<br />
<br />
Edit: Opps, I didn't see your link. If I have some time I'll take a closer look at it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked out your link... what you want would take some pretty extensive modding. There are many times additional files that would need to be included with the .xml file that you are trying to get. <br />
<br />
For instance, my group window makes calls for graphics from two different .tga's... plus it uses the default guage which is defined in the animations file and uses window_pieces01.tga (this is the main picture file for a UI's theme). If you copied all those files into a custom folder, you might get the group window to work... but it would most definately break other elements that are also set to use their own animations file and window_pieces01.tga.<br />
<br />
I appologize, I just didn't design my UI for windows to stand on their own. =(<br />
I think you may run into the same problems with some of the other windows you selected, at least the ones from complete UI's.<br />

But when I've tried to use complete UI's, they never work when I mix 'em. =\ Maybe I should get a crapload of seperate things &amp; blob 'em all together. lol :( <br />
I've been working with my &quot;mess&quot; still -- programming is definitely not my strong point. &gt;&lt; However, I did break one of my keys when I slammed my keyboard after a crash! /cheer --maybe I should take a valium before working on this stuff. lol<br />
