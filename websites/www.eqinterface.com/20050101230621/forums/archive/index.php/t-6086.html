<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantomfist</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CTD started happening on Saturday morning after I DL a couple of files logging into EQ. Before this, I had 0 problems with EQ. I even chatted with a GM who had the exact same thing happen. She could stay in EQ chat forum, but not stay logged into the game.<br />
<br />
At most, I'm able to stay online for maybe 5 mins. Besides portions of desktop bleeding thru, like the Start button and the sound/monitor icons, there is a lot of flickering in the game along with out of place colors. Chunks of pink snow, for example. Lol.<br />
<br />
My UIErrors file was empty other than this:<br />
<br />
UIErrorLog created at Wed Jan 29 17:51:05 2003<br />
<br />
It seems to recreate itself each time I log on(I looged on right before posting here). I had checked it once before the other day and it was empty then as well, but the creation date was different. I'm a noob at this so I have no clue if this is normal or not.<br />
<br />
I appreciate any help you can offer.<br />
<br />
Phantom<br />

EDIT: I have always used the default UI out of fear that something like this would happen if I tried anything else. Hehe.</div></div><hr />

This is sounding like some sort of old drivers not complying with the new windowed EQ mode's needs.  Sorry I can't think of anything else. :/</div></div><hr />

I've pretty much have tried everything, including reinstalling EQ, that could possibly work.<br />
<br />
I'm beginning to think this might be a sign that it's time to quit this addiction known as EQ. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try looking at this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6054) thread and see if it kinda matches what you are describing.  I think it sounds very much the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantomfist</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only the desktop bleed thru is the same. My main problem is CTD within minutes of logging on. Something that never happened before Sat.<br />
<br />
Since I tried what you suggested on EQlive, the game now says that I am under the world shortly after I log on and moves me to the zones safe spot. I then CTD within a minute of this happening.  I tried both of my accounts and it same thing with both.<br />
<br />
I also checked my UIError file and it updates each time I log on, but is always empty. Is this normal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No UI Errors should be fine.  Depends on how the UI is set up.<br />
<br />
When you reinstalled EQ, did you delete your .ini files?  You might try moving them out of the EverQuest directory and see if that changes anything (other than messes up your window anyway).<br />
<br />
Another problem is that there was a virus that went active on Saturday.  I had a virus once that caused me to CTD.  I assume that it was trying to spread itself to the EverQuest server and EQ booted me.  You might try an updated Virus Scanner.  Lots of viruses out there hacking computers on their own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which .ini files are you talking about? Being a noob, I'm not sure what you mean.</div></div><hr />

While not directly relating to this specific problem of yours, I thought I would comment on the above line.<br />
<br />
Unless every single one of your UI files, including all the dragitems, class animations, everything has been customized ... no, this isn't normal.  At the very least you should be getting the lines saying &quot;can't find blahblahblah in custom folder, looking for it in default folder&quot;.  The only way you won't be getting that message is if, as I say, every single file is customized ... or if you copied the files from your default folder into your custom folder.  If it's the latter ... don't.<br />
<br />
The only things that should ever be in your custom folder are the files that have actually been customized.  See Kudane's explaination on the front page of the site for further explaination and link to discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantomfist</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't use a custom UI, only the original UI.<br />
<br />
Currently the main problem is CTD within minutes of logging in. The last few times I have not been moved to the safe part of the zone I was in, so that's fixed as well. Just the CTDs.<br />
<br />
Even though the CTD hasn't been fixed yet, I do appreciate the responses I've received so far. Especially in light of the fact that Sony wouldn't even respond at all.<br />
<br />
Any additional help is greatly appreciated.<br />

<br />
*edit* i r guud speeler!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantomfist</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure if it's relative or not, but I zone just fine. The CTD happen no matter what I'm doing. I did zone a couple of times on purpose to see what effect if any it would have, but I crashed a min or so after I finished zoning.<br />
<br />
/hopes the patch works this time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fingers crossed for you, but it is definitely sounding like it is *not* UI related, which leaves me right out for suggestions. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had this type of issue before, not looking at the thread that Cairenn is indicating try the following...<br />
<br />
 1)  Locate Everquest Trilogy (or top EQ) folder.<br />
 2)  Delete all the files with extension of TXC (DOS = DEL *.TXC)<br />
 3)  Copy and then delete *.OPT (option files) (You will need to reselect Video Modes/Window Fades/Locks/Filters)<br />
 4)  Delete TEXTURE.TXT.<br />
<br />
Restart EQ<br />
Open Options and Reselect all options.<br />
Once you get into EQ <br />
ALT-O to options and reselect Video Options in DISPLAY.<br />
<br />
This solved a ton of Crash to Desktop issues and You are Below World messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantomfist</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The patch seemed to do nothing for my other than to make me CTD much faster. I can't stay on for longer than a minute now.<br />
<br />
I tried the above suggestion and it didn't work.<br />
<br />
2 things that I have noticed:<br />
<br />
1 My load time is way down compared to what it was before. I'm loading to char select screen in easily half the time I did before all the problems started. Probably closer to a 1/4 the time. No idea if this is good or bad.<br />
<br />
2 Right as EQ is about to start up(after the initial DL is done), a blank(black really) rectangle shows up in the upper left corner of desktop. It's about the size of 2 desktop icons side by side. This may have always been occurring but since I've never had any real problems I didn't notice it until now. No other program/game causes this.<br />
<br />
As you can see, I'm grasping at straws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed a number of issues on the older PC we use for EQ Mules - Video Card may be the real culprit now.  You prolly should head on over to the Station Support Msg boards, but I would look in the DEBUG.TXT file for something indicating the current date and a 628 or 629 error. <br />
<br />
If that is happening you may want to think about reloading DirectX 8.1 and then your video card drivers. (Make sure to reselect your video card thru options after doing this and disable virus checking when you do the actual installs.)<br />
<br />
Unfortuantely, tho this one may be way more in Sony's realm than in EQInterface.</div></div><hr />
