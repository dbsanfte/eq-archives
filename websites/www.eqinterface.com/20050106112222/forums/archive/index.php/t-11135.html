<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hertscha</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have recently installed Caleal ver. 1.4 and love the layout.  It's almost perfect for my playstyle.  I like all the mouse clicking to be in one general area, preferably in the lower right corner of the ui...which is how this UI is setup.  I was a lil disappointed at the fact that the player info (First/Last name, Class, Deity) was missing the players LVL # as well.  This info was shown as labels in the group window I believe.  If the author or anyone else capable of adding this to this Complete Set UI found here: <br />
<br />
Caleal 1.4 (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1476) <br />
<br />
it would be greatly appreciated.  I also noticed there was a version 2 made by same author, but it is created for 1280 x 1024 resolution and my monitor can't handle that res.  Is it possible to just borrow the pet window from ver. 2 and add to ver. 1.4 ?<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />
