<br />
has something to do with the Nedaria's Landing quest.</div></div><hr />

Where is this Nedaria's Landing...Haven't even heard of it til this post?  <br />
<br />
It's a new unannounced zone that's located just off of Jagged Pine Forest.<br />
<br />
There's a small breezeway on the (East?) side of the zone that was once blocked but now is open. It leads to Nedaria's Landing.<br />
<br />
I've herd of it. Some poeple talked about it, but I have yet to have visited it. Maybe one of these centuries I'll take a gander.</div></div><hr />

To get there, you need to go where the Brell Gnolls live and go behind the waterfall. There you will see the passage that will take you to Nedaria's Landing.<br />
<br />
The zone is made for upper 20's to mid-upper 30's. And if you go close to the waters edge in wolf form, prepare to be aggro'd, as the water inhabitants (frogs and turtles) do not take kindly to those in wolf form.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the bears have new graphics and actually stand on their hind legs occassionally. Its pretty cool to see.</div></div><hr />

Opps, my bad. Sorry about the bad examples. Like I said, I hadn't been there first hand myself. Just going off what I read here and there. Sorry for the incorrect directions.</div></div><hr />
