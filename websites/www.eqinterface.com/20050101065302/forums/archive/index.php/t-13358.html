If you are like me and try to install multiple mods at once and it doesnt work try the mods seperatly because if one of them doesnt work they all wont work.  I didnt know this and that is why i was stumped i thought only some of the features would be broken but i had two that didnt work when i tried them seperatly i found the two then combined everything else into a single folder and wallah it worked.</div></div><hr />
