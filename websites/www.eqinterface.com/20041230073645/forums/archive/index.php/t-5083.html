<br />
I have recently been informed that they will be shutting down the Old UI. I did not like the New ui, infact, I hated it so much I refused to look at it, but it seems now I have no choice. I always play a caster, normally Wizard, but im really starting to look at the Enchanter. Now to my question...I was wondering if anyone had a really nice looking UI for Enchanter or Wizard? Mabye a Layout like the Old UI, but that looks really cool? :) With gem stones of sort? Hard to explain what I want, as I am not sure what it can do. :( But I have seen some pics, and some look very nice! :) Also, im not exactly sure how to set them up, can anyone give an easy, and simple explaination of how to get it onto my UI? Isnt a thing I liked in New UI, so the layout I want to be like New ui, but it kind of have a &quot;Lore&quot; look to it, with power stones and such. Anyone understand? Or am I babling like a fool? ;) Ah well..im rambling. Thank you in advance for any help you can give, I will be very grateful. <br />

I play an enchanter and the mods I like best are the ones that clear the most room for the most view. Most of the mods I see on here take up alot of room.</div></div><hr />
