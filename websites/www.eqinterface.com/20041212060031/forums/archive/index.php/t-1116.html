<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">w0rm</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">... they're all in such high resolution that when I play, it refreshes at 60hz and I feel like I'm going to go blind. :(<br />
<br />
It'd be neat if I could find a really super custom UI (like drakah's) but in lower resolution. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup. I used to use 800x600... but since the new UI stuff I have gone to 1024x768. Just can't seem to get all the stuff I want on a smaller screen without feeling crowded.<br />
<br />
As for refresh rate, well, that's adjustable in options. It's matter of whether or not your vid card can run smoothly in a larger resolution.  I run a GeForce 2 Ti, in 1024x768 at 75Hertz - and the only zone I have to pull in my clip plane is bazaar, and grimling forest gets a little choppy sometimes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there's definitely room for development in the lower resolution UI department, but I'm dubious as to if you'll ever see a lot of activity in that area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ha, I have a GeForce4 Ti-4600 and I even get quite noticeable choppy lag in Gremling Forest. That zone's horriable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">w0rm</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:( Nonono... it's that they're building a lot of the nicest mods for the highest possible resolution, and to run in that, I can't run higher than 60hz. I'm used to running 115 hz. When it goes to 60, I can actually see the screen blinking! :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've seen plenty of excellent UIs for the 1024 r 1280 range.<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
It's nice to know that upgrading my GF2 Ti to a GF4 won't change much. hah<br />
<br />
I'll probably upgrade the rest of the machine before or at the same time I do the vid card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well one of the nice thing about the /viewport command is you can run a 1024x768 viewable window in 1280x1024 I have attached a screen shot of how i play <br />
<br />
I have discovers some great adavantages to this<br />
<br />
1. Lag of only running 1024x768<br />
<br />
2. never have to click throuhg another box to target or loot<br />
<br />
3. screenshots (when cropped) have no boxes in them.<br />
<br />
if you want a breakdown of what all the boxes are, let me know.. <br />
<br />
i find this very useful :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I designed my windows to be fairly small in 1024x768.  Simply trimmed out all the fat from the default windows without resizing anything.  I'm currently working on changing to 640x480.  But I don't want all my windows to look huge in 640x480 so I'm reducing many fonts and changing many of the pictures (hotbuttons, inventory, bags, and such) from 40x40 pixels to 24x24 pixels.  That means a whole lot of windows have to be completely redone.<br />
<br />
I'm having real difficulty with the viewport solution.  If I shrink it to 1024 x 560 for example I can't see what's at my feet.  The bottom portion of the image is cut off.  If I shrink it to 850 by 560 I have to think of something to do with a huge black bar along the right side of the screen.  I like my controls along the bottom for the most part.  Some things can be moved to the side, but chat windows really need to be wider than tall.  And since my eyes are often on the chat windows, I like to have the other controls near them.<br />
<br />
Currently the best compromise seems to be to push all the controls into triangles in the lower left and lower right of the screen.  Most windows like to be squares, not triangles, but they can be fitted in around the chat windows in each corner.<br />
<br />
I see that Kudane has done some typical things: keep the abilities window open to fill up space on the left, using the buffs window and full title bars to fill up space on the right, and sticking the player window way up in the top corner (not the most readable location).  No I don't have a better way... that's what I'm whining about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llaile</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The viewport command doesn't have to be a resolution size or use similar ratios. I use something like 1152 x 590</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you use 1152 by 590 you can't see what's at your feet.  It's covered up just as surely as if you had your chat window covering the bottom of the viewport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye. If you don't keep to standard resolution sizes, the view port will crop your view with the next highest resolution that fits.<br />
<br />
Only when it's standard resolution sizes will it actually shrink the image to fit.</div></div><hr />
