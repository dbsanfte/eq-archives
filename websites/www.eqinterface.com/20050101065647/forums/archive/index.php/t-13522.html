Just recently I tried loading up a few UIs and I install them just as I had my older ones, but they don't load up, instead they load up my default UI every time.  I used to use Tablets Marble Blue UI, but I switched to Tablets Marble Grey and mix and matched a few windows to best fit my needs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you added windows that were not part of the original Tablets UI you replaced windows that had code in them that the rest of the Ui needed to load.<br />
<br />
You will have to use the UI as it was intended or figure out how to get the code that the UI needs to run into another file so that it can still load.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of what I am talking about:<br />
I might make a custom gauge for my UI and put the code for it in my player window.  I used that gauge for every gauge in my UI, but it only needs to be coded once..and that code is in the player window.<br />
If you remove that player window, then the rest of the UI would be looking for that gauge still, and would not be able to find it because you removed the code for it as well.<br />
The UI would then give you an error like the ones you are seeing.</div></div><hr />
