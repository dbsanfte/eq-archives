<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanctum</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A while back someone made a &quot;window_pieces01.tga&quot; file that had no lines in it ( the bars displayed in target exp etc ) . It was basically a one piece bar for the targets and everything else within the UI. It worked really really well and there was hardly ever any lag in update times with it. Im curious what happened to it I have browsed the site and done various searches over the last 4 hours and have not found it ! :(<br />
<br />
If anyone has any information on it or a link please post it so I can get that window piece back :) Thanks a bunch!!</div></div><hr />

Please refrain from posting the same thread in several categories.. <br />
<br />
just post it once in the correct category and the people who can answer your question will see it.<br />
<br />
Posting it multiple times WILL NOT get it answered faster. <br />
<br />
happy modd'ing</div></div><hr />
