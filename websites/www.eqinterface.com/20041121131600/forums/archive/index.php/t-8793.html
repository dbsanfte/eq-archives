<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tobin Itharel</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two UI changes with the Spell Gems that might need to be looked at by UI builders. These are live on the test server now.<br />
<br />
8) A new method for memorizing spells. There was a day when casters only needed 32 pages in their spell books, with only 5 spells per page. These days spell books have 50 pages and 8 spells per page. Frankly, that's a lot of spells. We've come up with a new method for finding and memorizing spells that will make things easier for the overburdened spell caster. Right-clicking an empty spell gem will open a list of spell categories. Pointing your mouse at a category will display a list of spells. Selecting a spell from that list will make your character sit down, memorize the spell and stand back up. <br />
<br />
9) Spell Favorites. Spell favorites are an easy way to memorize a full set of eight spells without the tedious book searching. Right-clicking on the spellbook icon in your spell window will open up the spell favorites menu. You will be able to save your current spell lineup as a favorite, delete a favorite or memorize all the spells in one of your already saved spell sets. As with the new spell context menus mentioned above, this will not replace the spellbook, it is meant to make memorizing large numbers of spells more convenient.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brimztone</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually you did not include the little paragraph between #8 and #9 ...<br />
<br />
We know that many people are happy with the existing spellbook system. Rest assured that the spellbook isn't going anywhere. This new memorization system is an optional convenience for those who wish to try out a new method of managing their spells. The spellbook remains the only way to scribe new spells. <br />
<br />
the UI doesnt change for the new spells funtionality, just the internal workings of EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the changes after using them on test - this is a good thing.</div></div><hr />
