But when I logged back on to get an SS for help. I logged in and was put at default. Loaded Infinitimix and it lost all my hotkeys. Like my settings were wiped. I camped out again and relogged and my settings were there and the recreation of my problem resurfaced. I then loaded my kenna UI (which was put together with a UI genius's *cough - Dantos* help, so it's happening to things made by more than one author) to test it and also ran into the same problem. Here's the SS's.<br />
<br />
For some reason my window selector buttons vanished...<br />

Here is also the error text file. Funny that it looks very similar to the previous post in this thread. Something is affecting ALL my UI's. Maybe something in default is messed up? /boggle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is a easy trick to stop the error messages from showing up in game.<br />
<br />
put a EQUI.xml file in your modded folder and add<br />
<br />
../default/<br />
<br />
to the windows that do not appear in your modded interfaces<br />
<br />
ie*<br />
<br />
&lt;Include&gt;../default/SIDL.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
and so forth.  <br />
<br />
(Except for EQUI.xml itself)<br />
<br />
as for your selector window dissapearing you might have the animations for the selector window icons missaligned.<br />
<br />
I'll attach a EQUI.xml that I think will work with your error log here and let you load without error</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why put EQUI.xml in your custom folder if you dont have to? Sony seems to like to change that file alot.. best not to change it or next patch day your most likely gonna have trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well this is truely a easy window to maintain, untill they switch to a new form of XML all you have to do is either add or remove a line.<br />
<br />
perhaps I am the only one who doesn't like seeing that red error line every time I zone.</div></div><hr />

I get warnings (for each xml/tga my custom interface doesnt have) and I dont get a red error line in game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed the same problem on two computers after getting the message to /claim my free bag you get from purchasing the LDoN CD and installing it manually instead of via the click version the the server screen.<br />
<br />
I honestly think there is a bug with /claim.<br />
