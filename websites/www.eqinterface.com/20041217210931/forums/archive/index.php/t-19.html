Here is what I am Looking for.<br />
<br />
1) In the Inventory &amp; Hot Buttons in One on the Webpage, at the the bottom of the 8 inventory slots it has both the Primary &amp; Secondary Slots. I want the Secondary Slot to the the Arms slot instead.<br />
<br />
2) I Would love to have my Buffs Window across the top of my screen, but it reads from right to left. I would like one that Reads from left to right. Is that possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the Help &amp; Info.</div></div><hr />
