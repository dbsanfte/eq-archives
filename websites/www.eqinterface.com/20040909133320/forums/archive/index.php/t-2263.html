<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've finally gotten around to doing some more work on my mod. It's just about finished, and I think you'll like what you see.<br />
<br />
Here's the screenshot:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It might be a little difficult to get everything looking just like it does in the screenshot, so I included my INI file. To use it, rename UI_yourname_##.ini to show your character's name and server number, then copy it into the EverQuest directory.<br />
<br />
Be sure to back up your old INI just in case you hate my mod or it breaks your computer or somethin.<br />
<br />
Here's the zip:<br />
<br />
EDIT: I copied over the wrong files and messed up the cursor. It's fixed now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah, I forgot to mention a few things.<br />
<br />
The spellbook window and graphics aren't included because there are so many spellbook mods out there, and my own is already at www.eqinterface.com, so just go download it or use the one you prefer.<br />
<br />
The cursor in the screenshot isn't the default one. I was using the flashing purple arrow cursor when I took that SS.<br />
<br />
Stupid me also forgot to un mem one of my spells, so you could see how I changed the spellgem graphics. They're basically still the same as Kudane's hexagon design and full credit goes to him for making the original. I just cleaned up the edges and changed the &quot;empty&quot; graphic.<br />
<br />
If you don't like the arrangement of the spellgems, just use the default spell window XML, or any other, and it will work fine.<br />
<br />
The inventory window looks the same as the last release, so look there if you want to see what I've done with it.<br />
<br />
In the middle of the player window there's a cast time gauge. That's why there's a blank space, because I'm not casting anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Succubus</div><div class="date">09-20-2002, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Absolutely stunnning UI and perfect for me at 800x600 reso.  Only 1 thing ..... can you tell me how to change the overall color scheme or could I request it from you?  I really like the color, but my favorite color is a dark green or burgundy and was hoping to work in that theme.  Also I have the cursor that is the flashing &quot;fish&quot; :p  which is very unique.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for a wonderfully fantastic piece of work that I can actually use as it was designed.  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brimztone</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the group window, especially how you get the pets names to show. Thats what I would love to be able to do with the Vert mods. I will keep working at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Changing the color scheme should be easy if you have a decent graphics editing program. Just open the window_pieces tga files and replace the purple with the color of your choosing.<br />
<br />
I could post a set of TGA's that had a less imposing color, for those of you who don't have the tools to edit the files yoursleves. Probably a dark green like Succubus suggested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Succubus</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately I don't have a good graphics editing program anymore and I could probably download a free trial for 30 days but still not sure I'd be comfortable with messing around with your beautiful work.  If you could post the files in a few different colours that would be awesome.  Two colours of my choice would be dark green and burgundy.<br />
<br />
Also have you done other cursors?  The fish is awesome but wondered if you had any other cool ones hidden up your sleeve :p <br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still working on making new cursors actually. Just have a look at Grid.TGA. The file is basically just a grid with coordinates to place any type of cursor graphic up to 32x32, and you can change the cursor by replacing the coordinates for the default cursor frames in EQUI_Animations.xml</div></div><hr />
