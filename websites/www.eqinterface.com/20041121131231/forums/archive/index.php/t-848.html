<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koplal</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying atm to change the shape of my hotbutton/pet info window from a rectangle to a circular shape. Although i am not sure how to go about this. Was wondering if any of you Xml gurus knew how to do such a change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want a circle, you have to create a box and &quot;cut out&quot; corners to give it a rounded shape.<br />
<br />
<br />
in EQ, to get any circular border, you have to create a custom bg image for it and put that as thebackground, killing the current border set on it.<br />
<br />
Maybe since? Hard to really explain, but requires a custom graphic, modification to the EQUI_Texture.xml and EQUI_Animations.xml files and change to EQUI_PetWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Not a &quot;simple&quot; change, but not that complicated. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: You could get around all this by creating a custom graphic and a staticAnimation image.<br />
Place that in the back in the Pet Window and kill the current BG (trans=true) and Border.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koplal</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my idea is to make the pet info window a cricle, then have the buttons form around the edge of it with the text and shape of the buttons bending to the shape of the circle. Then having the pet's Hp in the middle in a circle shape. This is my plan if i can pull it off is yet to be seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, that would be difficult. The &quot;Blending&quot; part.<br />
<br />
Basically, you're wanting a round border and the ability to &quot;Break the border&quot;, but the spillage to hide behind the lines.<br />
<br />
Unfrotunatly, there is no way to do that, at all, I think.<br />
Well, you might be able to create a custom button image for each of the buttons, but that will take a lot more work.<br />
<br />
The only way I can think of it. An illusional border break. Kind of like the Card trick where you cut the corner of one card and hold it just right infront of another one. The one in behind appears to be infront of the cut card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koplal</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The button idea wouldn't work tried it already makes every button rounded i would have to create a completely new file and change and the settings in the animation/template xml files. This could be so much simpler why does verant make everything so difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll never get an answer, and if you do, half the time it's crytic.</div></div><hr />
