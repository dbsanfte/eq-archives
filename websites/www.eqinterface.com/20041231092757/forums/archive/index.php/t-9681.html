The effected OS's seem to be Windows XP, NT, 2000, 2003 Server. The only un-affected OS at the moment is Windows ME.  If your using XP or any other NT platformed Windows OS Read below. (please note EQInterface.com/EQGui.com and our files do not have this virus, we are sharing info to help stop the virus)<br />
<br />
You can read Symantec's write up on the Virus including symtoms and removal here (http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.blaster.worm.html). If you know you have picked up this virus they have released a worm removal tool you can download here (http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/FixBlast.exe)<br />
<br />
Microsoft has updated thier window's patcher to fix the hole that this virus is coming in through. To download the stand-alone patch to fix this you can go to Microsoft's site here (http://microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-026.asp). Please read the whole page,  you will find specific information about how to apply the patch and links to the patch files.<br />
<br />
As I said, this is a nasty little bug. To be clear the virus is not hiding in any of our files. We are sharing this with you out of concern, as always our files are checked for virus regularly.<br />
<br />
And a special thanks to Fazzelan, Scottpero, and Kuthbert from my Guild Stone for the information and links they provided. The were quick to find all the info needed to prevent/cure/fix this virus.<br />

I didn’t get a virus. Kudane didn’t get a virus. Eqinterface/Eqgui didn’t get the virus. Kudane just wanted to share information on a large scale worm that’s floating around incase you didnt hear about it on TV or the million other computer news sites. Like he said in his news posts none of our files are infected because the worm doesn’t get contracted through zipfiles.</div></div><hr />

Sorry Tink, I didnt see your post when I was gathering the information. I saw it later when someone replied to it.. <br />
<br />
/bow<br />
<br />
And Kenney I even said in the post <br />
<br />
 (please note EQInterface.com/EQGui.com and our files do not have this virus, we are sharing info to help stop the virus)<br />
<br />
I just want to see this virus stopped..<br />
<br />
And Tink, I know several people who have gotten it, one while his mule was in EQ (no SOE doesnt have the virus, EQ Just opens the port).. sooo if your doing something that opens the ports it uses, and you have not run the patch.. you could get it.</div></div><hr />

It also said that this  worm also attempts to use infected computers in a distributed denial-of-service attack against Microsoft's Windows Update site. Now im no computer buff but it sounds like it puts a stop to letting you go to windows update. Which is what im having a problem with. If i don't have the worm then i should be able to get to the site. I have updated my pc with the latest security updates but am i te only one having this problem?</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't cause you to have problems with window's update.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Risk: High. All unprotected Internet-connected PCs with vulnerable versions of the Windows operating system could be affected.<br />
<br />
Vulnerability: The MS-Blast worm exploits a vulnerability of the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) process built into Windows. The RPC process facilitates sharing resources like files and printers over a network. The MS-Blast worm scans the local network for PCs that have UDP port 135 open. If the worm finds such a target, it exploits the RPC vulnerability and infects the PC with a copy of itself. Once on a PC, the worm attempts to spread further and interfere with normal OS operation. The worm also attempts to use infected computers in a distributed denial-of-service attack against Microsoft's Windows Update site. <br />
<br />
Harm: Loss of user productivity, IT/Helpdesk calls and intervention required, and potential business continuity issues. Infected machines may experience performance problems and users may not be able to use their Internet connections. Network bandwidth usage could affect Quality of Service (QOS) and disrupt operation of critical business and network services.<br />
<br />
Thats the exact email i got from zone labs about this worm.<br />
<br />
TrendLabs has received several infection reports of this new worm, which exploits the RPC DCOM BUFFER OVERFLOW. This vulnerability in a Windows Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface allows an attacker to gain full access and execute any code on a target machine, leaving it compromised. <br />
This worm has been observed to continuously scan random IP addresses and send data to vulnerable systems on the network using port 135. On the following system dates, it performs a Distributed Denial Of Service attack against windowsupdate.com: <br />
On the 16th to the 31st day of the following months: <br />
January <br />
February <br />
March <br />
April <br />
May <br />
June <br />
July <br />
August <br />
<br />
<br />
Any day in the months of September to December. <br />
<br />
This worm runs on and is able to propagate into Windows NT, 2000, and XP systems. <br />
<br />
This is what i've leard at the trend website too.<br />
<br />
Both state that this worm could cause you not to be able to run windows update. Hence you will not be able to get this fixxed.</div></div><hr />

So don't expect the site to load quickly any time soon, so if you can get on, great otherwise you might as well keep trying for a bit due to the flood of people there trying to download the patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any chance it can get into a Windows 98SE system? I know next to nothing about virus's, worms, or any of that. I don't know if I've got it or not. My PC hasn't shut down by itself but earlier I did get a strange &quot;Not enough memory to use this program&quot; error, and all I was running was Avant Browser(an IE add-on pretty much). The error seems to have gone but it was pretty strange. I've got 256mb ram, but I'll be getting another 256 soon. (Would get a 512mb stick but I was told by a friend that windows 98 has a problem sometimes with having more than 512mb ram or something. Will have to upgrade to xp then I guess.)<br />
<br />
I was looking stuff up about the virus earlier after the memory problem and it said to look for a file call Msblaster.exe or something so I did but nothing came up. Think I'm safe? ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the Windows Update site, it is touchy to begin with. So if you are having a problem with it you should check out the help section on the site. Like Zantaklawz said, there is a lot of traffic to the site lately, so your problem may not really be your problem at all.<br />
<br />
I was having a problem that when the Update site performed the scan to see what updated files were available for my computer, it would go from 0 to 100% in a second and say no updates available. Hehe, I went to the help section and found out that it was just because I didn't have a language set in my Internet Explorer options.</div></div><hr />

The only version of Windows NT supposedly not having this problem is me. <br />
 <br />
<br />
Could be because ME is not a version of NT at all. :D As far as DOS attacks go, just cause you can't access MS-Update doesn't mean you are infected. It means two things:<br />
<br />
1.) 90% of computer users in the world are trying to access the site.<br />
2.) The infected machines are executing DOS attacks on the server at the same time.<br />
<br />
Together MS doesn't stand a chance. Therefore, you just need to let the hype die down and pray you don't get infected. I run Norton Internet Security on all of my machines and none of them have yet been affected. I haven't even bothered trying to get to Windows Update because I knew what it would be like. i focused on getting Norton updated first, seems that has been enough so far. <br />

The only thing you have to do to become infected is be connected to the internet.  By default, because of the security flaw, port 135 is open on your system.  The patch fixes this security bug.<br />
<br />
The way the virus spreads is once on an infected system, it runs an algorythm to calculate other IPs on the portion of the internet.  It then does a port scan, and finds computers with the same security flaw. It will then insert itself into that computer, were it continues to do it's work.  No user intervention is needed to allow this virus to spread.  That is what is so scary about it.  (and why it was upgraded to class 4).  We were lucky it wasn't more damaging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gdaren</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, from one that is behind what I would consider a extreme firewall set up, and still got nailed!! This is one of the more dangerous worms out there, it not only stops windows update from playing nicely but will also stop your anti virus software from phoning home for updates. Highly suggest that you get your updates manually (ie. go directly to the download, not via a software retrieve) and install them yourself.  If you use the automated route you will get a security RPC breach (XP) and your system will shut down, before getting the patches... <br />
<br />
A quick look ctrl/alt/delete then look in processes, if you see msblast.exe in there you are infected!! It was random for me on shutdowns, I could surf and game for hours without a problem. then if I went to do any kind of update (first noticed trying to update to the new Nvidia drivers), I would get the shutdown.<br />
<br />
I am amazed that I got it on my main system that is protected, but the network downstairs that is on adelphia cable, and is practically open to the world did not... Could be that it was targeted at larger more corporate type systems vs the mom &amp; pop systems on cable, dialup, etc... <br />
<br />
Good Fortune to those that did not have a problem, and to those like myself that did get it well all ya can do is smile....</div></div><hr />

<br />
It also doesnt disable any auto updates. Its just that windowsupdate and anti virus update sites have been getting Doss'd or cant keep up with the traffic.</div></div><hr />
