It lacks some of the spicey-fancy feelings that others have, but maybe thats what you were trying to accomplish.  Its simple, and I like simple, so keep up the good work.  I may download this when I get home, gotta look at all my other mods first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great job!!!<br />
<br />
One other thing I just thought i would add. If you could connect the Personal HPS data window with the groupwindow. That might look great. <br />
<br />
<br />
Great job.. I look forward to the next revision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glad you like the group window Excon, I'm rather fond of it myself. When you say &quot;connect the Personal HPS data window with the groupwindow.&quot; do you mean combine the player window to the group window? I suppose that could be done one of two ways:<br />
either put all the data in either one window or the other<br />
-or-<br />
just redesign their graphics so they can be put next to each other seamlessly. So they LOOK like one window but are still two.<br />
<br />
Anyways, leave ideas and suggestions here, I'll check back later.<br />
