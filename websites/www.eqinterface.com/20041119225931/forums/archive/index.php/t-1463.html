Apparently it isnt failing to load the skin but it certainly doesnt like it (the XML) either.  I am using a Remelio's CastSpellWnd mod that he uses for T.Kings, just with my positions plugged into it.  I am concerned over time the UIerrors.txt will become huge.</div></div><hr />

If so, it's nothing to worry about... it's just saying that it's loading the file from Default skin since it wasn't included in the new skin. If you attempt to put all the other files into that directory, then it won't work... personal experience. I may be wrong, but I think the error file is actually updated whenever you load a new skin... if not, it IS definitly cleared whenever you log back in...</div></div><hr />
