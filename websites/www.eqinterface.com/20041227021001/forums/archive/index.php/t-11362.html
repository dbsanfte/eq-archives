<br />
Here are the highlights I got from taking notes, while trying to save out the entire chat session. <br />
<br />
  Stamina Bar is going away.  This will become Endurance<br />
  &quot;Zing&quot; type spells such as Acumen and spells that effected Stamina will not work to improve Endurance recovery<br />
  At this time there will be no Endurance recovery spells in the game. <br />
  Changes will be on Test soon, and added to Live Server on Dec 16th Patch<br />
  Changes in disciplines will effect all classes, new Melee Skills will be provided via Tomes for Rogue, Warrior, and Monks<br />
  Tomes will be vendor sold under 60, and partchment style for 61 and up.<br />
<br />
The whole chat session can be read and commented on Here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11364)<br />

Lets see, I go to the library and pick up a book and it gives me some starteling new revelation on how my body works and I can immediatly put this new information to use....I'm glad this is a fantasy game.<br />
<br />
Did it seem more like 1 per level (bard) or multiples every few levels (caster) or a few every few levels (hybrid)?<br />
<br />
In a way it reminds me of Stat increasing books in D&amp;D.  Those required a week of game time to read and absorb the magic though if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
If there is no Stamina Bar(fatigue), then are they getting rid of how you get really slow if your STA is under 100 and your fatigue is empty?  Not that this matters to most melee characters, but my rogue has been debuffed to under 100 once or twice.</div></div><hr />
