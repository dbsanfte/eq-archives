we dont even OFFER 2.4.. because itwas not LOY compliant.<br />
<br />
Mine is. :D <br />
<br />
Mostly it's the colors of 2.4 and invetory of 2.4 I liked better than 2.5.  <br />
<br />
we didnt change the colors for 2.5 they are the same as 2.4<br />
<br />
we updated the inventory to have a charm slot. and added needed items to XML code, so the opitions bar would show all the icons, (and any other little tweaks).. and we added a &quot;done&quot; button but it was a clone of the Destroy button so its exactly the same color<br />
<br />
the only thing we DID do was remove Crystal Meth, it was the least popular of the 3 shades of blue that were out there AND the one right in the middle..(its almost identical to Ocean Spray) <br />
<br />
when we patched in 2.5 we just took the 4 or 5 files that needed to be updated and over wrote the ones in 2.4 and re-zipped them (the folder even says 2.4 when you un-zip we found out recently)<br />
<br />
I think you may be confusing 2.5 with the beta release 0.90 of Solaria which was a much biger change, but was scrapped for a new direction..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2.4 has(had) off Green HP bars. I liked them. I also swapped the HP and MaxHP numbers, cause I was use to how they are in the default UI. HP/MaxHP, the 2.4 UI I had has it at MaxHP/HP.<br />
<br />
I removed the nameds from the Spell Bar cause it was completely useless.<br />
<br />
I also removed the background from my Buff Windows, so the thing would go completely tranparent when I don't have my mouse over it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hum, that's odd .. The Vert 2.5 mod I have on my alt system isn't the same one that's on the site. It had a completely different style invetory window. One with a 'more apperently' auto-equip box. It's LoY buttons were also done in a fassion I didn't like. Plus, the 2.5 mod had Red HP bars.<br />
<br />
Ah, here's the INV I didn't like: http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?s=&amp;id=1352<br />
<br />
I reverted back the the 2.4 style Invetory and just put the buttons in a line at the top. I didn't like the buttons being placed 'around' the Charm slot like that.</div></div><hr />

The 'Updated' Invetory. The Lables on the Spell Bar. 'Red' HP bars (I like the off green) and the background on the Buff Window icons.<br />
<br />
Your Screen shot doesn't match what 2.5 really looks like now. ;)<br />
<br />
PS: This is what my UI looks like, aside from the spell book item on the Spell Bar, I've changed it's size to make it show:<br />
http://www.gpcentre.net/images/evercrack/gui/ui-pict.jpg<br />

<br />
1. the other spell bar is still availble for download, its in the Vert Folder<br />
<br />
2. we switched them ALL to red, we are not going to try and re-code 6 sets of XMLs... the green was for Cannabis, and Crystal Meth had Blue, Etc, Etc... they got all jumbled together at some point soo to clean it up, we moved it back to red. <br />
<br />
There are 26 XML files in each color.. we offer 5 colors.. that would be 130 XML files to keep track of, and make sure it gets fixed each time its changed.. You can understand having ONE set of XMLs save Sokol and I a HUGE amount of time in patching.<br />
<br />
3. We had almost 500 request for a &quot;DONE&quot; button and nearly that many to move the destroy button.. so we did.. And people wanted an auto equip area they could see, and we had to add 2 more buttons.  soo we made the Inventory exactly 28 pixels longer to incorporate this.. this IS and will be the inventory we support.. I am sorry that we wont support other people's &quot;patched&quot; inventory when things change on it..<br />
<br />
the screen shot did not get updated when we patched in 2.5 it will match when we release Solaria 1.0<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, what you do with the mod once you get it is up to you.. but if you have problems or something changes or gets added, we will tell you how to fix it to work with the design we have.. there are dozen's of &quot;add ons&quot; for download that we try to keep up-to-date, but sadly we run out of time.<br />
<br />
First thing we will tell anyone having issues is re-download and start fresh.. this means you will need to remember what you changed and make them again, when we offer a patch.<br />

<br />
Latest copy of Vert<br />
4x2 Castingbar mod<br />
t.King Spell Icons<br />
<br />
Resolution 1280 x 1024<br />
<br />
<br />
All done with a viewport setting to allow an unhindered view of the screen except when I pop-up the inventory, spellbook or the like.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like the way the current set of windows all use pretty much the same width.  This has allowed me to setup a very clean display for myself. (something MANY other UI's lack)<br />
<br />
<br />
I just hope this trend continues into future releases. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'll attach my layout to this message.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the time to patch, Have you looked into Search and Replace? This is the software I use when I have to change a number of HTML files at once: http://www.funduc.com/search_replace.htm<br />
<br />
It's very handy, allowing you to repleace based on a block of charater via direct matches or indirect in the form of regular expressions. Very powerful for a 750k applicantion.<br />
<br />
I have nothing against ya man. I'm just mentioned I still use 2.4 cause there are features in 2.5 that I didn't like. Better yet, I use 2.5 with old 2.4 parts. And I just mearly pointed out what they were. I'm no where trying to speak on behalf of the EQ UI'ers.<br />
<br />
I have my version of the UI loaded on my site and I plan to keep it updated for every patch, which I have been.<br />
<br />
As for the green stuffs, Guildmates of mine liked the green; I liked it too. I had to keep it for my UI. :p</div></div><hr />

no prob...<br />

Soon the name for our Active Mod is going to change and it won't really matter if your using 2.4 or 2.4-guice or 2.5-guice (aka 2.5 with 2.4 parts) <br />
<br />
The way the origin of all this came across was &quot;fix 2.4 problem cuz I don't wanna use 2.5&quot; and I was explaining that we just dont have the time for that type of request :(<br />

You cant please every one, and the direction to the changes for vert come from ideas/suggestions from the masses enabling Vert UI to maintain the status as the more popular EQ UI.<br />

The pet info window simply has to have certain things loaded into it. You CAN move them off the main window and &quot;hide&quot; them but thats it. thats your problem, you just have to move them. <br />

Thats fixed in the next upcoming release, it is caused bacuse Sony decided to add percents behind player HP mana, target etc, but they named it differently then I did, and anything sony adds the program wants to see, any way it's fixed in the new version, and is nothing major nor anything to be concerned with.<br />

<br />
the issue with the icon is in the icon files.. the book loads from SpellIcons01-5.tga the spellbar loads from SpellGems01-02.tga<br />
<br />
who ever made that set your using didnt put the same icon in both places that EQ looks for it.<br />
<br />
the error message has to do with the new code they added for showing HP message... its a minor thing and actually doesnt break the UI at all..</div></div><hr />

Icons work by simply telling the UI what icon TGA to use, the everquest program then find's the x and y by it's predefined programming. My guess is the icon set your using may have differing icons in some places, as thats the only thing which could cause this. <br />

I'm running into a problem and am unable to determine what's going on.  Hopefully someone can shed some light on this.<br />
<br />
I've downloaded the new vert2.4 file, and installed the patch for the three files.  Logged on, and got an incompatible .xml file message.<br />
<br />
I then deleted my entire original vert ui directory, and then rebuilt it using the new vert2.4 files, and then patched that.  I still get the incompatible .xml message.<br />
<br />
I checked the errors file, but it tells me nothing.  The only thing in the UIErrors.txt file is:<br />
<br />
UIErrorLog created at Wed Jun 11 17:18:01 2003<br />
<br />
I can find nothing else.<br />
<br />
Should I just ignore the warning about the .xml files?  If someone can clue me in, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Thank you.  <br />

No do not worry aboyut the warnings, as I explained this about 2 messages up.<br />

SIGH I am not beign rude, but I've answered this question no fewer then about 50 times! there are SEVERAL mods in the Vert DL section which have  a casting bar, and as their description states, the casting gauge IS the spell book button.<br />

Is there any chance you can make the spellbook button standard, or at least put up a separate download for it?  It'd really be nice to have that back.  :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and on a minor note, the window for reading in-game books is still hosed.  I'm still having to use that mod the other person posted when this was brought up before.  Not a huge issue, but thought a reminder of it might be in order.<br />

I downloaded the new version of Vert, last night, and made a clean install of it.  When I logged on, I discovered my castspell window was missing the spellbook button at the bottom.  I went and installed the patch from June (?) that added that button, but the result completely hosed my hotkey window, so I had to go back and start all over again.<br />
<br />
Is there any chance you can make the spellbook button standard, or at least put up a separate download for it?  It'd really be nice to have that back.  :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and on a minor note, the window for reading in-game books is still hosed.  I'm still having to use that mod the other person posted when this was brought up before.  Not a huge issue, but thought a reminder of it might be in order.<br />
<br />
Thanks!  <br />
<br />
First, do not install any patch to Vert 2.6 it will mess things up.<br />
<br />
Second, the cast spell windows that have a casting gauge, the casting gauge IS the spell book icon, and was changed that way due to popular requests :)<br />
<br />
Third That is most likely caused by your having applied an older xml file via your patching...... but I'll look into it. <br />

The only exception is the &quot;spellbook patch&quot; that I posted, this is not in 2.6b but will shortly be in 2.6c its good for all color versions of VERT.. (look in the patch section)</div></div><hr />

I didn't initially, and only tried it as a test.  After it failed miserably, I made another clean install of 2.6 and it worked fine, other than the missing spellbook button and the book window.<br />
<br />
Second, the cast spell windows that have a casting gauge, the casting gauge IS the spell book icon, and was changed that way due to popular requests <br />
I'm not seeing any spellbook icon/button on the cast spell windows at all.<br />
<br />
edit - Wasn't seeing a casting guage, either, but perhaps my using the mod listed below is part of the problem.  I'll check that, too.<br />
<br />
Third That is most likely caused by your having applied an older xml file via your patching...... but I'll look into it. <br />
If it'll help, the only files I'm using now are:<br />
<br />
1-Vert26b-Cannabis.zip  (or Vert26-Cannabis?)<br />
Right Buff.zip<br />
Sokol-CastingGaugev1.zip<br />
<br />
I'm at work, right now, so I'll double-check those files when I get home tonight and report back.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I'm also using the scroll file that was linked to on page 14 of this thread.  The problems mentioned existed prior to that, so I suspect it's not at fault.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.  :)</div></div><hr />

Do you mean vert25_6-11patch_v2.zip?  If so, I'm pretty sure that's the one I tried to fix the problem with, but which made things worse.  I won't dismiss the possibility that I did something wrong, but I tried three times and each time the hotkey box went bananas.<br />
<br />
In any case, I'm glad to hear 2.6c will include this.  Thanks again.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are 3 files in the June 11th patch, 2 of which will be no problem the 3rd is &quot;EQUI_Animations.xml&quot;. I am fairly sure he updated this file last night, so trying to use this animation file will screwup your whole UI (or most of it)..<br />
<br />
Sooo give him a few hours (its 4:15pm PST) and see if he doesnt post 2.6c with the spellbook repatched in.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the confusion, I did 99% of that patch and I should have gone back and posted 2.6a with it a long time ago. but I have been so swamped with trying to get Solaria ready I totally forgot.<br />
<br />
Sooo don't beat him up.. he will get it fixed before the end of the day!<br />
<br />
(ps you could try just putting the two files from the patch (TGA and EQUI_castspelll.xml) in your vert folder and see if the 2.6 animation file works. You do not want to try and use the patch animation file)</div></div><hr />

Just installed Vert 2.6c Cannabis, clean install, and everything was great. Went and setup the Hot-button box the way I wanted it, logged back in and the title (where you would see the number for what hotkey box you were using was shown) bars were replaced by black space instead of the usual pale green bar. This only happened with the Hot-button box, all other windows were displaying properly.</div></div><hr />

I was able to duplicate this issue. I was using the vertical hotbutton window in Vert2.5 and installed a clean version of Vert2.6 Neptune. I noticed on install that the hotbutton window for 2.6 was the horizontal version and tried to put back my vertical one, since it fits with my viewport at 1024x768.<br />
<br />
I got exactly the same thing happening as the above poster, also it created an anormous amount of lag/framerate decline.<br />

Is it possible to modify/request a vertical hotbutton window for 2.6 neptune?</div></div><hr />

Downloaded and unzipped this file (above link)  Vert 2.6c Cannabis to a folder called Vert in my UI folder in the EQ directory, loaded it up and it looks great, have always used Vert UI's. There seems to be a problem with the guild management window however,  it does not show any of my Guild Mates in it some 53 members and not one is listed =P,  any idea what I have done wrong, or what the problem could be.<br />

I am curious about one other thing, though.  In the player window, there are the current HP and total HP numbers.  With D &amp; E, the current HP number is in red.  Is this a deliberate change?  Prior to this, the only time I ever recall it being red was when buffs dropped and I was down a few HP.  Now, it doesn't seem to be anything but red, even when I'm buffed up far beyond my normal max.<br />
<br />
With D, the total HP number was showing with white, but after I installed E, last night, it was showing with green again.  Perhaps because I was buffed.<br />
<br />
Not a big deal if the colors have changed, but I just want to make sure it's intentional, and that I'm not imagining things.  :)</div></div><hr />
