<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aruvius</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've posted this in about ten places and haven't gotten any help, so I thought I would try it here. My current mobo doesn't have an AGP slot, but has on-board AGP video that shares system memory. I was using the onboard video with the system share set to 32 MB and the aperature to 64. I bought a cheapo PCI video card (PNY NVidia GeForce 2 32 MB) and tried it, but it didn't really help performance. Things LOOK better, but the game doesn't run any smoother. I'm on a very limited budget at the moment, but can squeeze out one of the following:<br />
<br />
1. 256 MB more ram (have 512 currently using ME, so everything above 512 will be ignored), set the system share to 64 MB which is the highest it will go, and the aperature to 128 MB.<br />
<br />
2. Buy a new MB with an AGP expansion and hope to score a better video card later.<br />
<br />
3. Buy a slightly better PCI card. Limit is probably $75.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions as to which is better? I realize it's probably option 2, but option 1 is a quick fix, and to be honest I really don't care about the aesthetics as much as performance. I'm happy with the way the game looks now I just want it to run smoother.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Option 2 - that way you set yourself up for the furture to be able to expand even farther, when you can.<br />
<br />
Even if that means using your currect GF2 PCI card in the new MB's PCI slot until you can score a better Vid Card. You still have that AGP slot just waiting for a real upgrade.<br />
<br />
1 and 3 are both hot fixes. Nothing more. They will work for a period, and then you'll be faced with the same troubles when the game upgrades it engines again. Not just EQ, but any graphicly intensive game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best to get a good motherboard first and then you can get a nice graphics card down the road. <br />
<br />
You cant really get that much better of a graphics card then that geforce2. Yes they might have faster ones for the pci slot but you wont get much more performance that what your getting with that geforce2.<br />
<br />
With EQ2 coming out and POP its only going to make your computer work harder. So get the new motherboard now so you can upgrade in the future.</div></div><hr />

You say that you are on a limited budget (which I can fully relate with :) ).  If you buy a new mobo, you may then also have to buy a new processor and possible new memory!  Just a thought.  ;)</div></div><hr />
