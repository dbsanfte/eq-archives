<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leilee</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using Oldstyle/Oldschool since I found it months ago. Recently I've had an issue where the second chat window does not get focus (so I can chat in it). It's killing me - I usually have this window setup for alternate channels ie. say grp raid goes to main chat and secondary raid channels goes to other chat window. No matter what I try all chat goes to main chat (I see incoming chat in the right place just can't send chat in the right place) - is there a fix for this ? Am I being a dummy and there's something I don't have set right? I love the UI and it's been working fine for months ( I think the 8-26 patch broke it but I can't be sure) I've even dl'ed the 2.3 patch and it displays the same behavior :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leilee</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Cairenn for the quick response! Gonna check that as soon as I get logged in - I had thought there was a different purpose for that option but I can't remember now what it was - I'm pretty sure I do have that set but it's always been set that way - maybe it's working the way it's supposed to now ;) /bonk Verant<br />
In any event I love the UI - it has everything I want - all my stats, my hotswaps and lot's of screen real estate to keep track of the beasties whackin on me in a simple concise display w/no frills or extra lag from the more graphic intensive UI's. My apologies to those authors - I have tremendous respect for your coding abilities and your product - I just don't care for the &quot;busy&quot; aspect of most.<br />
Awesome site Cairenn! /kudos :D  heh maybe someday I'll get off my lazy arse and get xml under my belt and code some...</div></div><hr />
