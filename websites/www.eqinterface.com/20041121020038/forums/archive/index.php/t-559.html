<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sokol</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm trying to make one solid window across the bottom for most my features. I would like to make the far right side have a spell book in it, only showing only 4 maybe 5 spells, with a scroll button to scroll to the other pages. <br />
<br />
My quesation is this. Has any one been able to change the number of spell slots on each page, and increase the number of pages? It breaks down into something like <br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;SBW_SpellBook1&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;SBW_SpellBook2&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;SBW_SpellBook3&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;SBW_SpellBook4&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;SBW_Spell0&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;SBW_SpellName0&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
On to 15..<br />
<br />
I tried changing the SpellBook1-4 to 1-15, and the Spell0-15 to 0-4, but it then refuses to load my skin, and help here is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It ties in with the idea of &quot;Mem this page&quot; feature that didn't get finished/go live yet.<br />
<br />
But, I'm not 100% sure. I hadn't taken any close look at the spell book itself. Purely speculation.</div></div><hr />

The game knows to fill in SBW_Spell0 - 15 with the spells depending on the page. You could hide some of the spells I guess and only use 0 - 3 and 8 - 11 on each page, but then you won't have many spell slots in your book since you'll be throwing away half of them.<br />

<br />
Personally I don't see much use for it, except to memorize my main page after respawning, and I've usually got plenty of time to do that since I'm either waiting for a rez or looking for one.<br />
<br />
In any case, I like the new spellbook, even though it was a total pain to reorganize.</div></div><hr />
