Re: The end of T.King mods...<br />
<br />
I did plea my case; that I may finish what I've started, but it was determined that there is a conflict of interest in doing so, I found this out only recently, but I knew it was going to happen, it was just a matter of time, and in all honesty I couldn't agree more with the decision, my creativity belongs completely to Sigil, I want to give them no less than 200%, the work I do at Sigil must be 10x better than anything I've done before, Sigil is that kind of company that has people whom I completely respect and admire, and my heart and soul are in Sigil, I would be letting them down by working towards different ends, but do know that I'm still working on something for all of you, you'll just have to wait a little longer to see it, but it will without a doubt be worth the wait.<br />
<br />
In the past 6 months the traffic on this site has slowed down to less than one quarter of what it use to be, that is the result of dramatically slowing down the frequency at which I was releasing mods, and though I do get donations from time-to-time, which is partly why I continued to create mods for Everquest, but there is still really good news for supporters...<br />
<br />
I plan to turn some of my spare-time over to creating high-quality content for the supporters’ forum, which will evolve from a simple mod forum to something quite a bit more, such as: <br />
<br />
-- T.King Fantasy Art Web Kits.<br />
-- Supporter-only Fantasy Art Wallpapers.<br />
-- Step-by-step Fantasy Art Creation Guides.<br />
-- High-quality 3D Fantasy Objects.<br />
-- T.King Fantasy Art Signature Templates.<br />
<br />
I'm already working towards this right now, I've been speaking with Kuvasie, Carienn and Remelio about having them continue mod work for the supporters forum, I will provide them with direct feedback, even though I cannot lay hands directly on any of the work.<br />
<br />
The supporters’ forum is going to evolve into something more special, and as such I may place limits on donations, or stop them entirely and cater only to the existing members, this will not effect existing supporters, my goal is to give supporters far more than they ever bargained for by becoming a supporter, I want supporters to think “wow! I never thought I’d get all of this simply for sending in a small donation”, and I want fans of my art to hang out here with me until things are released from Sigil, I want you all to know that it will be worth the wait, and you will be rewarded when Sigil’s game comes out by being in this forum already, when that time comes I truly believe that you will be happy you stayed, I'm not leaving any of you behind, I'm just taking you to a cooler place. :)<br />

And no, the combat window did not work, the graphics seem to be rather messed up.  I had to grab one of the stand alone combat windows from the download section.  No errors, just didn't look very good.</div></div><hr />
