<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, just had to vent a bit .. I spent the last 3ish hours trying to figure out PS ( I'm not a graphic artist ;) ) and EQ to get borders working.<br />
<br />
After I got PS working and something that was okay, I tried it in EQ.<br />
<br />
You know how time flies when you're just pulling your hair out? Well, I should be bald by now, cause time just FLEW ..<br />
<br />
2.5ish hours later, I finally got EQ working and I created a custom border. LOL<br />
<br />
See! <br />

<br />
Yes, I know, too bright for it's text. It's only a start!!<br />
<br />
That .tga file is a royal pain in the ***. Trying to figure out what graphics are for what. What goes where.<br />
<br />
And to find out that EQ has, not 1, not 3, but 5 different elements for the Title bars?!<br />
And 3 Elements for each side of a window ( Three left, right, bottom and top - 12 total ).<br />
<br />
Big pain .. Yeah, I know it's so you can create them &quot;cool&quot; little gliphes on the sides ( like the Main chat window ) but still .. It's a big much?!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any hoot, enough of that .. Finally done with that &quot;test&quot;. It's time to take a break.<br />
<br />
b-bye now .. and remember .. Live long! Live Proud! Live the Banana!! :nana:</div></div><hr />

Borders are a pain in the butt to make, but lots of fun to look at when they're done.</div></div><hr />
