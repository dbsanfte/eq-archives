<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khallim</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys.  I currently use Drakah's UI, Mixed version, and I love it to death.  Of course, this last patch screwed it all up so my Hotbuttons kept getting pushed up, Action/ Spell Bar window got pushed up, and Compass window was getting pulled off the side of the screen.  So I went and messed around with it and found a fix that WORKS for those three items.  Basically it resizes them and moves one a little so that they are inside the viewable area, and won't get pushed around anymore.  Heres how:<br />
<br />
Go to your Drakah's UI folder, and find the file named<br />
<br />
EQUI_CompassWnd.xml<br />
 <br />
Right click and select Open With: Notepad<br />
<br />
Use the find feature and search for &quot;CompassWindow&quot;<br />
<br />
This should bring you down to the last line of code.  Scroll down a little from where it says &quot;CompassWindow&quot; and you will see a line of code like this:<br />
<br />
&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
Change it to this:<br />
&lt;X&gt;2&lt;/X&gt;<br />
<br />
Scroll down a bit more and you will see:<br />
<br />
&lt;CX&gt;1290&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
change it to:<br />
&lt;CX&gt;1280&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
<br />
Close notepad and it will ask you if you want to save, click yes.  <br />
<br />
Now open the file called <br />
EQUI_ActionsWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Again search for &quot;Actionswindow&quot; after opening this file in Notepad.  <br />
<br />
Scroll down and find the line that says:<br />
<br />
&lt;Y&gt;25&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
And change it to:<br />
&lt;Y&gt;2&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
<br />
Then down a bit more and find:<br />
<br />
&lt;CY&gt;313&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
Change it to:<br />
&lt;CY&gt;290&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
<br />
Click close and save the file.<br />
<br />
Now find the file :<br />
<br />
EQUI_HotbuttonWnd.xml<br />
<br />
Open with notepad and search for &quot;HotbuttonWnd&quot;<br />
<br />
Scroll down till u see the code:<br />
<br />
&lt;CY&gt;140&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
And change it to:<br />
&lt;CY&gt;100&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
<br />
Click close and save the file.  <br />
<br />
That should be all you need to do.  You Should also be able to use the Action window fix for the Spell Bar window, if its having the same problem.  Me being a melee, I don't use the spell bar, but I have my action window in the same spot, and I think they are the same size.  As long as your UI has the Action Window/Spell Window at Coordinates:<br />
<br />
XPos1280x1024=0<br />
YPos1280x1024=728<br />
<br />
Then it should work.  Also, note that I did these fixes using the 1280x1024 screen res, so if you are using a different res, I don't know that it will work.  (I haven't actually found another res that Drakah's UI works at, heh)<br />
<br />
I hope this helps some people.  You may see a little gap between your Hotbuttons window and your action window and the bottom of the screen, but for me, its better than having things moving all around.  <br />

did not tried yet, using default skin =(<br />
<br />
and the last question: Does the fix work on<br />
drakahmain also?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vapor67</div><div class="date">02-08-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great fix, was exactly what I needed.<br />
<br />
Adapted to drakahpet  (what I use) with no problems, I touched up the cy amounts for size a tad from what you had but basically your fix was perfect for me.  I used the same guidelines to fix the pet window.<br />
<br />
My cy values for the Size changes described above were as follows, and this aligned them with each other and the chat box along the bottom, with a tiny gap to make sure it wasn't getting pushed up.<br />
<br />
CastSpellWnd: cy set to 294 for size<br />
HotButtonWnd: cy set to 103 for size<br />
PetInfoWindow: cy set to 97 for size<br />
<br />
Haven't had compass problems so left that alone.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks again for the info, wouldn't have been able to fix it without it.</div></div><hr />
