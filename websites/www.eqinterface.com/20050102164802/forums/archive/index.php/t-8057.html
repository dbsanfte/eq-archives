<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an inquiry...there are several full-screen UI's I'd like to try out, but they're hard-coded to work at 1280x1024 resolution. I run Windows and play EQ at 1280x960, which is a perfect 4:3 ratio, while 1280x1024 is a 5:4 ratio.<br />
<br />
In Windows drawing apps, a 5:4 ratio will make squares into rectangles and circles into ovals, that's why I run at 4:3 (1280x960). Yet, I notice that many UI's are designed for the 5:4 ratio. Doesn't this cause odd problems in EQ with things being disproportionate? Does EQ have an internal way to handle this and maintain the correct proportion of what's being drawn on the screen? If so, I'll change EQ ress to 1280x1024 and give it a shot. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your replies.</div></div><hr />

You may have a wide screen monitor witch is not normal. Authors make there skins for the most popular resolutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that 1280 x 1024 is a popular resolution, but it's not a standard aspect ratio, which is what has me wondering. The standard monitor aspect ratio is 4:3; this applies to all non-wide-screen monitors, from 12&quot; to 22&quot; and beyond. Here are some standard screen resolutions and their aspect ratios:<br />
<br />
  640 x 480, 4:3 ratio<br />
  800 x 600, 4:3 ratio<br />
  1024 x 768, 4:3 ratio<br />
  1152 x 864, 4:3 ratio<br />
  1280 x 960, 4:3 ratio<br />
  1280 x 1024, 5:4 ratio<br />
  1600 x 1200, 4:3 ratio<br />
<br />
Note how all the standard resolutions except 1280 x 1024 use the same aspect ratio of 4:3. Only 1280 x 1024 is the oddball.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if EQ had some internal (meaning we don't muck with it; the program just &quot;knows&quot;) way to discern the difference between 4:3 and 5:4 aspect ratio and compensates somehow.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll play with it a bit and see how it looks. :\</div></div><hr />

As I am led to understand by a friend who maintains computers for a living, some models with &quot;perfect flat&quot; screens may have a native aspect ratio of 5:4, but the majority of monitors, both CRT and LCD, do not.<br />
<br />
My own monitor is a super-standard Viewsonic A90 19&quot; CRT monitor at a 4:3 aspect ratio.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using a ruler I measured an 800 by 800 pixel square, it was nearly perfectly square and after a tiny bit of tweaking it was. It seems my monitor is just adjusted so that at 1280x1024 (it keeps setting based on different resolutions) it's vertically stretched to be be just at the top and bottom, and horizontally scruntched a tiny bit. I think that this is why it turns out square, even though my monitor is (I'm quite positive) an average 4:3 ratio monitor. At 4:3 ratio resolutions, I also get perfect squares, but I have much more black space at the top and bottom of my screen (does that make sense, you know what I mean when I say black space, where the image isn't projected on the screen).</div></div><hr />

Oddly enough, 1280x1024 is the only ratio that looks &quot;right&quot; to me, I am on expert by any means though. I use an Envision 19&quot; flatface CRT monitor.  <br />

I will admit that it was slight enough that unless you were looking for it you probably wouldn't notice it, but I guess I'm anal enough that I do. <br />
<br />
I did do a little non-scientific testing for lag issues between the 4:3 and 5:4 aspect ratio and, on a full screen viewport, I could honestly not say that one lagged more or less than the other.<br />
<br />
But, since there's a visible height/width difference between the two (albeit minor), I'm sticking to 1280 x 960 (and hey, I can't be in bad company if Thomus agrees ). ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmm... when I downsize a pic from 1280x1024 and I plug in 1024 as the width the computer puts in 768 as an accurate ratio downsize.  I am not the best math person around but shouldnt it be something other than 768 if you are moving from a 5:4 to a 4:3 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LeoNameless</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the posters here are making an assumption...namely, that the 3d images are rendered(drawn) &quot;in ratio.&quot; By this I mean that a square object for instance, must be drawn 10 pixels by 10 pixels. This is absolutely not the case when rendering 3d objects in a game on screen.<br />
<br />
3d objects themselves are defined in their own internal dimensional values (inches, centimeters, etc) which in no way directly corresponds to the pixels on a screen, since the object designer has no way of knowing what resolution your monitor is going to be set to. And in fact, people all use varying resolutions and aspect ratios so there is no sense in designing that way anyway. In our example then, the square object will be defined as 10 &quot;somethings&quot;(inches, centimeters, etc) high by 10 wide.<br />
<br />
The rendering engine draws the objects on the screen based on the resolution and aspect ratio the video driver is set to. So, that square object we were talking about might actually be rendered at 10 x 7 pixels, for example,  because that ratio appears &quot;square&quot; on screen (depending on the resolution and aspect ratio a particular video driver is set to).<br />
<br />
In this specific instance, i.e. 3d games rendering, think of the resolution as merely the size of the window you are looking through.<br />
<br />
This is completely different than taking a static image and resizing it to a different aspect ratio because, and this is the important part, the image is NOT being redrawn at the new aspect ratio, it is being stretched/shrunk to the new size. <br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that static images like bitmaps, jpegs, etc, ARE drawn pixel by pixel in direct relation to the resolution and aspect ratio of your video settings. So if they were created by someone at 4:3 and then displayed on a monitor whose video driver is set at a resolution with an aspect ratio of 5:4 it will DEFINITELY look skewed.<br />
<br />
Now, a grain of salt: I do not know if the EQ engine actually makes the proper transformations or not, but any game designed to display 3d objects with the correct aspect ratios irregardless of the USER'S video settings, does it this way.<br />
<br />
At least, this is my understanding of how this video magic works :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use 1280x1024 in game for the same reason that I use it on my desktop.  It is the highest resolution my monitor will run at without going all fuzzy.  I'm more interested in getting three more lines of text in my editor than in my squares being absolutely perfectly square.<br />
<br />
The difference in ratios between 5:4 and 4:3 is about a 6% skew, which isn't really enough to notice.  The human visual system is amazing at adaptation, so if something looks like it ought to be square, you'll see it as square and adapt the skew to the rest of the screen without ever being conscious of it.<br />
<br />
If the skew really bugs you, you can always shrink the visible area of your display by about half an inch in width.<br />
<br />
It is possible to correct the aspect ratio in the graphics pipeline so that a true 4:3 area is displayed on your 5:4 pixels, but I doubt Verant does that.  This correction would not add any lag, since it just changes a few numbers in the view projection matrix that is being applied to everything already.</div></div><hr />
