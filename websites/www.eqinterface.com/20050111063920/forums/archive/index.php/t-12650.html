<br />
I'm missing the button graphics on my selector window and also the spellbook button on the bottom of my spell bar...<br />
<br />
The selector window is completely black, though the tool tip shows if I put my mouse over it, thank heavens...<br />
<br />
I'm using the t. king 2.0 mod and the vert minimal vertical selector window...<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
TIA!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The piece for me that always got corrupted after logging in a few times was the Random graphic button for my custom MP3.  It would only happen though when I had texture turn off on the player though.  If I kept the background texture on, it never happens.  Very weird bug.<br />
<br />
I always fixed it by keeping another copy of my UI_Name_server.ini and copying the good copy over again (and again and again and again... it was that consistent for me).  Or you can cut and paste only the section concerning the botched up item in its appropriate place in your .ini file.<br />
<br />
Very annoying when it keeps happening consistently too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had that happen off an on for a really long time and it's bugged me - I'll give the texture thing a try...<br />
<br />
P.S. it WORKED!! I went in and deleted the custom selector window, logged on and changed the window settings on them, logged off and reinstalled the custom one and VOILA!! I can't thank you enough!!</div></div><hr />
