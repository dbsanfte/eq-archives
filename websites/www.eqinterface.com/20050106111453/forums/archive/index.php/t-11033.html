Eeveryone trying to get fixed for the patch and all... <br />
But this error is rather disturbing... <br />
I've yet to experience it after a patch...<br />
<br />
When i click the download links, this error-window pops up:<br />
-- The Compressed (zipped) Folder is invalid or corrupted. --<br />
Else it gives me a window with icons, but there is no content...<br />
Clicking extract tells me there are no files to be extracted...<br />
And i can't right-click (or left-click for that matter) any of the icons in the window..<br />
<br />
Relatively frustrating...<br />
Any clues? <br />
Thanks~<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you download are you selecting to open or save it right away?  If you select open right away some times on a windows 2000 or XP machine your personal temp folder gets full and it wont open zipfiles. You can choose to save the zipfile then double click on it to open and it should work. If this is the case you will want to look into how to manually clear out your windows temp folder.<br />

Our server is not really getting spammed since we upgraded to a nice dual xeon system. Things may be a little slow due to the on going DOS attack against the network we are on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sure the last patch had nothing to do with why your having trouble. <br />
<br />
BUT, what version of Winzip are you using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katagi</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Update...<br />
<br />
Day or two later, the errors stoped...<br />
And I did find that the next day i was able to avoid the error by Saveing instead of Opening on the DL... <br />
<br />
- Question<br />
<br />
I say next day, because I messed up my downloader, i unclicked that ask every time box...<br />
Anyone know how to get it to ask again?<br />
<br />
- Back on Topic<br />
<br />
Seems things just cleared up, must have been related to (not caused be) the patch, because of the high trafic of everyone rebuilding...<br />
Often patches don't break my UI, this one did; I assume this was widespread and added to the problems downloading...<br />
<br />
-----<br />
Anyway, thank you all for your help, would be interested to know if any of you know how to turn the question back on...<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />
