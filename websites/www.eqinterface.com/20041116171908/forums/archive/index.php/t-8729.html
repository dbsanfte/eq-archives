This Caster Kit was design to enable you “the user” to customize inventory items to those  that you find most useful for the UI’s I developed.   PDF format was selected as a delivery system to provide you with security against installing trojens on your system.<br />
<br />
TO USE THIS UI MODIFICATION YOU MUST DOWNLOAD ADOBE READER VERSION 6.0.  http://www.adobe.com  <br />
<br />
Target Window:  The original mod to this target window (a 1 minute timer added along with casting bar) was done by Xymarra.   I added the pet bar to the window along with 2 <br />
inventory slots.  This allows me to to keep my focus in one location when I have a charmed pet and click easily on an inventory slot item when needed.   The top of the <br />
window is the target name with Hp's. At the bottom is the pet bar and in between is the casting bar. To the right is a one minute timer.<br />
<br />
Pet Window:  This is my modification to the pet window. I added Cairenn’s pet stats page to Grimmier’s original pet inventory window and customized to my needs.<br />
<br />
Container Window:  This is my modification to Cairenn’s  container mod.   I reduced the size of the top inventory slots and made enough room for eight of them.  With this modification I have extended my on screen casting abilities by keeping a container up and swapping click able items in and out of the inventory slots.  <br />
<br />
HotButton Window:  This setup allows me to minimize mouse movement when buffing.  The spell cast window and hot button window are the same height and placed side by side <br />
in my setup. Hot button 1 is set up with the /rtarget command. To the right of the hot buttons the primary, range and inventory bags are available.</div></div><hr />

Just got a bard high enough to need the ability to switch quickly, used a pet and etc. Don't understand the pdf part but it seems a way to easily customize what the slots are. That I like, grin. And it isn't an exe, I like that even better, lol.<br />

Thanks:)  The sole purpose of using pdf as the delivery system was to eliminate the use of an exe file which could give someone a virus.</div></div><hr />
