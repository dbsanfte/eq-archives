It's what I guess could be called a mix and match... althought I really only used one interface to build on. It's based on the Infinity2 interface. <br />
This thread will be for discussion, suggestions, comments, gripes, whatever for the fozz_infinity UI.<br />

<br />
but you should have been more &quot;consistant&quot; with your gauges.<br />
the hp/mana/pet HP gauges should match the xp/AAxp gauges (i like the xp/AAxp ones :p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm... I was actually thinking about changing the xp and aaxp ones... because they are broken into 17 boxes. 17. Makes it a little harder to figure out where you're at from looking at the gauge. hehe. The gauges I made are broken into 20... which makes a little more sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was not talking about the number of boxes :p<br />
in fact 17 boxes is quite... weird.<br />
<br />
i juste prefer the desgin...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I already found a small issue... typical me. I can't complete something like this without forgetting something. For those wanting to use the target window with Pet hp bar (the one that is default) here is the fixed version.<br />
<br />
The mana percent number was off by two pixels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Patches for my UI are in the works... should be ready for upload tonight or tomorrow morning. I'm planning on adding the buff box below the buttons in the current pet window, it will hold 18 buffs, and will not be resizable. <br />
<br />
If someone would like to see something different (i.e. buffs to the side of the buttons... resizable pet window, etc.) give me a shout and I'll see what I can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalysto</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Loaded this up for my mage last night and was nice looking, and functional.  My only thing was the name of the spells on the spell gems, but no biggie really.  Nice job!  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if anyone is actually using this UI... =\<br />
but if you are, fixes and additions for the Nov 5 patch are coming soon. I am most likely also going to change to the normal size target window as default. The larger target windows will still be included, but I'm starting to believe I'm the only one that likes a target window that huge. :)<br />
If anyone has any comments or suggestions on changes, shout out and I'll see what I can do. I'm planning on not showing any con indicator in the target window, because I like the new target indicator around the target's feet, and it shows con color. I think it's kind of redundant to show the con color in the target window and around the target's feet.<br />
<br />
Basically, the only changes that are really needed should be to add the targetindicator.ini and targetindicator.tga to your custom UI folder... and that's really only necissary if you want the target circle to show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nwinn</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, I use a mod'd infiniti which is posted as derasiUI, in case anyone wants to know what I'm working with.... anyway, I messed around with adding a small dot target-indicator but, have gotten crummy results...  for some reason the no-target state shows up where I put it but, when you select a target the animation shows up at 0,0... along with the no-target animation (in the correct spot) :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nwinn</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and the tga/xml changes I made...  If anyone wants to play w/ 'em! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've done a regular-sized target window with con box... here's a pic of it. any suggestions on what to do with the big target windows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nwinn</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">grr, how stupid!  You can't just place a static animation wherever you want... you have to load it placed where you want it in a 'ghost' version of whatever window you want it to be in.  (if that makes any sense :P)  Gonna upload my target indicator 'fix' for my version of infiniti... I don't think you'd have to do much to make it work for other versions of infiniti, just use the other graphics for the target window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Meek, the Ui should still work fine after the Nov 5th patch... just no con box or target circle around people's feet. Are you having other problems?<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you want the health and mana back in the regular target window, wait a bit. I'm using the normal sized target window as default for my updated version... so the new download will have the normal stuff back in the player window. =)<br />
<br />
Don't worry... once I figure out what to do with them, I'll still be including the huge target windows as optional changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numgrak</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you said you thought it would be redundant to include the con box in the target window due to the ring around the target's feet, but I like how you limited it to the top left corner of the box on your new pic you posted. Possibly something along that line for the larger target window if you decide to make any mods to it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about this for the big window... does this look too stupid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brad_whitwell</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, not silly at all :)<br />
<br />
I like having all the info I need in one place during raids etc (tar health / my health / pet health / mana / casting bar....)<br />
<br />
Any chance you could add a casting bar to the big target box you have?<br />
<br />
Adding the con as you have is a nice touch too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numgrak</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't look stupid at all ;)  I like it. The con info isn't distracting, it fits nicely in the corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm going to run with it like it is. Should have the new set ready for upload in an hour or so. I changed my mind... the big target window is staying in as default.  =P<br />
<br />
I'm still including multiple versions of the big target window, as well as the regular target and player windows, horizontal and vertical buff bars. I'll add a casting bar to the top border of the big target window as well. =)<br />
<br />
let me go get to work. hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to be working this weekend on some much heavier changes... I'm going to attempt a tabbed pet window, one page for buttons and another for buffs... and I'm probably going to update other graphics (like the gauges).</div></div><hr />

The tabbed pet window is done... it came out pretty good. I'm not sure yet if I want to release it by itself or put out another revision of the whole UI. There are some other changes I'm still thinking about, so I'll decide soon. =)</div></div><hr />

Something similar to this happens on my druid when I want to drop stuff, the box comes up without yes or no confirmations.  I can try to drop it again though and a proper box comes up.  It's only on her though and not other characters using this UI, so who knows.  Some annoying bug I guess.  :o <br />
<br />
BTW, can't wait for new version!  Love this UI much!  :D</div></div><hr />

I can't duplicate the problem. I have no idea what could cause it. If anyone has any suggestions of where I should look, I would love to hear them. Very weird. Neither of the windows mentioned are part of my mod... they are the default window with only the graphics changed.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't destroy something earlier on my druid because of lack of &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot; on the confirm button so switched to default UI and could not there either.

As usual I forgot something. =(<br />
<br />
If you want to use the horizontal hot buttons, you'll need to add this background file...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">New new version uploaded, awaiting moderation. :D<br />
<br />
I added the background file to the download... and fixed a problem with the graphic for the mini gauges.<br />
<br />
Version 1.4 is the most up-to-date, please wait and get that one if you are interested in trying this UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone requested this... so I made it. :D<br />
<br />
Here's a 1024x768 version of the horizontal hotbuttons. It also comes with a modded player window... with all stats and resists.<br />
<br />
I don't really recommend Fozz_Infinity for any rez except 1280x1024 or above... but I certainly won't stop you if you want to use my mod and can't get your resolution that high. ;)</div></div><hr />

If you have been missing your &quot;who&quot; button, download this file and add it to your custom UI folder.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xarox</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey man!<br />
<br />
I really like this new improvment to your UI, with the long hotbutton bar with stats and such. It makes me make my chat windows alot bigger, and text is not split in more rows as fast. :D<br />
<br />
I have a request for you if I may be so bold to ask. I have been using infinity ui for a long time now, but with this new hotbuttonbar it made all the difference, so I'm stepping over to your side.<br />
<br />
There is one thing that I could change with the infinity ui, and that's the spellbuffduration windows, and songs. I could take a custom made and just cut and paste it into the infinity ui and get the setup that I wanted. For some reason I cannot do that with yours. It turns up with the nice frames and all around it, but it only posts the name of the buff that I have up, and not the graphics of the buff, and If I want to click the buff off, I cant touch it.<br />
<br />
So, the request would then be if you could make a spellbuffwindow like the one I'm gonna link a picture to below. And hopefully it will fit in my uisetup where I placed the default spellbuff slots. Or, if you could explain what I need to do, to make a custom buffwindow work with you ui? What files to remove and so on. That would work to. :)<br />
<br />
Those spellbuff setups that you guys use, confuses me abit. :)<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate any help or suggestions from you in this. :D<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what my setup looks like.<br />
<br />
1280*1024 (http://w1.404.telia.com/~u40439979/XaroxEQ.jpg) <br />
<br />
This is the spellbuff setup that I would like for it to look like. But within your frames.<br />
<br />

<br />
(the same look for the 6 short duration songs)<br />
<br />
ps. Even though alot of people really likes the spellbuff setup now, to get more options would be incredible. But, only a suggestion. :D ds.<br />

<br />
Here's what you were looking for I think... unzip all these files into your custom folder.. they will replace existing files. I put the two buff windows in that you wanted, and I fixed the selector window so it doesn't have the extra space at the bottom. =)<br />
<br />
Hope you like, let me know if you have any problems.</div></div><hr />

I've just checked it out, and it looks and works awesome!!! :D<br />
<br />
Thank you! Thank you!<br />
<br />
There is one thing that you forgot though, but it's not a big deal really. The dark shading you have on all the other windows. You added that to the &quot;shortduration buff window&quot; but forgot it on the &quot;longbuff window&quot;. It doesnt matter really, cuz it's the functionality I was after, and that works great. :)<br />

How could i go about putting that attack thing back.. Or possibly putting back into the target window instead of the player window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which player window are you using? That one I included as default, or one from the mods folder? If you are using the default one... here's how to get the attack border back.<br />
<br />
Open up your EQUI_playerwindow.xml with notepad, and find this section right near the beginning of the code:<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_AttackIndicator&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Cycle&gt;false&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;Texture&gt;TargetBox.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
&lt;Location&gt;<br />
&lt;X&gt;6&lt;/X&gt;<br />
&lt;Y&gt;2&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
&lt;CX&gt;0&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;0&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
Change the &lt;size&gt; section so that it looks like this:<br />
<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
&lt;CX&gt;116&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;28&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
<br />
Save the file and load EQ.<br />
<br />
The blinky attack border will only work in the player window... in order to have a blinking border on the target window you'd have to switch all the code for the two, while maintaining the needed information for each. A bit more complex, but I could do it for you if that's what you really want. I would just need to know which playerwindow and target window you are using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chaosbunny</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks so much for the help<br />
<br />
yes im using the default stuff. The player and target window are both the default small and the default player window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathos</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this UI! Great work on it. Exactly what I've been looking for. Just some small itsy bitsy problems.<br />
<br />
1.  It's in 1280x1024. No big problem, just makes me need to go buy a new monitor :D <br />
<br />
2. For some stupid reason I opened a new chat window. Now I can't close it.<br />
<br />
3. There's just a very small amount of space at the bottom of the window selector. Not really functional, just distracts the neat freak.<br />
<br />
Great UI!<br />
<br />
Also the Skills button in the Inv. seems to be broken (?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks! :D<br />
<br />
Let's run down the list.<br />
<br />
1. Yep. sorry. I already bought a bigger monitor and so I designed it for mine. =P<br />
Which hotbutton window are you using? If it's the horizontal one, I already made a 1024x768 version... I think it's somewhere on this thread. <br />
<br />
2. This is a small change, I can tell you how to do it if you want to brave the xml a bit. Otherwise wait a bit... this is fixed in the next version.<br />
<br />
3. This is also fixed in the next version.<br />
<br />
Skills button broken? That's odd... works on my two computers. Are you sure your skills window isn't off-screen or something?<br />
<br />
As you may have guessed from some of the above answers, I have been hard at work on the UI the past couple days. Version 1.6 is nearly ready... and contains all kinds of new goodies. <br />
<br />
Highlights:<br />
- The regular hotbutton window now includes a tabbed section with 12 inventory slots for clickies<br />
- Lots of bug fixes and cleanup, including the two things you mentioned<br />
- Two versions of the combat abilities window, which match the UI better (eight-button default, and a four button one for highbreds)<br />
- Discover new skills and unearth archane spells! and.... oh wait.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">imezru</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice UI and I love how you have great CS there are some things that I would love to have if I stopped using the normal infinity. I think it would be easier if the words on the spell casting box were on the left side so I could have that box snug against the right hand side, and the opposite be done for the buff box all the words on the right hand side so I could have it on the left hand side of my screen. And one last thing what I have done because I play a Enchanter and a Bst (I use my pet window a lot) is I have taken out infinitys pet window and replaced it with the basic UI, for me the bigger Pet Attack button is a lot more easy to hit and I never accidently hit Pet sit with it. So my wish would be a Pet Attack button bigger than the rest above the other pet commands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which interface are you using, exactly? I should be able to mod my pet window and spellbar to meet your request... but my buff windows don't have the labels so it would be a little hard to switch them to the other side. =)</div></div><hr />

Also, will you be updating the 1024x768 horizontal hotbutton window?  I'm using it, and it is Just what I've been looking for, for a very long time.  And will the skills and spells be free? Or will we have to pay $30 for some crappy, buggy, pos expansion?<br />

I wish more UIs would follow your example with all the included mods.  They just rock.</div></div><hr />

Are there any other changes you would like to see with it?<br />
<br />
Imezru, ok... I was confused. I'll get to work on the pet and spellbar windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reversed spellbar and the new pet window are complete. I'll include the new pet window as default in the 1.6 version, and the reversed spellbar in the mods folder.<br />
<br />
I took a look at the pet window buttons and came up with something I think should be better. I made the attack button larger and put it by itself on the top row, and I moved the &quot;pet get lost&quot; button to the second tab, under the buffs... so there would be less danger of accidentally clicking it.<br />
<br />
I'm off to actually play a little EQ :D. I'll be uploading the 1.6 version in a couple days, once I make sure I'm not forgetting anything really important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Playing EQ? How dare you! :D  You deserve a break. If you can call EQ that.<br />
<br />
edit: OMG! Not even the default UI has a working Yes/No box! :mad: I'm gonna go psycho very soon. Somebody better fix Vazaelle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathos</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If it helps at all, the reason it doesn't work is because it's almost three times as big as the default, and EQ doesn't like that. Easy fix, just copy UI_ConfirmationDialog.xml to your custom folder. Open with notepad. Change '&lt;style_sizeable&gt;false&lt;/style_sizable&gt;' to '&lt;style_sizeable&gt;True&lt;/style_sizable&gt;'. Then just make the box bigger.<br />
<br />
Also, I like the XP bars in the middle. I just turned off the player window cause it's huge and unneeded IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Version 1.6 has been uploaded, and is awaiting moderation. :D<br />
<br />
Check the first post in this thread! It now contains screenshots of all the included mods.<br />
<br />
A couple things to mention...<br />
You'll notice that I switched the UI default (as downloaded) to use the vertical buff and song windows, and the regular sized target window. This is because of much feedback I have recieved, and my desire to make the UI as universally appealing as possible. The large target windows and the horizontal buff and song windows are still available in the mods folder that's included in the download .zip file.<br />
<br />
You'll notice, if you look carefully at the screenshot, that the Combat ability window includes an endurance bar. This just made sense to me... and as a beastlord I can tell you that it works out well.<br />
<br />
You'll also notice that the hotbutton window now has a tabbed section that has twelve armor slots on the second page. I picked twelve slots based on my best guesses as to what people might need for clickies and quick switches. If you have a specific request for a slot that isn't included... post it.</div></div><hr />

The new hotbutton window has twelve armor slots on the second page, but two of them are the neck slot! Sorry =( I read my scratch paper wrong when I was coding this.<br />
<br />
The really sad part is that I caught this mistake when I was testing... and fixed it... but saved the fixed version in the wrong folder. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Here's the fix, I'll add this to the uploaded UI as soon as it makes sense to bother the mods again with my folly.</div></div><hr />

I really like this feature as long as ppl make them transparent like you did for you spell bar.<br />
<br />
Also if it's not to hard if you have time can you make a pet window that's not tabbed?  buttons and buffs on same screen and somewhat smallish.  I like the Fang pet window cause it's got everything in site without switching pages.<br />
<br />
I like everything else!  Good Job!</div></div><hr />

I like the idea of having no edges on windows.  I think I might play around with it some.<br />

If it's possible, maybe on next version make it so you can click on a spell name to cast.<br />

That would probably fall outside of what I'm willing to change about the UI... it would require redoing all the graphics files, and making adjustments to several things in many of the xml files. <br />
If someone else wants to create a version with no borders... by all means, go for it. :D<br />
<br />
Tom007, when you talk about making the hp number thicker, which target window and player window are you talking about? The default?<br />

If you want to see your total mana pool either use the /loadskin command which now allows quick switching without losing your window placements ... or just delete the EQUI_Inventory file from your UI folder.  It shows the mana on the default inventory window and you shouldn't notice a big difference in UI.<br />

I'll also update and incorprate as add in options the extra or dedicated files Fozz and Elmy added to the UI, as well as a no frills target window,  in a separate folder contained in the UI. <br />
<br />
I'm not good with Paintshop and TGA files so the graphics will be whatever is currently included in the UI but I can definitely put in all the new features and get (and keep) the XML codes up to date.<br />
<br />
I've a RL committment to attend to today and a mandatory raid tonight but this week doesn't look too bad at work, so I'll try and have something posted by mid week Lookfor an Infiniti Redux version around Wednesday or so.</div></div><hr />

Hi everyone!<br />
<br />
Yelara, thanks for keeping the UI alive... I think there are a few people who really enjoy it. ;)<br />
<br />
I noticed in the screenshot of your latest upload that the window selector bar is showing empty space at the bottom. I fixed the size issue back in January, I thought, but I don't think McKenna ever added that little change. Just check my window selector bar xml file (from fozzinfinity 1.6) to get the correct Y-size to get rid of that empty space.<br />
<br />
I'm sorta back (the beta didn't go overly well), so if there are any requests or questions I can help out with, feel free. :D</div></div><hr />

Is there anyway to bring back the horizontal hot keys, long target bar, spell gems with the names next to them, and buffs with names below them that run along the top of the screen?  I know I am asking quite a bit here but would be eternally greatful to see if we could get this I know a lot of my friends still use it too this day and loved those features.  Can we pull these up and see what we get? :)</div></div><hr />

The only obvious thing I can think of is that &quot;target of my target&quot; bar... which wouldn't show in the long target window.<br />
<br />
Were you using the blue borders or the grey? I'll try loading some things up and see what I get.<br />
<br />
I never made a version of the buff box with labels below the spells... that must have been someone elses. I'm not sure why it wouldn't still work though.</div></div><hr />

Personally I would like to see an update to the gray version og your excellent UI - but only an update, not any additions or too big changes ... but again, it is your UI, so ... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That... I can probably do. ;)<br />
<br />
Might take a little while, though.<br />
<br />
And, some dancing bananas for good measure... :nana:  :nana:</div></div><hr />

Found the buffs I was looiking for as well - thought you had made those sorry :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
just a few things i have noticed:<br />
<br />
- the Augmentation window dont work as it should<br />
<br />
I tried to remove an augmentation... normaly when you put the item and the solvent into the augmentation window you should get a button with which you can remove the augment, but there is no button. you can choose the augment from the list but you can not remove it (works only when i change to default UI)<br />
<br />
- ToTH<br />
<br />
Targetoftargetwindow missing... or i am just blind :p<br />
<br />
- Large meele target window<br />
<br />
when i copy the files of this mod and try to load the UI, Everquest crash... dont know if its a problem with my pc or the UI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... I'll try to figure out the augment window.<br />
<br />
As for Target of Target... I don't have any leadership points, and I don't belong to a guild. I'll see if I can figure a way to test it anyway.<br />
<br />
I'll check out the melee target window. I thought I tested it... but maybe I screwed something up.<br />
<br />
Hi ho Hi ho...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just uploaded version 1.8.<br />
<br />
This version includes a fix for the container window (the augment window should work as advertised now). I also added a fixed-up target of target window... it now matches the rest of the visible UI better.<br />
<br />
DarkFather,<br />
The target of target window may not be showing when you bring it up because it is off screen. If you are using 1024x768, that is probably the issue. If you try it with version 1.8 and you still can't see the target's target window when you bring it up, log out and look for a file in your everquest folder called UI_(your charactername)_(your server).ini<br />
<br />
Open up that file, scroll all the way to the bottom, and you should see the entries for TargetOfTargetWindow. Set the Xposition and Yposition numbers to like 500, 500. This should hopefully do the trick.<br />
<br />
As for the melee target window... I tested it again, and it works fine. It must be a glitch with your computer. Try it again and see if you crash. Make sure you don't reload the UI too many times... that will crash anyone's computer.</div></div><hr />

Since I discovered it I'm changing all my chars UI to this one, and have made slight adjustments to it to make it more suit my needs. It's very well written and friendly to customize. I know it's based on Infinity, but your version works well for me at 1024X768 .<br />
 Kudos, and keep up the good work !</div></div><hr />
