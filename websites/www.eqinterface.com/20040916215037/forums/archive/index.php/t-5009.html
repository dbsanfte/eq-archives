Hacked the heck out of it, but they say the biggest flattery is copying someone's work and making it your own.<br />
<br />
Waiting on the mod to be approved and will update with link to the skin and directions on making a viewport 1280 x 1024 cinematic interface.<br />

Screenshot Graphics is low quality just to save space.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There should be a file called Sona_Filler_Blank.tga.  This is the No-Character File.  Open that file and save it as Sona_Filler.tga and the DE will disappear on the next load.  OR, Open Sona_Filler_Blank.tga in a Paint Prog and take a copy of YOUR Char and paste it onto the file (Resize to fit the current image. Do not resize the Filler File.)  Once you have got your toon on the filler_blank, save the filer_blank as Sona_Filler.tga (not _blank) then it will import the next time you load.<br />
<br />
(I wil recheck the zip, just to make sure I didn't upload an un-blank Sona_Filler_Blank)<br />
<br />
And thanx for the nice feedback! )<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
Oh...and the file that has the toonPic is not an actual inventory window it is the player window with inventory aspects. The inventory piece is all Thangor's and I haven't/don't expect to touch it. Do a search for Thangor and you'll get his thread for his 'melee eye-candy'  <br />
<br />
I'm hoping he'll hear about the character insert file and incorporate it into his inventory window too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldfish_iota</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok..<br />
<br />
  now which files for just the inventory... i could get nothing to load..   i even tried to load the whole package and no luck..<br />
<br />
but i did try the inventiory file single, and the inventoyr/animation files together...  with all the other supporting files too..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotta do this, cuz I see that my Player Window with Inventory aspects is causing confustication....<br />
<br />
The inventory window is not included in my mod, cuz it is Thangor's Modification.  All my player window aspects were stolen from him.<br />
<br />
So to get the inventory window in its glory, go here....<br />
    http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2943&amp;highlight=Thangor<br />
<br />
If enough people want me to mod the player window into an alternate Thangor Inventory, then I suppose I will consider it, but I really don't think I can do any better than what he has already provided. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldfish_iota</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye... i am using his.. but yours was a more compact version.. i would love to have the one you modified...<br />
<br />
 &lt;  i tried for 3 hours to pick it appart.. &gt;<br />
<br />
Davidd<br />
<br />
edit: <br />
<br />
   OH... thats a player window too!!!   now i understand why it was not working...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">12-26-2002, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inventory Mod should be uploaded to Inventory Section soon. Here is a preview.  All credit goes to Thangor whose work I simply sliced and diced.<br />
<br />
Spellbook v2 is also being uploaded.<br />
<br />
Oh...yeah...after doing the char insert, put a sharpen buff on the pic...It'll look a lot better.</div></div><hr />
