Also, before the new UI if you had say 12 celestial essences and you wanted to add one more to the stack you just picked up the one you wanted to add and clicked the other stack to add it.  Now, if you do that you end up picking up the entire stack that you were trying to add the one item to.  Is that a bug or intentional?  And most importantly, can it be fixed back to the old way in the xml files?</div></div><hr />

I suppose it could be a benefit as opposed to a bug, but... it's annoying, he he</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, you should be able to turn off tooltips in the main options menu. Just look around for it. I can't think of any reason why they'd have removed that option in the new ui, it should be there. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ortrillian</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks but it's not there.  Checked all the options stuff.  Also, tried to just delete any tooltips references in xml files but that didn't work either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melosa</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, picking up that entire stack is annoying beyond belief. However, my guess is that they did that so that we'll see how &quot;useful&quot; the auto-equip section is. Since I'm a compulsive forager, I've already figured that handy addition out, but, like you said, when you're doing trades, you've already got everything opened, why can't ya just put it back? I don't know if it's a bug, or just one of those little oddities that we'll eventually get used to. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ortrillian</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, well the auto equip is what I will have to use I guess.  I don't want to switch back and forth with the default skin and my tweeked one.<br />

Now what about those Tooltips?  There has to be a way to get rid of them. One of you that knows what you are doing..Please Please Please..try to figure it out. I'll give you candy.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
