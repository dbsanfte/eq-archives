<br />
Drakah had a point...hard to get the info needed in a 1024 format, sooo, compressing the TK spells area to accomodate all 8 slots, not sure of what to do with the spell button yet, possibly intermixed with the labels. /ponder<br />
<br />
Focusing on dev for Ranger and Cleric at this point, could throw a pure melee up in no time am sure as spells not an issue.<br />
<br />
Anyone have some thoughts? Suggestions? Improvements? Am I full of orc dung? Throw a comment up. Thx.<br />
<br />
Upcoming adds: 1) do away with arcane spell cast window-incorporate with target window instead, 2) possibly reducing size of hotbutton window to allow more room on right hand side chat area (plus to bring it's text input line into view =p), et. al. as it gets tweaked.<br />

Shrunk the spell gems to about as small as they'll get (using Aya's gem window TY)  Rest of the stuff all from Drakah's work, thank you Drakah.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this is only a 1024 version of Drakah's very nice 1280x1024 screen.<br />
<br />
You all think its ready for Beta?<br />
<br />
Gimme some thoughts....<br />

Bazaar window might get changed before upload, not sure what others have for that yet, but the canned one is, well, lacking =D.</div></div><hr />
