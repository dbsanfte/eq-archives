All it shows is a pic of some icon stuff. What do I do with this? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you do have a custom window_pieces01.tga file, you need to use a graphics editor (PhotoShop, PaintShopPro, Gimp, etc) to compare your custom one to the one in the default directory and make any applicable changes (or have someone else do said for you).</div></div><hr />

Basically, open them both in whatever program you use and look at them side by side.</div></div><hr />
