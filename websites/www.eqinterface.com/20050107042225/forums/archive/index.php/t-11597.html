I'm like a dog with a bone sometimes, times like this. I've gotten three hours sleep in almost 24, lol. ALL BECAUSE OF UI'S!! <br />
Simple truth is that I like STYLE with LOTS of room. I play on a laptop and need that playing room, but I hate dull! So, I spent a few hours looking over the full UI's, too this or too that. However, I HAVE found several mix and matches I want to try. I've got 8 toons on 2 servers and want to do them all. Differently. I filled up a folder for each of my toons with one thing from each category if I thought I needed it. I've gone through and done allllll the things on the help me (READ THIS FIRST) postings. I've deleted all of the musicplayerwmd files (I can't hear it anyway /shrug). So, I'm off to check if it worked THIS time. <br />
After reading this, please be thinkin of answers to help me out, I just know somethin isn't gonna work. Like that dang tradeskill mod I want so badly in my story window! GRRRR<br />
Thanks. =)</div></div><hr />

I must ask though what did you name the folder which you put the files in?  ..  The code is looking for files in &quot;bard&quot; ..  if you named the folder &quot;bard UI&quot; (or whatever) with a space then that is why it's not loading..  it can't find the directory it thinks it's looking for so it loads the default for everything..  remove the space or rename it without a space.. should work fine then.. <br />
<br />
If that's not your problem not sure what's going on</div></div><hr />

<br />
This directory either does not exist. Has nothing in it or your files are in a subdirectory.<br />
<br />
Do not make your folder in default. Make sure all your modded and only your modded files are in your /bard directory. <br />
<br />
That UIerrors.txt has no &quot;errors&quot; only &quot;warnings&quot;. The warnings just tell you that EQ was unable to find the file in the directory you asked EQ to look in. By the number of files listed it found no files at all in your bard folder.<br />

PS. get some sleep youll think better~</div></div><hr />

Only the Ubisoft EQ boxes and maybe the newer ones put it under a \Sony\ directory</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kyndriana</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RAAARRRR! I hit something on my laptop, which I've done at least 100 times, but I type so fast that I've already gotten way past where my fingers where when I realize my screen is blank. It was getting too long anyway. Lemme summarize, lol. Yes, I know exactly where and how to put/install UI's. I've installed several and now have 8 more folders in there with FULL UI's AND partials. Like the dang tradeskill mod that I cannot seem to get installed no matter WHERE I put it. In each folder, there is a full UI, a picture that I like that's supposed to go into the inventory screen, an inventory screen picked out for that toon, spell gems for that toon, a single MOD map, a file called &quot;everytrader&quot;, a file called &quot;EQUI Bigbank&quot;, &quot;minigive&quot;, &quot;noscroll trader window&quot;, &quot;onering&quot; and &quot;tradeskillcontainermod&quot; and &quot;TradeskillAll-In-One_v2.0alpha. I'm sure I could just install the UI and be done with it, which I'll prolly re install Steamworks for the time being, but I want all of these little mods to overwrite the parts in the UI so that I'll have a full UI (which won't come up, it's confused!). HOW?? Should I just trash the full UI? Then what? I learned HTML (dog with a bone again) in 4 days well enough to write and upload the company website. Granted, it was being tweaked about every other day, but there was so much info out there. Where is the info about these? Are there any XML/mod tutorials out there that I can't find? Please help. I'd rather hard code anyday. That or get an WYSIWYG. <br />
Bing, Bang, Boom! Problem IS, I have a full UI and 10 separate (at least, some toons have more) smaller mods. I cannot get anything to load because..welll, I dunno. I've put all of the files into their respective folders, etc. But, I'm almost positive that my problem is that I have a full UI and at least 10 small mods. Help me to overcome? <br />
Thanks!!<br />

Steps I took before this log occurred. I took ALL of the smaller mods out of the folder, leaving ONLY the UI. Started up EQ. Typed /load druid. I got nothing. GRRRR. Forget it, I'm going back to Steamworks till this is figured out. /load ste. Hmmmm, it looks kinda like steamworks but not...<br />
What have I done?? Someone please tell me. In your eqclient.ini file should there be, and if so, what, something referring to a loadskin? Same question for toon.ini. I specifically remember adding a line to my eqclient.ini that was written on one of the posts, in the READ HERE FIRST section. I added a line about loadskin. I then deleted it when I couldn't get anything to load. Should there be anything in either file regarding loadskin? I'm about to trash everything and start over. <br />
