<br />
Okay, final modifications included:<br />
<br />
Added spacers to the location guide<br />
Alphabatized all lists<br />
Added a few comments<br />
<br />
This project was a bear, it was mostly all text entry, and then getting the spacing decked out, here's some shots of it...<br />
<br />
http://www.personal.psu.edu/pht101/images/location1.GIF http://www.personal.psu.edu/pht101/images/location2.GIF <br />
<br />
This list containts a massive ammount of zone in/out locations, as well as some portal spots and very very little mob locations.<br />
<br />
I wasn't sure if I should release this in beta or not, since I'll prolly add more locations, and fix any wierd typo's that I happened to miss as time permits.  If the mods feel that's enough to warrant a beta release then please move this ) <br />
<br />
This goes into the pet window.<br />

<br />
One request tho if you could...<br />
<br />
abscond/succor point locations would be great too...let us know if a certain zone is safe to use abscond instead of evac to another zone.<br />
<br />
One other thing i would like to ask, once ya put this out is it changeable? <br />
<br />
as in, could I change what you have as far as text? so I could not only add my own locs that I use in, but also it seems it would work for tradeskills..a whole other thread there...<br />
<br />
would be great to have this one up normaly, then just /loadskin &lt;skills&gt; and have the pet window change from locations to skills...then change back when done with skills.<br />
<br />
right now they are discussing the help window for skills...I wonder if they could do like you did and use pet window...<br />
<br />
anyhow..great job!!<br />
<br />

<br />
:nana: <br />
<br />
<br />
The locations *are* changeable, you just have to mess around with them.  To get around using a ton of labels, I made one lable, then made use of the WordWrap feature.  This saved about 100k worth of characters.<br />
<br />
I do intend to add more abscond points as I go!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just have one question (Don't I always?) I'm  a shaman and as such I was getting used to using the pet window. Kinda hate to lose it if I don't have to. Is there any way the mod can be moved to the Friends window? <br />
<br />
I thought I read somewhere that people were using the friends window for some mods. I tired playing wiht it last night but all I did was crash my interface or see absolutely no change. <br />
<br />
Can you give me a clue where to start to move it over? If it's even possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen code posted for putting tabs in Help, Chat, and Action, and I know you can do it in a few others.  There's only a few where you can't.  Do a search for the thread to find where this was discussed at length (titled &quot;Tabs within tabs?&quot; or something like that).</div></div><hr />

<br />
made a back up copy and tried to add in abscond locs. only changed the text area but that made it crash...  :mad: <br />
<br />
any hints on how i could add to what you have done such a great job on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lythander</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Text fields are...sketchy... the problem is you can only have so many characters per text field then you have to add a new lable, so that could be your problem.  If you're okay with the coding, adding a new lable isn't too tricky, then just divide the text among them... Or if you want post all the abscond locs here and I'll add them to v1.1</div></div><hr />

A few are missing, but most are good (and a few, like WK, were recently corrected).<br />
<br />
As someone requested earlier, I have a mod which uses my pet window for all my player information.  If this could be done in another window (friends being a great example) it would truly rock and be very useful for pet classes too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's one but though... I'm using Quartz and the pet-window's skinned along with most of the rest of the windows..<br />
<br />
Is there any way you could transport this whole thing to the Help window? Hardly anyone ever uses it, and as far as I know it shouldn't be too hard to move it from one window to another. (not that I'd know from experience though :))<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LordValance</div><div class="date">09-02-2002, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a little playing tonight, and this is what I came up with - a new tab for Lythander's excellent loc guide.  I made the Pet tab the default tab, as well as making it a garish red to make it easier to stab at when you're panicked by your pet smacking down the nearest red creature while you're trying to find your way out of the zone... :)<br />
<br />
There are no updates to the locs within, just a new tab.  I included a resizable version for those who don't like the rather large chunk of real estate the window normally covers.  WARNING: The one time I resized the window very large, EQ crashed to the desktop, so be careful how far you open it up.  Someone might wish to see if it affects them the same way.<br />
<br />
This was really not horribly hard to do, and only took me 45 minutes - and that was mostly figuring out XML.  (I'd never used XML before the new UI, but my L337 c0d1ng 5k1llz are formidable.)<br />
<br />
^<br />

<br />
BTW - SidlWidl rocks for helping to see what a window will look like without having to boot EQ.  It's a truly useful tool for doing stuff like this!<br />

Thanks for doing thee mod. I loaded it up in my Vert 1.1 Modded UI and it works great. Vert 2 doesn't like it at all tho.<br />
<br />
I had the same problem with the resize. When it got to almost no scroll length it crashed to deasktop. <br />
<br />
If I can get the time later I'll try and add the extra /locs (the abscond/succor points and added zones etc that have been posted here). If I can get it to work I'll post the mod here.<br />
<br />
Great fix for us pet casters. Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

I'll be uploading it to the Misc section for download as soon as I can.<br />
<br />
The SS shows it with my modified Vert 2.2 scheme.<br />
<br />
I still haven't been able to get around the vertical resize/crash issue, so I took out the ability to resize the window.  If anyone else has any idea why that happens please let me know :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atheenath Dawns</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The crashing to desktop comes with the size of the label text that has to be displayed on the screen. Dont ask me why, but that really is what is happening, If labels are containing too many characters of text, it crashes.  For that same reason, it will not work on the friends window for example, because the friends list text lenght in itself causes it to crash to desktop. I have also been working on on a loc mod for some time (sorry lyth :), and the only way I found to avoid that crashing problem, is making specific labels for every information, and yes its a huge work, there are about 1800 labels :P). So far working on the group, target, pet and action windows.<br />
<br />
I had huge hard drive space issues this week, and am expecting a brand new HD baby on Monday, so expect previews on tuesday, after I can properly test it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To get around the crashing I just turned off the resizing in the XML. Its perfectly readable without having to scroll horizontally and vertical scrolling really isn't that much of a hardship. The mod I use already uses the pet, actions, friends and window selector windows for other dedicated purposes. I really wasn't willing to give up those for the Loc Guide when there's a perfectly useless help window just sitting there :P<br />
<br />
I for one prefer the smaller window anyway.</div></div><hr />

i myself have a list of locations on a pad of paper, that i would love to do without, and see them on screen.<br />
<br />
maybe a text entry box, for adding new locations on the fly in game?<br />

that might be a little bit out there but doable maybe? :confused:</div></div><hr />
