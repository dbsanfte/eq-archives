<br />
Roger Sewell is looking for any feedback from those who are using the ATI Card that previously had issues. You can post feedback to him Here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=62315) on his post in the SOE Corner<br />
<br />
and HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO EVERYONE, from everyone here at EQInterface.com!<br />

I was even staring at the wall in the POK (not bank side) and it locked up.  It was even so bad that my computer crashed with a message about the video card not being able to re-draw.  Oh, turning off the 3D rings didn't help either.  Any ideas for a fix?</div></div><hr />
