<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khitajrah</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you all have heard a ton of this but I've tried everything and can't seem to get the target rings to work on one of my computers.  I've even gone to the extreme of copying the UI files directly from the computer it works on to the one it doesn't.  Even if I load the UI Default on this computer the target ring doesn't work.  The target box will light up but the ring won't work.<br />
<br />
Is there something in the Character UI file that is turned off that I can't find that would effect this?<br />
<br />
And yes I've tried all the fixes of loading the default UI and turning it on, camping to desktop, logging back in and loading the custom UI.  I've also deleted the UI Option window and loaded it from scratch.  Both computers and characters use the same UI so the only thing I can figure is there is something in the specific character UI file that I'm not seeing that has this option off.<br />
<br />
At this point I'm frustrated and ready to toss the computer out the window.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help :)<br />

Edit:  And yes I've checked for available patches and patched the UI.</div></div><hr />

I got it fixed.  It was the TNL=True option in the EQClient.ini file.  This is definitely bugged on thier end as this option was showing turned on in game and was clicking on and off but not saving the changes.<br />

Using 9600 pro.  I heard there is a specific problem for the 9600 series for those that have it and have tried everything but had no luck.  Anyone gotten it to work w/ 9600 pro by Raedan.  What drivers where you using.. Can you post?  Working on my pos laptop just great..just not my eq box:(</div></div><hr />
