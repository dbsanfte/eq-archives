I just posted my first public mod to the downloads section... don't know when it will be released in there, but I thought you folks might want to see a preview. This pic shows the spellbook (what I released), a beta-spellbar, and a beta compass. Let me know what you think of my work.</div></div><hr />

Your setup of both the spellbook is very expertly done, and pretty! I hope you are planning to do more? As a cleric, the skull isn't the best for my tastes. Perhaps a waterfall, or something? I don't know, you're obviously talented enough to come up with something! Excellent job!</div></div><hr />

Do we have any chance to see a Complete set ?  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been considering doing a complete interface conversion. The main problem I have is that I play the game at 1600x1200... So a very specific complete conversion would need to be made for lower res then I personally use. I suppose it would help to know what the most typical resolution people play at.<br />
<br />
As I've said, I've considered doing a complete re-vamp of it for quite a while. Maybe I can come up with something that is pretty universal for any resolution. Time will tell and your feedback helps a lot.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the encouragement. It's good to know my work is appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Screw lower resolutions! I play at 1600 and wouldn't go back for anything. Although it seems that 93% of the population prefers lower resolutions (cause their rigs suxor, me bets..or they want to be able to keep their eyesight by the time they're twenty...), i'd love to see what you've got now. Whatever you chose, i'm sure it'll be a good mod ^.^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm terribly sorry... but my original code had some problems in it. I've released a newer version of it. Nothing that would cause crashes or anything. But it was just annoying the crap out of me. <br />
<br />
Here's what happened:<br />
<br />
I had used a hacked up version of Remelio's code when I created my spellbook. I'm a graphics guy first and a coder second and was trying to take a bit of a shortcut. After releasing the mod I started to notice there was something wrong with the graphics of the mod in game. Other people might not have noticed it, but I certainly did. The game was squishing my graphics. I figured out why...<br />
<br />
Aparently the game only really likes to work with images that are 256x256. It may be able to work with others, but I noticed that using any other size of image the game would do strange things to the graphics (leave spaces, or squish them). Because I had used Remelio's code, I was suffering from the squished graphics (gave my skull a pointy looking head).<br />
<br />
I also noted that the size of the area for the spell names was too small... long spell names were getting cut off a little. So I re-worked that as well... Shouldn't be a problem anymore. I'm really sorry to those of you who already downloaded my mod. Please look for the updated version to show up in the downloads section. One other thing I changed is the edges of the paper in the corner... my first version didn't have a good enough 3d effect. So I fixed that. I also added a nice alpha blended drop shadow to the book itself, hopefully making it look like it stands out from the background a bit. Anyway... here's a screenshot of the updated version. You can compare it to the original screenshot to see what I mean.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

I actually prefer this one over t.king's necro book, which I think looks kind of.. I don't know.. Not as powerfull as this one, at least. <br />
<br />
Good work. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramsus</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game works well with graphics that are 256 based ^2. <br />
<br />
256x256<br />
512x512<br />
1024x1024<br />
2048x2048<br />
<br />
If you stick with 256 you will be fine, but just wanted to let you know you did have other options.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should avoid using textures that are over 256x256 because some video cards can't take textures that are larger. That's why the default UI textures are broken up into 256x256 and smaller TGAs. I myself use textures which have dimensions which are a pwoer of 2. 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 64x128, etc.<br />
<br />
I have never had and problems with EQ squishing or stretching any of my graphics as long as I correctly specify sizes in the XML files.<br />

Click here to go to the page to download this spellbook (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=135) <br />
<br />
I got some new ideas for a spellbook I am most likely going to start building soon. For some reason I find making UI mods more fun that grinding exp as a 56 warrior these days. :)</div></div><hr />
