<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 12:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally decided to update to get rid of the xml compatability errors and release this UI.<br />
It actually survived and worked flawlessly through the last 6 months of patches, without a single modification...<br />
<br />
View it by clicking here. (http://home.comcast.net/~mbeiser/Images/Caleal2beta.JPG)<br />
<br />
<br />
Download it here. (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2437) <br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
A very &quot;patch resistant&quot; UI designed for 1280x1024 resolution with a /viewport 0 0 1143 840 setting. <br />
<br />
Fully compatable with the default EQUI_Animations.xml file. If there is a patch that changes that file, just delete the custom one and your ready to play!<br />
<br />
The zip file contains instalation instructions and a copy of a .ini file that can be used to insure the windows line up correctly.<br />
<br />
The UI is primarily designed to be mouse user friendly, and for any class.<br />
<br />
The hotbutton window has a tabbed section that gives full access to all inventory and armor locations.<br />
<br />
The group window has large clickable areas for targeting self and group members. A pet lifebar will pop up under its owners lifebar if a group member summons a pet. The pet life bar is clickable to target the pet.<br />
<br />
The pet window is intended to stay up at all times as part of the UI. It has 3 tab pages. The stats page displays full character stats and resists. The Player page shows Exp and AA exp gauges and %, as well as % allocated to AA, unspent AA points, encumberance level and character name/class/level/title. The Pet page contains all the functions of the normal pet window.<br />
<br />
The buff and song windows are compact with small icons, buff names, custom icon backgrounds and numbered buff slots.<br />
<br />
The &quot;target&quot; bar is very long and has 10 sections to it. There is a casting gauge under the target lifebar that also has 10 sections to it. I find it usefull for heal timing.<br />
<br />
The &quot;target&quot; window is made from the player window, so it will have a flashing red outline around the target and casting gauges when attack is on. There is also a 60 second timer as part of the window.<br />
<br />
The inventory window is very compact and has no stats in it. The autoequip area is the class animation.<br />
<br />
Containers have the primary, secondary, ranged and ammo slots in them.<br />
<br />
<br />
The chat window contains the template for its custom borders, as well as the templates for the borders for all other windows in the UI. All custom graphics animations used in the UI are defined in the xml code for the chat window.<br />
<br />
The UI is fully compatable with the default EQUI_Animations.xml file. The custom one included with the UI is for the custom buff icon backgrounds. If a patch makes changes to the EQUI_Animations.xml file, you can just delete the custom one and the game will use the default backgrounds.<br />
<br />
The modified xml files are:<br />
EQUI_Animations.xml (only modified to use custom buff icon backgrounds, delete if it is patched)<br />
EQUI_BuffWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_CastingWindow.xml (reduced to size 0 0 so it is never visible)<br />
EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_ChatWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_CompassWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_Container.xml<br />
EQUI_GroupWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_Inventory.xml<br />
EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_SelectorWind.xml<br />
EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_TargetWindow.xml (reduced to size 0 0 so it is never visible.)<br />
<br />
Modified graphics files are:<br />
window_pieces01.tga <br />
window_pieces02.tga<br />
window_pieces03.tga<br />
window_pieces04.tga<br />
wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga<br />
wnd_bg_light_rock.tga<br />
scrollbar_gutter.tga<br />
<br />
Added graphics files are:<br />
Caleal1.png (custom borders, buttons and gauges)<br />
<br />
Custom graphics are adaptations of  Raxthorn, Vertebrea, Lunakin, and TKing graphics.<br />
<br />
This UI survived 6 months of patching and an expansion, with no updates, before I released it.</div></div><hr />

How do I get the player stats/pet window up without a pet?? I'm not using the UI_character_##.INI file that you supplied.  I've tried several things but no help.  So, I have to cast a pet to see my stats.  I'm sure that it is something simple that I'm missing.<br />
<br />
Again this is a great UI.  Keep up the supper job you are doing.<br />

Hit Alt+f1 to get the pet/stats window up if it is not showing up. Then in the options window somewhere, there is a &quot;pet popup&quot; button you can click off to keep the window from vanishing when your pet goes away.<br />
<br />
Jentraal:<br />
I'm a cleric, I use the timer for counting off seconds when I'm in heal chains, and other times when I need to count off a set pause between doing things.<br />
If enough people are anoyed by the timer, I can make an optional window without it.</div></div><hr />

I'm working on an update to remove the error, but I'm not sure the final product will include the display for pet buffs. There just isn't much room to work with unless I resize the window and all 3 tabs in the window.  =x</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there an updated version of this UI that has the new target info in it?<br />
<br />
I dont know if there is a new version that I am unaware of as I have been away for a few weeks so wasn't around at the update time and may have missed any posts on this subject. At the moment I cannot seem to get the target to work and was wondering if I need to down load one of the other target bits and add it to this UI if so is there one that someone already uses with this UI that they could tell me about as I have tried to mix a few other bits into it before but with no luck. <br />
I have no XML knowledge so any advice would be greatfully received.</div></div><hr />

I got rid of my custom pet window and am using the target window xml file for the stats and player info in my UI since I use the player window for the normal functions of the target window.<br />

The 3d targeting seems to be working fine in game with my UI.<br />

You can download the updated version in the Complete Sets section of the download area as soon as a moderator passes it through. Its listed under &quot;Fantasy&quot;</div></div><hr />

Is there anyway to make this fit 1024 x 768?  <br />
<br />
It will fit on the screen if you shrink the chat windows, but I made the hotbuttons and life gauges oversized for visibility/clickability at higher res, so it would be to large at 1024x768.<br />
<br />
My Caleal1.4 UI is designed for 1024x768. It is listed in the &quot;Functional&quot; catagory of the &quot;Complete Sets&quot; download section.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me first say that I am a huge fan of your UIs.  They're functional while still being very pleasing to the eye.  So thanks a million for the work that you've put in on these UIs.  I started in 1.4 and converted over to 2, including changing my res to match the intended screen sizes.<br />
<br />
That being said, are you planning to make a combat discpline window that fits into your UI?  Possibly (just a suggestion) utilizing the &quot;extra space&quot; where you have &quot;Park Timers Here&quot; in the current setup?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think Caleal's ui needs a update after patch 10th feb.<br />
<br />
Both 1.4 and 2.0</div></div><hr />

<br />
I moved the mana percent slightly to the left, adding numbers on the mana bar itself: It's not the best eye candy sight, but it's functional for now.<br />
<br />
I'll try to move them around in a better place as I have a bit of free time to spare.</div></div><hr />

Your UI is basicly the only one I have found that dose what I am looking for in a UI. Mainly letting me line up the Casting, Group, and Hot Buttons in a tight lil group.<br />
<br />
However, there was one request I would like to ask. Is it posible to squeez a inch more out of it to add the numbers for Mana and such in it. I prefer to use the 1024X768 Ver of your UI, but would go to the 1280X1024 Ver if I had too.<br />
<br />
One more question/sugestion. After a large period of inactivity, I have come back to EQ. After several HD cleanings and a wipe, I lost my EQ Directory. So, I logged in under the Default and found that Any buff that is active on you now has a ETA for drop. Can this be used as a timer in some way? Just a sugestion.....</div></div><hr />

(thttp://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=14385) Was simple and easy.<br />
<br />
I replaced the HP numbers in the tabbed player window with mana numbers in this UI. Mana isn't as much of a concern so having it there works out well enough. To do this, open your Caleal UI folder, open your EQUI_TargetWindow  window with notepad (in Caleal UI the EQUI_TargetWindow file is the tabbed player window, don't ask me why).<br />
Click the Edit button at top and use Find feature. (or use control+f) Find &lt;EQType&gt;70. Replace the 70 with 128. Save. That's it. The 70 stands for current/max hp, the 128 for current/max mana.</div></div><hr />

I have been a faithful Caleal user for 2 years, moving from Caleal 1 to Caleal 2 when it was released.  I have put up with changing to default every time I want to use an augment sealer, and painfully pieced together my own hybrid combat ability window, while also using the default pet window.<br />
<br />
Even in the first weeks of OOW's release, I did without an upgrade until today when I purchased my 9th spell gem.  There's just no more ignoring it, this UI needs to be resurrected.<br />
<br />
This will be my first major project on UIs, and any and all help would be appreciated.  I just can't bear using any other UI, so I'd rather teach myself the down and dirties of XML than give up my beloved Caleal's.

Even modifying the current UI I cannot think of a way to place it to fit properly. Since I do not use the window selector I was thinking of having an L shaped spell bar so the 9th gem + spell book are curved over at the bottom. Making each spell gem smaller would probably work also, but that would look bad imo. I still use this UI, modified of course, and love the basic nature of it. No extra cutesy crap around the windows makes for a nice looking UI.</div></div><hr />
