You can only have one set installed at a time. If you want to switch between skin sets for different things in game , you need to reload the skin's at that time. If you want bits and pieces of several skin sets, you need to mix and match them into one folder. Be aware some 'skin sets' will not mix and match. you need to be sure each window is a stand alone version in order to sucsessfully mix and match. <br />
<br />
All of the windows you want to use have to be in the same folder for them to load. Not seperate folders for each window.<br />
<br />
Skin= set of custom UI windows</div></div><hr />

Have you tried reading the FAQ??  I have a feeling that would solve your problem.</div></div><hr />
