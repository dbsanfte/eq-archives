<br />
What do clerics get asked all day long? Time after time untill they just volunteer the info every 5 seconds? MANA CHECK!.<br />
<br />
Mana check is all I really need from my player window. I don't need to see a whole bunch of other stuff. Don't need stamina, don't need exp/aa, don't need percent on health, don't need anything confusing or cumbersome to pick through for my mana check. I need...<br />
<br />
Health Bar &lt;no percent next to it&gt;<br />
Mana Bar &lt;No percent nect to it&gt;<br />
...<br />
and under them both I need a BIG nice and obvious mana percent. Why not one as long as the mana bar itself when reading 100?<br />
<br />
Is that possible? I don't know if you are able to make a number that large or put it under the mana bar rather than beside it. If you don't know then here's a developer's chance to figure out something new - Challenge Yourself!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a preview of what im working on now. Once i get some stupid texturing problems solved, i'd like to release it soon.<br />
<br />
Spell gems, easy to read gauge, cool buff windows. etc. i'm currently trying to skin everything. gonna take a while.<br />
<br />
I'm in favor of alot of yur ideas..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorthis</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice! I like it. Make sure you read the post I made a few minutes ago about the group health bars. Maybe that would be something you might want to implement with your new interface? Anyway, please do post a link to your skin when it's completed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vertebrae</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, i like your idea of doubling the length of the bars, including the group windows. This is not a problem. However, i have a bad feeling this might affect all gauges. i could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Johrena</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vert, I really like what you have right now...  I like the little marks in the last bubble... great idea.  The spell icon is the best I have seen out so far.  I hope you do not change much from what you have in that little snip that you showed us.<br />
<br />
Speaking as a cleric, I think it would be nice to have the casting gauge in my player window.  If I cast a cheal and it's going to be close I keep looking at the gauge to the target box to the gauge... since I keep my target box near my 'player box' it would come in VERY handy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing that go live.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scratches</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about and I don't know if this is possible with this info coming from another whole char but let the melees see what mana each caster has (like beside their name) that way we won't have to bug you.  <br />
<br />
Course we wouldn't have to ask MC if you would just tell us instead of us pulling and then finding out you are LOM or OOM and you are our only life source as we can't gate the heck out like some can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Johrena</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">... but I think there is a thread about how that can't be done.  I could be wrong... but I don't think other players can see our mana.</div></div><hr />
