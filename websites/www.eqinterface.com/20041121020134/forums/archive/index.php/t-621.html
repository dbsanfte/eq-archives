<br />
Am I the only one who have experienced that, when you define a new tga file as a texture , reloading the skin isn't always enough , I have to log all the way out and back in to check my new changes out.<br />
<br />
bugs me alot ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinuvian</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You mean you are editing your .xml and .tga files while playing Everquest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadman</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I create a test directory for skins and load them via a second computer. Then just /loadskin to test them. Saves a ton of relog time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's very well possiable. On any system. Even on just one system, if you have a powerful enough system. ha ..<br />
<br />
And with the Caching thing. EQ's caching engine is totally screwed up, imo. It might be a bug with that.<br />
<br />
Do you have Texture Cache turned on? that could be a contributer as to why it's not working.<br />
Turning that all will increase your load times, but should help in refreshing all graphics ( including your UI ones ) when you zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tedar</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes I edit while playing , well not playing per se, actually just standing around and occationally hit my &quot;/loadskin myskin&quot; hotbutton once I've updated something :)<br />
<br />
yeah , I do have caching turned on. running on a athlon 1400 with 1gig of ram so memory isn't my bigest concern *grin* but I'll try turning it off for testing .. sounds like it would work. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh I wonder if I could test in the tutorial .. no waiting for network or delays of development if the servers are down .. I think I'll go test that right away.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
hmmm doesn't seem like the tutorial is running at all, gave me an error &quot;the procedure entry point _AIL_set_3D_sample_distances@20 could not be located in the dynamic link library mss32.dll&quot; , looks to me like they gave the tutorial the boot. ahh well either they give us tutorial back or a tool for offline testing .. either way they should give us neams of testing .. I can't even begin to imagine what testing must be like with only one computer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a 1.53 1.5 gig RAM system at home. I know the feeling. :D<br />
<br />
Right now I'm stuck on a 900mzh Laptop with maybe a 8meg Vid card and only 312 RAM. I'm hurting. I'm hurting hard! (With a Dial-up none the less, too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dregor</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my guess would be that EQ loads all the needed graphics into memory when it first boots up. the /loadskin command most likely simply loads the new XML files... not checking to see if it needs to load any new graphics. so while the XML changes you made will take affect.. you wont see any changes to the TGA files you made... that would be my guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think dregor is right for tga loading : not sure, but EQ may load it between server selection screen and char selection screen (u know , when there is all the small things wrote on the bottom of pic ).<br />
<br />
<br />
and for tutorial , if i remember correctly , new UI is not implemented in it ...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
btw , don't cry about computer .; i have a p2 400 256 Mo ram 8Go HD.... and i play EQ with it .... yes , i really need a new computer :)</div></div><hr />
