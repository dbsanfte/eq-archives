<br />
I'm building a custom compass using some graphics from Daelig's UI. I modified the graphics file I wanted to use for it, built a border template to place the graphics around the compass window, but it just doesn't work.<br />
<br />
It generates no errors in the uierrors.txt file, and my UI runs fine, but the compass just isn't there when I put the files for it in my UI. Its totally blank where the compass window should be.<br />
<br />
I don't know if the problem is with my code for the window, or if it is a problem with the graphics file. It all displays PERFECTLY in SIDLWidl. =/<br />
<br />
Here is a link to the files. (http://home.attbi.com/~mbeiser/Files/Calealcompass.zip)<br />
<br />
If someone could take a look at the xml and the graphics file for it, and figure out what is wrong, I'll be forever in your debt.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok...being that I'm at work, I can't check your graphics for problems; however, this sounds like a problem I just had 2 nights ago.  I believe it is a problem with your graphics files.  (search for the word &quot;alpha&quot; will give you more info on this)<br />
<br />
Here is what I found:<br />
<br />
When you create a graphics file for EQ to use, you have to specify an alpha channel on that graphic... The way I think of it is this -- if you want to see it in EQ, it has to be part of the alpha channel...if you want to see through it in EQ, it should not be part of the alpha channel!  That was the easiest for me.<br />
<br />
Now how to make an alpha channel:<br />
<br />
In Photoshop, select any part of the picture that you want to display in everquest (or pick what you don't want to display, then invert your selection ;)  )...next, on the selection menu item, choose to save your selection.  There should be an option there for the name of the save (default on mine was &quot;NEW&quot; with a pull down menu)  If you use the pull down menu, there should be an option call &quot;Alpha 1&quot; or something similar.  When you pick this name, I got 4 more options to choose:<br />
 - replace current<br />
 - add to current<br />
 - subtract from current<br />
 - (not sure what this was)<br />
<br />
You can choose to add to the current alpha channel and click OK.  Then just deselect everything and save you picture.  Then test!  That worked for me :p <br />
<br />
Hope this helped!<br />
<br />
EDIT:  just fixed up some mistakes I saw :)</div></div><hr />

I'm graphicly declined though, and umm, I use Paintshop Pro7, so no amount of explaining how to do it in photoshop will enlighten me.  =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already did that before I posted, followed your instructions to the best of my understanding.<br />
<br />
I have a good 24+ hours invested in getting this compass window to work. At this point, I just need someone to look at the files and tell me what is wrong.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
