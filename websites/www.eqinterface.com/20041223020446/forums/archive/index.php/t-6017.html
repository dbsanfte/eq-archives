<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canorne</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:D Someone, more like alot more than I expexted asked me if I spliced together any more Class type UIs. Most like the way I have it setup do to the placement that is not hard to get to on the screen. I can agree with that the fact that some do not like the bunched up and square look. I have been asked since I like T.king art to please express more of the excentricness and flavor instead of the square, plain, bunched togther at the bottom of the screen, and window3.0 look to some of the UIs. I personally have to admit that I am fond of the quarts UIs myself, but I would rather be more creative so that is why I go along with T.king. Anyways, here is the shaman UI that I have heh* spliced together it falls in the setup line along with the other UIs I have created in the past. The 3 chat windows at the bottom are explain as one for guild chat, one for group chat , and the main chat for melee and ect.:cool: I can be reached at this E-mail address.
