Also, none of the windows will display options when right clicking on the topbar.  I don't know what it is.  The problem persists even using the default UI.  I tried removing all mods and then removing the default folder to force eq to download new files.  Still no love.  Finally I tried removing the UI_Char_Name.ini and UI_Char_Name_Server_Name.ini files and the problem went away.  I'll look over them later to try and figure out what the problem was.  Hope this helps a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayhel</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The right clicking on the top of the chat bar say can be fixed by going into options and display there is an option which escapes me at the moment but just click on it and you will beable to right click your chatbar window again or any other to get the drop down options.  That was somehow reset in one of the patches is my guess.  <br />
<br />
I will try deleting the 2 files you mentioned and see if my problem clears up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As stated in the Vert patch, delete the file that has the name SKILLSWINDOW in it..<br />
<br />
Solaria doesn't use this file, but Vert had it included.. it is not longer modified.<br />
<br />
also make sure you patched AFTER we updated the patcher.. it will include a new animations file.<br />
<br />
if in doubt re-download patch and patch again. (can be found in download section)<br />
<br />
and the attack indicator is not a problem, it will still flashy like it use to.. in the next two weeks Sokol and I will be making a custom version and that error will go away too<br />
