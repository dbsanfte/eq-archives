Hi folks, just wanted to let everyone know that we are making some huge changes on the Test server today.<br />
The changes being made involve a new character file format, which means every aspect of an EverQuest character could be affected.<br />
Does anyone know any more about this &quot;new character file format&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Mostly, I am wondering what they are doing and how it might affect teh characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People gettting all their AA's wiped, levels being lost.  Zones crashing like mad.<br />
<br />
And best of all, entire characters being erased!  Wu wu!<br />
<br />
Don't expect this bad boy of a patch anytime soon ;)</div></div><hr />

When i dinged 3rd AA i Zone crashed to the desktop and i had to reboot to get back in.  When i got back in i was at 98% AA exp so i fought 3 mobs and re-dinged AA.  I went into my Alt Advancement and both of my Banked AA's were gone *poof* <br />
<br />
I petitioned at 3am to a guide stating that he would invegestagate this issue and that he needed to bring it up to a GM.  <br />
<br />
I got a response today from a GM stating that they have no record of my 2 AA points.  Needless to say i am very Bitter. <br />
<br />
Now i am 76% into re-dinging AA5.<br />
