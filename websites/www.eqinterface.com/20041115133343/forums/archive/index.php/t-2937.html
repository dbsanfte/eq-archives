<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Odaku</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, As a shammy I click cast from the spell gems.  No good mod has come out that has enlarged the actual icon..just the stupid placeholder.  Well I had enough of that and began to tweak some code around.  I suck at it but I discovered how to make the Icons bigger.<br />
<br />
1. I doubled the gemicons.tga files to be 512 x 512<br />
<br />
2. I edited in the eqanimations.xml file to make the icons be about 49 x 48 (couldnt quite get it)<br />
<br />
3. Edited my own little Spell Gem Bar to test it with..It only shows the BIG OLE icons and the place holder (when no spell equipped)<br />
<br />
I need someone with more xml experience to help with this I unlocked the door..now someone else needs to step in there and squish the mean ole spiders.  If i manage to make it all purty I'll repost.<br />
<br />
I couldnt get this dang forum to act right so I posted this on my old webpage.  Go to the link and click on the screenshot to download the zip file.  Just download the zip and replace all files you got with these. <br />
Test it out play with it and post your results.<br />
<br />
Download the 3 from here....<br />
http://www.geocities.com/lordjobu/<br />
<br />
If you guys like em I'll actually post in the download section :P<br />
(So post what you think or MOD my mods and post your screenies)<br />
<br />
<br />
Tking mod posted under spell gems....ALL my mods work with the new patch now btw.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go to my old page there and download any of the 3 mods for this spell bar.  There is no longer a background or a border on any of the downloadables though only the Tking Screenshot shows this...you can drag the spellbar around by clicking just under the last icon and moving around.  Enjoy...Tking is the best one imo.<br />
<br />
This is the Tking Screenie for those who haven't seen<br />

<br />
*grins* I'm a clickcaster too...but also a minimalist, I run with the tiny icons on the tiniest bar I can find in 1280 by 1024 :) ah well, to each his own</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Odaku</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the size scares people..but like i said it's just a test to make the spell icons big enought to enjoy....warcraft 3 icons...T King icons...need I go on? (Can't really cuz that's it)  I'd like for that test spell bar to eventually lose the border and bg so that I have a managed sized transparent spell bar.  I too am a minimalist but I would like to use some of the better spell icons on my uber high resolution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the original icons in &quot;big mode&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, yeah...sometimes it gets really hard to recognize t.king's spellgems on 1280x1024, and any higher it's just impossible :( I was scared by your use of the defaults at that size. They look like giant mutant growths on your screen =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Odaku</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Size of what appears on the screen is a direct result of 2 things....<br />
<br />
1. The animation file has a line that originally defines them as either 40 x 40 ...or 24 x 24...I forget which..but it describes the size of the first spell icon in the gemicons file.<br />
<br />
2. Increasing the size of the gemicons.tga files to a level that maintains the aspect ratio...in this one I increased it to 512 x 512 just for the heck of it.  <br />
<br />
I think that it must be the power of 2 rule that governs it.  But that's really all I did.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Screenies of how it looks with both Warcraft Icons and T King icons are up...because I'm illiterate with posting they are on 2 different posts.  I'll put em up for download if you guys want em.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if you simply magnified the original spellbar Icons set looks like ti tho.... here's the mission, should you choose to accept it...<br />
<br />
Locate the icon in the Spells01/02/03 file<br />
Copy and paste the correct icon into its slot in a NEW GemIcons.TGA.<br />
<br />
This way you retain the detail in the larger icons, rather than increasing the lost detail in the smaller ones...will make your Spell Bar Gems much more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Good work.  I often look at my spell bar and think I need to make a bigger box just so I can enjoy those Icons.  (Does the HotButton Bar use GemIcons or Spells##?) may need to make updates there as well....</div></div><hr />
