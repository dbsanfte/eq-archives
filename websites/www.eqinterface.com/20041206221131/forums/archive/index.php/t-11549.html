I may be logged in to the forums but not the site, or vice versa, and it seems to log me out after about 5 minutes. I do not see any kind of 'keep me logged in' box or option, nor has anything been brough to my attention about cookies... <br />
<br />
mostly I'm just confused. ^_^ and tired of typing my password fifty kazillion times, heh. Chances are it's something I have/not done, but I still can't find the problem. <br />
<br />
Thanks. <br />

see &quot;why does it keep asking me to login&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure what's up with my browser, I didn't change a thing and this time it asked me if I wanted to save the login/pwrd for this site, so I said 'yes' and will see if it works this time. <br />
<br />
sorry for the pester &gt;_&lt;<br />

<br />
Perhaps I have some option turned off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks.<br />

Oddly enough, I run vBulletin 2.3.3 for our guild forums and I stay logged on there.  I must have some odd setting going on at home.  I suspect I need to make a change to something in my zone alarm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Possible you enabled sessions for your account on your forum in your user options in the user cp so you dont need cookies. Or you configured your zone alarm to accept the cookie from your site.<br />
<br />
The reason it is there is becuase there have been about 4 people out of 150,000 that have had trouble logging into the forums. People normaly have logging in trouble when downloading interfaces.</div></div><hr />
