<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, with todays patch it seems that almost EVERY Mod has been broken.. before posting &quot;xxxx mod is not working&quot; look and see if someone has not already posted the same thread or even a fix. there are several topics for the different fixes. <br />
<br />
Also UIBuilder is offline temporarly.. Being that any mod it would create would not work.. and with everyone trying to make replacement UIs.. it was becoming a really bad loop..<br />
<br />
We have peaked with users online today at one point having 471 Users online at one time. our normal load is about 140-160 soo you will see some lag, but it will go back down over then next 12-24 hours as people find thier patches.. <br />
<br />
To Authors of Complete Sets:<br />
If you make the repairs to your mod, uploaded it with no picture and in the description tell me what file its updating. I will replace the current file on the server with the new one. Should speed up the updates.<br />
<br />
NOTE:<br />
I would expect a similar &quot;boom&quot; in members next Tuesday when Planes of Power is released. They are patching Monday night and it will envolve the UI at least a little (adding to AA for sure). So please be aware that this cycle may repeat itself next week.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your Patience<br />
