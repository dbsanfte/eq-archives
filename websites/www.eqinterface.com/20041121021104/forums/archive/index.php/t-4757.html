<br />
I'm trying to find a UI/MOD builder.. <br />
<br />
I have used Sidlwidl but it has way to many problems and the creator hasn't worked on it in over 4 months.<br />
<br />
I can't use vert's Builder as for some reason his sites down getting a 404 error on it.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to edit my own UI's, mods to look how i want them. You know certain things here , other stuff there.<br />
<br />
Eg. Have *I have on one alt UI already* the level of the character showen up in the player window on the far right side. So that you don't have to keep looking at your characters level by pressing *I* for inventory. Also, i like to add items, or equipment boxes to my hotbuttons, but can't do that because when i move *try to copy* from invendory box, to hotkey box, it removes the actual pictures from the inventory box, and i'm left with a empty spot where it should be. But it's been added to my hotkey's box. Just makes for a aweful presentation. How do you copy from one .xml like inventor.xml to another .xml without removing it from either one. Again, point being... *Put my level on my player window, without actually removing it from the inventory window where it normally is*. Currently i can't do it or it ends up at the top of the inventory window and i cannot change it's color, or hide it as it reflexs the *playerwindow.xml* where i wanted it to show up in the first place.<br />
<br />
So, any help on finding another good UI/MOD editor i would love the links, AND any helps on how you can copy so i don't delete or remove from a .xml file to add to another .xml file.<br />

Which can be done with SidlWidl, but I save often to avoid major losses. Pretty much I caught on to a lot of things through SidlWidl on the fields to edit</div></div><hr />

Moving a control from one window to a different window &quot;breaks&quot; the button since the different window isn't programmed to accept input from the button.<br />

SIDLWIDL is the best layout editor EQ skinning (never used it - I'm a notepad guy).  As far as I know its basically the ONLY one specifically for the EQ schema.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghostlancer</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In order to Add new things that SidlWidl doesn't edit I save the whole thing then crank up the file i wanan copy from and to in notepad, and Copy and paste, changing the ScreenID and name. It's crude but works since the sidlwidl doesnt have all the tags to add</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thulgar</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, if i just change the name and ScreenID i will have a separation from another .xml file ? IF this is incorrect, are you able to do a screen capture of what you mean, or given an example please.<br />
<br />
This thread can help those as well that need help in understanding how to change .xml files to better suite those that want a different look or such. <br />
<br />
Now you mention you edit in notepad, but in notepad what is it that you edit. I'm new to this language, and would like to know how it is that you are able to manipulate what you want showen or done in notepad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghostlancer</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't want to clutter up the board with pictures and such, but I can describe it (if you not familiar with using Notepad, stop reading, you not gonna get far)<br />
<br />
One good step to learning what to copy and paste is using something like SidlWidl that picks out the Tags, every buttong, number, guage etc has a tag. XML is Extremely similar to HTML, just different tags.<br />
<br />
As for seperation from XML files, not sure what you mean, Copying and pasting is one cheap way to get all the fields of the desired itemcopyied to a new window (Like Inventory slots on the Hotkeys window) Although as mentioned (and I forgot hehe) You cannot copy things like buttons and the Autoequip area.<br />
<br />
The name and screenID are both inside the XML file itself and defines it as a window (the name tag is actually the indicator, such as Button, InvSlot, or guage)<br />
<br />
It would help you immensly to open up an XML file with notepad (right click adn chose edit) from your default directory, or download one you think is interesting. There is just a lot to cover regarding the fields used and I hope there is a sticky post somewhere that points em out(I havent looked over all the boards yet)</div></div><hr />

<br />
to my knowledge tehre is still no &quot;great&quot; WYSIWYG editors yet. I am sure there will be one at some point.</div></div><hr />

Also, try checking out the AboutSidl.doc in uifiles/default. It's a good overview of how the interface works.</div></div><hr />
