<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dalarlightbring</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a UI that I just finished working on that I call RTUI. It was designed for 1024x768 screens but should work fine on any other resolutions.<br />
<br />
Some of you may notice some of the Vert and  Canopy windows/gauges design. I love them myself. The spellbook is from T. King and Remelio. The Help window has locations of all zones and the Actions window has the EQToolbox maps. <br />
<br />
I have changed the Pet window into the inventory/equipment window you will see in the top right of the screen. On the top left corner you will find all your resists,stats,HP,Mana,Exp,AAExp, ATK, and AC values.<br />
<br />
At the bottom left is the Hotkey window which has a built in group window with your own HP Gauge ( makes it easy to select yourself if you dont use F1). There is also the Primary/Secondary/Chest/Inv Slot 1 &amp; 2 built in for quick swapping items. <br />
<br />
The old Group window still contains the Invite/Disband buttons but more importantly it is now the Cast time window. (I nestle it close to the new combo hot button/group window.<br />
<br />
The Spellgem bar is place close to the combo window for ease of casting spells without taking up your precious hotkeys. (More room for macros and such without swapping pages). It also has a mana line gauge there so you can see how much mana you have without looking elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I have shrunken the Inventory screen since everything you normally need from there has been moved to a new window.<br />
<br />
http://randytam.home.att.net/Files/Main.jpg <br />
Here is a pic of the chat windows transparent with the main windows open.<br />
<br />
http://randytam.home.att.net/Files/Spellbook_Inv_Opened.jpg <br />
Most windows open including spellbook and mini Inventory.<br />
<br />
http://randytam.home.att.net/Files/New_Spell_Icons.jpg <br />
Here is a pic with the T.King Buff and Spell icons. These are optional.<br />
<br />
Download (http://randytam.home.att.net/Files/RTUI.exe)  my RTUI Everquest Skin.<br />
<br />
The file is a self extracting zip file that will install all files into the RTUI folder in the default Everquest directory.(C:/Program Files/Sony/Everquest Trilogy/uifiles/ ).<br />
<br />
Once done just log into EQ and type /load rtui to load up the UI and then rearrange the windows to the positions in the screenshot. I force the windows into locations based on a screen size of 1024x768 because of compatibilty issues.<br />
<br />
Download (http://randytam.home.att.net/Files/SpellIconPack.exe)  the T.King spell/buff icons.<br />
<br />
Also in a self-extracting zip file that will install to the above folder within my rtui skin folder. Just run it and play. It also comes with an unistall file in case you don't like the new graphics. Not always fun to re-learn the new spell icons. It might also be better to install the actual mod before this as I have not tested doing it backwards.<br />
<br />
Whew that was a lot. I hope it wasn't too long. I am not too good at wrting as you all may have guessed. My English isn't the best. <br />
<br />
Feel free to try it out and post any comments you may have. I would love to hear from you.<br />
<br />
P.S.  This is my very first skin that I have made and I would like to give thanks to the makers of the Vert and Canopy Skins, EQToolbox, T.King&amp;Remelio.  Without their skins, this one wouldn't have come out. :p</div></div><hr />

this should also cut down on the amount of crashes when Sony Patches.. but only time will tell =)<br />

The Texture was made in Adobe Photoshop using the Gradient fill/and other effects.  <br />
<br />
One question... what is the EQUI_RTAnimations.xml file for? Should we copy it to EQUI_Animations.xml?? <br />
The EQUI_RTAnimations.xml file is used for templates and other backgrounds for the mod.  It is basically an add on EQUI_Animations file that will never be patched by Verant. <br />
Just another way of trying to be &quot;patch-resistant&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the praise and comments for the mod. I have noticed a few other glitches but will fix those as the time permits.</div></div><hr />

I just have one request the spell book.  Would it be possible to make it smaller like the Invintory.   I like what the Quartz mod has done with it.  Other than that Looks real good :)</div></div><hr />

I'll see what I can do with the spellbook about making it smaller. <br />
<br />
If you noticed, I left in the top Title bar of the spellbook so that I could include a Minimize box in the top left. I noticed some of my friends using that minimize box very often. I guess they use the Spellbook icon to sit/stand instead of a real sit/stand button and then minimize the book itself so they can see the mobs while they med. Sounds confusing to me but I guess if you are under the lvl to use the regular &quot;sit as medding&quot; feature, this would be helpful. <br />
<br />
its not showing up! Im lauching the extract app but no file is showing up in my uifiles?!@ help! <br />
<br />
Hmm, the file should automatically extract into its own RTUI folder within your Uifiles folder.  Unless, your Everquest is not installed in the default directory which should be C:/Program Files/Sony/Everquest Trilogy/uifles . <br />
<br />
If that is the case, I'm pretty sure it will create a whole new path and folder that I listed above. All you need to do is find it and copy/paste the appropriate folder into the Uifiles folder of where your Everquest is installed. <br />
<br />
I am heavily thinking of just making it a zip file. Only reason I made it a self-extracting zip was because a few of the people I originally made the mod for, I have tons of trouble geting them to work. This was my answer for that, as long as it was installed in the default install directory.</div></div><hr />

However, if you're not using the EQUI_ClearBorder.xml file, you don't need to include it. I created that file for the sole purpose of giving my windows an invisible border so they could still be resized without having a visible border around them. Apparently you are not using that feature, so you don't need to include that file in your archive.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I guess I should be flattered that you modeled this after my idea.... nicely done.<br />

Actually if it wasn't for your Canopy skin, this mod would not have come out. Your skin pretty much set the foundation on the layout of this one.  I am not an XML expert as you could probably tell with the coding on the files, so I had to borrow bits and pieces from yours.  I learn fast though and finally know how to build templates and the like.  <br />
<br />
Could you post the file texture and explain how to do it or no? If so that would be great.. Thanks... I dont know if its that easy or not though... mmmm <br />
<br />
Sure, Ill post some textures with the overlays that I used to make those backgrounds later on tonight. <br />
<br />
BTW, The mini spellbook is complete also. It is basically the same thing excep its about 20% smaller. I'll post that up for download also.  <br />
<br />
An a side note,  How do I upload files and skins to be hosted here?  Kudane mentioned about submitting them to the Downloads section.</div></div><hr />

1) i am semi computer illiterate meaning i am able to do some advanced file stuff but know enough to really mess things up and that option was removed on this by the zip. going straight to where it needed to be without my direct intervention. This option is to SWEET.<br />
2) the one most important option i found was that without doing anything  i was able to put my spells where i wanted right from the get go . i'm sure there is other UI's with this but this is the first i have found out of the many i have looked at .Also you are able to see the bottom portion of your screen .<br />

<br />
1.  we need some sort of pet life bar, i have some cleric friends that i talked into using this UI and they were complaining about that.<br />
<br />
2.  i see youre working on the spellbook, im in love with vert's spellbook and i cant seem to get that to work with your mod... is there some way you can show me how to use vert's spellbook or to design a spellbook that looks like his... that seems to be the ideal spellbook to use<br />
<br />
3.  is there some way we can make the friends window perma-open because i use it often and would rather have it just open all the time<br />
<br />
4.  can we put the maps right into the help window, that way all that stuff is right there and when i need to change /assist buttons or incoming buttons for raids its not very difficult to do that.<br />
<br />
either way the skin has been wonderful for me and i've been spreading the word of how useful this UI is, hope you keep on updating it as i would love to keep on using it, thanks very much on the hard work.<br />

<br />
Couple of things:<br />
<br />
How can I move the Invite/Disband buttons?<br />
<br />
The default directory for folks with older EQ installations is c:\program files\everquest\uifiles.  The c:\program files\sony\everquest trilogy\uifiles is new, not sure how long it's been in use though.<br />
<br />
For the person crashing to desktop, you need to copy the new Raid xml file from default into the rtui folder.  it will work then.<br />
<br />
How can I change which inventory slots are shown under the group healths?<br />

all you have to do to get rid of the extra tabs is to copy the &quot;EQUI_ActionsWindow&quot; from your default folder to the one you have your RTUI in. and just over write.<br />

Well the only way i have found to close the extra windows is to load the default skin... rember if you have your screen setup make sure you type &quot;/loadskin default 1&quot; or it will change your settings.  close the extra chatwindows and then reload your skin. &quot;/loadskin rtui 1&quot;<br />

i only have one problem with it, no pet life bars :-(<br />
i play a cleric and sometimes need to heal a pet, and since there is no pet life bar, i have to ask them to let me know if pet is getting low, or make a hot key for the pet and check it. is there anyway you could add the pet life to this ui? if that could be done. omg!! it would be sooo nice. i will still continue to use this ui reguardless.<br />
<br />
if there is someway to do this that i can do please e-mail me theregos@hawaii.rr.com<br />
