(since i have WC3 and can look through ALLL the icons) I found and/or edited ones that looked cooler IMHO.. heh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayken</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my biggest issue is i need a bit more range in icons for nukes, ie all my fire nukes, be them DD, AE, or Rain, are all the same icon, would be nice if they could be different or atleast different color. for example my fire dd my fire AE and my fire Rain and/or pillar spells are all the burning hand icon, change up the color or diff icon per type would rock. this goes for ice and magic as well. will get some ss for ya <br />
well it depends.. you cant actually give EACH spell its OWN icon /sigh Sony, I REALLY wish you could.. but you CAN change what icon a certain group uses... AND.. SOME times two icons ARE used but they happen to look the same so you can sorta change them... load mine up and see if it changes anything for ya.. although with what you are asking i dont think so, but never hurts to try..<br />
<br />
______________<br />
Also, ya I expected the druid icons to work because i have access to a (low level) chanter and druid, along with my 65 BST...<br />
<br />
/Edit Nevermind found out what Ro's Fiery Sundering was and yes thats the right icon heheh<br />
<br />
your thoughts on the changes i made from raxthorne's?<br />
<br />
______________<br />
like I said my goal is to have a set that has NICE global icons but CUSTOMIZED (as much as possible) icons FOR EACH CLASS...<br />
like.. lightning strike for druids uses the same icon as my pets lightning proc on my BST.. so.. my BST's icon will have a lil pet on it (havent added it yet) whereas obviously this would look silly for a druid :p<br />
<br />
______________<br />
once i get screen shots of my classes spells and which spell gets which icon.. hopefully i will have some class specific zips to DL :)<br />
<br />
______________<br />
On a final note:<br />
:nana: Nana's own http://www.brentcopeland.com/beastlord/images/emoticons/yes.gif Yes they do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayken</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">on a side note.. i dont like the harmony icon as much...<br />
and i LOVE the charm icon for chanters.. so.. im thinking maybe to use it.. but with a blue/green glow?? <br />
<br />
dunno will work on this more tonight and post some more screenies<br />
<br />
/Small Edit <br />
looking through my photoshop files, I have noticed that while some icons are different, and sometimes VERY different, alot of them are still the same as Raxthorne's.  I would really like to see these, unchanged icons in particular, in screenshots of high level casters to see what spells they go with and, possibly, tweak them further.<br />
<br />
thanx in advance ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayken</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I got feedback from a higher level druid, I am posting/updating spells based on what i see... <br />
Comments welcome, tell me if u like that change.. like what i had originally.. etc. or offer an alternative idea?<br />

:: Changes<br />
=============<br />
<br />
Fist of Karana                <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldfist.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newfist.gif Alternate New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newfist2.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: Obviously this graphic looks cool for most casters.. but.. tweak tweak,....  i thought of the golem fist might look coo, cus of the name.. another thought, is that the graphic itself was cool but.. conjures up the image of a firey strike not a lightning/storm based one.. so a slight tweak of some hues and saturation with an overlay.. and we have the alternate one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Harmony of Nature:       <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldharmony.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newharmony.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: was a semi-cool image but.. kinda washed out... and i tell ya, i LOVE the image i came up with for Chanter charm so.. blam.. overlay of green = druid based charm/lull. Side note.. will have to see if harmony and beguile animal has same icons.. ifnot.. will retweak..<br />
<br />
<br />
Nature Walker's Behest:       <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldpet.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newpet1.gif Alternate New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newpet2.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: very cool icon, again tooled for my chanter ... but.. this does not conjure up images of the druids lil furry friend.. so thought maybe the dire wolf icon might work.. or.. some tweaking of a boar(?) icon to change the red aura to a greenish one came up with the other.. but.. i think it loses something in the shrinking.. dunno yet tho<br />
<br />
All the other ones.. for druids, anyways, seem rather nice tho ;)<br />
I like the Druid Skin icon and Thorn icon much better than Rax's<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weawen</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the second.  Fist of karana icon.  I agree that it looked kinda crappy b4.  And I love the new harmony of nature spell icon.  One thing though could you redo the portal icons?  It might just be me, but I really want a good port icon.  I have one up all the time so I have to look at them alot.  <br />
<br />
As for the last icon NWB..... What can i say the old one sucked :D . I love either of the 2 you posted, only thing I woudl sugest is a better &quot;Bear&quot; looking icon.  Not sure if there is a good one in WC3 but I will take a look tonight and see if I can see one that I like.  If you want some more screen shots of my spell book just let me know, and I will post one.  Also if you want more spell shots just let me know the type of spell and I will gladly put up the shot.</div></div><hr />

Excellent work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you said earlier:<br />
my biggest issue is i need a bit more range in icons for nukes, ie all my fire nukes, be them DD, AE, or Rain, are all the same icon, would be nice if they could be different or atleast different color.<br />
I hear ya bro... maybe Sony will make EACH spell able to have a user-defined icon.. until them.. they are rather bland for Wizards methinks. Since alot of them resemble each other http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif<br />
<br />
Now, based on the SS's i got, these are the changes I came up with.<br />
<br />
Comments welcome, tell me if u like that change.. like what i had originally.. etc. or offer an alternative idea?<br />

Greater Concussion:                <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldconcussion.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newconcussion.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: Obviously(?) some other class uses this icon so it would make sense... Since its a hate reducer spell.. I felt a guy gazing at you looked coo :) so blam<br />
<br />
<br />
SpellShield:       <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldspellshield.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newspellshield.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: This was a cool icon.. but.. its a spell shield, the icon did not evoke that image to me, so a little overlay.. and screen magic.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Okeil's line:       <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldfireDS.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newfireDS.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: Changed this back to Raxthorne's original, I must admit I thought it was a fire resistance type spell from lookin at only the default icons, so I changed it.. but.. as a DS icon.. his makes more sense....<br />
<br />
Mark of Karn/Retribution line:       <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldMoK.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newMoK.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: After noting that the one next to this one was a DS, and by lookin at my friends Cleric, I realized was the Cleric reverse DS. and Raxthorne's original icberg icon didnt fit.. dont know if the NEW one fits either, dunno if my attempt to make it look like some energy was hurting him worked but... it looks coo, heh ;)<br />
<br />
Druid Spell Updates:<br />
===================<br />
Breath of Ro: <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldbreath.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newbreath.gif<br />

<br />
: Nature Walker's Behest       <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newpet2.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newpet3.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: As much as I fiddled with it, I could NOT get the boar to look good, so came up with an idea.. took the falconish(?) icon for lev.. added some brown overlays, tinted the nose.. and.. if i do say so myself, you have a rather respectable bear icon :)<br />
<br />
<br />
And, try as I could... I can NOT seem to come up with anything better for portal spells. http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif Me, personally, I like them.. but if someone can point me to a better WC3 icon... or an idea for combining one or two into something that would look cool, lemmie know.<br />

I'd prefer the sphere of cold posted above.  The fiery hand is cool, but the blue version isnt quite as nice imo.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, I kinda like the fiery orb above too, just as a wizard.  I'd kill for a version of your icons that included those =)<br />
<br />
Oh, and those portal icons would be pretty cool.  Not sure if they're necessary though, the ones in game are already pretty groovy (the ones raxthorne included that is).<br />

:: Changes<br />
=============<br />
<br />
Ports:                <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldport.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newport.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newport1.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newport2.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newport3.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: Not sure which looks the best or not so.. unfortunately the ring lost some detail when i shrunk it, but it still looks coo. different ports would have the ring color coded.. although.. the casting icon will look.. prolly messy heh<br />
<br />
<br />
Ressurection:       <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldres.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newres.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: Just tweaking this slightly to give it more of a divine intervention type feel :)<br />
<br />
<br />
And, in the end... I'll put out two zips for people.. those who want fire/ice hands and those that want the orbs. Since people seem split..<br />
<br />
Once people agree on the port icons.. (since i dont like any of them any more than each other heh they all rock..) ill update the druid/wizzy/bst/cleric sets and post links for download..<br />
<br />
ATTENTION: I still need enchanter SSs!! alot of mind icons that i have NO CLUE what they do hehe.. Same goes for bards and necros too. Looking through the spells to see if i can figure them outmyself tho.. ;) <br />
<br />
c'mon people I wanna make these icons just OWN everything :D <br />

<br />
tho you have covered this, was curious if when you mean all types share some icon, does this mean fire and ice both have to use the hand? or can we do fire with the hand and ice with the sphere?<br />

I see some bad ones. <br />
<br />
Clinging/Engulfing/Dooming Darkness are our dot snare. Those icon suck a big one!!!  <br />
<br />
Dark Pack &amp; Allure of Death are blood for Mana spells. <br />
<br />
Tiny Companion is a pet shrink.<br />
<br />
Spook/Panic the Dead are undead fears. They look like the dots.<br />
<br />
There are others but these i think are the worse. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps.If i did this right. I lov these spells icons!!!!<br />

The classes share the same spell icons. The bugged spells are ones that should logically have one type of icon but display another.<br />

I'll have to try these out.<br />

<br />
Will do some more retooling.. and have, most, class icons ready for download this weekend... I hope..<br />
<br />
To Do Still: Alter some Shaman Icons Check Bard /Mage Icons Retool Port Icons (will probably have two sets to DL for this) Retol Nukes (again, may have two sets to DL for this)<br />

As always, suggestions and/or comments welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asmyr</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wouldnt http://lucy.fnord.net/ be a great source for this project?  each of the spells in that database has a &quot;bookicon&quot; value associated with it.  seems the lucy site has already figured out the corresponding icon picture that fits those values.  Check out the icons displayed next to each spell in the list.  Kerasota posted some icon info on 10/19 in news.  Hell you might even be able to contact the moderators of lucy (lucy@fnord.net) and have them run a custom report on their database, showing each icon slot, and a list of each spell that uses that icon.  Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Asmyr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raxthorne</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That list is not accurate and the reason why, is the spells are bugged. For example: They are displaying the small spell icons that are linked to each of the spells assuming they looked up each class? However, some of the spells are bugged and the small icon for the spell is not the same large icon that is used in the spell book. Perfect example there is with the shaman's Primal Avatar. They have it as the red dagger, but it is the blue one in the spell book.<br />
<br />
To over come the bugs and make the spells custom for each class is a huge task and I salute you for doing it. However, for many such as myself who use only one UI and have many high level characters, the custom class specific spell icons would be a moot point. Plus, if the task of ensuring similar type spells for cross classes (IE roots or invis) did not hold the same spell icon, then it would be confusing if you played multiple classes. This is why I tried to do something universal, but it is not easy since spells like Primal Avatar share the same icon as Mage's summoning daggers. Go figure what VI was thinking when they assigened these spells.<br />
<br />
Other than that, good luck and I look forward to seeing what you come up with. BTW; I downloaded the ZIP files and could not open them, is there another link or that file corrupt?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayken</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why would it be confusing Rax?<br />
i have a druid, chanter, and Beastlord<br />
they ALL have seperate UI's<br />
its quit easy<br />
<br />
log on to class_01<br />
/load class_01_UI<br />
<br />
log on to class_02<br />
/load class_02_UI<br />
<br />
log on to class_03<br />
/load class_03_UI<br />
<br />
now they are all on different UIs... which.. using the icon sets im tryin to put together.. all the GLOBAL icons should be.. nearly the same.. ie buffs... where the class specific icons.. will make more sense.. if... nukes, self only buffs.. etc<br />
<br />
<br />
and as far as the icon swap... well.. hehe i fixed that.. just swap them in the icon file.. blam.. now avatar is blue dude in book.. and blue dude on casting bar =)<br />
<br />
would love to see what my icons look like on a high shammy spellbook like yers.. i still have much tweaking to do.. which, like I said.. should be knocked out this weekend..<br />
btw.. think i found a better canni icon.. maybe .. a cooler one ;)<br />
<br />
Will keep ya posted..<br />

<br />
And yes you can do it very easily the way you stated with loading UI's. But that is the thing, I only wnat one UI for all my characters. Seems like almost everytime they patch they break something with the UI so I would be one that would only want to have one set of icons universal to all classes. :)<br />
<br />
I think your work is well worth it and I know how much time it takes to do. Just pointing out the pros and more so the cons of specific class spell sets.<br />

:: Changes<br />
=============<br />
<br />
Charisma buff:                <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldcha.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newcha.gif <br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: Old one was... was kinda coo.. but plain.. so.. when i saw the *bling* *bling* icon.. i was like.. oh that has selling (ie the only thing *I* use Cha for) written all over it.. hehe<br />
<br />
Chanter Alliance Line:                <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldalliance.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newalliance.gif <br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: While the old one is a coo icon, I could never remember wth it was heh... so i took off of the cha icon a little.. since I when I think of Faction, its usually for sellin stuff or turn ins both of which bring Charisma to mind.. soo<br />
<br />
<br />
 Gate:      <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldgate.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newgate.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: After I changed the Clarity/KEI icon, gate matched it a tad too much, so... basically made it look like the personal port icons... for DRU/WIZ but took the person out.. so that should let u know its a special self-only port.. <br />
<br />
<br />
 Weapon Proc spells:      <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldpalyproc.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newpalproc.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: Used by RNG/PAL/SHD for their weapon proc buffs.. mainly just beefed it up some..<br />
<br />
<br />
 Misc Mage Summons:      <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldmagestuff.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newmagestuff.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: Same as proc spell.. just beefed this up some, its used, mainly, by mages for various weapon summon spells, it seems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure if I'm keeping the last too tho.. but thought I would put them out that for feedback... lemmie know if I should axe em.<br />
<br />
ATTENTION: I still need enchanter SSs!!  Same goes for bards, and mages too. <br />

I'll keep this simple so your little infant brain can handle it. We are playing with the WC3 icons because blizzard does AWSOME cool looking work. It is so cool looking that we would love to use them for our spell books. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xzoltar</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it but I want a final version soon, because its hard to remember what icon do what when they all are the same ( in your fisrt version my cleric buff was with 5 icon that was identical ) now you have made major update and just few buff that stack have the same icons, what will be really cool his to make a icon by buff type + stacking. <br />
<br />
Some cleric buff stack with enchanter and shaman ( all are protection ) but sonme other dont stack, so enchanter , cleric and shaman could have the same buff icon for spell that DONT stack, but different for spell that stack. Lie a green shield , red shield , yellow shield, 3 buff that stack but from different source...<br />
<br />
I dont know if im clear, but well its just a suggestion...</div></div><hr />

I superimposed the 'flash' from the other eyeball icons and filled in with black.  Now it looks like darkness instead of surgery. <br />
<br />
Thank you for these icons.  I love em and I don't even play WC3.  Is there any way to merge the nuke and ports for us wizzies?</div></div><hr />

hmm never thought of that heh :) I always liked the sewn eye myself.. gave the image of they couldnt open their eyes.. ie they was blind but.. ill change this tonight myself and see how it looks...<br />
<br />
Thank you for these icons. I love em and I don't even play WC3. Is there any way to merge the nuke and ports for us wizzies?<br />
<br />
hmm ya i could do that i guess.. but actually the way its set up.. you should have to.. here's what you would do:<br />
 Download the Alternate Port Spell Set (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=733)<br />
 Extract all files into your EQ directory (or into your specific UI folder if you dont have extract with subfolder option on)<br />
 Download Global Nuke Spell set (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=732)<br />
 Extract only the spells_02.tga and the gemicons01.tga files (cant recall the exact names, will double check when i get home)<br />
and yer done :D <br />
because the only files that have the globe icons are those files..<br />
and thats all you need to update...<br />
<br />
If thats too confusin.. i can upload another zip with both, when I get home,  for people if they want em</div></div><hr />

dunno if they fit the WC3 them tho.. =\<br />
<br />
and rythmyc, um.. you can just use the general ones? unless.. u dont like an icon??<br />
which ones u dont like? or want changed?<br />
<br />
<br />
really the only reason i made ANY class specific sets.. was cus SOME spells used the same icon for different spells for different classes.. so.. i changed some for THAT class to use...<br />
<br />
but.. if u want some mage specific ones, or any class specific ones really.... by all means gimmie some feedback.. i mean.. YOU play the class.. not me.. so.. who better to say well this spell would look coo with THIS icon.. etc etc..</div></div><hr />

I just got that game today and I am going to play around and see if I can get the icons from its spells.  They are just really detailed and cool looking =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayken</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok so.. seems to me.. since have gotten little feedback...<br />
these are good as is and to release them??<br />
<br />
no more feedback? no icons wanting changed?<br />
<br />
btw on a side note.. noticed that.. eventhough Beastlords use the actual 'wolf' icon for pet summons.. Shaman.. who GET an actual wolf.. dont.. they use the normal pet icon /boggle I will be fixing that soon and updating the shaman set to have a wolf pet icon...<br />
<br />
also.. does anyone want me to try to make race specific Beastlord pet summon icons? wolf/tiger/bear etc.. dunno if i could find a dino or gator in wc3 tho.. =\ and eventhough im a Kat.. I like the wolf icon myself.. /shrug...<br />
<br />
things to ponder upon</div></div><hr />

sowwy :( <br />
like i said.. some classes got class specific sets because they used the same icons as other classes.. but for different things..<br />
are there any icons u dont like for necros? as in.. they dont quite go for this spell?<br />
<br />
lookin at the SS's people sent in.. i thought all of them kinda went with the spell.. with the exception of FD, which.. i dunno if there would be a coo one for that.. but<br />
u want necro specific ones.. tell me.. say Spell X has this icon that doesnt go.. or spell y icon makes no sense.. etc....<br />
<br />
i dont have ESP.. i can only make changes based on feedback people give me :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalamaku</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">one think i just noticed today. the dead man floating icon is the purple buring hand. not sure if that was on purpose, use to be some spookey ghost thingy, which would work good for DMF.<br />

Well I am not sure if you can change color of the icons but if you can here is what I think.<br />
<br />
DMF can use different look<br />
FD (Death Peace) can use a change too.<br />
Lich line could use a change something like Splurt (page 6) but with blue instead of green?<br />
Incinerate Bones could use skull removal.<br />
Fear spells would be nice purple not blue.<br />
Sarym's Kiss can be red (it return HP after all).<br />
Dark Plague would be nice green.<br />
Zevfeer's Theft of Vitae can use a change maybe not icon but color to red.<br />
<br />
Well what other necros think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes i  agree. <br />
My nec dont hav dmf yet but that one really not right. A hand dont fit a floating dead man..lol.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayken</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, I would like to THANK you for the feedback!!! Feedback always = good thing :D <br />
<br />
DMF can use different look<br />
only problem with that is i could change it for necro's but it would still look the same to everyone else.. other classes use the same icon for different spells.. only thing i could maybe do is change it to a semi-generic skull icon.. ill work on it..<br />
FD (Death Peace) can use a change too.<br />
ya.. never was thrilled with that icon.. kinda hard to find a good one for it tho.. but im always lookin..<br />
Lich line could use a change something like Splurt (page 6) but with blue instead of green?<br />
hmm ya i could do that... only thing is.. thats the illusion icon.. so if anyone casts an illusion on ya.. if would have the blue icon.. if thats fine.. sure i can change it...<br />
Incinerate Bones could use skull removal.<br />
well its an undead only spell... shouldn't it have the skull on there?? but i can remove it.. /shrug<br />
Fear spells would be nice purple not blue.<br />
Sarym's Kiss can be red (it return HP after all).<br />
Dark Plague would be nice green.<br />
unfourtunately you cant change ONE spell's icon and not others.. those three spells use the same icon as others in your lineup.. u change one icon.. and ALL spells that use that icon will change<br />
Zevfeer's Theft of Vitae can use a change maybe not icon but color to red.hmm sure i could do that..<br />
<br />
will work on some changes and post em this weekend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think also the skull should be there for Incinerate Bones.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
But they are diferent color ... was just wondering if you can switch colors on all of them...<br />
<br />
<br />
Incinerate Bones is not and undead spell ... its fire nuke ... Ignite Bones is same spell with one minor draw turning target in to skeleton. Incinerate Bones dont turn target in to skeleton.<br />
<br />
<br />
hmm ya i could do that... only thing is.. thats the illusion icon.. so if anyone casts an illusion on ya.. if would have the blue icon.. if thats fine.. sure i can change it... <br />
<br />
I have no problem with that... then i am under lich no other ilusion can be cast on me so its all good with that...</div></div><hr />

Necro pact:                <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldnecropact.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/necropact.gif Alternate: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/necropact1.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: First is color change requested, on the second, I was thinking.. to give it kinda a ghoul heal look to it.. dunno if i succeeded..<br />
<br />
<br />
DMF:       <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/olddmf.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newdmf.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: The old icon looks coo for spells that use it as a nuke/dot but.. doesnt go with DMF.. so.. came up with (I hope) a nice.. semi-generic skull icon.. that will work for both =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Lich:       <br />
====================================<br />
Old: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/oldlich.gif New: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newlich.gif Alternate: http://www.bloodandloyalty.net/UI/post_pics/newlich1.gif<br />
====================================<br />
*Notes: Dunno why i brought up the illusion thing.. that would be if u wanted to change Splut's icon.. /bonkself.. <br />
Used the splurt/Illusion icon.. with blue glow.. and thought maybe the Necro Pet icon with a red aura might be coo?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Love the new and alternate FD<br />
<br />
Love the new necro pact<br />
<br />
Love the new eye of zomm<br />
<br />
GREAT new dmf, it needed to be separate<br />
<br />
Not sure about the lich series...one is the same as splurt, and the other is the pet icon.  You could either keep the ALTERNATE lich icon (the skelly), or change splurt to something else and make the lich series the guy with the hood<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
<br />
Can you change the fear spells to something different than the bond of death/saryn's kiss (hp taps) line?</div></div><hr />

people are split on the Lich line? like the New or the Alternate new?<br />
heard no feedback on the dark pact icons...<br />
which for FD? dunno which skull looks cooler myself..<br />
no thoughts from shammys or beastlord on the pet icons?<br />
and feedback on the blindness spell? i personally like the sewn eye.. but if people DO want it changed.. what do u want it changed to??</div></div><hr />

hate to do this to you, but if you got more images to go through hehe, are you going to be retooling the entire standard batch?um i dunno.. any icons that you dont really like and/or want changin?<br />
<br />
Not sure about the lich series...one is the same as splurt, and the other is the pet icon. You could either keep the ALTERNATE lich icon (the skelly), or change splurt to something else and make the lich series the guy with the hoodThoughts? Do necros want that new icon to be used for lich and then have slurt's changed? (just remember splurt's icon is the SAME that is used for illusions.. so if IT changes.. anytime yer illusioned (not too often from what people tell me hehe) it WILL be different)</div></div><hr />

Ah, I didn't know that.  Keep the Alternate Lich then, don't change splurt.<br />

Thank you for ALL of the hard work into these.  I liked T'kings work a lot, but dropped them instantly when you released the first version of this set.  Never turned back. )</div></div><hr />

I like<br />

Necro Pact = New<br />

would love to see these up for Download SOON :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bengali</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would DEFINITELY like to see race specific icons for BLs ... I'm partial to the cat one myself.<br />
<br />
Could you show the cat icon in original form in addition to the orange....I know vah shir warders are orange, but the color seems a bit off.  I might prefer the orginal white tiger icon but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
You know what it is...it's that the tiger's face is all orange, when in game his fur has white (or at least lighter orange) in it around the face.  That's what's throwing me off.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I want a cat icon!</div></div><hr />

That's what's throwing me off. hmm never noticed.. will have to fix/edit that.. will post edited and original next update..<br />
necro set continues with tweaking.. im thinkin.. since none would use a 'global icon' that is used by another for a different purpose.. i may just add them to the global file.. so there may not be a necro download but certainly necro icons..</div></div><hr />

Am I just dumb? I can't locate the Beastlord only versions. Like with the Kitty for a pet. Also some thoughts on current ones.<br />

<br />
Spiritual Purity line just looks odd as a red glowing hand. I'd think the icon used for summon companion would be a good start at something that would fit this spell more. Like an aura around a person you know.<br />
<br />
Tiny Companion and Shrink just look like shaman style sticks. Dunno if there is a better icon, but that one doesn't really make sense to me.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Lightning/storm: Maybe an orb with a lightning style and that animal head?<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Scorpion: Maybe an orb in the same style as the Resist Poison green liquid with that animal head?<br />
<br />
Spirit of Vermin: Maybe a green orb like the style of the Resist Disease with the animal head?<br />
<br />
Spirit of Wind: Perhaps an orb like the &quot;Breath of Karana&quot; Just cut out an orb from that picture and add the animal head?<br />
<br />
I think those would go a long way to make the spells look more uniform instead of a bunch of different ones for spells that do the same thing?<br />
<br />
And of course the beastlord specific pet icons!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bengali</div><div class="date">01-18-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing is that the game seems to force Spirit of Wind and Spiritual Purity to have the same icon.  So part of the problem is finding something that suits both.<br />
<br />
As far as the beastlord specific ones, the way I understand Rayken's post, he hasn't uploaded them yet.  He said he might be able to do them this weekend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spirit of Wind: Perhaps an orb like the &quot;Breath of Karana&quot; Just cut out an orb from that picture and add the animal head?<br />
these two, plus tash.. plus one other spell i cant recall atm.. all use the same icon.. <br />
<br />
Tiny Companion and Shrink just look like shaman style sticks. Dunno if there is a better icon, but that one doesn't really make sense to me.I dunno.. shrink is a shammy only function.. shammy stick fit for me.. i could change it tho.. <br />
<br />
Spirit of Lightning/storm: Maybe an orb with a lightning style and that animal head?Several mobs use this icon for bad effects they cast on u.. although i could change it..<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Scorpion: Maybe an orb in the same style as the Resist Poison green liquid with that animal head?<br />
This would change any poison icon.. ie ours and mobs..<br />
<br />
Spirit of Vermin: Maybe a green orb like the style of the Resist Disease with the animal head?<br />
This would change any disease icon.. ie ours and mobs..<br />
<br />
And of course the beastlord specific pet icons!Aye havent posted the BST ones yet.. no one sed if they liked my warder icons :( <br />
<br />
<br />
so.. if u want all them icons changed.. and have the OTHERS not fit.. ya i can change em.. <br />
thats why they have the icons they have.. because alot of spells use the same icons.. so if i change any.. it has to be to something that makes sense for them ALL.. yes yes I know /rude sony for not letting us have an icon for EACH spell but.. thats how it is atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">defy</div><div class="date">01-18-2003, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like the beastlord ones =P<br />
<br />
iksar tho, so any dragon thing would look cool.<br />
<br />
i've actually found the original set by raxthorne works better for bl overall than your global set.<br />
<br />
Waiting for the time when i can load up bl icons tho =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bengali</div><div class="date">01-18-2003, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the fact that people have been asking for you to post the beastlord ones means that they like them.  I know I posted that I liked them, although the tiger on the vah shir looked a little too orange.  I've been waiting to see the updated version that you said you would do after I pointed that out.<br />
<br />
Even still, I'd be happy with the &quot;default&quot; version that had a white tiger, to be honest.  Anything would be better than the wolf for me (because I'm Vah Shir, not because the wolf looks bad).  The rest of them look fine to me also.<br />
<br />
I don't see the problem with posting a BL set using the &quot;default&quot; colors and then tweaking it later based on feedback if you want.  But as it stands now, I think people want to at least try out a new version, and if you keep waiting for more feedback then it could be months before you put up new ones :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bengali</div><div class="date">01-18-2003, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my perspective, your set works better overall for BL's than the original ones.<br />
<br />
My only suggestion would be to change the SP hand icon to a different color?  Because it's reddish, it always seems like a detrimental effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayken</div><div class="date">01-18-2003, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My only suggestion would be to change the SP hand icon to a different color? Because it's reddish, it always seems like a detrimental effect. Aye I feel the same.. but it also the same icon used for tash.. might be confusing to have a 'good looking' buff for a bad effect if u get it cast on ya.. but ill mess around see if i can edit it some...<br />
<br />
as for the update.. ya sorry.. im feelin sick the last few days.. today im all joint achy and crap :(  not coo...<br />
<br />
will have update for download either Monday or Tuesday tho.. <br />

<br />
Like this.<br />
<br />

Of course, I don't have any SS's of negative effects, just imagine the blue bar being red instead.<br />

<br />
1) the warder icon isn't that ugly red eyed wolf =P<br />
but that's np if rayk releases the custom warder icons by race.<br />
<br />
Also, i think the red lightning boot would be better for sow type effects =P</div></div><hr />

Not many people downloaded the Cleric/Druid/Port/Globe sets.. if enough people want em tho.. ill update them too..<br />
<br />
As always.. comments, suggestions, and screenshots, are welcome.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">defy</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i see that the spirit sight icon is still the night elf female face with an eye in the corner, i think the demon hunter with the flaming eyes works better.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if you already use that for see invis or not.<br />
<br />
Also, i think the red lightning bolt boot is a better icon for sow?<br />
<br />
edit: some people didn't know where to look for it, it's at the very first post in this thread.</div></div><hr />

make sure to only use the link from the First post (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4464) of this thread to download them tho..<br />
or u may download an older set..<br />
<br />
trying to have the older ones removed to avoid confusion... but either way.. if u use the links in the First post (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4464) of this thread, you will always have the lastest icons, cus i always update them when i come out with changes :D<br />
<br />
<br />
also.. for those Beastlords that cant find their pet icon... Sorry, just make sure to read the instructions...<br />
<br />
Simply download and unzip into your EQ dir.. then dbl click on the batch file (the .bat files) for your race and it will copy over the right icon files for you..<br />
<br />
so if u a Vah Shir, double click on Tiger.bat<br />
Troll, double click on Troll.bat<br />
Iksar, double click on Iksar.bat<br />
Ogre, double click on Ogre.bat<br />
Barbarian, double click on Barb.bat<br />
<br />
that will copy the specific files that have THOSE icons.. into the place of the normal one.. ;) <br />
<br />
hope that helps..</div></div><hr />

The only one I had seen before was with my wizzie and the familiar summon icon is not as good as it could be, but oh well, the rest of the set is amazing. Awesom icons! Thanks!<br />

---Margrave  <br />
well thats my fault if i wasnt clear in my labeling..<br />
the extra 'sets' are only there for when 2 spells.. (from 2 different classes) use the same icon for different spell effects.. <br />
<br />
ie there is 'a generic nuke' icon thats used by most classes.. for clerics and druids i made that icon the fist (for cleric's smite line and druids fist/karana line) to customize it more towards what THEIR spells do.. the easiest one is pets.. almost every pet class uses the SAME physical icon.. but for different TYPES of pets.. so to allow each class to have icons that made more sense for THEIR spells.. i made this icon look like this for them.. and like this for this class...<br />
<br />
hope that explains it better<br />
<br />
oh.. and thnx Crow.. Homer rox! &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a few questions for you.  Namely this.  With the WC3 expansion out, theres a lot of new art that would go really well in the spell gems.  Id like to play around with it and modify my own, but am sorta lost on where to start.  What method did you use for grabbing the images out of WC3 ?<br />
<br />
Thanks. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayken</div><div class="date">07-05-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ooo.. WC3 expansion? new art? o.O<br />
looks like I'll have to get that to update my icons :D<br />
<br />
how did I get em? um.. there was a program that extracted em all that I downloaded it.. don't recall the name of it.. and now I cant find it.. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghesta</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dang.  Well, ill keep checking back here.  The Frozen throne expansion for WC3 has some really awesome icons.  Definitly worth using.<br />
<br />
No offense, but i use the raxthorne's set over yours.  Just feels a bit more right to me.  Thats why I was wondering how you got the icons.  Figured that way I could play with them myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayken</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe ya.. I got Raxthorne's at first but alot of them didnt 'fit' I felt.. so I changed some.. I think I'll go out and pick up the WC3 xpack today so.. look for more/new icons this week :D</div></div><hr />

Can't wait to see what it looks like. I have tried to play WC3 but I just can't stand those point and click top down veiw types, just not involved enough for me.

It is very nice.  I will look through the WC3 icons if you want and make suggestions from a necro point of view. <br />
<br />
Edit: also where do you find the icons, so far i can't find them in the WC3 directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, I think the Necro Darkness line of spells could use a change.   No offense to Rayken but the Darkness line in my spellbook is kind of an eyesore, with the Grunt picture highlighted in orange.  I think Lady Vashj's Mana Shield icon would look nice, or the Bloodmage's Phoenix one.<br />
<br />
Against better judgment I'll keep making suggestions on existing icons.  The Orb of Venom Icon would be awesome for our PZN dots, and keeps in line with the dripping orb thing you've got going on now.<br />
<br />
I'll edit this post if I find anything I think you might wanna look at.</div></div><hr />

They aren't, I extracted them.. scan up a few posts for a link to a MPQ extractor..<br />

Well I don't use that spell (not having a Necro) so.. I'm not the best to be givin opinions on whether its a good icon.. if u dont like it.. say so.. hehe<br />
I'll admit I haven't played WC3xpak enough yet to know which 2 icons you are referring to tho.. I merely extracted all the art and edited em in Photoshop.. heh can u describe the two icons? and I'll try to whip somethin up as always ;)<br />

Um, sorry, again not a Necro, whats PZN?? I know which Orb of Vemon icon you are referring to tho.. so im guessing(?) you are referring to a poison dot?? or?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe Rayken.  Yea the PZN = poison.  The Mana Shield icon is like a black/blue swirlie circle with blue around it.  The Phoenix icon is like a black hand on fire, swirling flames around a jagged like hand.</div></div><hr />

Ok, here they are (can't post pics for some reason on the net, I'll just give you the name)<br />
<br />
For Darkness:<br />
<br />
1.  called BTNNeutralManaShield'<br />
2.  called BTNMarkofFire</div></div><hr />

ill try to work something up..<br />
<br />
why dont you like the rottin green skull for poison?? i love that one :( <br />
<br />
but.. i can try the Vemon orb..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh by itself it isn't too bad, it's just very bold, and when you have a page full of em, it gets to be a bit much =D  But it's fine either way, I still like em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raijuta</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oooh I likey. All of them look great, keep it up. <br />
Disease the 'new' one looks great.<br />
Lifetap, the 'new' one is more meaningful<br />
I hope to see more for the shaman side since that is what my main character is, also would like to see what you have plan for the beastlord if your going to get into that.<br />
Overall I think they'll Rock =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayken</div><div class="date">07-20-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there will only be 'new' ones.. if <br />
a) The old ones sucked for some reason and people want just ANY kind of replacement.. <br />
or b) The new icon far exceeds the look of the old one..<br />
<br />
So like.. are there any old shammy/bst icons you dont like? that you want replaced? <br />
There ARE some nice new icons in the xpack.  But not enough to like, replace every one of the old ones.. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great work, can't wait for them to be updated!</div></div><hr />

I recently was without internet for two weeks. (damn bills, and having to pay them EVERY month)  While i was offline I messed around with the raxthorne set a bit and the new icons.  After I test them out, I wouldn't mind sharing them with you to get some feedback from you.  Interested ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayken</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure Ghesta.. always lookin for feedback :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bril</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Necromancer point of view here about some of the changes.<br />
<br />
FD - The old one is good but if you want to change just for the sake of chang, then I would go with the &quot;Alternate&quot; verison.  Still think the old one was the best thou.<br />
<br />
Life Tap - Indifferent to all of them, none of them really stand out and scream &quot;Life Tap&quot; to me.  Hopefully you can find one that stands out a bit more for these spells.<br />
<br />
Disease - if you go with the &quot;globe&quot; for the Life Tap then please do not use another &quot;globe&quot; for this category.  They look way to similar.  I actually liked the old icon myself.<br />
<br />
Look foward to seeing what you come up with for this build.  Been using these icons for a long time and they are great, just hate getting use to new ones...<br />
<br />

I like some of your changes.. some I had already planned on using.. although.. u leave alot like Rax had them.. many I changed cus I felt they didnt fit.. =\<br />
<br />
<br />
btw.. I will be TRYING my best to get an update up this weekend so people can download the new stuff..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaitlyn</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any word on an update?  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kjan</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love your current icons so far as I love Warcraft III, looking forward to testing out new icons as they become available.<br />
<br />
do you change the themes of the icons depending on class cus some Paladin ones would be cool but I'd imagine they would look very close to the cleric icons =)<br />
<br />
btw what is the latest version you have available for download and where can i get it? (if not listed in download section that is)<br />
<br />
very good work though :D</div></div><hr />
