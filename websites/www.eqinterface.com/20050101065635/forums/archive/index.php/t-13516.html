<br />
When facing North , my compass reads North East. is there a line in the compass file I can alter to shift the compass display to correct the error ?<br />
<br />
Many Thanks</div></div><hr />

Also if you deviate from the sizes, lets say the compass graphic is 24 x 108 and you extend it to 112 or such, it will distort your compass reading.  So make sure u have the correct sizes referenced in the .xml.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can compensate by changeing your .tga file and redrawing the compass positions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen some compasses that others have done (LodiDodi and Sars) and liked them, but wanted to change different aspects of the overlay drawing.<br />
My problem is that when I modify the drawing at all from the original TGA, it draws the overlay, but not the strips. All I have is a white background where the strips would be.<br />
This problem exists not only with modifying a custom UI, but with making modifications to the default TGA file or copy/pasting sections onto a new canvas and referencing that file in my target UI.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
I am using MS Paint atm for use in the file drawing edit, since I'm not a graphics guru. Don't know if this makes any difference.<br />
<br />
Any potential trouble in opening a TGA file, saving as a BMP, making modifications, and saving back as TGA? <br />
<br />
Are there any freeware or trial TGA editors that I might get? (MS Paint doesn't support TGA - go figure)</div></div><hr />

Indeed you can't simply use MS paint for the TGA files.. you also need to edit the alpha Channels and this is not possible with MS Paint afaik...<br />
<br />
You should either try Adobe Photoshop which I personally prefer.. Or Paint Shop Pro.. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Photoshop and PaintShopPro both come with a  price tag if you want to use them past there trial period.</div></div><hr />
