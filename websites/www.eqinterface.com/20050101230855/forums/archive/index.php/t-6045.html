<br />
<br />
And what inventory window are you  trying to use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corrinth</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sona_tt_Inventory is the inventory window i am using.  It's one where you can put a screeny of yourself in it so u have a picture of yourself in your inventory.<br />
<br />
Also, what about the missing files?  It says in the new patch information to add those strings in EQUI.xml and i did, and it can't find the files.... where do i get these files?  I ran EQtestserver and also regular EQ and even did a through file check.  I even remember seeing it download the bigger bank window file... but it's not in default 1.... wtf? please help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That warning is normal.. it looks like its finding them in the default folder :)<br />
<br />
The first thing I would do is download the latest version of quartz from here:<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=183<br />
Follow the readme to reinstall it... Do not copy the default folder to your quartz folder!!<br />
<br />
if there was no problems with the spellbook or musicplayer mods install them in into the quartz folder..<br />
<br />
I will download sona inventory and see if I can fix it that for ya then upload a little fix for it in this thread..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corrinth</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thank you for all your help :).  I found those files so i no longer get the missing files message.  I also fixed the options window problem as well.  I no longer get the screwed up XML file message at log in either.  The only thing in the UIerrors.log i have is this one:<br />
<br />
[Tue Jan 28 22:17:32 2003] Error: Could not find child ClassAnim in window InventoryWindow<br />
<br />
I do not know if this will cause a problem or not.  I would like to get rid of this message though, just to be sure.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you for all your help.  Much appreciated<br />

Install the original zip then unzip this over it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I strongly urge you to reinstall the new version from scratch.. It's much more patch friendly... If you copied  the default folder when you installed the version you're using now: It will most likely break every patch!!  The newest version is more patch friendly if you don't copy the default directory when installing!!<br />
<br />
***Edit***  Those warning messages are normal... It means it's loading the file from the default folder.. Which is perfectly normal..</div></div><hr />
