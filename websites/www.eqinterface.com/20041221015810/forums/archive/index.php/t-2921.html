This sucks we only have like 1 skin here for Ranger, Mav's is awesome I mean 4 thumbs up but, It doesn't have anything special to it, like a Recipe or Loc guide to, come on people<br />

It doesn't exactly have a ranger-y feel to it though- all blue with Celtic-type filigrees everywhere. But it wouldn't be hard to put a nature skin on it if somebody wanted to make all the tgas (I'm no kind of artist).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And as far as it goes, I would view any of the UIs that are here more as all-hybrid-friendly than any one hybrid-class-specific.<br />
<br />
Plus the ones that are posted in the download areas, plus the ones that are listed in various other forums here besides just the Class Discussion forum.<br />
<br />
Not to mention all the ones that are posted over at the Ranger's Glade.</div></div><hr />

Also lay off the caps... shheesshh</div></div><hr />

Do as i do take what you like from each one. The back ground can be changed on almost all uis.That way you get what works for you. NOT what someone else thinks is best.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nemnoch</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, learn to do a little work with the UI's and come up with something that suits you.<br />
<br />
I loved my UI but got really tired of backgrounds and stuff not matching other things, so over the course of the last two weeks, through trial and error, I learned what I needed to do to change background colours, add the things I wanted from other mods, what would and wouldn't work. All it takes is a littel patience and some free time. If I had a place to post my pics I would load up a screenshot.<br />
