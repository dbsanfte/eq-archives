<br />
Second, If anyone knows Bridget that deals at the Paris Hotel/Casino in Vegas, tell her thank you again.. she was a great dealer and I nearly doubled the money I sat down with at her table (to bad I lost most of it at another hotel)<br />
<br />
Lastly, Had fun and it was a great get away. Hope you all had a good weekend. Came back to a semi-full mail box on my email, sooo if you emailed me, it may be a day or two before i can get through them all<br />
<br />
sooooo here i go back to the grindstone!<br />
