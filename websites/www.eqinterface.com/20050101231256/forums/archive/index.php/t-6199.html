<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">02-01-2003, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm. Looks like old files causing mayhem.<br />
<br />
Try this... delete or move to a backup folder the following files in the directory/folder you use for this UI.<br />
<br />
EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_LootWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_BugReportWnd.xml<br />
<br />
Once you move or delete those files, it will cause the UI to use the up to date files from the default UI folder. This may however change the look of the skin if any of those windows were customized. So again, you might want to just move them to a backup directory so you still have them in case you need them for further reference.<br />
<br />
Once this is done, load up EQ and see how it turns out.  If it's just old files you should be all set... or there might be other problems such as a customized EQUI_Animations.xml file.<br />
<br />
This is a good first step to determining a solution however, as it just might be the only thing wrong. Also, the name of the skin you are using might help too!<br />
<br />
Some users that followed the advice of 'copying the default UI files to your other mods folders' had this happen a whole lot.</div></div><hr />

Easy one first ... do you actually have a custom BugReport Window? If not, just delete it.<br />

Do you actually have a custom Options Window?  I *highly* doubt it and would recommend just deleting it from your custom folder, but if you do, the changes required can be found here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5619), 15 Jan Patch fix.<br />

I tried searching for the UI on this Website but I currently have not been able to find it, it was entitled &quot;Druid&quot; as far as I know and includes only T.King artwork I believe, I will continue to search for it on the chance it might be here somewhere.<br />
<br />
Cairenn, I am truly computer illiterate, and am having problems understanding what I would need to do in the January 9th Patch Fix, so I was not able to do that, as I am afraid me trying to add/delete anything from a custom UI will make it impossible to ever use it, I do truly appreciate any help I can receive on this matter though from both you and Tellgar, and I thank you both very much for the help thus far</div></div><hr />

<br />
*edit* and actually, if you look here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6130&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1) you will see where I walked someone else through basically the exact same changes the other day.<br />
<br />
It may give you an idea of how to do this, if not, post and we'll work something out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">02-02-2003, 04:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess I shoulda put the part that says &quot;you might want to just move them to a backup directory so you still have them in case you need them for further reference.&quot; in bold face, just to make sure it got due attention.<br />
<br />
The fatal error that's causing the skin to stop loading is:<br />
[Sat Feb 01 20:47:01 2003] [Line:194 Source:UIFiles\Default\EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml] Couldn't find class:item 'A_SongBtnPressedFlyby' reference in FieldParseItemOfClass()<br />
<br />
It's trying to reference some changes to files that aren't there in yours. Up until there, it's all ok.<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt you have a custom Options and Bug Report window, so those two don't matter. If the UI you are using is the one I believe it is, you are fine anyway. There weren't many customized windows.<br />
<br />
Since Car has offered to take a hands-on approach, I'll let her take you the rest of the way through it. I have my hands full enough helping friends with their UI's (they should just use mine - shameless self plug there).  :)<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
