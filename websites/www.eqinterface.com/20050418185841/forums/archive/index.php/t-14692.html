DarkSir23 (Moggan Proudfoots - Rathe)<br />
originally by Statix Cinderblade - Xegony (1.6 and earlier)<br />
Version 1.8.1<br />
<br />
-- NOTE :  As of version 1.7.1, Quartz includes 2 extra Background Packs.  One is the Quartz Blue by Tadayasha and the other is DS Blue, a DarkSir23 Original.<br />
<br />
-- NOTE : I am looking for input regarding the stuff listed under &quot;Coming Soon&quot;... I will give more details on them in this thread, once I get back from running errands. --<br />
<br />
Coming Soon:<br />
  * Quartz Inventory Window (finished)<br />
  * Quartz Combat Skills Window (Two planned, one finished)<br />
  * UI Installer (Sets your UI ini files with correct window locations, etc)<br />
<br />

  * Added Crystals to Inventory Mod.<br />
  * Fixed Item Graphic problems.<br />
<br />

    OOW Buff Window.<br />
<br />
v1.7.2<br />

  * Added optional Inventory Window.<br />
  * Combat Abilities Window Added.  Takes the same position as the Spell Gems for casters.<br />
  * Changed the optional non-caster group window to GroupWindow-Wide, for people without Spell<br />
    or Combat Ability Windows.<br />
<br />
v1.7.1<br />
  * Integrated the Quartz Blue background pack by Tadayasha.<br />
  * Integrated an all new DS Blue background pack by DarkSir23.<br />
  * Rewrote a lot of the instructions.<br />
<br />
v1.7<br />
  * Added Group Leadership AA Bar to Player Window.<br />
  * Added Mana and Endurance pool/max numbers to Player Window.<br />
  * Changed Sta label to End label.<br />
  * Modified Flashing Attack Indicator for Player Window.<br />

  * Added LFG Button to Group Window.<br />
  * Added a third chat window to the default config.<br />
  * Minor tweaks to make the UI compliant with the current requirements (Got rid of the &quot;Your XML files are incompatible&quot; error every time you zone).<br />
<br />
v1.6<br />
  * After the Jan 9 2003 patch the selectorwindow and pet window had to be tweaked slightly to comply with something verant changed (this was causing the 'your everquest files to not match' garbage to  come up every time you zoned.<br />
  * Made changing mods easier, and removed the config.bat that doesn't work on XP.<br />
  * Added in a Quartz mp3 player mod :) looks nice!<br />
  * Quartz 1.6 comes with the patch released after version 1.5 so it is completely up to date.<br />
  * Gave the Short Duration (songs) buff box a texture.<br />
<br />
v1.5<br />
  * Fixed the Stablity (Likelyness for verant patches to NOT break UI) by a large amount by reconfiguring how Quartz gets its graphics/templates, the only way it should break is if verant adds in a new 'required' window like RaidWindow.xml, which is a quick fix.<br />
  * Quartz should now easily work with other mods (such as the spellbook graphics mod :)<br />
  * Fixed the Non-Caster spell casting bar thing that made me thing those emails were from crazy people.<br />
  * Improved the GUI memory useage: This should cause Quartz to lag alot less on those systems with poor videocards that don't adapt to alphatransparency all that well<br />
<br />
For more information on how these changes will affect other mod's and/or how Quartz gets its attributes (all UI makers should follow this design) please goto http://skins.machin-shin.net<br />

  * Added a new Config.bat file for changing between caster/noncaster and configuring buff box.<br />
<br />
v1.2<br />
  * /bazaar crashing bug has been fixed<br />
  * Noncaster groupwindow now has a casting bar<br />
  * The actions window is Moveable but has a light border around it (i had this removed at one point, i don't know why its back)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkSir23</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, last post I said there were a few things that are &quot;Coming Soon&quot;.  I would have just implemented them in 1.7, but I wanted a bit of input first...<br />
<br />
1.  Quartz Inventory Window.  I'm going to try to come up with a matching inventory window for Quartz.  I'm open to suggestions on how it should look...<br />
<br />
2.  Combat Skill Window.  I'm thinking that the combat abilities window could be set up in two possible places.  In the lower left corner (Replacing the spellgems), or in the upper right corner (Replacing the Pet Window).  Given that people may have different tastes, I'm going to make both, and let you choose which one you want.  By default, it will replace the spellgems, but you will be able to switch out that one for a smaller one that takes the pet window.<br />
<br />
3.  Pet Window.  Statix's last update on his site included a new pet window, with the pet-buff window relocated to a second and third tab on the player buff window.  However, this has proven to not work completely (Icons and buff color won't carry over).  So my thought is to make the pet window extend down where the Actions menu is now, giving pet buffs a place to show up.  ALTERNATIVELY:  I've also toyed with making a separate pet window that isn't part of the dashbar.  I'd like to know what you all think...<br />
<br />
4.  UI Installer.  I plan to make an installer that will copy the UI's default window locations over to your individual UIs.  Originally I was going to make this very generic, so others could use it with their UIs, but I think the initial installer will also let you choose which UI options you want (Letting you choose which type of combat abil window you want, which buff window you want, which MP3 player, etc).  Again, I'm open to thoughts on the matter.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorkenthor</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">*Bows in the presence of glory* Thanks so much for taking this over and getting it up-to-date...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorkenthor</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the inventory, what I see in my brain is this:<br />
<br />
A window that sits in the buttom right of the screen just above the dashboard. It would NOT have any of the stats in them or the AA/EXP bars, seeing as we already have them. It would have the money along the bottom and the actual inventory kind of waving (like the guages on the player window) above that. Would also be nice if the buttons (skills, dye, destroy, etc) were all iconified. Like small icons out of the way.. Again wavy like the player window along the edge of the window. Not muli colored perty icons.. just.. hmm.. how do i say it.. Like the icons you see on the menu in a macintosh computer running OS X. The whole window wouldnt be square. It would be square in the bottom right and then wave in and blend to the rest of the dashboard. <br />
<br />
I hope I made what i think clear. Not very good at describing things.<br />
Again.. Thanks for keeping this up to date for us. I love this UI<br />
<br />
For the pet window.<br />
<br />
Im not sure if this is even possible but ill say it.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to add a whole new window to the EQUI? Like add a buff window like the ones that already exist but for pet buffs? maybe put it off in the left? If not, I personally would like it better if an extension to the pet winder were above the dashboard for buffs. I use the actions window a lot and dont want to lose it or have to go digging for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whether or not you can create a new window is irrelevant because the pet buffs MUST go into the pet window.  It could be a tab page withing the pet window, but must ultimately be in the pet window.  <br />
<br />
However, there is a way to kind of cheat and achieve almost the same thing.  Most screen elements have a &lt;RelativePosition&gt; setting, and for most elements this is set to true.  What this does is make any location settings for the element relative to that element's parent window.  For example, if a pet buff icon is defined with a relative position of true, and location of 20,20, then the icon will appear 20 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down from the upper left corner of the PetWindow.  But, if &lt;RelativePosition&gt; is set to false, the any location settings for that element are relative to the entire visble area of the screen.  So, in the above example, with relative position being false, the buff icon would appear near the upper left corner of the screen, regardless of where the parent PetWindow is.<br />
<br />
So, if you do this, it is possible to have the pet buff icons appear in a neat row or column anywhere on the screen you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkSir23</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting thought.. I don't like making anything that people can't move, though...  It would be difficult to align something like that to the right side of the screen, without limiting the resolution that the UI is released under.  One thought has been to make the pet window separate from the dashboard, perhaps making the whole thing look like one of the buff windows, with small controls at the bottom.  <br />
<br />
If I do that, then the pet window area is available for a combat abilities window, or maybe target of target, or a compass... I dunno, there are a lot of possibilities.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of making the inventory screen be similar to the hotkeys window, and have it superimpose over the hotkeys, similar to the way Night Elf does with some of its windows.<br />
<br />
Always open to suggestions,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alun</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's great to see this UI being updated, I've been using it since it came out. I play a melee character, so I've always used the GroupWindow-NonCaster mod. However it's still giving the XML warnings in 1.7.1, so I updated it based on a diff from the caster version.<br />
<br />
My version is attached if you want to just grab it!<br />
<br />
For combat abilities, I replaced my pet window with Tevin's warrior minimalist combat ability window (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3114). Something along those lines but that &quot;fit&quot; better in Quartz would be awesome.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkSir23</div><div class="date">08-01-2004, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I've designed an inventory window that can superimpose over the hotbuttons.  It only includes the main body inventory, money, bags 2,3, 4, 7 and 8, the Autoequip area, and the 6 Inventory screen buttons (Face, Dye, AA, Skills, Destroy, and Done)<br />
<br />
The only problem I have with it is: While the rest of Quartz is usually 40% transparent, it is not.  If it is, the hotbuttons shine through from behind.  So it doen't match perfectly, but it does pop up in an inconspicuous spot.  Since space is limited, the boxes are rather small (The same size as the inventory boxes below it)<br />
<br />
This will be a possible Mod for Quartz, and not part of the default, unless I get a lot of positive feedback about it.  Next step are the two Combat Abilities Windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorkenthor</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh, TABs. BOO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkSir23</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tabs?  Where?<br />
<br />
This is just a normal inventory window that's the same size and shape as the hotkeys button.  When you hit the inventory hotkey, it opens up right on top of them.  Like I said, it's optional, and will be in the next release, but not as a default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fovol</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the status on making a target of target window for the UI?<br />
Same goes for updating the chatwindows so they can more squarely fit into the UI theme and removing the &quot;type here&quot; part for the top 2 windows or shrinking it to just a thick line so you can right click it to set up filters and such... thus giving more viewable text area...<br />
<br />
Is a version of the &quot;player window&quot; in the works that leaves out mana for the pure melee? <br />
<br />
Food for thought, you are working on the combat abilities window.. could make it 2 button wide and have it vertical... So it could slide down in and replace the pet window spot for us pure melee?.. having the timer bar on top...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Player Window without mana:  Will try to include an optional in the next release.<br />
<br />
Combat Abilities:  I'm making two different combat abilities windows.  One that can sit in the bottom left corner, where the spell gems goes, and one that sits in the upper right corner of the dashboard, where the pet window goes.  Both will be available for the next release.<br />
<br />
Chat windows:  I've not given it much thought, but I certainly will.  I'm not sure the input fields can be removed or shrunk, but if they can, I'm all over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fovol</div><div class="date">08-03-2004, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the Target of Target could maybe be a trapezoid that goes in the middle right above the MP3 player... so it kinna blends in... /_______\ kinna idea...<br />
<br />
as for the chat window &quot;input boxes&quot; as it is now, i take my middle chat window and extend the top of it up over the other 2 chat window's input boxes... <br />
<br />
I been using stratix's quartz since UI's were available and his came out... I've yet to find a better one with the form and function of this one... So glad to see someone taking it over and working on it... Thanks alot!</div></div><hr />

One thing to check:  Did you empty the quartz directory before installing the most recent version?</div></div><hr />

Im sitting here opening and closing it becaus its so AWESOME!!! it just FITS there... Absolutly fantastic...</div></div><hr />

DAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN!  You deserve awards my friend... you and stratix... Quartz is best mod out there, hands down.... it's just... its.. yeah... <br />
<br />
The eq community thanks you guys :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fovol</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found this container mod that seems to work flawlessly with quartz... if you are tired of huge ass bags... this one is tight...<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3487<br />
<br />
give it a whirl... the bag slot icons are the same size as the new dashboard inventory... you can line yer bags right there above the inventory, all 8 of em.. real sweet...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkSir23</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny, I used those very same bags, right up til I started working on Quartz as my own project.  (I took out all the other mod bits that I was using, so I could package the interface)<br />
<br />
You're right, they would work well, and I recommend them for anyone that likes to organize their containers.<br />
<br />
I may work on a small container option, as well, but I'd like to start from scratch.  Kinda enjoying the crash-course in EQUI XML I'm giving myself. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fovol</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">crash course or not, yer kicking ass bro...<br />
<br />
Another idea for the interface... a tribute window... quitepossibly use the very same idea as you use for the inventory...<br />
<br />
Or.. a trimmed down version that just shows time left, current favor, and Activate button,  that could replace the pet window or overlap it when turned on...<br />
<br />
More food for thought:  I see most put thier spell buff stuff on the upper part of thier screen, but i like to nestle it down next to the dashboard... perhaps a mod that has a the &quot;arch&quot; part of the windo on the top.. kinna flip flopped for versatility...<br />
<br />
And i'm sure you already know this, but the &quot;short duration buff with names&quot; has extra stuff on it that needs to be trimmed.. <br />
<br />
I'm still blown away by the new inventory and how flawlessly it switches back and forth.. pure genius...<br />
<br />
<br />
Stuff for future: rumored that with AA's you can get 5 additional buff slots and 2 more spell gems... might be something you want to start thinking about for OOW... <br />
<br />
<br />
And for those that dont know or explored this, it's very easy to cusomize yer color for this mod, simply by right clicking and window &gt; background &gt; tint color... you can change the grey to whatever color you desire...  I'm currently using a dark purple of 10 red, 0 green, 25 blue... <br />
<br />
You rock man, keep it going</div></div><hr />

so please (heartfelt plea here), would it be possible to adapt it to OoW expansion as well?? Ninth Spell slot and all, I could not bear to use another UI<br />

Keep watching, it'll be here as soon as I can get it.<br />

Warning to quartz users:  I don't have the originals to work with for the Quartz2Blue background pack.  That said, I will either A: Not be updating the Q2 Blue pack, or B: be removing it entirely.  Input is appreciated.<br />

<br />
Why not leave it the same and just add the 9th gem below the 7th gem staggered as is?  The way the spell gems are is one of the big reasons i like quartz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkSir23</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, the problem with beside the group window is:  It's a different window, I don't think you can move spell gems to other windows.<br />
<br />
Below the 7th might work, I'll have to see how much room there is.<br />
<br />
The only place I know of where there IS room, is the upper right hand of the spell window, next to 2.  But I don't really like that.<br />
<br />
I hope to have the update posted by monday.  Been kinda busy this weekend.<br />

The biggest problem was modifying the buff window graphics without having the original to work with... But oh well. :)<br />
<br />
For NOW, the 9th spell gem is going to go beside #2, just to get the XML compliant, and get it in your hands.  I'll work on placement a bit more for the next patch level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rukog</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great job updating this UI Darksir!  Really appreciate your work on it.  I've been using it since the beginning too, and started to itch for some tweaks due to updated things.<br />
<br />
Now I've got a couple questions.<br />
<br />
1)  I have been grinding to 70 - haven't spent new AA's yet.  Will the 9th spellgem just magically appear when I buy it?  Or should I be seeing some kind of &quot;dead/inactive&quot; slot that's acting as a placeholder for it until I purchase it?  <br />
<br />
I had to do some copying of files when I put the new quartz in to try to keep some custom windows from the previous Quartz that I'd added myself at the top, so don't know if I messed something up.  My spellgems area looks the same, afaik, as it did before.<br />
<br />
2)  Would it be possible to add a few small &quot;tick&quot; marks or translucent blue horizontal lines in the buff box?  The purpose would be to show where the bottom of Buff 15 is (and 16, 17, 18, 19...20 would be obvious like it was when 15 was at the bottom of the buff window).<br />
<br />
Right now, since I haven't purchased the extra buff slots yet either, when I'm getting close to having a full buff box, I have to count manually, and then try to make sure I get my long-term self buff into slot 15 as my &quot;border&quot; indicator.  It's annoying not knowing, with one glance, where buff slot 15 ends (and then the others as I buy the extra slots).  HoT's, buffs, etc. are bouncing and I don't know until I stop and count where my max is.<br />
<br />
I like the buff box, so don't want to simply change it to something that's got numbers.  If it's slightly editable, it'd be perfect.<br />
<br />
Something like:  (Imagine the sides are smooth like normal)<br />
___________<br />
|................|<br />
|................|<br />
|................|<br />
|................|<br />
|................|<br />
|................|<br />
|................|<br />
|................|<br />
|................|<br />
|................| <br />
|................|<br />
|................|<br />
|................|<br />
|................|(ignore the dots...just placeholders)<br />
|_ _ _ _ _ _ |<br />
|_ _ _ _ _ _ |<br />
|_ _ _ _ _ _ |<br />
|_ _ _ _ _ _ |<br />
|_ _ _ _ _ _ |<br />
|__________|<br />
<br />
...where the dashed horizontal lines are either a &quot;bump&quot; in the graphic or a slightly-noticeable colored line...something to indicate quickly when buff slot 15 is about to be filled, etc.<br />
<br />
3)  Finally, I think I remember reading something about this, but I want to be sure...<br />
<br />
Does this/will this have the function of &quot;auto-adjusting&quot; itself when SoE makes new changes to UI's?  I don't know exactly how it worked, but I remember Statix adding something to the package that made it so I didn't have to worry too much when SoE changed/added XML files.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your work on this.  I have almost no knowledge of XML or I'd try to fiddle around and work on a few things myself.<br />

What do you guys think?  Alternatively, I could try to put lines through them, not sure how it'd look... Definately something to check out, tho. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Rukog: <br />
<br />
The spellgem will magically appear to the right of #2 when you buy the AA, yes.<br />
<br />
I think I like the ticks idea better than numbering the buffs.  Will see what I can do.<br />
<br />
And yes, the UI doesn't break terribly when SOE adds anything, the things that Statix did to insure that are still there.  (Except the icons for OOW... Bah)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll do what I can this weekend, or the first of next week.<br />

Thanks for the input,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraith098</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would like to see a number next to each spell buff. As a lvl 69 warrior - I've little time to count how many buffs I have up; watch the number of debuffs, dot's, curses - etc etc that are on me (a high number of OoW mobs cast them); and hold aggro all at the same time (split second distraction could cause me to lose aggro and could cause raid/party wipe out).<br />
<br />
More often than not I have beneficial buffs overwritten because I get hit with 4 or 5 debuffs/dots at once. Would be nice to be able to just glance up and see how many buffs I have - so that I can dump something if I know the mob I'll be fighting has a debuff or DOT.<br />
<br />
One other thing crossed my mind - not sure if it's possible or not... but is there a way to highlight the group leaders name in red in the group window?</div></div><hr />

There seems to be a glitch in the new patch, that has all the Bard Song Buff labels showing as DO NOT USE, I'm seeing if other UIs are having this problem, and am investigating.<br />

P.S. I'm not above accepting donations, but I'm not actively seeking them out.  If you're serious, send me a private message, and I'll give you information. :)  Thanks</div></div><hr />

Do you have any plans to change the pet window?  I like being able to see how long is left on buffs for charmed pets and even mage pets.  Well, even seeing what debuffs are on pets.  For raids its nice to know your bet has a high end dot on it...or that it has brells.<br />

I believie further DoN progression yields yet more buff slots for a total of 25 possible.  Any plans to change that window?<br />

I'm looking at a pet window that will expand down over (or possibly replace) the actions window.  Not sure about that yet, but looking at methods.<br />

Also yes.  The capability is already mostly there, just have to resize the graphic files.  If this keeps up, I won't be able to keep supporting 1024x768 :/</div></div><hr />
