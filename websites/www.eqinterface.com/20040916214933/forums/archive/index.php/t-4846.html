<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tegar</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, well this is a mishmash of several UIs with some hard tweaking and a few mods of my own.  There is quite a bit from Sars and some from Calleals.  <br />
<br />
I tried using several pre-made UIs but there was always something I really didn't like, so I had some fun with mine.  It's nothing special, but a couple that assisted me with it (clerics) asked me to post it after since they were clerics too.<br />
<br />
I really like the large target bar especially that it has the casting bar integrated so I can watch the speed someone is dropping right with the how quickly my heal is casting and know which will finish first. :)<br />
<br />
Sorry the screenie is so dark.  I mistakenly decided to take it in VT, which is probably the darkest zone in the game.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, I am completely happy with it.  Due to my ancient computer and monitor I can't play in those super high resos most seem to use, so space means a lot to me.<br />
<br />
Would love some feedback... good, bad, ugly... whatever. :rolleyes: <br />

I love the buff bar, and the window selector is genius. Were I still playing everquest, my cleric would use this XD</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing is I like my cast bar horizontal and not vertical but other than that I really like it. Can you maybe post it so those that like it can download it to use?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tegar</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a pretty neat site.  I've never been there before and it's not how I made the UI.  I actually downloaded complete UIs and then copied in certain pieces of each other into them.  Then I went and messed with the xml text to make sure everything worked.  Had a lovely problem for a while where all my health/mana bars only had 4 bubbles instead of 5, which is a trademark of Sars and annoyed the hell out of me - couldn't stand all those hundreds of little lines in the bars.  :p <br />
<br />
You couldn't actually replicate mine using that Sars builder.  Three of the best things about it... the long target bar window, the hotkey window with all the bags and inventory slots, and the group window with all the stats and the actual player window in it are all from Caleals (see complete downloads).<br />
<br />
Really all I did was some debugging to get things from 3 different UIs here and some from default (I haven't found an inventory I like better than default) to make everything work together.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback so far. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Post your files please :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ambershine</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would always locate the grp window close to my spell bar so targeting players and casting heals is the fastest possible. I know you can use f1 thru f6 and so on but i dont. Also as a righthanded person it seems awkward to have my spells on the left side of the screen. Otherwise great job</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any know where i can download this mod?<br />
Its very good, and Tegar if you listeting.. please post files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buzzyrd</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and i would love to have this UI, <br />
<br />
I did see thats its a mix and match and it could be duplicated if I had the time but i have a SLOW connection at home and it would take me days to just get the downloads to chop up.<br />
<br />
Can you make this avalible? I would use it for sure!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tegar</div><div class="date">01-19-2003, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't posted it yet because the last patch fuxored it up pretty badly. I made all the required changes to the files with the correct adaptations for my files, but for some reaons I still crash to desktop every time I try and load it.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I will get some time this week to try and get out the kinks of whatever is making it really unhappy and then I will post it. :)</div></div><hr />
