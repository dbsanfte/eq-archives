By request, I'm posting my modded version of Leo's Icey Blue interface.  Credits go to Leo for making a great skin, T.King for the excellent spell icons and gems, and the wealth of information here at EQGUI.<br />

 News for Feb 26, 2003:<br />
Massive updates to the UI for LoY Release.<br />
An all new zip file has been uploaded.<br />
Get it HERE! (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?op=showfiles&amp;catid=45) <br />
<br />
What's changed:<br />

3) Various improvements for future patch compatibility.<br />
4) Bard Icon is now present in the Selector Window<br />
5) New LoY 'Charm Slot' Icon<br />
6) The UI should be able to maintain function through most patches (xml out of date message instead of crashes) for continued use until a patch is available.<br />
<br />
Phew, been keeping me busy lately! Enjoy!<br />
Comments and feedback are welcome.<br />
<br />

*Old News* <br />
<br />
 News for November 25, 2002:<br />
Updated the UI, changes include the following...<br />
1) Incorporated Target Name/HP into the player window.<br />
2) Incorporated Cast Time gauge into the player window.<br />
    Note: Classic Target Bar is still available via Alt+T<br />
3) Streamlined Hotbutton/Inventory window.<br />
    Note: The blank space in bottom corner is intentional, for future use.<br />
4) Spell Casting Bar was made vertical again.<br />
5) Music Player Window made a horizontal 'thin' bar.<br />
6) Included a default UI_Character_SrvNum.ini file for 'As Pictured' function.<br />
<br />
 News for December 11, 2002:<br />
Uploaded melee/hybrid and intelligence based caster player information windows. They will be available as soon as they are approved. You can find them Here (http://www.eqinterface.com/list.php?skinnerid=1205)<br />
<br />
 News for December 12, 2002:<br />
Patch didn't affect anything new, however, if you are getting the 'Your XML files are not compatible' message when zoning just delete the EQUI_BugReportWnd.XML file from your directory. It will then use the up to date version from the default folder. This file was unchanged, but was accidentally included in the zip file.<br />
<br />
 News for January 10, 2002:<br />
Patch for new UI changes (bard box, etc) is attached below. No other changes aside from updating it to be current with latest patch.<br />
<br />
 News for January 28, 2002:<br />
Patch for the changes today (tint window, etc), and fixed a small glitch with the song selection icon on the Selector Window not showing up. Bard song icon modified to match the style of the rest of the layout. The actual bard song window is as yet unmodified pending decisions on what to do with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
already had the blue theme from Icey Blue but wanted the compass that you have here.  <br />
<br />
  when i put the .tga files and equicompass.xml file in, i just get totally blued out compass where i can't see anything in that window hehe.<br />
<br />
  anyone know how to fix this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fahan</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great mod, thanks to Tellgar and Leo.  If thee was one last request I had, it would be for a small open inventory box, with maybe 12 slots, that I could use to customize my clickables, rather than open the inventory window.  I play on a Zek, so clickables tend to be essential.   ;=)<br />
<br />
I have no idea if this is doable, but it would bring everything needed for game play to the 'working' view, hopefully without cluttering the screen.  The ideal implementation would allow drag and drop of the item slots, I guess.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damlo</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love your UI and downloaded if fine.  One thing I would like to change though is 'WIS' in the player info window.  If I have a melee, i would like STR, if I have an int caster, I would like INT.  How can I modify this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fahan, I'm not exactly sure what you are requesting. My modded gui, as it is, adds access to main inventory and weapons on the hotkey window. That's to allow for easy swapping of clickables gear.<br />
<br />
In order to use clickables, they must either be equipped or in a main inventory slot - they can not be used from bags, so I don't see anyway this can be improved?<br />
<br />
Perhaps I am not grasping what you meant correctly?<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
As for the compass modification, the graphic for the compass was added into window_pieces04.tga by default - but Leo had already used that tga file for parts of his custom buttons. Therefore I changed the texture reference to a different tga file.<br />
<br />
To use the compass, you must use the files listed in the download information text file that was attached. That's why this was posted seperate from Leo's main thread - its a divergent modification. (ie: not compatible with Leo's original skin)<br />
<br />
Yes, I realize that this could complicate matters on further updates from Verant. Right now everyone is just tinkering with stuff until it gets settled - everyone is learning which files to pop custom code into, etc...  if there are changes I will update asap.<br />
I'm pretty much forced to, if I want to continue to use my UI. hehe<br />
<br />
--- <br />
<br />
About int/str displays - I will do some editing and post patch files here for melee or int casting classes as soon as I can. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, for you INT casters that want to use this interface, here's a patch file to display INT stat on main player window.<br />
<br />
Note: This IS compatible with both my mod and the original Icey Blue UI by Leo.<br />
<br />
Unzip and replace the EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml file in your UI directory with this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And here's one for melee types that would like to display STR stat in the main player window.<br />

I added a new hotkey box and it has my xp/aaxp on it so now i have it in 2 places and i think the easiest would be to take it off of the player window but i have no clue how to do that. if anyoen could do this it would be awesome or if someone could tell what to change in the xml would be awesome too. thanks a bunch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athion</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, maybe its just me... feel free to yell at me if it is :)<br />
<br />
I can move the Target box, but not resize it, and I can resize the effects box, but not move it... is that intentional, not intentional, or am I just &quot;Click Challenged&quot;? <br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">09-16-2002, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stamina bar was left out. I don't need to see it, on caster it doesn't matter to me - and my melee has more than 100 stamina so it also isn't a factor. I am looking into making a primary display somewhat suited to monks... showing either ATK + Weight, or STR + Weight. Will post here when I decide what to do with it.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">09-20-2002, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrmm, that's certainly strange. I have no troubles at all with trader mode using the skin. Perhaps another mod is creating a problem?  I use the /bazaar and /trader functions very often, and have yet to see any unusual behavior.<br />
<br />
As for submitting to downloads section, I'm certain I will - with due credit given to Leo, as I used his skin as a base.  Right now, I am working out a few glitches that could cause issues with additional patches from Verant.  IE: moving some code from the Animations file to the respective xml files, basically streamlining an already good skin for use with other modifications and compatibility with future UI patches.<br />
<br />
I was kind of caught by surprise, I didn't think it would be receiving so much attention. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quei</div><div class="date">09-20-2002, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think it just might be i have several other mods included into yours, hence loc and maps.  Maybe this is why i am crashing?<br />

One other suggestion is please make the windows so that you can move them normally (the buff window is only resizable not movable) thanks keep up the good work</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arasmis: I looked at the level bars for both HP and Mana... I can't find any disparity between the tooltip pop-up and the actual numerical indicator. They both use the same variable value to determine the number to display. Perhaps it is just refresh lag, I dunno... in any case I don't view it as a critical problem.<br />
<br />
I am also working on making the buff window moveable as well as resizeable... all others operate just fine. The buff window is the only one with the 'no move' glitch.  I have a feeling it's something related to not having a title bar on the window itself, and I am looking into it.<br />
<br />
There are a few other things I am toying with to make the whole thing more appealing to melee types (as I've gotten a lot of requests from friends that play monks and such).<br />
<br />
That's it for the moment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaii</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love your ui!! I just downloaded it today and it's the first time im using the newui for playing and not just selling in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Couple things I was wondering...<br />
<br />
Could you change the WIS to be ATK (I'm a monk and that would be awesome)<br />
<br />
What is the middle bar for? The one that doesn't show up and is 0% all the time.  My guess is stamina?  If so could you fix it so the stamina shows up (again the thing about being a monk)<br />
<br />
I downloaded all your patches but EQ gives me an error message evertime i zone. Somethin like you xml files do not configure with the eq ui files pls load up the default ui =(  It still works but wondering how i can get this message to stop appearing?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the great UI even without the &quot;fixes&quot; I am looking for it rox!<br />
<br />
Jaii</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurrani</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not just you that get's that error message. I downloaded another UI and I get the same message. I also get it everytime I zone. But my skin works fine,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The middle bar that never seems to show up is... the pet bar! When you have a pet (for pet/charm capable characters) this is your pets HP bar.<br />
<br />
A more melee friendly version of the player info window is being worked on... no eta, but it will get done.<br />
<br />
If you are still getting the xml incompatible message after updating... there must be something else left over in the skins directory.<br />
<br />
I probably should have mentioned this in the first place, but I do keep the zip file up to date. I try and update within 24 hours of each patch.  So... I'd recommend clearing out the directory you use for the skin completely, redownloading the zip file... and extracting it to the directory again. That should fix any offhand error messages. See the text file on page 1 post 1 of this thread for download location.  (Side note: Some cosmetic adjustments were made to the casting bar that I never posted... so you might notice a few small changes after extracting the new zip.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arasmis</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">im having a problem with the target either im getting really wierd lag on raids or something cause last time we faught KT everyone else has it showing up as 50% and my bar is showing 2% really messed up not sure how to fix this but i love your UI and if you wouldnt mind taking a look at this id really appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 01:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check your UIErrors.txt file? I'm not able to duplicate this error at all in any form. I know someone mentioned that there was a one percent difference between the actual bar gauges and the 'tooltip' pop-up - but that is simply caused by a delay in the tooltip updating of the UI interface... the gauges are accurate.<br />
<br />
It's possible you are using another mod that is conflicting and causing this rather unusual error: if you find out anything let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alrighty... spent some time reworking the player information window. I really like the results... here's a pic:<br />
<br />
http://members.cox.net/pub-info/newplayerwindow.jpg <br />
<br />
I changed things around a bit. Mana now has a more highly visible sub-bar for a better overall grasp on where/how fast mana is regenerating. The same for the XP and AXP bars.<br />
<br />
The stamina bar is back (due to repeated requests), you'll notice it between the HP and Mana bars.<br />
<br />
Pet title was added above the pet health bar.<br />
<br />
And then the bottom segment. The Melee/Hybrid version shows ATK and Weight.  The Wisdom caster version shows wisdom and weight, and the Int caster shows Int and weight. Attached is the wisdom caster player window... following replies will have the melee and int caster versions.<br />
<br />
I hope the people using this enjoy the changes!  :D</div></div><hr />

NOTICE: Updates, news, etc will now be edited into the first post in order to save EQGUI some storage and avoid overly lengthy postings. This also serves to make checking in and following updates a lot less confusing for people. Some of the older screenshots have been removed as well, the reason being my ISP might soon get annoyed with me... as I am approaching 2,000MB of bandwidth per month! :eek: <br />

New screenshot is located on the first post in this thread as explained above. Also, the UI will now be submitted to the download section.  :cool:</div></div><hr />

Same excellent quality as his other work, but more readily identifiable with the removal of the borders... this makes it much easier for you to identify at a glance what effects are currently active in your buff box. As soon as he is done with them, I'm definitely incorporating them into the UI.  :)<br />
<br />
I've also fired a request to the EQ Dev Team with the question... 'Will you, at any point, be adding EQ Types for the health levels of /raid members?'. This has come up in many discussions with fellow players, and I think it's something that would greatly aid in the organization and implementation of raids. There is some concern about bandwidth impact (given the max size of a /raid is 72 characters), but I'm skeptical as to the seriousness of it. In any case, this is something I'd really like to see some thought put towards, and I'll post here any information I get back.</div></div><hr />

On another note:<br />
I've been pretty comfortable with the UI in its current state, and haven't made any large scale changes. I'm curious if any users of this UI are interested in seeing particular changes or features added, problems addressed, or areas for improvement.  Feel free to post or PM them to me.<br />

Not sure if my suggestion is possible and still maintain the effeciency of space, but would be nice to have the spellcasting window with the names of the spells.

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've checked out a few of the existing mods for text inclusive effect boxes. Definitely nifty, but the problem I had with it is the fact that it takes up quite a bit of space. (The current effect box is pretty compact, as you might have noticed).<br />
<br />
I'm already using what I like to consider the maximum amount of space for information. I like to keep a wide horizontal as well as moderate vertical range of vision... it's often critical to know what is going on around me both solo and in groups. I'm semi-often a healer groups depend on, as well as crowd-control in certain situations using ensnare/root methods if no Enchanter/Bard is present or assisting if they become temporarily overwhelmed. Druid is my primary character, and a druid that sits back throwing around dots and an epic click here and there is... well... lazy. Uh.. back to the subject, sorry!  ;) <br />
<br />
I could increase my resolution to have more area to work with, but I prefer 1024 x 768. Due in part to performance issues, compatibility with not so state-of-the-art systems, and plain old visibility. At higher resolutions the extra space really becomes counter-productive, as it gets more difficult to read/see items clearly without enlarging them and thus eating the space you just created while simultaneously reducing framerate and response time.<br />
<br />
Ok.... so, enough about what I don't like - and time for what I had been toying around with as an *alternative solution* (because I really do like the idea of being able to see a list of current effects, as well as for some other things).<br />
<br />
Here's the idea...<br />
Replacing another window with an effect list (possibly other info as well, resists or the sort)... an on demand pop-up list of what buffs-debuffs are currently effecting your character. That way you can hit a key, see what you have, and close it again - keeping your view at a maximum when you don't need such verbose information.  I'm semi-sure it's possible to do, though I have not actually had time to test it.<br />
<br />
What do you think? I'd been pondering it on and off for a while now, your post brought it back into focus (thanks Skarlett). I'll play with the interface a bit and see if it works, and how helpful it would actually, be as soon as I get some time.<br />
<br />
There's always room for improvement. Discovering how, that is the real challenge.<br />

I no longer get the XML error messages every time I zone.  I am only really seeing one small problem that really does not bother me, but if you can offer some advice I would appriciate it.  My function bar has an empty hole where the bard buff window button is supposed to be that turns on and off the window.  I am guessing it is supposed to look like a musical note.  At least that is one of the graphics in the new window pieces file with your patch.  I am also curious if you are going to modify that goofy bard buff window?  I really like the small resizable buff window that comes with this mod.  I would love to see the bard buff window be the same.  As the bard buff window is now it is just too dam big, and I do not need boarders either.  Anything that saves space on my pitiful small monitor = good.

What I'm hoping for, is eventually being able to 'update' the actual download itself (as by this point it is waaaay out of date), that way users don't need to patch a bunch of stuff after they download it. Admins have told me they are working on this currently. :)<br />

I decided to make some cleaner gauges, as I wanted a little bit more visibility on mana regen, mob hp status and a cleaner look to the player window.

<br />
The atk/weight - int/weight player windows are for the older, now out of date version (download blue_v2 and bear with me while I get the atk/weight - int/weight windows for the new version done. You'll love the new gauges I'm sure!).  I'll try and have em uploaded tomorrow, all this patching and graphics editing have worn me out today.<br />
<br />
NOTE: A small glitch with V2 was discovered. The first groupmember in the group window has their hp bar slightly askew (only 11 or 12 pixels, but still looks kinda bad). I'll release the patch for this with the new versions of the player window.<br />

Hope my users are happy with all the new changes, I know I am definitely happy with the look of the new gauges! Mana and xp progress are noticeably easier to follow on the bars.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">any way you could add an invite and disband for group maybe under the prim/sec hand slot?<br />
<br />
Probably not. There's only so much space to work with, I like to keep things compact and the buttons really aren't needed. You can invite and disband groups/members by pressing CTRL+I (Invite/Join) and CTRL+D (Disband/Decline). I use those two key combinations for the group functions, so having a button for them just takes up space I'd rather use for something else.<br />
<br />
It never hurts to ask though, just explaining why they don't exist right now - and probably won't in the future.  I did reserve some slack space in the hotbutton window (you'll notice a small blank area under the mini inventory slots) for future use - maybe something to do with the charm slot eh? :D <br />
<br />
As always suggestions are welcome, I'm always looking for ways to make the UI more compact without sacrificing function. I love having as much at a click of the cursor or a keystroke as I can, but when the UI totally surrounds the view of the game world or encroaches on the view to much, it makes me feel crowded and uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the compliments also.  :)<br />

Do you have hotwindows attached to the opened bags?  I have this currently and would find it hard living without them.<br />

Using them with other Interfaces may have unexpected or strange results. You can certainly try.<br />
<br />
Other mods should work fine as long as the appropriate changes are made. Exceptions to this however are the compass (uses a unique tga file for the compass). One thing to note is that the graphics and gauges are global - if you replace my player window with the one you have, it will use the gauges and graphics from the blue... how this might appear is a mystery until tried.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Gazzaz - Are you sure you downloaded the ATK window V2? It was fine under testing, and the target bar was definitely not removed... just make sure you didn't download the older version of it which did not have a target bar included.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nandayar</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well done yet again.  I have always used this mod since Leo first made it, and then Tellgar went nuts tweaking it.  I have actually started to learn how to code a little XML myself from playing around.  I am now using version 2, and in the tradition of Tellgar I have tweaked it to my likeing.  Somone asked if you can just use components from this mod, and I am here to say yes you can.  As I said Version 2 is the core of my UI, but I have made a few changes.  I stripped all the boarders from just  about every window.  Shrank the size of the hotbox window.  I use the new TKing compact celtic Inv, but use the ice Blue window pieces for the actual item slots.  I use one of Remelio's Player/Group combo windows, but it has the Ice Blue look to it.  I just can not leave my mod alone hehehe.  I have mixed and matched so much I can not remember all of the different mods I have blended.  By using Tellgar's V2 Ice Blue as my core I can continue to use his Animations and main UI xml files for most patches.  Soetimes it is tricky, but it just feels right to have the mod exactly the way you want it.  Keep up the great work Tellgar, and I will keep learning more about xml.  ;)</div></div><hr />

If so, how do they look in Remy's group/player window? Just curious, so far all the users I talk to on my server love the new gauges over the old.<br />
<br />
I didn't like the graphic EQ used for the Charm slot at all. I mean, what was that thing? Looked a disfigured grey blob of who-knows-what! So I used the 'crow foot on a chain' graphic from Everquest itself as the charm slot icon. The charms seem really interesting, at least from the information released thus far.  :)</div></div><hr />

I kept the original window_pieces01  just as personal preferance.  The new guages you made are certainly clean and clear.  I just tend to stay away from things that look to me as hi-tech, perfect, clean.  I try to avoid things that are square and sharp looking.  I prefer to keep things closer to the fantasy feel. I tried blending in Drakah's version of TKings player, group and hotkey windows to my current mod, but they are just too dam big.  I am already using the TKing compact celtic invantory window blended with the IceyBlue item slots and buttons.  It looks great to me.  :) I am trying to figure out if I have a program like photo shop that is capable of shrinking them down.  I really do not know how to do stuff like that, and really have no idea what program I would even attempt to use.  Your choice for the charm slot graphic was right on the money.</div></div><hr />

The generic fixes in the Patch thread worked.  The WindowSelect bar will be missing a few keys (unless you update Windowspieces.04).  I would suggest not making any changes to the inventory.xml though (buttons are out of place).  <br />
<br />
You can use key commands to access any of the new features without the buttons, while we wait.</div></div><hr />

LoY patching is all complete, sorry for the small delay - but there were some quirks that popped up and I also have other duties.  All is well and working though.<br />
<br />
The new download can be found HERE. (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?op=showfiles&amp;catid=45) <br />

I recommend that you clean out the UI directory, install the new zip and re-add any other mods you might be using.</div></div><hr />

Just been busy, and thus far none of the additions made to the UI impacted my current version much. I've been happy with it (and apparently so have its fans) so there haven't been any real changes.<br />
<br />
Aside from a message saying that its out of date - it actually functions just fine (this is caused by the devs need to apparently annoy everyone who didn't want percents on everything and add them in anyway).  I'll be cleaning that up, as well as making the additions necessary for the new expansion (LDoN) and other adjustments and fine tuning when the time comes. Which is in the near future! (Man I'm looking forward to LDoN)<br />

Another big thank you for this wonderful skin.  I think that this skin (and 177aa's lol) has totally improved my enjoyment of EQ.  I also was dismayed today when it was zapped.

Update can be downloaded HERE (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1436) .<br />

(Note: It will say your files are incompatible, that is because of the new hotbutton code they slapped in. It functions fine, I'm just not willing to rework the entire hotbutton xml file until I'm sure they are done screwing around with it. I don't see any reason for the changes they made... if anything, its ugly as heck! I like mine better.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They aren't default (I can't stand the default icons), they are different however. The icons that are now included are T.Kings G2 spell icons/gems (standard release). Previously it was the 1.04 versions.<br />
<br />
Link to his other work/versions (in case you prefer them) is here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?s=&amp;op=showfiles&amp;catid=27&amp;sortby=date&amp;sortorder=DESC) .<br />
<br />
I like the G2 release, as I am of the opinion they are more intuitive and less cluttered at smaller sizes.  I also debated with myself over including them, but in the end decided that it was less work for the user since they are so popular.  Included, of course, were full credits to Thomus for his excellent work on those fantastic icons. ;)<br />
<br />
-- Short note about the current status of the interface--<br />
<br />
I'm fairly happy with the current state of the UI. It's compact enough to run at 1024x768 or more with ample field of view in both first person and external camera. Even those who are using it at 800x600 seem to be happy.<br />
<br />
I've been contemplating the hotbutton window a bit - mainly the mini-inventory next to the actual hotbuttons. I use it (though not as much as I had)... and was possibly considering trimming it down to just the main weapon slots and the last two main inventory slots.  This for reasons of reducing the amount of screen coverage used for information display. I'm not exactly sure though, as I do like having the inventory there for easy access without having to open another window.  Any suggestions, comments, or input is welcome. (Do you use it, do you hate it, do you love it and wouldn't change it at all? etc.)  For now I'm leaving it as is in the working version and fiddling with it on my spare time.<br />
<br />
I've also been thinking of adding small numerical values next to the spell cast icons on the spell casting bar, and possibly the buff status window (while trying to keep them around their current size). I find myself having to manage my buffs more and more, particularly during raids. So many buffs, only 15 slots... my current method was to 'size' the buff window horizontally so that only the 15 allowed will fit. Thus I know when I am running out of room for buffs, and can easily cancel non-critical effects or organize them efficiently for encounters against debuffing mobs and the sort. Again, any input on this (good idea/bad idea) is welcome from those that currently use it).<br />
<br />
That's it for now,<br />

<br />
I for one use this at 800 x 600. (Old age and bad eyes = bad combo for trying to play at higer resolutions hehe) The way I have it set is: Upper left going Vert down the side the buff bar. My main is a 65 beastie and I have an aweful habbit of clicking off buffs at the most inopportune times (I.E. Agroing XXXX uber mob in 15 seconds) Ugh! So I moved it up and out of the way of errant mouse clicks. Along the top under the window selector thingie is the compass. Upper right I have the Actions window which i promply close after group/raid invite so its out of the way. Bottom left corner I have the player info box stacked on top of the group window. Moving towards the right, next would be the chat box slightly lower in height to allow for the targt box to sit on top of it but be aligned with the rest of the boxes. To the right of that I have the Spell bar and in the bottom right I have the Hotkeys. Sitting atop the hotkeys closed unless I have warder is the pet box. Each one is set to fade to 5 except for the spellbar which is set at 20 I think. Not too dark but there. <br />
<br />
<br />
The mini inventory I use ALL the time. Might be because I've been doing the Aid Grimel quest, but that is a whole other story :rolleyes: I have stat food/drink in my first bag and my spare weps potions etc in my last since its close to change out (which I do alot of) <br />
<br />
The buff box I also have stretched only as far to allow 15 buffs. Raid times depending on mobs etc it gets close then its decision time on what to drop, but most times I have free buff slots open. <br />
<br />
I started using your mod because I liked the simplicity of it. It is sleek, compact and everything is at a close arms length so to speak and I would hate to see that change. <br />
<br />
There is my two cp's =) Keep up the good work. I for one greatly appreciate it. <br />

Hopefully this will be last update needed until SoE releases LDON, though that depends on them. I'll continue to update it as needed.<br />
<br />
Thank the EQGUI team for making it such a breeze to update files and screenshots on an as-needed basis!!<br />

List of changes, animated preview screenshot, and of course the actual download can be found here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1436)!<br />

The animated screenshot occured to me to be an excellent idea, so users can see what the different windows might look like. :)<br />

I use it all the time for re-arranging heavier loot into my Rallic pack, and it's nice to have when trading with someone too. It's compact enough so that it's not significantly in the way. In fact, there's a little wasted space in there under the primary &amp; secondary slots to add a wrist slot and chest slot or some other clicky arrangement.

<br />
I'm still working on things, touching up parts of the UI I think need improvements.  One thing I'm doing is making blue a little more bard friendly! Customized the bard song window (poor bards, I neglected them). A much better background texture for the windows, which should be a lot more eye pleasing and a little easier to read things like blue cons in the tracking window. Please provide some feedback on this, would like to get an idea what people think of the texture before publishing the updated zip file.<br />
<br />
Making larger version bard and buff windows included in a seperate folder in the UI zip (they would be copied to the main directory to use as the compact version will remain the standard). Still deciding what else to put into the hotbutton window.<br />
<br />
I do have limited time, but this all should be done very soon so have patience with me.  :)  Attached is a screenshot preview of the changes. (A bit of quality lost due to attachment size restrictions)<br />
