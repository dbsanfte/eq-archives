I also keep getting your UI files are not the proper ones message to switch to default, any ideas how I can fix this?</div></div><hr />

First, I split this off the post in the ChitChat forum because this is a specific request for help, as opposed to a discussion about the patch yesterday.<br />
<br />
Next, read through the READ ME (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=44) sub-forum at the top of this forum, specifically the three stickied threads at the top of it.<br />
<br />
Then, if you are still having problems come back here and post again, providing the info we need in order to help you, as outlined in the &quot;Having problems with a skin/mod?&quot; thread.</div></div><hr />

You need this one (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=31256#post31256) first, follow the instructions in that post, then you need this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=31428#post31428) one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok first so everyone knows. I crash to desktop with defalult ui on. <br />
and ive tryed the post above. also wint and made sure all drivers where up to date. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chorty</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kasca i am having the same trouble<br />
<br />
I have downloaded and done as Cairenn said... but it doesnt seem to make a difference.. i have a folder labeled 'Custom' in my UIfiles folder into which i put the corrected file, but still getting booted at zones... how the hell do i tell the game.exe files to use that corrected file and not the incorrect(and patched) default one?<br />
<br />
Pls someone help....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomko44</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following must be in your custom EQUI.xml file<br />
<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_BodyTintWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
You won't get an error message in the UIError.txt file, but it will dump you to Desktop!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Folks, the two downloads I linked to are for *MY* UI skin only, in direct response to the one specific person who posted asking about it.<br />
<br />
The rest of you need to apply the universal fix (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6012) as explained in the Patch Fixes (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=36) forum.  If after applying those you are still crashing out, you then come back here and post your UIError.txt log file.</div></div><hr />
