Ive been thinking a lot about EQ2.  I would like to know what you all thought about the release of it and if you are gonna drop EQ and start playing EQ2.  I have spent a lot of time in developing and playing my character and personally would not like to start from scratch.  I know that there are others who have been playing since EQ was released and have more time spent on their characters.  So I know that changing to EQ2 would be harder for them than me.  So please post anything you want to say about EQ2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just don't like alot of the 'features' it will have and also enjoy playin my many toons now. When EQ1 Dies...that will be the end of my Online Games with Verant .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I myself am looking forward to it... the graphical upgrade (though EQ original has gone through its phases... Sigh I miss the barb bear helm), the new ideas on story line, and equipment wear. Yes it is a take off of DAoC alright, but I have yet to play that game.... (hmmm thinks of heading to the store)<br />
<br />
I like a game that makes twinking difficult if not pricey for weapon upkeep. It also allows people with tradeskills much more valuable instead of those few selected skills. I personally haven't seen anyone shouting &quot;Anyone looking for any good baked goods.&quot; Its mostly just armorer or jeweler. I have tried to rend my baking services to others, only to get &quot;What do I need rat kabobs for?&quot; Its not the purpose of actually needing, but actually of 'just having'... hell first off it gives you a Dex and Agl boost of +1 just for food that is easily made. But its also a good RP feel for the game. Sigh, guess most people will never know.<br />
<br />
But as I said, my wife and I, both are waiting with anticipation for EQ 2 to rise from the shadowed mists to present itself to the world.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking Eq2 is gonna be pretty sweet. Of course I'm gonna keep EQ going till it comes out, then check eq2 out, and see if I wanna switch.<br />
<br />

But the real question is, Does EQ2 Deserve Nanas? :nana: ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanys.Neoconker</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally am not really looking forward to EQ2.  Like many people said, it does look like a Verants/Sonys runoff of DAoC.  What I am really looking forward to is Final Fantasy XI.  I think it will be somewhat like EQ, but at least its a brand new thing and not trying to copy of some other game.  My cousins and I are looking very forward to it and if we like it, we will probably switch to FFXI because its always nice to start out and be among the longest playing of a game and be among the best.  I started EQ after Velious and before Luclin, around June 2000.  I only have low level characters considering the year and a half almost that I have been playing.  I just get tired of seeing people that are way better and higher level with insane amounts of money, when I get lucky when I get enough money to buy my SCHW for my monk.  I see people buying Cloaks of Flames and other items, and its just sickening.  So I want to be the first to start on FFXI, and hopefully be part of the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dillomjm</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont know, some of the things that I have heard of for EQ2 sound pretty cool.  I dont remember where I read it but someone was saying that banks are NOT going to be linked, therefore to move your gear you'd have to hire someone to haul it.. IE a wagon driver or such (merchant type person).  Then you would have to hire mercenaries to defend the wagons, if you wanted the goods to reach your destination.  At the time I read this it sounded like Verant was just toying with different ideas, but if this is true, it would make the game a lot more realistic and fun.  Same with owning buildings and such.  Seriously, it would be aweome to have a house to come home to in-game... Adds a sense of realism.  Thats what I think EQ1 lacks, is a sense of realism in some aspects.  EQ1 has some very good things going for it.. such as how enormous the world feels for a beginner (just like real life), the whole sense of adventure when your doing quests. (However, I think there could be MAJOR improvments in the quest system... I wish you could be able to almost do all your xp'ing through quests.)<br />
<br />
Anyways... I'm going to stop rambling, I'm interested to see what they actually ship the game with in regards to features and realism.  With Verant, however, it sometimes seems that they talk up their games so much that they cant deliver on all the features they promise.  Hell.. look how long it took for us to get the new UI... originally that was going to be a new feature for the Luclin Expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dawson</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there were many things verant said were going to be in EQ when it was released. And  look how long it took them to deliver. <br />
<br />
which makes me wonder how much is going to be immediately available when released. <br />
<br />
I want to see a 3D version of Dragonrealms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Verant is no more! Its SoE now. Just priror to Planes of Power launch they finaly dropped the name Verant.<br />
<br />
It would take a good deal for me to move. I already know so many wonderful people in this game that they would all have to move to EQ2 for me to move as well. Witch I dont think is going to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riksar</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well just so you kow.. FF XI isnt coming to the states.. Thats if you live in the states of course</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dawson</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only way I would consider playing EQ2... is if they had a character move. Which we know they said they wouldn't do since that will corrupt the 'new world'. <br />
<br />
I bet they will have a character transfer service to EQ2 from EQ1 after about a year or so. And probably Charge $200 per account to have all your characters moved Naked and penniless. <br />
<br />
I did not know they dropped the verant name. I learned something today... too bad it had to do with EQ...heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadd</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Ive been playing EQ for almost 2 years now, and dont have planes of goin to EQ2. There are still lotsa places I havent been, lotsa stuff i havent seen. :nana: I like the NANACON</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanys.Neoconker</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Riksar, are you sure about the FFXI not being in the US?  I'm almost positive there's gonna be an American version.  At least there should be.  Most of us now have Network Adapters for PS2, or we can just use our computers if they come out with both.  I don't see why they wouldn't have an American version.  Please confirm this and provide evidence if you can.</div></div><hr />

Here's a little update on your info...<br />
<br />
Square says some 90,000 people are currently subscribed to the Final Fantasy XI PlayOnline servers, and that at any given hour, some 55,000 are playing. Let's hope for better numbers when it hits North America sometime next Spring.<br />
<br />
Square has revealed the minimum system requirement for the PC beta of Final Fantasy XI. While likely close to, or the same as the final requirements, we'll save that until it becomes official. Either way, you're going to need a mighty powerful computer to run this game. It doesn't really come at a surprise. <br />
<br />
Minimum Requirements:<br />
OS: Windows 98/ME/2000/XP<br />
CPU: Intel Pentium III<br />
RAM: 128MB<br />
3D Card: DirectX 8.1/AGP Compatible<br />
Sound: DirectX 8.1 Compatible<br />
Hard Drive: 4.56 GB Free Space<br />
CD-ROM: 4X or Faster<br />
Modem: 56k or Faster <br />
<br />
Recommended:<br />
CPU: Intel Pentium IV<br />
RAM: 256MB<br />
3D Card: Nvidia GeForce 3<br />
CD-ROM: 32X<br />

I have to admit thier monsters are rather 'better' looking... as the ingame screen shot shows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe.. I know what you mean... ahh the days when a game only took 10-50 MEGS of HD... sigh... I guess with technology comes a price... and that price being space and mega memory! Weeeeeee!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I definitely won't be playing EQ2.  Once I get myself back on my feet in RL again, Oguler will return to EQ....  EQ2 is a scam for even more money, and that's it in my eyes.  For me to even consider playing it, we're talking full immersive VR-type worlds, a gameplay system that is so revolutionary there has never been a game like it, and a belief that Quality, not Quantity, is the primary importance in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dawson</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good Point Ogular... <br />
<br />
If they made it so there was no camping multi-day spawns. And Quests were Dynamic and able to be done a couple of different ways (full quest, or several mini quests adding up to the full quest). <br />
<br />
get rid of the pure class system and use a Skill based System with classes but some skills are only usable by certain classes.<br />
And no Limit to Skill Max (but the higher it is the harder it is to improve it)<br />
<br />
for example :<br />
Rangers - only ones who can tracking<br />
Clerics - Only ones who can use 'divine spells' .. aka rez's<br />
bards - only ones who can use magic instruments<br />
<br />
pick locks and detect traps can be learned by anyone but thieves get a bonus to these abilities. <br />
<br />
monsters can drop treasure chests that are usually locked and trapped. <br />
<br />
etc..<br />
<br />
if anyone is familiar with Dragonrealms... this is basically the way they do it. They are the Only TRUE RPG online, since you can play the game and have fun and advance your character and never fight a single creature. It all depends on what you want to do with your character. <br />
I just wish there was a True 3D RPG Online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilee Castus</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not really a decision to play EQ1 or EQ2, this is just something I have been pondering with the release of all the expansions in the last 6 months.  I presently do not plan to play EQ2 but I'm sure once support falls off, worse than it is now, for EQ1 that many people will. (support falls off you ask ?? how many times have you called Tech Help and been connected to a person in under 30min-hour ?? , how many times have you petitioned just to get no reply until days later?).  Imagine what happens when EQ1 becomes Sonys back-burner game.<br />
<br />
Back burner game you say ?? Yes ..how many new release PS1 games have you heard about lately ?? If Sony wants people to move to EQ2 they will get them there 1 way or another.  (No they won't you say ?)  Service drops, expansions are neglected ..bugs don't get fixed, EQ2 is hyped in magazines and reviews &amp; next thing you know..you try it and boom there you are EQ2 playing :( .<br />
<br />
Has anyone noticed the rate of released expansions in the last 6 months ?? Has anyone even put thought into WHY ? so many.  This is only a hypothesis but here goes.  <br />
<br />
   You own a multi billion dollar on-line game &amp; you have sunk untold millions into research &amp; development over years &amp; years.  You have had teams of developers &amp; programmers working on expansion software to make your game even MORE interesting.  Alas... another company puts out a new twist on your game and you hurridly put together a team of developers to counteract this new threat.  Low &amp; behold ... your latest research team says, &quot;Hey !!! check it out..we're done &amp; ready to release our version&quot;.  Suddenly your original Expansion R&amp;D teams are now working on projects that may be obsolete in 6 months.  What to do now ?  Panic ? No......release what we have at $30-$45 a pop and toss in things like items, zones, spells that make each expansion a 'must have'.  I have heard much disappointment in the latest GoD expansion.  I have heard that many quests aren't even functional.. certain aspects don't work proper.  Rememeber launch week ?? Lagg city...Server crashes...etc etc.<br />
<br />
Sony KNEW they were releasing an expansion..they KNEW the traffic would be phenomenal.  Did they expand their servers capacity to hold all this new code and influx of players on at 1 time trying out the nex expansions ? No, they didn't.  Only after weeks of complaints did they add new server and try to get the connection problems under control.  Weeks Im sure that Sony had tons of PO'd customers ranting and flooding with Email.  Is this a permanent fix ? I have no idea but Im banking that it's a (here's Sonys favorite word) 'Patch fix'.  Just to get through until EQ2 comes out and the number of EQ1 players drops to a manageable level.  Was it a good move for Sony to put out all these expansions so close together ?  Well, from a business aspect I have to say heck yes !!.  Recoup some of your R&amp;D money while you still can and while people are still interested in playing EQ1.  They may take a small loss on their R&amp;D dollars but a slight loss is better than a major loss.<br />
<br />
From a customers standpoint..this sucks.  I really DO hope none of this happens &amp; that EQ1 &amp; EQ2 can co-exist..but in reality do you really think they will ??<br />
<br />
Sorry for godawful long rant but it's eating away that these expansions are so rushed in feeling and that they are jipping us the players.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
And If i do get it it would only be after the first few expansions came out. Got jipped on buyin them one at a time on the origional. lol</div></div><hr />
