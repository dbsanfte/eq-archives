<br />
Anyway, the reason I'm using this one is because it has the pet commands included on the same mod. ALSO included are three inventory slots (legs, primary weapon and 8th general inv slot).<br />
<br />
I know nothing about programming .XML but was hoping it would be simple to either <br />
<br />
A) Remove the inventory slots altogether or<br />
<br />
B) Change which slots are visible.<br />
<br />
I'll attach the file here to you experts can take a look. Remember, I didn't write this, I'm not smart enough at this sort of thing. And if the author finds this post, I love it. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks so much.</div></div><hr />

I didn't have a chance to open your file and look...  however in your .xml file(s) there will be a tag:<br />
<br />
&lt;EQType&gt;&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
<br />
in the middle of this tag will be a number...<br />
<br />
All you have to do is replace the number that is in there - with the corresponding number you would like to be in there...<br />
<br />
Here is a chart for the numbers that have to do with the inventory...:<br />
<br />
Inventory EQTags <br />
<br />
EQType <br />
1 LEar <br />
2 Head <br />
3 Face <br />
4 REar <br />
5 Neck <br />
6 Shoulder <br />
7 Arms <br />
8 Back <br />
9 LWrist <br />
10 RWrist <br />
11 Range <br />
12 Hands <br />
13 Primary Slot <br />
14 Secondary Slot <br />
15 LFinger <br />
16 RFinger <br />
17 Chest <br />
18 Legs <br />
19 Feet <br />
20 Belt <br />
21 Ammo <br />
<br />
22 inventory slot top left 1 <br />
23 inventory slot left 2nd <br />
24 inventory slot left 3rd <br />
25 inventory slot left 4th <br />
26 inventory slot top right 1 <br />
27 inventory slot right 2nd <br />
28 inventory slot right 3rd <br />
29 inventory slot right 4th <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just swap the numbers you don't want, with the numbers that you do want...<br />
<br />
