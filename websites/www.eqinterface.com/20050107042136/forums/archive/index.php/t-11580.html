<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dandi</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please be patient with me, this is my first stab at creating a whole new mod. :)  I have created my own custom inventory, mainly just by rearranging and removing things.  I modelled it off of an old inventory UI that I had a while ago but got outdated and buggy.<br />
<br />
I have my class animation overlapping the autoequip box to save space.  But in the old inventory I had, before one of the many patches that broke things, the class animation would fade when I moused over it.  I can't find any code that seems to do that either in the autoequip box or class animation portions of the old xml, but I know it once did it.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to make that happen again?</div></div><hr />

[My guess is that] Too many folks complained about it fading out, so they made it so that it doesn't any more.</div></div><hr />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />
