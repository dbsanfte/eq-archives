Only thing i changed was making the chat boxes 50% translucent, the rest is great.<br />

One problem I'm having though: The STR on the target/stats bar wont update from my char's base stat when buffed. The rest (dex, agi, etc) all work.<br />

<br />
Sgui, the reason you sometimes have trouble clicking on your spell icons, is because the invisible overlap of the target window, if you move the spell bar up by 2 or 3 pixels, the overlap is not so bad, and it should work alot better.<br />

I am glad you were able to fix the problem you had :)<br />
<br />
If anyone might be able to help out my issue... it's a smallish problem, and I can't seem to get anything to work in solving it.<br />
<br />
The Issue: I don't want Stamina bar -- I want a Pet bar -- right where stamina is placed.<br />
<br />
Every time I try to get rid of the stamina bar, or replace it with pet bar, the whole UI fails. I don't know why... I had such good luck with making the spell-casting bar (creating a mana bar and spell casting timer with %'s all in a vertical list of names, but horizontal icons)<br />
<br />
If anyone has any ideas on how to go about making these changes, let me know :)<br />

Basically, from what I gather, someone would have to edit the TargetBox.tga image and adjust the alpha mask. I have no idea how to go about doing this. My knowledge of graphic editing, etc., is very limited. And that image would have to be edited for every resolution offered by Delta 3 UI (I need it edited for 1024x768).</div></div><hr />

I have tried messing with sizing and such in the targetbox.ini and cannot get it right. I have done everthing from have it accross the entire target bar to having it very small like a dot at the end of the hp bar. I also use the 1027x768. It is just sad that such a fine UI is neglected by the maker :(  Is there anyone that can fix this? I really don't want to find a  new one but might just have to. /sigh</div></div><hr />

in grey and 1280x1024 <br />
PLEASE  <br />
<br />
Hmm? I'm confused..<br />
Don't know exactly what you mean.. <br />
Like do you want the grey files for 1280x1024?<br />
<br />
If so.. sorry, I don't have them.<br />
I only play with 1152x864.. so all my fixes are normally for that.<br />
But if people post the other resolutions, I can fix'em.<br />
<br />
I have a whole revamped custom version of Delta3.0<br />
So changed I could almost call it Delta4.0 (but that's Tekyn's...)<br />
Maybe I should call it like Deltil1.0 or something.. lol<br />
<br />
But anyways.. sidetracked..<br />
If you post it, I can fix it..<br />

<br />
http://207.44.246.157/images/targeting.gif<br />
<br />
<br />
Zip includes EQUI_TargetWindow.xml, Target_bg01.tga and TargetBox.tga. Backup your old files before overwriting them. Tested, you shouldn't have any problems.<br />
<br />
I was also playing around with doing this instead, anyone think this would be better?<br />

[EDIT] Tweeked slightly to be more readable, file change to Target_bg01.tga. This is now for BLUE only [EDIT]</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NefariousMethod</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is that, what doesn't work? What are you copying over, what do you get when you try?<br />
<br />
That's not much to go on, try to give me some info so I can fix it if there is indeed a problem on my end.<br />
<br />
Things to remember:<br />
<br />
1. Copy files to ~/uifiles/delta3/* (you will get overwrite y/n prompt. NOT another folder inside delta3)<br />
<br />
2. Make sure you have patched on that particular machine<br />
<br />
3. Make sure you are using Tekyn's delta3.0 as I noted in the file name, not any other version including 2 or whatever else cause I haven't tested those.<br />
<br />
4. This is for 1280x1024<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone else having problems?<br />
<br />
Btw, in the meantime while Tekyn updates his great UI here is the entire current working version of Delta3 1280x1024 blue.<br />

When I copy the files over into the DeltaX (what i call my version of it) folder,<br />
it asks about the overwrite, which I let it do. I then log into eq and<br />
load the UI 1. What comes up is a combination of default and Delta.<br />
The regular Delta target bar is gone, the hot keys are from default,<br />
but the borders around everything are from Delta.<br />
I run at 1280 x 1024 in the grey theme.<br />
<br />
Edit:  really liek the &quot;turn signal&quot; idea you have for the /con.<br />
hope that you can make that one work too.<br />
<br />
Edit 2:  New information. We (Moze and I) use the target window <br />
that has the red ring around the displayed hit points to let us know<br />
that attack is ON. On our version, the hit points themselves are<br />
not attached to the Alt-T window. I am sure that is why your patch<br />
isn't working for our version. If there is a way to make yours<br />
have the attack on ring, that would be super.</div></div><hr />

Sorry i havent posted in a while, under this ui, i kinda stopped using, as i found another that fit me better, i still use it on my shaman though, and having no problems what so ever, except i have no attack indicator or con indicator, i will be looking into a way of making that, and also making the combatwindow ito look like the spell window for pure melees, i still need to think about how it will work for hybrids, that have spells and combat abilities.<br />

do anyone have any ideas? on how to make this best suited for everyone?</div></div><hr />

How to install:<br />

Download Tekyns Delta3.0, copy the files from my Alonefixed1280x1024 zip, and you should be good to go.<br />

That would be a good place to put an autoattack indicator maybe. Put the hp's back in and wrap the indicator around it. Not sure if that is possible, but just a suggestion.<br />

I noticed with the combat abilities when you activate an ability it shows an icon. Would it be possible to replace the standard button for the disc/ability with the corresponding icon? <br />
<br />
The UI as it stands now is absolutely perfect functionally for pure melee's, but you're right when you said that the CAW looks kind of crude to the eye even though functionally it's perfect.<br />

<br />
Now, like others, I have a wish list:<br />
<br />
1. I'd like to have the spells in a vertical format similar to what Nylith offered (but not the other changes that he added): http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=51676#post51676  This will also help hybrid classes use both the spell cast window and the combat abilities window simultaneously.<br />
<br />
2. My combat abilities buttons are quite illegible in the most recent addition posted by Alone.  I'm glad to see something that fits where the current spell cast window fits, but it would be nice if the buttons were easier to read, somehow.<br />
<br />
3. I added the auto attack blinking around the player window, but somebody else suggested a simple dot/square/something, instead of a flashing outline.  Has anybody figured out how to do that?<br />
<br />
I'll attach a screen shot to show you what I'm using so far.  I'd be happy to post anything else that you want to see.<br />

Looks great!  I really like the vertical spell cast window (as I mentioned above).  I figure you're still working on stuff like the con color around the target hp bar.   Speaking of hp bars, I'm assuming that you've blurred out your character name (otherwise, what's that tan bar in the middle of your hps?).<br />
<br />
Have you figured out anything to indicate auto-attack other than the flashing box?  A simple indicator would be really nice, but I'm not sure it can be done.<br />
<br />
I don't play a pet class, nor do I use the mp3 player.  Any idea what I might stick in the hole on the right?  I typically use the actions window, but keep it on the left by my hotkeys and inventory.  I make my left chat window a little narrower, and reduce the font size for all my combat spam.  It leaves my interface a little non-symmetric, but is functional.<br />
<br />
Finally, any word on an updated combat abilities window?  Oh, and the weight is no longer displayed.  Is that on purpose?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all of your work!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalken</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the way this looks thus far. My main is a rogue. That's what I play 90% of the time and DElta3 was almost perfect for rogues and other pure melees. The rest of the time I play a bard and shaman. The pet window makes Delta4 nice for both of them, but not so good for the rogue.<br />
<br />
My Delta4 wishlist:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Combat Ability Window centered similar to the caster bar in Delta3. I found a mod for Delta3 that did that very thing, but then it sucked for my bard and shaman. The vertical caster bar works looks really nice and having the CAW centered would work well for hybrids and pure melee.<br />
<br />
 Tabbed pet window that will work as a nice alternative for non pet classes. Maybe put in clickies or something useful like that on a seperate tab. Or maybe just something pleasing to the eye like Tking's class icon things. The window selector can go since I think most people just turn it off an on with Alt+W when they need it. That will give you more room for the tabs.<br />
<br />
 Outlining the target window with the con color. Pretty much a must now.<br />
<br />
 Auto attack indicator of some kind. Delta3 mod that I'm using now has the auto attack indicator as a flashing box around the hp area. Using the Alt+Y window. Would prefer something like having one red led light on each side of the hp area that goes bright red when auto attack is on and dark red when auto attack is off.<br />
<br />
 Also there has to be an 1152x864 version in grey :p<br />
<br />
<br />
I've got some other ideas I'll post later when I have more time. Glad to have you back Tekyn.<br />

1) Any class that can use combat abilioties anytime in there career can open the CAW.  It just won't have any of the buttons actually used.  <br />
2) You can create level 25 characters on the test server using the /testbuff command in game.  The first combat ability is gained by pure melee at level 20, called Focused Will or something similar.  The book needed to gain this ability costs only 3cp or so, and is sold on the main level of the library in PoK as well as the tunnel in EC.</div></div><hr />

I, by far, prefer a horizontal spell bar, so I don't have to drag my cursor all the way to the left side of the screen, far away from my attack and range keys. The horizontal spell bar is what made me choose Delta 3.0. I hope to see the spell bar remain horizontal, in my opinion--the way it should be.<br />

<br />
As stated somewhere up above, I prefer the vertical orientation of the spell cast window gems.  I'd like to try to understand how you are using that window, so that I can understand the strengths of horizontally-orientated spell gems.<br />
<br />
First, I play a warrior as my main, but I do have caster alts.<br />
<br />
Now, it seems as if you click on the spell gems to cast your spells.  Do you ever use your keyboard to cast spells?  Or just when they are hotkeyed?  I will most often cast from my keyboard and don't usually hotkey my spells.<br />
<br />
Do you ever need to see the names of the spells in each slot, or do you just remember what is there (or use the spell gems as reminders)?  Since my casters are my alts, I find it very useful to have the names of the spells handy so that I can make a quick decision as to which one to cast.  The horizontal orientation doesn't allow me to read the names of the spell gems very easily, since (a) the names run over each other and (b) I have to press and hold the Alt key to see the names.  I prefer the vertical orientation because of exactly that: (a) the spell names are all legible and (b) they are always displayed.<br />
<br />
One final thought is that when playing hybrids, the same space cannot be occupied by both the spell cast window and the combat abilities window.  I would make the same argument you made about not wanting to move my cursor much when dealing with the combat abilities window (as opposed to your defense of the spell cast window).  I use my mouse for those buttons and not the keyboard, since they're used much less frequently than many abilities.  I guess then, the CAW could be vertical, too, which would offer a better display of the ability names, but at a loss of real estate (I like plenty of unobstructed space when playing a melee).<br />
<br />
In any event, I appreciate that we have differing preferences.  Maybe Tekyn can come up with something that allows a few different options that might satisfy both camps!</div></div><hr />

I like how your CAW looks!  I do have a few of questions, though.<br />
<br />
First, how do the ability names get truncated?  It looks like the first word fits and the rest is truncated (eg. &quot;Resistant Discipline&quot; shows up as &quot;Resistant&quot;).  As a warrior, I sometimes use the &quot;Might Strike Discipline&quot;.  I'm wondering how that'll look.<br />
<br />
Second, how wide is that image?  Will it fit in the gap in the delta ui?<br />
<br />
Third, where is the endurance bar?  As a warrior, I could revert back to the stamina bar on my health bar, but that wouldn't work for pet classes who use that space for pet health.<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm not near my home computer right now, so I can't try your window myself at this time.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

The buttons are displaying the named with word wrapping.  I shrunk them down until you could only see the first line.  All of the disciplines that I have tried wrap at the word discipline, in oder to make it not show up I had to make the button only 14px tall.<br />

I posted this as something that you might be able to use, not as a mod that I made specificaly for the Delta UI.  I do not know where the Endurance bar is located in teh Delta UI.  The default UI has Endurance in the Player Window.<br />

  Do you ever use your keyboard to cast spells?  Or just when they are hotkeyed? <br />

Only when they are hotkeyed, and I only have one spell hotkeyed .  . .<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
I only want to see the names of the spells if my mouse pointer is over the spell. I know what spells are where; I'm the guy who put them there. Moreover, I don't like text cluttering up my screen unnecessarily. I don't need to constantly see the names of the spells. I know what spells are where, and they rarely change, except for a single buff slot that I switch out (the last spell slot).<br />
<br />
One final thought is that when playing hybrids, the same space cannot be occupied by both the spell cast window and the combat abilities window.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure I understand what you're referring to or what the perceived problem is.  I don't perceive this as being an issue with any spell cast window, be it vertical or horizontal. However, I do prefer having both in close proximity of one another.<br />

Thanks for the info.  We seem to have some differences in style/needs (who doesn't).  When you play your main, you know exactly what is supposed to be where and expect it that way.  When I play my alts, I need constant reminders as to what I'm doing.  I also try to use my keyboard for spell casting and you click the spell cast gems with your mouse.  For these reasons, I see more text as clarifying while you see them as cluttering.  Again, just different styles or points of view...<br />
<br />
One question, though...  Do you see the spell buff names as cluttering in this ui?  Or are they more useful than the spell gem names?  Just curious.<br />
<br />
As for my issue with a space conflict between the spell cast window and the combat ability window, I was referring to the space in the Delta 3.0 ui that is currently dedicated to the horizontal spell cast window.  I've reused that same space for a combat ability window because there is no need for a spell cast window with my warrior.  If you want both windows, however, they cannot go in the same spot in the ui.  That was my point.  I'm sure you agree and seem to indicate you don't care where they are as long as they are in close proximity to each other.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the reply,<br />

<br />
I had a look at the screen shot you posted.  It looks very different than the Delta 3.0 UI that I know.  There are some elements from it, but it is way different.  Please have a look at the screen shot I posted on page 23 to see the differences that I speak of.<br />
<br />
FWIW, I like the organization of the Delta 3 ui.  Everything seems to fit into its own place.  I suppose I could look at rearranging the pieces and only including what I need, but it wouldn't have that nice integrated feel that I like.<br />

<br />
I do prefer to see the spell buff names (the right hand side vertical bar), simply because I use the original spell buff pictures (easier for me to identify what they are), and some spell buffs share the exact same picture icon, even though they have slightly different effects (and are enirely different spell buffs).<br />
<br />
I'm sure you agree and seem to indicate you don't care where they are as long as they are in close proximity to each other. <br />
<br />
Pretty much. I'm accustomed to having my attack click keys (having played for a long time with the original EQ UI) at the bottom right, and, in turn, I prefer a low positioned horizontal spell bar, because the distance my mouse has to travel is shortened.<br />
<br />
I guess you're right; it's a matter of playing style.<br />
<br />
***One thing I would really like to see instead of a mana bar being shown as a percentage out of 100,  is my total mana pool, like the way hp is shown, so that I can tell exactly how much my total mana pool increases when my wisdom stat increases. I have no idea if this is possible or not, but it would be nice.***<br />

Here's a pic of the ui I downloaded originally: http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=2160 .  AFAIK, it has always been labelled as Delta3.  Of course, that could've stood for 2.3 and not 3.0, but Tekyn recently posted a note about Delta 4.0 (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=64147#post64147).  Either way, it seems that you've found a version of delta that has been modified to your liking.  I still really like the original version, and hope that 4.0 will fix some of the minor enhancements that I'd like to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting...  I'd ask you which set of spell casting gems you use, but I wouldn't know one from another (I use whatever was posted with the delta3 ui orginally, whichever that is).  That issue you describe with duplicate buff pictures is something that I have experienced with spell gems as well.  (A friend of mine experienced the same thing when his wizard alt ported into Hate instead of where he thought he was going!)  That's another reason I like the spell name displayed.  I suppose that if I were playing the char as a main, though, it wouldn't matter nearly as much.<br />

<br />
NO 1024x768 version.  (I will add it later because well the graphics were too damn crampped then i had thought so i need to rework)<br />
<br />
NO horizontal combat abilities window...(soon though)<br />

<br />
Things I like:<br />
<br />
The con indicator is a pretty cool idea. Previously I had been using mods that put the con color around the target thing. I think this is a better implementation.<br />
<br />
I like the pet window. Works well for my shaman and bard. Unfortunately it's simply wasted space for my rogue and other pure melees.<br />
<br />
The new horizontal spell bar is nice and compact and looks good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestions:<br />
<br />
Maybe make the pet window tabbed to include player windows or clickies or something. That would give pure melees or non-pet casters some use from that space.<br />
<br />
Some kind of auto attack indicator other than what is there now with the player window (alt-y). Personally I'd prefer something similar to the Con light thing ya got going on. Having a light that shines bright red when auto attack is on and either black or dark shade of red when auto attack is off would be cool.<br />
<br />
Other than a horizontal Combat Abilities Window similar to the spell casting bar which you already said you were planning on doing Delta4 is perfect for me.<br />

<br />
Ok so that eliminates one of my 3 wishes. Probably wouldn't have used a tabbed pet window with clickies and character info anyway.<br />
<br />
So now all Delta4 needs is the horizontal CAW window that is centered and a &quot;cooler&quot; auto attack indicator and I will never bug you again.<br />

<br />
Biggest request I would have for Delta4 (and may be a simple fix that I can figure out myself) - put title bars back on chat windows.  Found out the hard way last night that once I make a window, I can't close it... and the only way to move it is to resize it into place, which is kind of annoying.<br />
<br />
I play a cleric, so when I raid, I open a new chat window and sent the healing channel to that window.  Since I don't need to look around too much on raids, this usually winds up covering about half my screen with UI and windows... when the raid is done I close the window so I can see normally while adventuring.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is an amazing UI - definitely one of the best I've played with, please keep up the awesome work!!</div></div><hr />

There was a fix to Delta 3 somewhere up above that I used and it worked very well.  I haven't tried DL'ing delta 4, yet, but plan to soon (since tonight is raid night, it may wait until this weekend, though).  If nobody has posted a fix for you by then, I'll see if I can remember what the change was.  I recall that it was a simple true/false value for the close button.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, after trying that I discovered 2 things.<br />
<br />
First, It shrinks the available chat space a little more than I like, and second, it didn't actually do what I wanted, which was to enable the ability to close the window, lol<br />
<br />
Incognitogamer - Tried that right click idea last night after I made my first extra window, but the option for &quot;Close&quot; is greyed out and thus non-selectable.<br />
<br />
Adawen - nice work around, I hadn't thought of that.  I don't switch UIs much, so that idea hadn't occured to me.  Too much work for me though... takes my computer up to 30 sec to switch UIs sometimes, during which I may as well be linkdead.<br />
<br />
Still, with Mortis42 pointing me in the right direction, I found that if you edit the EQUI_ChatWindow.xml like so:<br />
<br />
Change<br />
&lt;Style_Closebox&gt;false&lt;/Style_Closebox&gt;<br />
to<br />
&lt;Style_Closebox&gt;true&lt;/Style_Closebox&gt;<br />
<br />
Then you can do what Incognitogamer suggests.  Note that making this change did NOT put an actual checkmark in the title bar when I had those turned on.<br />
<br />
Since that gave me the ability to close windows, I then went back and undid the changes that Mortis42 suggested, which opened up that extra line of chat room, and I can still close my windows through right clicking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tekyn</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So after much research...only hybrids and melee's have combat skills right?  and hybrids only have 4 while pure melees have more then 8 right?  And there is a spell buff icon like thingy that appears when ya use it right? and a bar of some sort...(can someone please clarify what that bar is for thnx) and the name appears aye?  if i am wrong plz tell me.  <br />
<br />
As far as the attack indicator, i find a blinking light thing while playing, or when i used to play, quite annoying.  I may or may not implement one depending on how much money you send to me(make all checks payable to CASH)...all kidding aside i will try and put it as an option...maybe...someday...next year...:D <br />
<br />
As far as the group thingy not in zone but no real difference in color, I am clueless but will look into it...(hard to get people to help me test out UI).  If anyone knows what i did wrong plz post.<br />
<br />
The floating castspell gauge, that haunts you everytime you cast but disappears right after, is scary as hell.  If you wish to do an exorcism on your UI, open the XML file EQUI_CastingWindow and go to the bottom and change the size to <br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
	&lt;CX&gt;0&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
	&lt;CY&gt;0&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
That should fix it...</div></div><hr />

Best UI ive used so far as far as issues they already mentioned When my other group members are in a different zone their Life Bar at the Group windows does not grey out unlike in previous versions of Delta, I play an SK and my Disciplines seem to work just fine,<br />
<br />
A problem for me though is I So got used to the Warcraft 3 Icons and Tekyn has placed the old EQ icons for the spell book and Buff Icons does anyone have any suggestion how I can change this? I have the previous Delta 2 to 3 I was wondering if the Icons there would be fine to cut and paste into the Delta 4 folder if so can someone post a step by step intruction?<br />
<br />
Many Thanks to the Author of this UI you are a Creative Genius keep it up! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as changing the inventory boxes next to the hot buttons, you will need to open EQUI_HotButtonWnd.XML with an editing program and do a search for: &lt;eqtype&gt;#&lt;/eqtype&gt;.<br />
where the &quot;#&quot; corresponds to the list below. Replace the slot number you dont want with the slot number you do (only the number). Then save.<br />
<br />
Inventory EQType:<br />
0 = Charm<br />
1 = LEar<br />
2 = Head<br />
3 = Face<br />
4 = REar<br />
5 = Neck<br />
6 = Shoulder<br />
7 = Arms<br />
8 = Back<br />
9 = LWrist<br />
10 = RWrist<br />
11 = Range<br />
12 = Hands<br />
13 = Primary Slot<br />
14 = Secondary Slot<br />
15 = LFinger<br />
16 = RFinger<br />
17 = Chest<br />
18 = Legs<br />
19 = Feet<br />
20 = Belt<br />
21 = Ammo<br />
22 = Top Left<br />
23 = Top Middle Left<br />
24 = Bottom Middle Left<br />
25 = Bottom Left<br />
26 = Top Right<br />
27 = Top Middle Right<br />
28 = Bottom Middle Right<br />
29 = Bottom Right<br />
<br />
If you are having troubles doing this or my directions are unclear, email me at ken-nek@excite.com. Plz let me know which slots you wanna change and i'll email you the new file you can replace it with. Also a new one should be out soon where you can switch to a second table of inventory items. Hope i addressed all the questions. ~enjoy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should just need to download the spell gems set from here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2867) and unzip this into your Delta4 folder.<br />
<br />
Word of caution though - 1 of these files was updated in the Default with GOD launch, and the download above has not yet been patched to include the new gems.  I haven't run into any problems yet, and my suspicion is that when EQ tries to pull these gems it will come up with just a black or blank gem in place of what should be there, don't know for sure though.</div></div><hr />

How does one go about changing their screen resolution? I'm not sure if I even have the option of 1152x864, though I hope I do. Could any one post to explain and help me?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To change your screen resoltion - assuming WindowsXP:  Right-click on your desktop Select Properties Click on the Settings tab Drag the slider-bar to the setting you desire Click OK<br />
<br />
To Change your screen resolution in EQ: Login to EQ Open the Options window (Alt + O) Choose the Display tab Click the Video Modes button Select the resoultion, refresh rate and bit depth you desire from the choices Click on Accpet<br />
<br />
NOTE: You can only reach a screen resoultion that is supported by both your video card and your monitor. If one of the other can't display a higher resolution, you'll get some strange activity on the screen, and then Windows should reset the display to the previous value. <br />
<br />
Glossary: <br />
Screen Resolition, Video Resolution = The size of the display in Width x Height.  <br />
Refresh Rate = How often the picture redraws.<br />
Bit Depth = The color complexity displayed. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My own suggestions are probably not what the rest of the world wants but what would rock my world in terms of UI.<br />
<br />
Centre console with clickies is too congested, I would replace the existing group bars with buttons for pet commands and move the group bars down to the centre. Something like:<br />
<br />
<br />
          Hitpoint Bar<br />
            Mana Bar<br />
<br />
 Hotbutton Numerical Keypad<br />
<br />
Group Member 1   Group Member 4<br />
Group Member 2   Group Member 5<br />
Group Member 3   Group Member 6<br />
<br />
Also, I would make the existing targets different, the left side would be my pet health, the right hand side would be my target. In the centre of both of these would be a mez timer a la Danyela mod.<br />
<br />
If you could do these alterations as some kind of patch it would be frikkin awesome :)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, the XP bar colours are awful....the old orangey colour is much nicer for regular xp.<br />
<br />
Hope this gives some inspiration!</div></div><hr />

The only  thing I can find wrong with it to this point is that in this resolution the buff window is just about one buff too long (meaning if the window were shrunk to about the bottom of where the next to the last buff is now it would be perfect).  I've been waiting a long time for something to come along to get me to stop using Delta 3.0 because I haven't been able to find updates for it for my resolution and have been trying to do it myself  :eek: This is without a doubt the best UI I've ever seen.

<br />
As far as your suggestions Krash, i am guessing you use pets a lot and probally a chanter.  However, its not pratical for me timewise to try and create seperate styles for seperate classes.  I've tried that before with my previous versions and it was a headache to try and fix after a patch if something had changed.  One time I had a melee and a caster version, in 3 different resolutions, in 2 different colors.  I dont know how the other UI authors can handle so many different UI's.  Anyways, try and post it in request section and maybe someone with your same needs already altered DeltaX.  Good luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wrennd</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great UI, I was glad to see the update.  Here's the two issues that I'd like to see addressed:<br />
<br />
I seem to have lost all color on the buffs window.  It would sure be helpful to at least have red show up when you get hit with a dot, snare, etc.<br />
<br />
HoTT is very hard to read.  I seem to have black text that is in the middle of the health bar.  Since the bar is very thin, I can't read what it says and it's difficult to tell when I lose agro.<br />
<br />
Overall I'd say keep up the good work!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ramzeva</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes please add color to the buff bar ;)<br />
<br />
also the flashing ATK logo keeps disappearing when I alt tab out and nowhere to be found, in 1152 resolution at least.<br />
<br />
the 1152 group bar colors when full group dont seem to match very well, different shades of pink?<br />
<br />
the 1152 ToT name isnt aligned properly, same for 1024 i believe.<br />
<br />
the 1152 CON color text doesnt seem to align up properly with the spot it goes in, works fine in 1024.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

Weeding them out one by one.  The zone out group color thing sucks since I believe its hardcoded to be dark red and that is same as what it is when they are in the same zone.  Only option is to make it a bright red or change the color, blue maybe.  feedback would be nice.  As far as the buff color thing, i know its hard to tell a dot from the other buffs but I had a problem with getting it to display right. (instead of fading gradually like the other deltas before it was more like a color bar strip from dark to light)  Working on getting one to blend more smoothly.<br />
<br />
First i heard of disappearing attack indicator.  Your toggle for player window is not the same as alt tab?  I'll try and look into it.  As far as the ToT bar and labeling goes I dont have a clue as to what you all are talking about cause i never have nor probally will have the chance to see it in action. a screenshot would be nice so i know how far off it is plz thanks.  The CON indicator should match, maybe just out of alginment.  As far as the mana numbers on the horizontal cast bar, i did not see any numbes cut off at the bottom for me.  I will try and see what i can do though.  About swapping sides with the target and player, its not on my high prioroty of my &quot;to do&quot; list.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, also working on left aligned buffs, hybrid combat window thing, shrinking buffs so they fit in 1024 resolution, and other things.  Keep the bugs a coming. i will do best to try and fix em.  I probally wont load the fixes until i get a few more things done, maybe a few days.  Until then, plz endure working as much as time allows.</div></div><hr />
