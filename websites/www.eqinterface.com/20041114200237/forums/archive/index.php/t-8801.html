<br />
I switched to a UI that had small healthbars, and noticed a significant decrease in my speed when it came to keeping those people alive...<br />
<br />
Browsing through WoW's (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com) screenshots, i saw their group set up and considered it for EQ..<br />
<br />
<br />
here it is ;) other windows unfinished, not an in-game screenshot.<br />
<br />
click link for screenshot :)</div></div><hr />

Love the look of most things WoW related, and a UI theme based off of WoW would be awesome, what you have already is enough to make me /drool.<br />
Would LOVE to see this come to be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orison</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very quality...  If you could do a full UI with this theme/style in mind I'm sure it would be quite the shizznit! :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i wanting to make it into a full ui but still trying to get XP bars on the main screen along with working out spellbar, hotbuttons, and modifying the player window to have hp / mana %s<br />
<br />
gotta work something out for the target window as well ;)<br />
<br />
will be a couple days or so before i can post a new update. still gotta do thinkin on composition and stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thelonstormeyes</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW is right, hope you're able to do a full UI based on this idea :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take as long as you need Veirna, I'm just hoping this excellent idea doesn't turn into another one of those &quot;are you ever gonna release this?&quot; mods months later... it's WAYWAYWAY too good for that.  Anyway, keep up the brainstorming and good luck!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elezibeth</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was designing a concept on this one as well. ;)<br />
<br />
Looks good though!</div></div><hr />

Veirna is the best UI maker I know. Glad to see your still at it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm... <br />
<br />
well.. in a matter of 2 days, my guild crashed.. very hard... and it was very dirty.. it even disbanded... fyi ~ never make a guild if you don't plan on staying around for the long haul. My ex-GL made this guild just to see if it was possible to get elemental in 2 months... well. we did it in 52 days, and then he deserted us =P<br />
<br />
still unsure how to react to this, but being very uninterested in the other guilds on my server, my time in EQ may come to a close...<br />
<br />
I don't see myself finishing this UI if i don't go back to EQ... I've started devoting 100% of my time to AO, just waiting to see how things go and what to do about my current state in EQ..<br />
<br />
So, Elizebeth, if you'd like, you can take up the reigns on this themed UI. I'm confident you'd do a great job.<br />
<br />
I'll probably visit you guys ( in lurk mode, as always :P ) but doubtful you'll see anymore mods from me.</div></div><hr />

Ouch, what a shame. :(<br />
<br />
So much time devoted to your character too. :(  Well, good luck in your future projects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">tell me about it ;) very close to 100 days played on my cleric alone, not counting the other alts i have..<br />
<br />
Ah well. Live will go on. There was talk about reformation, but the 2nd in command Guildleader chose not to take this path.<br />
<br />
Two other guilds sprung up in the wake of HoR, one of which is being run by someone i've found that lied to me about themselves, and baited me by acting as a friend, when all they wanted was someone to control :P<br />
<br />
Perhaps something positive will come out of this, only time will tell.</div></div><hr />

Everquest is a great game but people like them ruin it for every one :(  That was a great start too! Hope to see it finished 1  day!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">been tinkering around with the WoW interface since during the time I released the WoW spellbook...I have images rendered that emulate the WoW interface without having to copy off from screenshots to gain quality, but that is sorta still on the backburner until the Shadowbane one is completed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weawen</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say that is one is the pimpest UIs  I have seen, I especially like http://www.blizzard.com/wow/images/screens/all/ss35.jpg  with the spell title in the spell bar, that would be way way way sweet.  Not sure if its possible or not but it still would be cool.  I would enjoy helping make this UI happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sslishta</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the UI, I'm going to Use it now, but to make it more compatible for a lower UI is there anyway just the Hotbar Bank can be shrunk to an 1152x864 width, seems everything else can fit ;)</div></div><hr />
