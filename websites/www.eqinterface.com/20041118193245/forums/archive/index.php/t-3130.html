<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need some help guys.  I've been trying and trying to figure out how to create my own .tgas and/or modify others'.  I have gone through this forum backwards and forwards (lots of great info here, this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=458) thread is great!).  However, try as I might, following every step here, I can NOT get this stuff to work for me.  I'm about ready to either tear my hair out or cry from frustration.<br />
<br />
I'm using PSP 5.0 (it's all I've got).  I tell it to create a new image, with a transparent background.  Fine, blank sheet up now, checkboard (transparent) background.  Draw whatever I want on it.  Go to save it.  Don't have the option to save as 32-bit, but remember reading (somewhere in one of these posts) that you can save as 24-bit compressed.  Do that.  Yes, as a .tga.  Open it back up, or look at it in-game.  It's got a white background.  I just can not get them to stay transparent.  Help!<br />
<br />
*feels very very stupid for not being able to figure this out* :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drestin</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried that same thing at first. Transparent backgrounds just dont seem to work. You have to add an alpha channel to it. Not sure if psp 5 has that option, I know psp 4 ( the version I had ) doesnt. I DLed the trial version of psp 7 and havent had a problem since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've tried to tell it that it has an alpha channel, but I'm not sure if I was doing it right.  If you can, try to explain to me (yet again, I know it's been covered in this forum but it's not making sense to me) what I need to do ?<br />
<br />
Trial Version of PSP 7?  Wouldn't happen to have a link handy, would you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grab a TGA file you already know has a transparet backgorund and erase all the drawing in it, Save AS &quot;Transparent&quot;. Then use that to start with every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still real new with the graphics thing, too, but here's how I do it with PSP7.<br />
<br />
Start like you have been, with a transparent background.<br />
<br />
Draw your doodads, doodles, and niftys.<br />
<br />
When you have you graphics straight, Select All, this should put the selection marquee thingy around edge of your file.<br />
<br />
Now, find 'float' in the selection menu and hit it. This should make the marquee thingy 'hug' the edges of just the graphics you made, it shouldn't include any background. I've managed to do this a number of different ways, so I'm sure there are others, this is just the one that tends to work most often ;) I have also heard of people using 'invert' to get the marquee to hug the edges of your graphic.<br />
<br />
Then, 'save selection as alpha channel'. Again, under the selections menu.<br />
<br />
Then, save your graphic file, you should be good to go.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure my .tgas are getting saved in 32bit, and I don't have a problem with them.<br />

<br />
You can choose the DPI, then choose the dimensions of your document in Inches.. or centimeteres, and then the program will simply mutlipy with DPI to find the pixel dimensions of your image, so that when it prints at the size you have set in inches/cms, it will effectively print the number of dots (pixels) per inches you have chosen ? Makes sense ? <br />
<br />
Only for printing. Forget about it for EQ UI. You can set it to ANYTHING as long as you choose the pixel dimensions of the picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cairenn, I gotta tell ya. I started doing UI mods with psp5.0 and had so much difficulty, I was just about in your state. Making them transparent was/is no easy chore in that version. As soon as I downloaded psp7.04 everything became clear (no pun intended). <br />
<br />
Making transparencies in psp7 is a piece of cake. There are many different methods as people like to do it their own way. I prefer the magic wand method.... click the blackground color with the wand, invert your selection (CTRL+SHIFT+I), then save that selection to the alpha channel. Mind you, it might help to adjust the tolerance of your magic wand. If you have it too high, it will select more than just the background. Play with it a bit for different effects or levels of transparency.<br />
<br />
Get psp7, even the trial edition for now (lasts for 60 days). It'll make your .tga editting a whole lot easier. Not to mention it makes making animated Nanas easy for when you're tired of modding skins.<br />

OMG I would never have figured that out!! I'm totally new to Targas, I KNEW there was a reason they were using them... I just didn't know what!<br />

You guys ROCK, I've been banging my head on the desk all day trying to figure out why my mod has these wierd holes in it!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also had trouble generating tga files with transparency.  I am using a very old version of Fractal Painter and it does not understand that tga's can have alpha.  However, it does understand that tiffs can have alpha.<br />
<br />
So, what I do is output my images as tiffs and use GIMP (Gnu Image Manipulation Program) to convert from tiff to tga.  Somewhere in the process the alpha gets inverted, so I have to save my tiffs with the reverse of the mask I want.</div></div><hr />

no transparency problems except when editing other people's artwork, and then only certain ones cause problems (t.king's Celtic inventory turns white, the other ones don't...)</div></div><hr />

While I know zip about XML other than it's a mark up language (which puts me ahead of 90% of the world's population as far as that goes.) I rather enjoy doing graphics.  I got really hooked on them from a site called Moyra's Web Jewels.  I am not anywhere near her quality of work, but I can always hope to improve myself, and now I have a new inspiration with the EQ UI.<br />
<br />
If you can find a copy of PsP 6 lying around somewhere, I highly suggest you pick it up.  Personally, I'm holding out for Photoshop 7, as I downloaded a demo for my Mac and man, is it SWEET!<br />

Hope this helps, although it seems most of the problem has been resolved.<br />

I have done TGAs with 5 and 6... its not the transparancy of the layer that needs to be fixed..<br />
<br />
its ALPHA channel<br />
<br />
In this image you can see the frame that Xym uses for the compass<br />
http://www.technosapien.net/example/step1.jpg<br />
<br />
Now if you switch from layers to alpha as in this picture<br />
http://www.technosapien.net/example/step2.jpg<br />
<br />
You will see Alpha 1 channel, in this picture i have enable it only<br />
http://www.technosapien.net/example/step3.jpg<br />
<br />
Now on this channel ONLY stuff in while will show through, soo for this example i have erased the left and right filagry ONLY on the alpha channel<br />
http://www.technosapien.net/example/step4.jpg<br />
<br />
Now, if you turn the RGB Channels Back on WITH the Alpha Channel Like this picture<br />
http://www.technosapien.net/example/step5.jpg<br />
<br />
You will see both the full color image, and a &quot;red&quot; mask that is the alpha 1 channel, notice how the filagry is still there on the color image but the alpha channel has it erased.<br />
http://www.technosapien.net/example/step6.jpg<br />
<br />
Save the file as a TGA File, 32-bit, (no transparent Background you notice above)<br />
<br />
when you load it in game this is what you would see<br />
http://www.technosapien.net/example/final.jpg<br />
<br />
TA DA!!! <br />
<br />
Soooo dont worry about that background.. it can be black, white, or any color.. Transparency is determined on the alpha channel.. 100% black NOTHING Shows. 100% white Whole thing shows.. 50% black (grey) and you get semi transparency<br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />

<br />
Is the Alpha Channel where you put the graphics that you WANT to see, or is it for the areas that should be Transparent?<br />
<br />
In other words... say I'm doing a simlpe .gif file with transparency.  I usually use a Hot Pink color to be my transparent color.  Any background areas that I want to disappear in the final viewing of the .gif I make them Hot Pink, define that as the transparent color, and presto - gone.<br />
<br />
Now - thinking along the lines of a .tga file with an Alpha Channel.  If I want those same Hot Pink areas to &quot;disappear&quot; do I put the HOT PINK stuff on the Alhpa Channel, or do I put my picture on the Alpha Channel?<br />
<br />
Sorry to be such a stooge - I'm one of those folks that learns much better if someone Shows me as opposed to reading instructions - so readiing you advise here I tend to catch on a bit slower.  Anyone wanna come to my house and give me PSP 6 Lessons? :)</div></div><hr />

Photoshop7 does use Alpha channel as the previous version did. You have to download the patch though in order to get that feature to work. You can download it at adobe.com.</div></div><hr />
