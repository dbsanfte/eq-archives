I can do the buttons for the hotkeys and maybe the inventory slots also and the pet buttons but as for the guages and spell gems I haven't figured out how to work with those yet. So if anyone can help at all I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maginus</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have completed the Hotbutton window, Group window, Player window (all but the size of the gauges), Target window, Pet window.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I am still unable to locate my options window. I hope that it wasn't used to make that window with the help button on it. Cause I would like to have access to those other options...<br />
<br />
If you know about this skin/UI please let me know about the options window...</div></div><hr />
