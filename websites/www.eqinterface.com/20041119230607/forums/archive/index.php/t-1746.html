<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slizz</div><div class="date">09-03-2002, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded a mod that has spell gems to the left, pet commands on the right, and 3 clickable slots below the pet commands. The pet commands do not work but the spell gems and the clickables do.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a link to a functioning mod like this? It would be very handy for pet classes. It would also be very nice to add an assist button into the pet command area.<br />
<br />
Not sure how to do any of this myself but it seems to be a very good idea so I thought I'd ask here.<br />
<br />
The mod I have was called petspellwin.<br />
<br />
Also looking for a very nice shaman spellbook that was posted for a while and then removed. It was a bear skin look and very nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lysiander</div><div class="date">09-03-2002, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have tried to work with things like this, but so far I wasn't able to make 'new' buttons. I guess they are hardcoded. <br />
<br />
The problem is, that the buttons are only allowed in the window they are supposed to be (If they are renamed or removed the file won't load). And if you just copy them you have to change the name, which makes the game draw the button, but they don't work.<br />
<br />
So as of now, I guess it's impossible to code a window that includes both, spellgems and pet buttons. Sorry.</div></div><hr />

That way people could customize them to pet commands or multiple assists as they need? Or are the effect of the buttons static?</div></div><hr />
