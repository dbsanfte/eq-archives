How about a Cleric-friendly interface? If you are a deleloper that plays a cleric then you probably already realise what is most important to a cleric - Health Bars!<br />
<br />
That's right. Health bars is all we look at all day long. The percent number added to most of them now is great, but it only helps if you are paying attention. How many times has a cleric let you die for not paying attention?<br />
<br />
What we need is BIG in your face health bars, something to really look at... how about 4X long? maybe thicker too<br />
<br />
By all means don't stop there, go ahead and come up with your own ideas for a cleric-friendly interface, but if you only have time for one mod then PLEASE do this cleric a favor!<br />
<br />
Post a link to your BIG *GROUP HEALTH BAR mod here please! Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

The point I was really trying to get at is I just simply need something more to look at. I play on high resolution and get tired of squinting my eyes at one inch of my screen to see group health all day long. If you are a cleric you understand...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorthis</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, i'm getting my post viewed fast enough, how about some of you viewers post your opinion? Tell me what you think. If a developer is going to take this post seriously then i'm going to need some posted support. The developer is going to need to know exactly what we are asking for. Post ideas for the exact details on this thing. What do we want? 4X wide health bars? Do we want them thicker? Do we want anything else added in the module like a HEAL hotkey or inivte/disband buttons? Let's be creative and give a developer something worth doing! :)</div></div><hr />
