<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabbina324</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep my resolution on 1152x864, when I logged in today, my buff bars which i usually keep on the left side of my screen were fine until i zoned. <br />
<br />
Then they shifted just enough to the left where i could move them. When I zoned a third time they were gone. I changed the screen resolution to 1280x768 to move the bars back over to the center of the screen then switched back to 1152x864. They were missing again. <br />
<br />
Finally I changed the resolution to 1024x768 and the buff bars were back where they should be. For some reason it will not work in 1152x864. Anyone have any ideas what would cause this?</div></div><hr />

Mine, in specific, was the buff bar. It slid left every zoning (until it went away).<br />
<br />
In your case, every time you zoned it slid, then recorded its new position into the ui_charname_server.ini, under your resolution. When you switch to another resolution, it loads new window positioning info. When you switch back to your old resolution, it uses the (now incorrect, and having the window off the edge of the screen) geometry/placement info.</div></div><hr />
