<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leo_iCE</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my UI. Thanks to everyone that I borrowed code from. Thanks Aruman, Patito. Robert Babiak, and others. I borrowed most of the code, but some of it is mine, pretty much all the graphic changes are mine.<br />
<br />
http://www.starpixel.com/eq/ss-t.jpgPREVIEW (http://www.starpixel.com/eq/ss.jpg)<br />
<br />
http://www.starpixel.com/eq/icyblue.gif UI FILES (http://www.starpixel.com/eq/iceyblue.zip)<br />
<br />
<br />
Graphics:<br />
---------<br />
-- I changed all the graphics to a cool iCEy blue color. <br />
-- All the buttons are roundish and clean. <br />
-- I redid the inventory item backgrounds. Included in the screenshot is an empty inventory window so you can see the changes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Here is some notable mod features:<br />
----------------------------------<br />
-- Target window display the current target with a unique number, (i.e., froglok_bok_knight13), the percent of target. The casting bar is to the right of the target bar.<br />
-- Player window shows HP, MaxHP, AC and WIS. There are also bars for hps (red), mana (blue), pet (green), exp and aa exp. All with percents.<br />
-- Group window shows percents<br />
-- Compact spell book<br />
-- Compact Inventory<br />
-- Horizontal spell gems<br />
-- Compact, horizontal buff window -- to move this window you have resize the window.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To Install:<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
1. Go to the uifiles directory in your Everquest folder, Right-Click on the DEFAULT folder there, and select &quot;Copy&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Then Right-Click in the same folder as default (beside it) and select &quot;Paste&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Re-name &quot;Copy of  Default&quot; a new name, keeping it short <br />
<br />
4. Download the file you want and un-zip them.<br />
<br />
5. Drag all the items in your un-zipped file folder into your new folder, (you just named a short name)  it will ask you &quot;do you want to copy over....&quot; select &quot;YES TO ALL&quot;.<br />
<br />
6. Log into Everquest<br />
<br />
6. use /loadskin &lt;folder name&gt; (this is why you keep it short)<br />
<br />
****If your using a SKIN Mod, you must then camp out and back into the game to see it****<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to install selected mods from this interface, just copy over the &quot;.tga&quot; files that you want. (i.e., copying over only EQUI_Inventory.xml will only change the inventory mod).<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To ONLY Install graphics, copy these files only:<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
window_pieces01.tga<br />
window_pieces02.tga<br />
window_pieces03.tga<br />
window_pieces04.tga<br />
window_pieces05.tga<br />
wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga<br />
wnd_bg_light_rock.tga<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also note: I made a few changes to the spell icons which are mainly tailored to shaman spells, here are the files:<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
gemicons01.tga<br />
gemicons02.tga<br />
spells01.tga<br />
spells02.tga<br />
spells03.tga<br />

Problem though when i install it I get the windows fine, but the graphics are not showing up. I camped out and back in and same thing. then logged completly out and back in and same thing. Only graphics i see thats from the skin is in the inventory, not the window itself but the little boxes where the gear is placed. <br />
 Also after i turned it off since it wasnt working i logged in on my rog and noticed that the same inventory graphics showed up and even the buff icon from my illusion mask was a bear icon. so i reloaded my rogs skin and same thing. then i loged out and deleted the skin and its all back to normal.<br />
 Anyone else getting this? I installed it just as you said in the read me. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I just downloaded this one yesterday and everything is awesome.  Some of my favorite options are the smaller inventory window, great for people who want their inventory window open but don't want to block half the screen.  Also love the target window/ casting bar, now that is very nice.  :)</div></div><hr />

Not sure if you noticed yet.. but the compass doesn't seem to work on your old interface.. or maybe its just me. <br />
<br />
Great job on the interface though.. i love the buttons.. i can't live without them =)<br />
<br />
Amura:)<br />
<br />
PS if possible.. can you make a fix with just the compass? cause my whole UI is pretty much set exept for that. I have peices from all over the place atm. Would be much appreciated beyond no end.</div></div><hr />

I am also interested in the display of the INT instead of WIS since I am a chanter.<br />

Great work in anycase!!</div></div><hr />

I changed my client folder in the EQ directory back to default.  CRASH....   I changed the UI file for one of my characters back to default and I am able to get in, but I can not even get the wonderful window mods to work.  I hate these big giant windows with goofy borders and plain colors.  I hope you get it working soon Leo because I love this mod.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hrothgar</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was a bit rusty but I fixed it... It loaded but I didnt check to see if I broke anything so let me know... <br />
<br />
Here are the steps... <br />
<br />
1) Recopy default into the directory containing this mod... I call it blue. Say yes to overwrite all. <br />
<br />
2) Redownload the original mod. Unzip and copy into the &quot;blue&quot; directory. Say yes to overwrite all. <br />
<br />
3) download the zipfile below, unzip and then copy the files into &quot;blue&quot;. Say yes to overwrite all. <br />
<br />
Should work. <br />
<br />
PM me if it doesnt work and send errors... I can see email popup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, ok. LOL<br />
I really didn't want to post it, but if I don't I might get linched!<br />
<br />
The reason I hesitate, is it that Leo himself might post his fix. His fix, and my version of it could be drastically different. IE: I used a new tga file for texture reference, he might use the standard window_pieces04.tga file - resulting in incompatablity later on.<br />
<br />
So, WARNING, this patch should be considered temporary pending the original authors release of his fix.<br />
<br />
This is what your compass will look like after:<br />

<br />
Here's the patch file:<br />
Just unzip all files to your Icey Blue skin directory, and Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, Leo, wanted to throw you a thanks for the great skin.<br />
I used this as my 'base' skin and added a few modifications. IE: I added inventory attached to the hotkeys (had a lot of clicky stuff to swap around, and quick inventory access was a must).<br />
<br />
I love how little space this UI takes up, and no lack of information or ergonomics with a bit of re-arranging. If you might be curious, here's two shots of the skin after some of the mods. One with spellbook and inventory open, other in standard mode.<br />
<br />

i did see that someone had posted that they fixed it but did not confirm that it was working correctly so i dont want to install it until i get a confirmation.<br />

I suspect that Leo might have forgotten to put EQUI_TextEntryWnd.xml into the include section of the EQUI.xml file. Thus, trying to rename the chat window results in a crash to desktop.<br />
<br />
If you want my modded version of Leo's skin, as appears in the above pictures, I'll post a link to it in the main 'Released' forum, as I think it belongs there rather than here. Look for it there.  :)<br />
Edit: (It is now posted, under 'Tellgars Modded Icey Blue UI')<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way... to 'move' the buff box just resize it into position... kinda like 'stretch' one side to where you want, then the other, etc. Inch-worm method of relocation, hehe. This I haven't been able to rework yet... so stuck with doing it that way for now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eriadoc</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like the poster above, the horizontal spellbar is my only turn-off on this skin.  GREAT skin, Leo, and thanks for the contribution to the community.  I changed the spellbar to be vertical, but I have nowhere to host it.  So if anyone wants it, feel free to email me at eriadoc@yahoo.com.  Other than that, and changing WIS to INT, and adding weight/max weight, I have modified nothing on it.  I love this skin.  I have found nothing else I like better.  <br />
<br />
&lt;MAJOR PROBLEM&gt; -- with the 10/31 patch, I can no longer use this skin.  Anyone know what I should do?  I can load up default, and everything is fine, and then I can load iceyblue up, but as soon as I zone, I crash to desktop.  Help!  I can't play without this UI!  Thanks in advance!  :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eriadoc</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I fixed the problem I was having.  Evidently, the new patch has modified the Raid Window to look for another label, that is not specified in Icey Blue's Raid Window.  I could have modified the code to include the new label, but I just copied the EQUI_RaidWindow.xml from the default.  Works fine.  I also had to copy the dragitem_23/24/25.tga files over to the Icey Blue directory.  There is still an error appearing in the UIError.txt file, because the Inventory Window is not finding the child &quot;ClassAnim&quot;, which is the class animation (for wizards, the hand with the fire spouting out from it).  Personally, I don't miss it, and this is not a critical error, so I didn't worry about it.<br />
<br />
My modified version of this UI has a vertical spellbar, INT instead of WIS, and current/max weight showing in the player window.  I also use the old color scheme (Aug 02).  So 99% Leo, 1% me, hehe.  I am not sure how to post it out here for people to view or obtain, so I guess post instructions for me to do so, or just email me.  Good luck with this UI; it's great!</div></div><hr />
