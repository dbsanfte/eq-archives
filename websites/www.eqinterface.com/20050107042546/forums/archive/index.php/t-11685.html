<br />
Can anyone please, PLEASE, relocate this for me?  I went to the download section (where I got it before), and I can no longer find it there.  <br />
<br />
Here is what it looks like.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are currently 83 files availble in the PLAYER WINDOW (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?s=&amp;op=showfiles&amp;catid=20&amp;sortby=date&amp;sortorder=DESC) Download section.. <br />
<br />
you will want to look at the screen shot of any file you think could be it.<br />
<br />
and there is no way it over-wrote that file, that file would be in a custom folder for it to work. it just not working properly do to the patch change.. If you had that in your DEFAULT folder it would have been over-written the very next time you played.<br />
<br />
good luck with your search, I am confident you will be able to find something you like.<br />

<br />
Glad you like it.. be sure to put it in your custom ui directory and not the default directory.. not sure why it would have been overwritten otherwise!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I Use the T.King Draconic Player Window, the new patch over wrote that too.    They no longer use stamina so it's a different command/programming.</div></div><hr />
