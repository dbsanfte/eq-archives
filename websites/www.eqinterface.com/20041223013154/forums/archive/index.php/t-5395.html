<br />
I have made a patch for it :)<br />
<br />
Edit:  You'll have to also download one of the Song Buff Windows..<br />
They are posted later in this thread..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a horizontal song window!!<br />
<br />
Edit: The original one, I posted, was displaying the Buffs names, instead of the Song names.. I attached a new file.. You'll have to redownload it, Sorry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">celoco</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey you think you can do one for bluefantasy1.zip? i dont know how to mess with all this xml stuff all i know how to do is load the UI's and thats about it.. the old one is still working and all i just get an error message when i zone.. id appreciate it if you could help me out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I'm not gonna do, For 3 reasons:<br />
<br />
1.  I fixed bluefantasy.zip because it didn't even load. Aeluin isn't working on that one anymore (that I know of)..  Someone was trying to get it going. I was trying to help.. I said to install the newest version (I didn't realize it was completely different)..  Because of that, half of the original and half of the newer one were loading! <br />
<br />
2.  There's already a newer version of BlueFantasy1.zip but the author renamed it.  It's not up to date either (Get's Warning Message), but it works..<br />
<br />
3. Even though,  I'm not 100% positive. I'd bet:  Aeluin is still working on that one..<br />
<br />
You can get his latest version here:<br />

<br />
:edit - Worded reason 1 differently and changed the number of reasons to 3 :)</div></div><hr />

But,  I got bored playing eq.. So, I decide to do a patch for Aeluin.zip(Which is a newer version of bluefantasy1.zip.)<br />

<br />
To fix this delete the EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml in your BlueFantasy folder. It is not needed. It just uses the default window anyway.</div></div><hr />
