<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sthikik</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyone out there recommend a good (I don't mean top of the line) Laptop to play EQ on?<br />
<br />
what should be the minimum requirements for adequate play over a laptop.  I know there is a difference between a Desktop and a Laptop as far as graphics is concerned, but having never really bothered with anything more than a text editor for my laptop running on an 8088 processor with a 20 Meg HD... I know that's not enough for EQ... my Home Machine has an AMD3200+ 128 Meg video, yada yada yada... but like I said earlier... Laptops are different.. .I know I'm not going to get as good or better game play on a laptop.. but right now I'm looking for somewhere to start.  I need to economize size for my EQ play since my Sony 20 Inch monitor takes up a heck of a lot of desk space and a second Desktop machine is not an option for 2 boxing or for my travel needs... its an addiction I have to feed when I'm on the road.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two most important things to look for:<br />
<br />
Hard drive speed (you want 7200 RPM.. but there are almost NO laptops that offer it. At least get 5400 RPM. A lot of laptops come with 4500 RPM drives, and they will really kill performance)<br />
<br />
Discrete Graphics - you want a real graphics chip, something from Nvidia or ATI with it's own memory (not shared system memory). I would probably recommend looking for the Geforce4 4200 Go. If you want DirectX 9 compatibility, which might not be a bad idea if you plan on keeping the laptop for several years, look for the ATI Mobility Radeon 9600. It's going to be hard to find any good graphics chipset... most manufacturer's don't offer very many choices (even the big companies) and typically don't give you very much info about what you're getting.<br />
<br />
Other than that,  you are looking for the same things you look for in a desktop. Fast CPU and front-side bus, Large and fast memory... You get the idea. Brand is not so important, But it is better to go with a big company, because laptops are hard to fix for yourself if they break. Look carefully at warranty. It sucks to have the motherboard fail a year after you get it and discover that you have to do major surgery on the thing... if you can find replacement parts.<br />
<br />
You are going to pay through the nose for a laptop that plays EQ (if you want it to play EQ well), $2000 or more. Probably More.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sect</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now as I type this I am on the buss headed to work. Thats right I have A cell Modem from Sprint on my Compaq Presario 2500. I have it through a rent a center where I pay $50 a month for it. I know you might say ouch! but see it's the only way I can get away with having a laptop, my Ol lady would tear me up if she thought I dropped 2500 bucks on one. Anyway The cell modem costed me 200 bucks and the service for unlimited internet is 80 a month so between EQ and my laptop and my wireless internet I'm paying about 145 bucks just to play EQ each month. SHHHH! if she finds out I'm dead!<br />
<br />
Anyway Compaq Presario 2500 Pent 4 the only upgrade I gave it was the ram, I bought 2 512 ram chips for it which costed me 300 but it is always worth grabbing ram when you can! :P I'm not rich but I'm ot poor. Certainly the poor person can't do this. But if you have the cash DO IT! My buss rides haven't been the same. I love parming Hill Giants while headed to work!<br />

<br />
I run the whole thing EQ etc from my Laptop and it runs a lot better than a lot of my friends home systems<br />
I spent a bundle on it approx £1800<br />
<br />
P4 1.8G, 512 DDRAM, 40G HDD, Gforce 4 128MB, etc<br />
<br />
I am currently running 2 sessions of EQ as well and except for PoK I have very little to complain about. I zone a lot quicker than most etc etc<br />
If you are seriously thinking of getting a Laptop then spend the money now and buy a real good one as you carn't really upgrade later. I bought mine from Dell on the web as they tend to do some good deals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vaanoor</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My old refurb Gateway finall died, so I needed to buy a replacement.  I went through all the standard &quot;Well, if I get this, I can do that&quot; .......and the price rapidly passed the 2K point. <br />
<br />
I finally decided that I would get one that would NOT play 3D games, thus dropping the cash I would spend.  Bought a Toshiba at CostCo for $999.99.  Celeron 2.4, 30gig drive (4500 rpm), 512 meg ram and 32 meg SHARED memory Intel video.<br />
<br />
Got it home, uninstallled AOHell and the rest of the junk I did not want.... copied my EQ folder over and ran the game.  I did turn off all character models, MIP mapping and socials.  Logged in, ran around POK then the Bazaar..... wandered elsewhere.   Plays fine.   Surprised me, but gives me a travelling alternative when net access is available!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Toshiba 5100-s501 (or something close to that) has upgraded memory to 512.<br />
<br />
Other than that, turn off antialiasing in the GEFORCE4 440 Go and rockin in the free world.<br />
<br />
I have never had an issue playing EQ and my only lag is in POK recently when the population managed to get over 200 at once.  Nice big sharp screen too.<br />
<br />
My wife also uses the same model and my son bought the updated model (I think a 5800, not sure)  His is even better with a 2.7ghz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I knew you'd have the top of the line machine Kudane... I was looking for something a little bit back from that.<br />
<br />
ya know... champagne dreams on a beer budget... ok maybe not beer... but Guiness budget<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best performing laptop? They really should have put the ATI chip in it if they wanted &quot;best performance&quot;. Oh well... maybe Alienware has some kind of buddy deal with Nvidia. =\<br />
<br />
I recommended the ATI mobility Radeon 9600 if you want DX9 performance from a laptop... because it completely wipes out the Nvidia chip in all benchmarks. Especially in benchmarks that actually use DX9.<br />
<br />
Check out this article (http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.html?i=1866&amp;p=1).<br />
<br />
They put the ATI MRadeon 9600 up against an upgraded version of the chip that's in all of those alienware laptops... and ATI wins without a struggle.<br />
<br />
EDIT*** oh, let me take my foot out of my mouth... Alienware offers the ATI chip, at no difference in price. Well, anyone buying this laptop... Get the ATI CHIP!! hehe*****EDIT<br />
<br />
Anyway... as you said, you aren't looking for the most expensive thing. Seriously, as I said above... Look for a 5400 rpm hard drive and a decent graphics chip with it's own memory... and you should be able to play EQ respectably well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a dell Inspiron 8200SC (2.4ghz, 1gb ram 64 shared with video, 40gb HD, ATI MRadeon 9600 64mb, UXGA 1600x1200 Display). It cost a little over $1,500 with discounts/rebates from work and deals I found on fatwallet.com. Check with your place of work because if they buy a lot of Dell stuff you can get up to 15% off various computers.<br />
<br />
I can run EQ at 1600x1200 with old world models on.<br />
<br />
My only complaint is that this laptop is about as heavy as a boat anchor.</div></div><hr />
