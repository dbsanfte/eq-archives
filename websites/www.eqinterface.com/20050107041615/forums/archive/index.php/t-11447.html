Everything works ok, except my compass displays consistently 45 degrees to the left.  In other words, when I'm facing South, it shows Southeast.  LDoN line works ok, btw.<br />
I have quite a few lines in my UIerrors file, but they're all &quot;Attempting to use file from the Default skin&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Normal compass appears right on, LDoN line is 45 degrees off.  A pain trying to find entrances... ;)</div></div><hr />

We have heard this many times.. and every time we test it, the compass is correct..<br />
<br />
the only way we have seen the compass off is if you add a mix of other UIs to your vert folder.<br />
<br />
please take a screenshot of your compass (and crop down to it) and attach it to a reply here.<br />
<br />
I have tested every compass for all colors of vert and solaria and they are right on the money (unless you do like i mentioned above and accidentally replace part of the compass)</div></div><hr />

I'm using all Vert files, but I will double check that everything is up-to-date.  Maybe it just needs a reload? <br />
<br />
a fresh version (and any patches) is always a good idea if having trouble. <br />
<br />
a lot of the solaria issues I saw right after the last patch were because people were still using Solaria-BETA which we had some extra files (that we combinded together for the final release).. <br />
<br />
Now, I doubt your using any kind of Vert beta... that was just an example.<br />
<br />
the other way we found people's compasses were off is the would repace the strip (the background that says n/w/s/e, etc) with the default or a custom one.. but NOT replace the frame..<br />
<br />
Vert's compass is WIDER that the default, sooo the center is to the RIGHT of the center of the default if you line them up on the left edges (ie, default is 80 pix wide, vert is 120, soo the center is 20pix to the right). soooo if you put the default strip in there, the center shifts back to the left, but the FRAME doesnt know to move to the left.. sooo it appears the compass is off. (this can happen in reverse too)<br />
