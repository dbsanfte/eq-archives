<br />
My roomate tried to start playing again recently, but we cannot get his main char to load.  He has a UI called ortin that we installed in Jan.  His other chars, who do not have the UI, will load properly.  His main char, with the UI, willload every time on my comp.  When we load his main on his comp, we get &quot;You have Been Diconnected&quot; and get kicked to the server screen.  His UIerror.txt file is empty every time.  I have tried everything, from deleting all UI files attached to his main, to typing &quot;default&quot; after UIskin, to going through all the patches and checking his files against them, to nuking all his files and running a 10 hour patch.  All I want is to return to his default UI so he can start playing.  Anyone ever had anything similiar or have any ideas?<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />
