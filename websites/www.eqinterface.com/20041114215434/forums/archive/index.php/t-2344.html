<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay guys here is the latest update that I have been able to come up with.  I really appreciate all the suggestions.  You guys are motivating me to keep going on this.  One thing i'd like to mention about the chat windows when you use this mod is this;  If you use the MOD you MUST copy the provided UI_Yourname_XX.ini file into your Main Everquest directory using your character name and the server number of your server in the XX postion.  If you do not do this the chat windows will be all over the place.  The .ini file is setup with all the correct fades and window positions for the hitsmodes and spam to where you see it in the caps.  Otherwise use at your own risk :P  <br />
<br />
As to the help i need...  If you look at the cap I sent with this post you will see this gap at the bottom of my container bags which is completely driving me crazy.  No matter how I code it I cannot get this to go away.  Any help you could provide me on this would be GREATLY appreciated.  I will send the EQUI_Container.xml and the pieces file for the bags if you think it will assist in troubleshooting since i can't post them here<br />
<br />
Thanks and here is the latest Look :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atheenath Dawns</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My best guess would be to open the container.xml file, go to the end, and check which template it uses. Then create a copy of that template with a slightly different name (or a 2 at the end of the existing name) without the bottom frame, and assign the containers to look for the new template.<br />
<br />
If you dont want to have to modify the EQUI_template.xml file itself, you can insert the new template IN the container.xml file. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />

<br />
I give 6/10 bananas<br />
:nana: :nana: :nana: :nana: :nana: :nana:<br />
<br />
Why i don t give more ??<br />
<br />
- If possible , i ll be nice to have a bigger Target window ;)<br />
<br />
- Nothing let me know if i was in Attack mode or not :eek: It will be VERY nice to see this important thing :D<br />
<br />
- It ll be nice to have a casting gauge we can see ( the actual is too small and too far from center i think ) ( one more:nana: If ya put it just under the target gauge )<br />
<br />
- Don t see the track on this screenshot :confused:    Do ya put a Druid s one ? ( without rangers function )<br />
<br />
- Plzz resize all box/bag, Sorry guys this is nice but a bit too Large :(<br />
<br />
If you can change this plzz  CONTACT   (francky_shark@hotmail.com) me , i ll really want to test it another time :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is really cool. I'll have to check it out sometime when I'm not so tired :p <br />
<br />
Oh yeah - what screensize is that for? I play in 1024 x 768 most times, sometimes lower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aniela</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I already downloaded this, but I didn't even bother installing after reading the readme file that stated it's for larger resolutions. I run a 1024x768 and I'd love to try this out, it's hard to find a druid ui I REALLY like.</div></div><hr />

You hit most of  the things I asked myself when I loaded up this skin.  I will still use it, because it rocks, but the few things touched on here, would make this skin own any other skin out there (for druids at least) Anyway Keep up the awesome work Spirit!<br />
<br />
The only other things that bug me are, I can't seem to move the buff window where i want it, or resize it, and the chat windows don't like to move either, I have shuffle them across the screen by resizing the boxes. <br />

a little bigger target window might be nice  <br />
<br />

<br />
I did find the indicator for attacking it is a red square around the entire player window  <br />
<br />

<br />
I do agree with this, cast bar under the target, or on top of it, and bigger would help a lot  <br />
<br />
- Don t see the track on this screenshot :confused:    Do ya put a Druid s one ? ( without rangers function )<br />
A druid version of the track window without the ranger options would be nice too  <br />

I totally agree. I want a big exp bar as well. Tried getting the one Oguler has but I dont know which file(s) it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, near as I can tell, from looking at the container files, the gap has to do with the fact that the entire bottom of your container is a button. It would seem that the EQ schema wants to put space around the buttons, thus the gap. However, I have been able to make headway by applying a static animation behind the whole area and placing the buttons over it. Thereby filling in the gap instead of trying to remove it. I will continue to look into this further in hopes of finding a more suitable solution.<br />

<br />
I was looking at this ui, and I downloaded it.   After useing it for a bit (and LD'ing a few times) i decieded not to use it.  However, i wanted that big exp bar<br />
<br />
So i did a little research..   The exp bar is connected to the selector window.. that is EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml <br />
<br />
Cool, found that, but now i can't get it to work in Quartz ui.  :confused: last time i tried it jacked the quartz so it wouldn't load.  Not knowing a THING about xml, i'm lost.  reloaded quartz, and it's working fine.  but how do i get this selectorWnd to work instead of the one with quartz ui (or the default which works as well)<br />
<br />
any ideas would be great!  -Zarmie</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilerin</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having the same problem as you zarmie except with my own custom UI.<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate it if someone would let me know how to use the exp bar without crashing... Thanks</div></div><hr />
