<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">[All screenshots have been reduced to 800x600 for bandwith and space concerns]<br />
[For all those that have the older file and don't want to upgrade, but still want the cursor fix, that can be found here (members.cox.net/dreamersofeternity/misc/CursorFix.zip)]<br />
[You may have to clear your browser's cache to see the new screenshots]<br />
[The newest version will ALWAYS be found at http://ayonae.ro]<br />
<br />
Welcome to my, uh, updated TrilZW3 UI. I removed the cursor for good, promise! All mods were NOT made by me, except the slight change to the inventory (switched the done and destroy buttons around and make the destroy button larger for all your tradeskillers with mass combines. if it's annoying enough, I will post the original version). If I don't mention names, chances are, it's because I forgot, but ALL of the mods can either be found in Zeremus' pack, or at http://www.eqinterface.com.<br />
<br />
I've also cleaned up the zip file, removing all unnessecary files, but it's still a very hefty &lt;3meg download, I'm afraid =(<br />
<br />
Note that this UI is for 1280x1024 ONLY, and is very caster friendly!<br />

<br />
-=Features=-<br />
<br />
Based on Zeremus Windows v3.0 [found here (pub142.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showMessage?topicID=3064.topic)]<br />
Streamlined NPC-Give window (Not shown in the screenshots)<br />
Streamlined container windows (the little space on the bottom of each container is where the 'combine' button would go. the borders have been removed and the only place to move the container is the title bar -- perfect for you smiths doing mass combines!)<br />
t.king's beautiful arcane v2.0 spellbook, and v4.0 spell gems<br />
Athee's 'expanded' friends list, featuring big AAXP and XP gauges for those who want to see EXACTLY what they're getting in that Plane =P<br />
Kathara's Tradeskill Mod, combined with the actions window (ctrl+o in game)<br />
Athee's Loc Wizard (combined with the feedback window)<br />
Much more visible, numbered buff window<br />
Also features a fully modifiable UI, allowing nearly all parts (except the target window) to be switched, ripped, and changed at your leisure<br />
Streamlined item-info window, with a smaller font to see all the effects of that new loot you just picked up has =P<br />
Other goodies I probably forgot to mention =P Just explore<br />
<br />
Arista's timers are NOT included, and are there for show because I use them =P They can, however, be found here (www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp)<br />
<br />
This UI was meant for nearly everything to be turned off, so you only get the information you need, when you need it, and to save you those precious frames-per-second during that NToV raid. Remember, chat windows are also 'click-through' and can be use as a flota--er--and are made transparent so you can see what's going on, on all sides of you.<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoy the UI, I've gotten make compliments from it so far, and I'll continue to update it as people want it! Enjoy =)<br />

Has things I've looked for in mods like the tradeskills window.  Only problem is can't use because of the resolution being too high.  Be proud, you do good work ;)<br />

The mod I am using is very similar ta yours with a few extra tking borders, but the spell gems are much easier to see and very nicely done. :)</div></div><hr />

Personally, I think it is the best out there. Wonderful mix of vert, Zeremus and the loc/tradeskill guide. Now I pray that it will work on my computer :).<br />

(like in the Animations file, or any extra tgas?)</div></div><hr />
