<br />
This is less than one half what it cost for one month for us to host this site. <br />
<br />
BUT, that is ok for those who donated Dolby and I thank you gratefully!<br />
<br />
And as promised here is the first of four images from EQ2 exclusively here on EQInterface.com<br />

<br />
It's hard to believe that there were so few donations.  I thought that my donation was a bit low, but $85 from the whole community?<br />
<br />
There are 112,763 members.  If everyone donated a single penny that would have gotten over $1100.  <br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to donate even a single cent.  <br />
<br />
Did you know that if you don't have a paypal account that they give you $5 just for signing up for one?  You could make money by donating.<br />
<br />
Come on people, give a little to a site that gives so much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katn</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">should get other means of donations then paypal..like what was sayed a P.O box or something..for me that would be easier..then I can send a money order..hehe trying to pay off my credit cards :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zikbus</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Agree with Katn use a P.O. Box and i will send a donation Glady as much as i use this site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are saying they should add to their monthly expenses when they can't even get donations to meet their current expensis.<br />
<br />
Paypal is the best method to use.  You do not need a credit card to use.  In fact they prefer you to not use credit cards, and to use direct debit.<br />
<br />
When I use paypal I use one of my checking accounts, and use the debit card for the same account as my backup source.<br />
<br />
You can even deposite money into your paypal account, and it will earn interest.<br />
<br />
Please go to their site and read about it before you knock it.<br />
<br />
I might sound like an advertisement here, but I have used paypal for years now<br />
<br />
I'm sure you will be able to come up with more excuses, but I'm done ranting about this.<br />
<br />
Kudane, <br />
There may be a free way around the P.O. Box thing though.  You may be able to have donations delivered to you through general delivery.  This will deliver the mail to the post office, but you would get no notice, and would only have a few day to pick it up before it is returned to sender.  Check with your post office to see if this is applicable in your area.</div></div><hr />

I will check into this, but that again means more work, since I now have to go brave the lines at the post office.<br />
<br />
Dolby and I are discussing the ideas of a P.O. Box.. we are looking at all options..<br />
<br />
thanks for the plug on Pay-Pal..</div></div><hr />
