<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mutley</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't going to post these as so many of us have customized our player, group and target windows, mine included.   So I'm including an image here so you can see what you'll end up from these files.  If you don't like the setup, don't use that piece, just use the ones you do like.<br />
<br />
While the UI works fine as it was, when you reload it, you'll get an error saying possible incompatibility because of the 5/14 changes.  These files fix that error, even though there's no visible change to the UI, and restores the spellbook function under the spell casting gems.<br />
<br />
I have to play at 800x600 and space is at a premium, so I like to keep my UI parts as small as possible.  Here's what the following pieces included in the zip file are.  They're all shown in the image below.<br />
<br />
EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml<br />
Vert never included the ugly spellbook under the spell casting gems, and I liked that look.  What I did was to make it invisible under the 8th spell gem.  When you move your mouse in the area, you'll see the text &quot;Spellbook &lt;Ctrl B&gt;&quot;... just right click and you've got the new save/load features without the ugly icon.  See the image below.<br />
<br />
EQUI_GroupWindow.xml<br />
See image below.  I use Ctrl-I and Ctrl-D to invite and disband.<br />
<br />
EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml<br />
See image below.  I shortened mine so only the hp, ac, atk and weight are shown.  This includes a mana bar for casters.<br />
<br />
EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml.MELEE<br />
This makes the player window a bit smaller since there won't be an empty space for the mana bar.  Just rename the file deleting &quot;.MELEE&quot;.<br />
<br />
EQUI_Target.xml<br />
Plain and simple, see image.<br />
<br />
window_pieces01.tga<br />
With the 6/11 patch, there was a greyish shadow very noticeable around all the boxes that was never visible before.  This file simply cleans that up to get rid of that slight grey outline.  <br />
