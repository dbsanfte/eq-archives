<br />
<br />
<br />
I was thinking of creating (unless one is already made) a Resident Evil inventory UI like the menu screen you have when you pause the game to equip items, reload guns, use/mix herbs, etc.  More specifically, I was going to use either Resident Evil 3 or Code: Veronica.  Was wondering if anyone might be interested in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ultrax</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would personaly be interested in using the inventory mod. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would make something like the inventory window or player window mod before you make a whole UI to get a feel for demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riegal</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't mean make an entire UI based on Resident Evil, but merely stated, most likely the inventory window (based on the menu screen from either RE3 or RE:CV)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasshaiz</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this should be interesting! make a whole UI! hehe will beta test too if you like = ) Take the challenge! = )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ultrax</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'd test it also. :-P Get crack'n! RE UI would be so uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riegal</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been doing some work on this, and the only problem I see right now is the classical 'heart monitor' health indicator that is seen in all (at least I think all) RE games.  Good health (normal heartbeat in green), caution orange (slightly lower than normal), red caution (lower than the previous), and red danger (real lower), and poison (crazy heartbeat in purple).<br />
<br />
I'm not too sure of how to do that programming (just yet anyway), and was thinking of possibly having a gauge in the form of a heartbeat monitor with 75%-100% health indicated by green line, 75-50% in orange, 50-25% in red orange, and 25-0% in dark red.<br />
<br />
Other than that, it looks like everything else should be a piece of cake.. short of having the inventory drawn and designed (the coding for that isn't much of a problem)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check out this (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2570)  for the heart beat monitor.  This isn't fully what you want, but it's at least a start for you to go off of.  Good luck! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riegal</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you so much for that link to that mod.  I'm going to work with it (haven't tried it yet), but if I can get it the way I want, the lower health you get, the more color change to red (from green, yellow, orange, orange red, to red), and the faster the heartbeat will go.  Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasshaiz</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">then maybe you can get it to turn purple when you get a dot on ya? that would be awesome lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Son-of-a-Gun</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whats taking so long !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riegal</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Almost done working on the first version of the mod.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a sample (and teaser, boy I'm evil) of what will be on it.<br />
<br />
Made in the traditional menu style (UI inventory) from Resident Evil.<br />
Will have heartbeat monitor representing health (working with having it change depending upon health status and not fade like a regular HP bubble)<br />
Depending upon if you want to put a picture of your character (for kicks I guess) on the auto-equip (the same area where the picture of Claire, Steve, Chris, etc.  is in RE: CV), I'll include some directions in a .txt file.<br />
<br />
So far, everything is looking great.  Hopefully, the first part will be up by tomorrow or the day after as I do the finishing touches.  Will appreciate all the feedback I can get from it so I can make it better.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your patience and encouragement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riegal</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going through the coding and stuff.. I've run into a problem with this.<br />
<br />
It took some time, but I was able to fix up the inventory window and move everything around to accomodate for the RE effect, plus have the regular inventory window replaced by an image I have.  the problem is.. when I use fiddle (the program designed for WYSIWIG .xml), it shows up correctly but without the image up in its place (still working on that problem).  When I load the UI, it doesn't do anything but load my default UI.  It doesn't say I have an error and that there is something wrong with my .xml files.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what could be the problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In your Everquest directory, there should be a file called UIErrors.txt   This file will list what is wrong...if you can't figure it out, post a copy of that file up to this thread...someone else should then be able to point you in the right direction for fixing it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riegal</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a bit of common stuff found in the log, (i.e. this wasn't in directory, loading default...)<br />
<br />
Here's something I noticed a bit different..<br />
<br />
[Thu Dec 11 19:31:43 2003] [Line:3054 Source:UIFiles\ResidentEvilInventory\EQUI_Inventory.xml] Couldn't find class:item 'ReInvBack1' reference in FieldParseItemOfClass()<br />
[Thu Dec 11 19:31:43 2003] Error loading skin: loading default skin instead.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
I now have the UI loaded on my game but the problem is the .bmp will not load.  Other than that, the entire thing (minus the heartbeat I am messing with) is good for beta testing.<br />
<br />
Another EDIT:<br />
<br />
I figured out the source of the problem.. and when I fixed it, it messed up and now I can't load it (get the same thing on the UIErrors.txt from above)<br />
<br />
And in case anyone is wondering.. yes, this is my first time working and customizing on a UI... so.. forgive me for any delays/problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riegal</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings again<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long time of waiting, but it is now nearly 100% finished and ready for testing.<br />
<br />
Right now, the only thing that is the problem is getting the background (which I have been at for the past four hours) to become transparent.<br />
<br />
The heartbeat monitor is in the works still, with the one changing colors and what not.  Forry, if you read this, I could use your help with the one you had designed.. if you do not mind =)<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the waiting and encouragement to help me finish this.  Will have it for downloading once the background becomes transparent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thread moved to pre-beta forum. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riegal</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first version of this can be downloaded at:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2862<br />
<br />
<br />
I am currently working on the next one right now.  Keep in mind, this one does NOT have the heartbeat monitor.  Read the readme.txt file for further information if you download it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Son-of-a-Gun</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make on like the old resident evil , you know like the original. Blue is better than gold i think , the font should be clearer (maybe green if you change to blue). Also it would be nice if you made it for all window sizes.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.<br />
<br />
EDIT : BTW in the pic you have DIE not DYE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riegal</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback so far.<br />
<br />
And a note on the 'DYE'/'DIE' part.. I did that intentially.. (thought to myself, it still sounds the same, and since when did Chris, Claire, Jill, etc, able to 'dye' their clothes?)<br />
<br />
Will change that on next version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyoya</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you ever thought of making an inventory mod based on the inventory window of the Resident Evil 1 remake for gamecube?<br />
It looks awesome. :cool:</div></div><hr />
