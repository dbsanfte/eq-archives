You can check out the hotbuttons box idea though. graphics aren't nearly finished. ( im a perfectionist :X )<br />
<br />
hotbuttons are :<br />
1 2 3 4 5<br />
6 7 8 9 0<br />
<br />
its small but effective i think.. but dont know if anyone would actually appreciate this type of interface.. <br />
<br />

<br />
I've done some work myself on one, mostly just shrinking down the default one, but have not really tried hard to complete it.<br />
<br />
The concept you have is really neat.  I'm looking forward to trying it out once you get a trial version posted.</div></div><hr />

Text labels always show up.  Regardless of the fade level or anything else.  If you look at the player window in the same pic you will see that she has 0 aaxp and the % label is still showing.<br />
<br />
I browed through the downloads area looking at other mods and all that I looked at had the % labels showing, even in empty groups.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if there was a change to the coding, or a way to convet a button r gauge or something to show the %'s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i used the label &lt;EQTYPES&gt; that SoE has included in their new groupwindow that shows %s by default.<br />
<br />
When the value does not exist, the label is invisible :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I wonder if they are not visible on my UI either and I just didn't notice.  I'm using the same EQTypes, Label item and ScreenID that the default uses now.<br />

Thanks for the reply.  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyste</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That feature went in with the last patch... if you haven't specifically updated your group window to use the new names, it's probably loading fine but there are errors in your error log. It's a pretty neat feature I must say ;)<br />
<br />
By the way... what's the inventory window look like? I've been piece-mealing together an 800 x 600 UI, but the hardest thing I've always run up against is the Inventory window...<br />
<br />
Nice work tho!</div></div><hr />
