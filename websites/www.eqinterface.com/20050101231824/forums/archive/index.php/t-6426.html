<br />
I am using a custom inventory for example that I created some time ago. So I went in and added the charm slot and just slapped it anywhere till I could get a visual ingame, yet the new inventory window refuses to load at all.<br />
<br />
I modified the equi.xml to add the new stuff and it STILL wont load right.<br />
<br />
Target bar is supposed to be supressed and shows with supression chars in the equi.xml file yet shows up on screen. My player window is gone, my inventory is screwed, my spellgems are back to huge and buttugly without the swapslots i added next to them.<br />
<br />
My whole gosh darn UI is hosed! how the heck can i get it working again?<br />

Too bad this game pisses so many people off and is so frustrating with all the problems that are caused.</div></div><hr />

Regardless of how irate you are at SOE and the patch process - God knows how irate I was after spending 4 /12 hours trying to debug the guage problem....<br />

This place is NOT a forum for B****NG about it, nor a forum for your llanguage or sarcasm.<br />

Got a question.  Phrase it and be courteous and those of us who may be willing to help will be a bit MORE willing.</div></div><hr />

How can we help you when you don’t even post your uierrors.txt witch is asked for in our READ ME forum. You need to provide us with the errors before we can help.</div></div><hr />
