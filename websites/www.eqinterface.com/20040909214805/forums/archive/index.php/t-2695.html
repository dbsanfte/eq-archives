Fix for Vert Mod Spellbooks Example (http://pub165.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31.showMessage?topicID=33.topic) <br />
<br />
For modders out there that would like to use my animation splicer, here are some notes<br />
<br />
* You must put the changes FIRST and additions LAST<br />
* If you want comments included, put them inside the items instead of outside.<br />
* If you want to add textures but no animations, or animations but no textures, do not delete the appropriate file, instead use a single comment line in the file<br />
* There should be no trailing lines - the last line of your .txt file should be the last line of code - if you have empty lines at the bottom (even one) the program will crash.<br />
* Be sure to put changes in the proper order<br />
<br />
I think thats about it for now - please use this thread for feedback :)   Hopefully this will make modding easier for those mods that need animation.xml changes.<br />
<br />
I plan to go back and make the program a bit less picky sometime :) <br />
<br />
Feedback GREATLY appreciated - let me know what you think.<br />

I really dislike the VERT default spell book (way to small and plain looking) so I was glad to see I could go back to using one of yours.<br />

If you can give me a basic conceptual and instructional I'll play with it and give you feedback.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remelio</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok let me see what I can do to explain this better.<br />
:nana: <br />
<br />
The basic concept is that the program takes the changes that are in the two text files (one for textures and one for animation objects) and splices it into the equi_animation.xml file - that way if say you want to use the briar wand pointer with verts mod, you just extract the files into your custom UI directory, and run remmy.bat<br />
<br />
Does that help?  If not I'll try again.. I'm not usually very good with instructions. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anybody else out there with messed up animation files now?<br />
Let me know!</div></div><hr />

I will be giving this a whirl<br />
Im always trying different mods, parts etc<br />
Always making changes to the animations.xml<br />
This looks like it would be a time and aggravation saver.<br />
Good example though pretty easy is the tk_arrow cursor and swapping spell buff windows.<br />
I use / try alot of mods and change them alot and I always use the tk_arrow cursor and my favorite buffwindow<br />
<br />
I know what you mean about instructions.  LOL<br />
Makes sense in my head and then when it gets to explaining or documenting it, it seems to lose something as others see it.<br />
Yet still makes perfect sense to me<br />
hehehe<br />
