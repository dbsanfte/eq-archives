<br />
this is my completed skin (vert's mod with my color scheme)<br />
<br />

<br />
and this is the bane of my existence :<br />

<br />
I have scoured all the window pieces.  At first I thought the change to the window_pieces04 was the culprit but now...<br />
<br />
sigh... I have no stinking clue.  There are too many parts to these windows ehehe..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any way you could send me the graphics files - Like all the window_pieces.tga files. If possible you can either post here or send in a PM to me. Thanks, I try to help in anything if I possibly can :)<br />
<br />
That almost looks like a transparency (Alpha Channel) issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought about that last night after I logged off.  I think what I am going to do it just copy window_pieces01 onto a black backround and see what shows up.  Some sneaky smidget of grey hiding in that grey/white check that is photoshops rendering of transparency maybe...<br />
<br />
anyhoo, I have a webpage with this pieces skins zipped (http://webpages.charter.net/robnjuli/eqskins.htm) <br />
<br />
<br />
Has anyone mapped those teensy bits on windows_pieces01 into a visual quick reference format yet?  I am going to put colored dots on it today and figure once and for all which piece goes where.  Ugh I wish I had more time to mess with this :( <br />
<br />
<br />
thanks for taking a look at it</div></div><hr />

==============================================<br />
<br />
No more grey line I moved everything in window_pieces01.tga you have posted and placed into new 256 x 256 black background and saved alpha channel.<br />
<br />
Where the grey line WAS is now transparent. It will take a little while longer to place anything there, but here is the file as of now :)<br />

<br />

<br />
Following the same concept I went back and looked at my copy.  Lo and behold!! Grey spots!!.. more than one! RAWR!<br />
<br />
Ok working to get this fixed and on the website for all to peruse.  :nana: :nana: <br />
<br />
As for the T.King's icons... I have been to his personal website and drooled on his work.  Also put my .02 in on his WYSIWYG editor.  I think he is a fabulous artist and cant wait to see more<br />
<br />
<br />
:D :<br />

<br />
thanks again :)<br />
