i have recently discovered all the wonderful mp3 files for the more recent zones in my EQ directory..<br />
as i listen to the files of the zones i have been in, i realized something...<br />
i have never heard thsi songs when actually in game...<br />
i do have music on so i know htat's not the reason....<br />
might anyone have any idea as to why i dont hear any of the music of EQ other than the battle theme and main startup theme?<br />
<br />
as a side note, ive been listening to the new stuff from GoD, and i must say, it's all some amazing stuff, hauntingly beautiful<br />
as is the mp3 for Plane of Time, hehe <br />
<br />
<br />
again, any and all help would be much appreciated</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure about this?  I have combat music off and still hear environmental sounds and zone music.  I did set everything through the Options window howver, and not through slash commands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im guessing that the music your listening to are named these:<br />
<br />
bothunder.mp3<br />
codecay.mp3<br />
combattheme1.mp3<br />
combattheme2.mp3<br />
deaththeme.mp3<br />
eqtheme.mp3<br />
hohonor.mp3<br />
poair.mp3<br />
podisease.mp3<br />
poearth.mp3<br />
pofire.mp3<br />
poinnovation.mp3<br />
pojustice.mp3<br />
poknowledge.mp3<br />
ponightmare.mp3<br />
postorms.mp3<br />
potactics.mp3<br />
potime.mp3<br />
potorment.mp3<br />
potranquility.mp3<br />
povalor.mp3<br />
powar.mp3<br />
powater.mp3<br />
solrotower.mp3<br />
<br />
If so, the reason why you havent heard them, aside from EQtheme and combattheme1 and 2, is because unless you havent visited any of the planes, you wont hear any of them until you do.<br />
<br />
And as for the new music from GoD, well thats just a given... Just wait till its released or you have participated in the beta.<br />
<br />
Now some music is environmental (i.e., PoK and spires), make sure your Environmental Sounds is activated (should be yellow text). It is located in your Options Window (ALT+O) under the General tab.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

i have had environmental sounds off for a long while now, ever since they added the option  (being in OOT for hours on end with the ocean really starts to drive ya nuts)<br />
<br />
sucks that ill  have to turn it all back on, some of the true environment sounds are really really annoying, but the music is so good.<br />
<br />
well, thanks for the help</div></div><hr />
