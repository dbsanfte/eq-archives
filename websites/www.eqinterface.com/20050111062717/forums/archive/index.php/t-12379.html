When the server finally came back up, it only lasted a couple of hours before it was down again.  No info has been posted so far.  The only msg on eqlive is something about a login problem.</div></div><hr />

Some info on /claim<br />
<br />
Hocus Pocus!<br />
<br />
After this morning's update, many of you received the /claim message to claim an LDoN bag.  Unfortunately, this message was given in error and has been corrected. <br />
<br />
However, after some liberal waving of our wands and a few magic words, the /claim command should now be working. Those of you with outstanding claims from your Lost Dungeons of Norrath purchase should receive the proper message and be able to /claim your bags.<br />
