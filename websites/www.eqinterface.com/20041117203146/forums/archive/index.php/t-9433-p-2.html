I have been using it since sometime in 2003 I think? Or at least something very much like it until I got tired of coding it myself every time there was a patch. Then I found yours and have been happy with it ever since :) Was worried for awhile when it hadn't been updated for so long, but I found and read this thread, I thought maybe you had quit. Sorry to hear about your injury. Don't overstrain and reinjure yourself.  :o  Thank you again for this wonderful UI.<br />

I believe the link on this forum, dated 8/25 is only an Update, intended to be installed into a working version of the UI.  Try this link http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=2568 . It will take you to where you can DL the whole shebang.<br />

If you do not have the ui already you'll need to follow the other links they are kept upto date as well for new users so they don't need the updates. There is also an options zip that you can download for the UI that contains alternate windows from the ones in my main file for people with special preferances. It contains most of the requests that I have fullfilled over the year I've maintained this UI. Also make sure you unzipped all the files into it's own folder under ui files. The folder should be a one word name ie centhena, celtic, custom. The files must be inside a folder that is in the uifiles folder not a folder in a folder like come unzipping progs sometimes like to do.If this doesn't help please let me know.<br />

Those were it.  I downloaded the full version but still had the same issue.   I inadvertently had a space in the name.  Once I fixed that it worked.  Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />

Ok here's the deal... I haven't been working on the UI for a week or so now. I haven't been playing EQ1 at all really. My husband and I are in EQ2 beta and that's been taking up all my free time. *NOTE* Don't ask I will not answer any questions what so ever about the game be it either in this forum in private message or email so don't bother. Hehe sorry just gotta cover my butt hehe.  Anyway the point is that I haven't bought OoW and I'm not sure if i will. I need to save up for Eq2 and as we all know it's carrying a hefty price tag 90 for collectors 50 for standard. Considering between me any my hubby we need 3 copies at least one of which of course must be collectors. It's not a definate no we're not buying it yet but it seems unlikely as we have no plans on playing eq1 much anymore except to visit friends.<br />
<br />
So the long and the short of it is I don't have any updates for OoW at this time and I'm not sure when I will. I have no intentions of cancelling my eq1 account anytime ever so heh.  So i'll see what I can do about getting at least one copy of OoW at some point but I'm not making any promises. I hate leaving you for a while with no update but I have no way of getting OoW atm anyway.. Kinda having a too broke to breath moment. I'll keep watching the thread and answer any questions or help with problems.<br />

No more updates? I hope you reconsider <br />

But alas I do not...There's still a possiblity that I may get it just not in the next week for sure. I mostly posted just to let you know not to hold your breath for updates. I have no way of making them atm as I don't even have the files.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so i was talking to the hubby and maybe we can work something out about getting at least one copy once we get our hands on some cash so i can get you guy's updates and we can check out the new content and such. I mean we've never missed an expansion yet.... If this does transpire it will probably be my last update to this UI unless something major happens and it starts to crash... I will begin work on the UI for eq2 after that and hope to see you all in the eq2interface forums once eq2 is released. Untill then I'll be taking a break from coding and such.... again don't hold you're breath but there is hope :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fireheart</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">... So, where do I send my 1 dollar donation?  If all it takes is for a few of us Centhena-junkies to chip in, in order to keep our UI current, then it's well spent.  Even though I, myself, don't expect to buy OoW soon - maybe in a month, or for Christmas...  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grymgroeth</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Happily enough, it seems something like 90% of the changes do *not* require an OoW subscription to patch in and test.  Unlike the last silly change that was so sadisticly evil this one seems to be fairly simple and straight forward.  I have little reason to buy OoW after the horrid GoD release and the issues ppl are *still* having with its content but simply to be rid of the error message it's worth attempting to keep up with the changes to the UI, especially as much as I absolutely love this UI  :cool:<br />
<br />
If it would simplify your life Centhena, I would be willing to do what I can with the updates and email the modded files to you or something  :D<br />
<br />
-------update-------<br />
After some testing and fiddling I have managed to get all but the options window updated to my satisfaction after the OoW patch.  What Im looking at doing with the options window is moving the new &quot;advanced options&quot; button from the 2nd tab where it deafults to the first tab that already has a ton of buttons.  This is as much for ascetics as just making sense to me and seemingly less work than reorganizing the second tab.  (I'll be done with this in about 10 minutes Hurricane Ivan permitting)<br />
<br />
The only assistance I would need from Centhena to keep everything looking right is a mod on the art for the CastSpellWnd so the 9th spellgem has a border.  I'll be the first to admit art is just not my thing and I leave it to those better than myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grymgroeth</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I managed to find a way to keep the advanced OoW display options button on the Display tab afterall with a bit of juggling.  I don't have borders on the new windows yet but everything works with no compatability warnings.  If Centhena feels up to it, I'll email her the recoded files to post for download in the morning.  Im not going to attempt to do pics of the revised windows with Ivan playing havoc on my dialup :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">fireheart you are one in a million :) thanks for the offer but i'm not asking anyone for money *giggle* if worse comes to worse and I can't buy it and you guys really feel the need i do have paypal set up for my ebay auctions (hehe i collect books) at Centhena@comcast.net but I'm not even sure if you can send to it heh. But like I said I don't expect or ask anyone to donate anything.<br />
<br />
Grymgroeth i'm glad you're getting things working for you. I appreciate your offer to send me your files but if i can't test them then I can't add them to the main file and as we all know with out the expansions the benifits don't work... you are however welcome to post them on this thread as unofficial updates/fix's... anyway.... my hubby get paid on friday. bills come first of course but i'll see how much we have left after. we're a check to check house so i can't promise but if i can spare it I'll see what i can do about picking it up.<br />

I've only included the existing files changed in the OoW update, no borders on the new windows yet since Ivan has done horrible things to my dialup :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grymgroeth</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I missed an edit on the location for the 9th spellgem and had to fix it so heres the updated version.  Couldn't tell it was off till I saw a gem in the slot :(<br />
<br />
Had to upload the file again, I grabbed the wrong version - thatll teach me to upload stuff at 330am on less than 2 hours sleep</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it doesn't look like i&quot;m gonna be able to get OoW any time in the extreamly near future. The funds just aren't there this time. I'd love to get it and check it out and update the ui and such but I just can't justify spending the $30 on something that I'll probably never actually play. Perhaps I'll be able to buy it in the future but as it looks right now I'm not sure. sorry guys if i were rich..... but couldn't we all say that about a lot of things.<br />

So, Grymgroeth, Centhena, or whoever, here is some art for the Centhena UI Spellbar:  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fireheart</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Err, okay, I hope this worked.  There should be two attachments.  Both are TGA images for the Spellbar, two different versions.  They have art for both 8-gem and 9-gem spellbars.  The tricky part is figuring out how to encode them.  A 'perfect' solution would be for the game to check to see if the 9th gem is available and, if so, to substitute the extended spellbar art...  Pixel size and location info is also inscribed on the art.  Hope it's useful!<br />

I haven't even had time to attempt adding the &quot;new&quot; player options to the custom window yet that went in 2 patches ago.  Hopefully I can look at these this week and actually get the spellgems updated at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fireheart</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In fact, I'm glad I did those when I did, since my professors really kicked it in and now I'm constantly swamped with homework, too.  I've managed only one brief visit to Norrath in the last weeks.  People were wondering what had happened to me!<br />
<br />
I hope the pics turn out useful, I've been tempted to try my hand at coding for them, myself, but I just don't have the time to spare.  I'm starting to think that there should simply be two versions, one for people who need the 9th gem and one for the rest of us.<br />
