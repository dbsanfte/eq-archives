Hide your children and lock the donkey in the oven, folks, this one's HOT! That's right, now you can have a tiny animated dancing girl on your Music Player Window of your very own! She'll dance and dance and not stop dancing until you exit the game, by which point her curvacious little pixelated undulating figure will be burned onto your corneas! <br />
<br />
She comes in two packages, one an excellent  music player mod by Akshue (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4150&amp;highlight=music), the other an equally cool music player mod by Yuniargo (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=22211#post22211)(shown in screenshot), for which I kindly thank both authors for such excellent moddage. To install, simply download, unzip, and copy the files (EQUI_MusicPlayerWnd.xml and spritedance.tga) for the music window mod of your choice (screenshots provided in their respective folders to make choosing easy!) into your modded interface directory and ¡Viola! your tiny dancer is ready to show you her moves! <br />
<br />
She cycles through a whopping 68 frames of animation, and is guaranteed to offer precisely 850% more viewing pleasure than *cough* a certain other, greatly inferior yellow-coloured dancer (who will remain nameless Die, bananaman!) before she gets mind-numblingly boring! Don't delay, download Casanunda's Music Window Dancer today! (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=625) ! Or we breaka yo' face!<br />
<br />
Note: For best results, playing techno or rock music is recommended; however, dancing girl will also dance to Mozart or Polka, assuming the price is right. Attempting to mate with Tiny Dancing Girl is a federal crime. You have been warned. :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I kind of enjoyed doing this, and i've done most of the hard work already with the coding, so if anyone has any sprites or animations they'd like me to mod in, i'll gladly do them, just post em here :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">murphyrulez</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am oddly.... aroused?<br />
<br />
 I like it. I like it alot. I wonder if you can make this girl my cursor?<br />
 That banana needs to die. Die. Banana. Die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know how to do cursors. Don't have the knowhow, don't have the software. Though I suspect that, with the ease I was able to obtain a full, registered version of PSP v7.4 from Kazaa, I could find some decent cursor editing software fairly easily. Also, keep looking for your favourite little animations like this that you'd like to have made into animations in game, my offer still stands. I'm currently browsing the catacombs of the RPG Icons Archive (http://www.rpgicons.com/frames.html) for eq-esque sprites, so yall do that as well and tell me what you like ^.^ I've found this one, from some game called Lady Sia, which I particularly like, it reminds me of barbarian lasses: <br />

<br />
And Murphy...one would think I'd be rather disturbed by your post, but I admit that when I first saw her, I felt a similar emotion. There's just something appealing about sprites. Just..uhm..don't get your hopes up.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
