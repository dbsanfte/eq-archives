<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tabashir</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have played with quartz to move the clickables to one side of the screen, added arista's timer and moved all of the inventory to 1 window. I have moved the casting bar into the target bar and slimmed the spell gem and hotbox windows. I also added a sleeker spellbook and buff window. However since doing that I cannot find out who made them to credit them. I will do as soon as I find out. If you made them, feel free to mail me.<br />

The version you see in the screenie is with no textures, but I have included an ini in the zip to put the textures back in. These are modded to fit better with the new box shapes, but I am not artistic and so if anyone likes this skin and wants to tidy them up, feel free!<br />
