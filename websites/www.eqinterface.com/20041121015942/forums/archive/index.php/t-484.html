I have lost the right caps for my custom gauges in a new hotbutton box I am creating.  The thing is finished except for the damned end caps and I am completely stumped as to why they are not showing.  I would be very grateful if someone could take a look and post up suggestions as to what could be going wrong.<br />

Cheers<br />

*EDIT*<br />
<br />
Slight edit to included files.  Removed EQUI.XML as removing the player window appears to make EQ barf its cookies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
when you changed the size eq just chops the extra stuff off,<br />
 a fix? hmm<br />
<br />
try looking in one of the drag item files for a guage and chop it? but then that would screw with everything. i think you need the rocket scientist's guide to using your own pictures (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=458) by psychogears. if there is in fact a drag item picture for a guage you'd have to copy it, chop it, and add a cap. <br />
<br />
sorry for not knowing anything. =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edan Humblefut</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using your Casting Gauge you have listed in HotButtonWnd.xml.<br />
<br />
You have it defined as the following<br />
<br />
Size<br />
  x=84<br />
  y=8<br />
<br />
This tells the interface that your gauge is ONLY 84 pixels wide.<br />
<br />
Your animations file shows the end caps are both 4 pixels wide and the gauge background is 84 pixels wide.<br />
<br />
Seems to me you need to define the gauge size in HotButtonWnd.xml as:<br />
<br />
Size<br />
  x=92<br />
  7=8<br />
<br />
You forgot to include the endcaps when setting the size of your gauge.</div></div><hr />
