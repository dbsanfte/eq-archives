<br />
I really like it, vyx. They all line up, and that's probably the coolest feature of all...you can do a lot when the window dimentions share a common side. I see that it's just been uploaded, so I'll have to try it out ^.^<br />
<br />
Come on, someone else post here too. It's a good mod and deserves recognition :D</div></div><hr />
