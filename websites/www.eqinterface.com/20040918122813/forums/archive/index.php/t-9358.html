I assume &quot;Barton&quot; to be a play against &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, &quot;fink&quot; being the partial Spoonerism of your name.<br />
<br />
clever. oh so clever. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And smeg it all, I miss Red Dwarf.<br />

*edit: And I've been checking out WorldForge. I am almost giddy at the concept of in-game development of spells unique unto myself..... /drool</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cleaned the code some, removed the mapwindow.  Prepared a little for the LDoN updates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinkfu</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Updated again 8/9/2k3 <br />
Was able to clean the code a bit better this time, also cleaned the graphics so it is a smaller download,<br />
<br />
added a brand new version of my FU1DeadLeaf background, hope everyone likes it...<br />
<br />
look for the download shortly in the completes link<br />
<br />
thats it for now :-)</div></div><hr />

~added ERROR FREE CODE to FU6~ <br />
~shrunk the UI again~ <br />
~switched back to the older selector bar (it has all the buttons)~<br />
~the UIerrors folder will still show warnings on missing graphics files, but this wont give you a error message in the game~<br />
~put the pet bar back in the player window, it will appear above the player health gauge where the name show have been~<br />
~added the buttons for the group window including LFG button~<br />
~reset the FU version number to 666 because that is Tinkfu's Luck number~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinkfu</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the Error Free Codeing is causeing a bad side effect, by default the EQUI.xml in FU6.66 looks for the missing files (ie* the ones I didn't mod) in the default before the game can tell you it can't find them and load them itself.  This is all fine, the problem we have found is after using the UI, with this code, and completely logging out, the patch server has to redownload the files in the default folder that the FU6 folder used..<br />
<br />
this fix allows you to make a copy of the default and use it so you don't have to patch every time to try to enter EQ<br />
<br />
completely copy the default UI folder, name it OtherDefault  and the UI and game should work fine with this patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a fix comming in later today for Tinkfu's FU<br />
<br />
btw the above patch is no longer needed<br />
<br />
I am going to put the Lunix buff window in FU666 as a option so look inside the Lunix folder and copy it to the main if you want to use it.  Also I am preparing it for LDoN.<br />
<br />
well, I'm off to fix it, see you all next patch :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FU6.70 will be downloadable soon, it is 100% ready for LDoN, so that means no running back here to find a update after LDoN.<br />
<br />
also I removed the old BlackLeaf backgrounds to shrink the size of the UI for people on dialup.  If you still want the background you can download it below</div></div><hr />
