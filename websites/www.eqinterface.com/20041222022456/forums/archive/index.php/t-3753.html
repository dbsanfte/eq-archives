From what I've read there is a chance you could get banned for using it, then again there is also a chance it is not breaking the rules of the eula. Try doing a search for it at yahoo or some place like that. Shouldn't be too hard to find.</div></div><hr />

They're never going to officially condone it, but neither are they going to go witch hunting the people who use it. They figure that if it can get people to buy more accounts (so that you can play two characters at once) that's more money for them, and who can argue with that?</div></div><hr />

YES, it is a Bannable Offense, if they find out your using it... <br />
<br />
YES we do not want anyone to link the file or upload it here.. we don't want SOE coming down on our heads.. it IS breaking the EULA and we can not support that (sorry)<br />
<br />
NO, they will not turn a blind eye, sorry.. SOE itself hates this program, I have heard of &quot;guides&quot; using it.. but GMS will not tolerate it..<br />
<br />
If you don't think its banable, send a GM a tell telling them EQW is not working correctly.. see if you dont get booted and locked with in 5mins (read about someone doing that on another board, was very funny)<br />
