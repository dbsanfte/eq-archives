Well, lots of things have been happening behind the scenes.<br />
First of all let me say this: THE DATES ARE NOT CHANGING. IT IS STILL 4/1/04 - 4/4/04.<br />
<br />
Negotiations with the Rio Hotel &amp; Casino broke down this week (they were stalling a lot and dragging things out among other things) and we are now on a fast track working with the Hilton again. The Hilton took very good care of us last year, and I'm happy that we can go back there.<br />
<br />
I'm doing some contract negotiations with them now and I hope to have the site up by the 1st of Feb. /cross fingers<br />
<br />
Sorry to anyone who booked a room at/near the Rio I apologize but I have always said &quot;Nothing's for sure, book at your own risk.&quot; Sorry.<br />
<br />
You should have plenty of time to cancel and move things around if you need to. (sorry Alla.)<br />

Soooo Watch for a Fan Faire Page to be up, and if you were not at last years Vegas Faire it was a BLAST!! Dolby and I both are planning to attend this year! <br />
<br />
Will post more as I found out!<br />
