<br />
On page 97 Dreadlands the monster level is wrong... 1-10? I think not. What giant do you know that is level 10 let alone 1?<br />
<br />
On page 246 Karana, Western Plains... the following are wrong.<br />
A. should be To the Northern Plains of Karana<br />
B. should be To the Qeynos Hills<br />
And D. Ogre Holy Circle is misplaced as it is located in the hills not next to the water as shown on the map. That area is the undead battle field.<br />
<br />
Maybe they should of contacted hmmm someone who has the proper information before throwing out a book with the incorrect info. But then again thats Verant/SOE for ya!<br />

But the book is cool nonetheless..</div></div><hr />

Call me odd, but I think it would have been nice if they discussed a few of the new features that came with this expansion, like the raid window. But from what I read, and I admit I skipped through most of it, I didn't see it even mentioned. Nothing on the &quot;graveyards&quot; either. That's a new concept that I would have liked to have read a bit about while I was installing or patching. Ah well, I guess we can't have it all.</div></div><hr />

I still have no idea what these Graveyards are and what they are for.  Can someone please shed some light on this for the uninformed?  <br />

Dammit, I'm always the last to know anything...</div></div><hr />

When you die if you wait 20min your corpse will pop in the grave yard. So you can go die in a really bad place and CR will be easy. From what I've seen grave yards are always located at the zone in/out point.</div></div><hr />

Wonder if sony will realize their mistake in the book and release a &quot;patched&quot; book... then send &quot;patch&quot; pens to everyone who bought the first one so they can make the proper changes? of course they would have to include a &quot;manual Patcher Bic Pen&quot; with every book after that too... hmmm... lol...</div></div><hr />

The other funny thing I noticed about this &quot;manual&quot; is that it contains 90% of the content of another of their newly released books (I believe it was the Player's Guide).</div></div><hr />
