<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manchaca</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded a UI yesterday, and now I've got a major headache that I can't seem to fix.                My confirmation boxes are very small and  have no yes or no option, making it impossible to accept rezzes and teleports.<br />
<br />
I put in a larger height and width for the confirmation dialogue window in my UI_mytoon_myserver ini file, reverted to default UI, and toyed with some other possible fixes, but I had no luck correcting it.  <br />
<br />
Any advice here would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I still don't get a yes/no.            Guess a game reinstall is the only fix for me. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lexola2113</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also tried what was listed as solutions.  I also cut and pasted another persons UI conf dialog box info into my user interface file.  I tried deleting my whole default ui file as well.  None of these fixes seemed to repair and restore a yes or no box.  Is reinstalling Everquest the last resort for this sort of problem?  <br />

Thanks again for your assistance<br />

<br />
Now what I do is I go into the game. I pretend to drop something on the ground twice to bring up two confirmation boxes and then on the third drop attempt a normal drop confirmation box pops up, and stays that way until I log out etc. Until we get this situated, I am  gonna have to keep doing this I guess.</div></div><hr />
