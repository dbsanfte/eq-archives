Well I thought Everquest would be a bit better with all the changes that went in during the year I was gone, but it only lasted a few weeks. Although my time back was short the bazaar was almost worth the money I spent on SoL (I said almost), I finally got a character to level 35 highest I have ever got in any MMORPG and made around 10k by the time my character was level 20 {I love spiderling/spider(s) and their rich soft silks}.<br />
<br />
I would give my things away but I did that before I left the last time you never know when EQ will pull you back in to its grasp. I will more and likely head back to FPS games or DAoC for now. Wish I could stay and get my twenty-nine dollars worth out of SoL but oh well.<br />
<br />
Why am I posting this here, it is kind of like a EQ'ers Anonymous {EQA} thing where I solidify my canceling and leaving Everquest to collect more dust. Well everyone good luck with your journeys in EQ and with PoP, I might see you and shoot you in Planetside or sell you a multi-lingual droid in SWG. <br />
<br />
I am also a little mad because of how the world does business I know its gonna happen all the time probably for the rest of time. For example the new Raid interface is only usable with PoP I know it would be awhile for any of my chars to participate in a raid but it is forcing the many who can into buying PoP just so they can go on a raid and not get left out (I know I know its to soon its just what I forsee, the majority will force the minority into purchasing PoP....its kind of what happened when the bazaar went live and now everyone and his grandma has SoL (not including about 5 people I met in the month I was back they were either stubborn undecided about staying or just didnt have the cash for SoL) BLEH BLEH BLEH BLEH!!<br />
<br />
Enough of my ramblings time for me to leave :nana:  good luck and be safe to the masses :nana:</div></div><hr />
