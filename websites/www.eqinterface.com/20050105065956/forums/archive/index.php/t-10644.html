<br />
First of all, I'd like to thank everyone involved for the effort they put forth to make these custom UI's for us.<br />
<br />
My problem:  I downloaded the Solaria &amp; Vert Oct 9 Patch.zip for the new pet buff window.  The pet command window looks fine, the pet buff window looks fine, but the player stats window has problems.  None of the graphic icons show up for the resists (fire, cold, etc.), and none of the text icons show up for stats (STR, STA, etc.), but the values of each do show up.  Also, when I open the player tab, the game lags like crazy.  <br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Looks like the graphic file that was replaced from the Solaria 10/9 patch overwrote the spell window and player info window graphics.</div></div><hr />

Have seen the lag, although since the patch my hard drive is chattering away and in POK it's like I'm swimming in jello (but I think that it due to things other than vert).<br />
<br />
From the date on the file on the download page, it doesn't appear that this issue has been resolved as of Friday, October 17th.<br />
<br />
Sadly the last time I tried to modified my UI, I ended up pulling out my hair, so this time I'll wait since I just love my Vert UI.<br />
<br />
&lt;patiently waiting a fix for her beloved UI&gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinaei</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I upgraded to Vert2.6e fixed the problem with pet/player info window and lag but then spell book was all messed up causing the same problem with video lag.<br />
<br />
After messing around with it for like 45 mins i just upgrade to Solaria and all works well now. Still prefer the buff windows from vert but Solaria will do .</div></div><hr />
