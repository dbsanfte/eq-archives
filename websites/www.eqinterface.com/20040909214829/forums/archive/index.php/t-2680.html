Most designed for casters. Gonna work on a melee version. Please give me your comments on what to get rid of and what to keep. Mostly I wanted the spell gems, pet commands and hotkeys fairly close together.<br />

Btw, cast gauge is under the spell gems, the buff window is along the top (transparent atm).  Also has Athees location mod in it, to activate it type /f       its in the feedback window. I forgot to mention that it was in there in the readme.<br />
<br />
I kinda rushed the release as i was about to move and wanted to post it, so the readme is has some faults. <br />
<br />
Usable in 1152x 864 and 1280x960  prolly usable in more but i havent checked. <br />
<br />
please post here with any suggetions or flaws. <br />
<br />
It is available for download  in the complete section of this site. File name is Drestin.zip</div></div><hr />
