Try this out and see what you think, it's an XML mod for the spell gem window ( the thin bar usualyy on the elft that has your 8 memmed spells in it ). Sorry no screenshot. The entire window is the vertical gauge that empties, from top to bottom, as you cast a spell.<br />

But then, I can't believe I created a circular gauge that took 51 gauges..... anywho, yes, this is about the only way to make a completely vertical gauge. Problem is, obviously, alot of gauges and a nice big xml file. Another problem I've considered is that this might cause 'laggy' effects on less robust computer systems.<br />
<br />
I'll give you a 'pat on the back' for actually sitting down and putting in all 100 gauges tho. <br />
<br />
Oh, and if I'm not mistaken, you don't need a seperate animation for each line of the gauge. Infact, since each gauge encompasses a single percent of the total gauge, you could probably get by with a single animation that's 1 pixel high, and use the same animation for each gauge.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a fairly powerful machine ( AMD Athlon XP 1500, 512 MB SDRAM, GeForce 3 Ti200 ) and a way to monitor EQ's framerate and lost maybe 10 frames per second with this and hitting F10 to hide the UI gives me about 37 frames a sec increase, so obviously it isn't easy on the CPU. Also, I used a tab box and page to limit the gauge's left and right so that theorhetically this gauge could work without having to take up the whole window, I just made it use the whole window so it'd be big and visible. The way I coded it allows for you to use just one animation file. I actually just used a 20 pixel wide, 1 pixel high section from the note window background for the gauge.<br />

This also has a skin applied to it, that's why the cast gems are square and the border is weird, without the skin, it looks quite different.<br />

<br />
i can't quite understand how that works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, to make a vertical gauge, instead of being 100 pixels wide imagine it's 100 pixels tall, one pixel per percent. Since you can't REALLY make a vertical gauge, it's 100 gauges stacked on top of each other and coordinated so they disappear as the bars drop. Uh, yeah.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how did you coordinate it to disappear 1% at a time with a different gauge is what im wondering...<br />
<br />
its all the same gauge but duplicated 100x, but has a delay factor put in or something ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't looked at the code but my impression is he probably played with the gaugeoffset x value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the gauges are just thousands of pixels wide and only a 40 pixel wide segment is shown, they're staggered so that the one percent that it's supposed to be represented is showing.</div></div><hr />

is it possible to include names of spells ?<br />
<br />
i've played with it some, and it seems to be pretty lag free, but so many of my spell icons are the same, the text names would be a BIG help .. especially on raids where you have to pop the spells fast  :)<br />
