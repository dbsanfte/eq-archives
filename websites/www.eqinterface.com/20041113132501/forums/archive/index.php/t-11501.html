<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This UI was based on some of the artwork in T.King's Steamworks UI ..  I basically took his graphics for the windows (from the 4 main UI .tga files) and modified them a bit..  It has a nice glass tube look to it..  ;) . <br />
<br />
Other modifications:<br />
<br />
 - horizontal hotbutton bar and spellcast bar<br />
 - player hp and mana bars are placed in the group window, and the group window is transparent<br />
 - target window is also transparent<br />
 - player window now has inventory slots, stats and exp bars in it to make them always accessible<br />
 - inventory window is reduced to player info (name, class, etc), money, class animation and buttons (face, dye, skills) and is renamed as &quot;Player&quot;<br />
 - buff and song windows have the spell names next to the icons<br />
 - pet window modified to match the buff and song windows.. pet buffs show up just like the player buffs with spell name.  pet hp bar and commands are in the bottom of the window<br />
 - compass modified to match the look of the UI<br />
 - includes T.King and Remelio spellbook art and coding<br />
