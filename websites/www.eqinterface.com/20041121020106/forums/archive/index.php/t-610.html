For example, it looked like I could move money, at least to a tabbox, even though it looks alot like a button.<br />
<br />
I am fairly new to moding these, so I don't know many.  For now I do know:<br />
<br />
IW_CharacterView - Cannot be moved.  Must be in InventoryWindow.<br />
<br />
That's all I have checked.  But I would appreciate it if others post items they couldn't move to other windows.<br />
<br />
Maybe we can get a complete list of unmovable items.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing wrong with changing sizes to 0 instead, or moving them to an invisible area.</div></div><hr />
