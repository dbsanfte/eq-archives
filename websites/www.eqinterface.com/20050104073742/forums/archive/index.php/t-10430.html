<br />
Maybe that's what he's refering to?.. I'm assuming that you made sure that the technical parts met specifications (zip the files, not exceed size... etc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No I wasn’t referring to number 8. I dont think I've ever used number 8. I have no idea what rule/guideline Kenny was breaking at the time but he might.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If any of you XML Guru's out there know how to create one, please do, if you need suggestions on what it should look like, send me a PM and I will more than glad to tell you what I would like to see it look like.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is an interesting idea and would love to give it a shot... I'm not the greatest UI guy out there, but I can hold my own.<br />
<br />
I guess my first concern with the idea is that there are areas in the UI where the graphic actually serves a function... just as an example, the spell bar. If we were to remove the spell Icons and just show the spell names, I'm not sure if it's possible to make the labels themselves act like the spell gems do (i.e. left click to forget, etc.)<br />
It may very well be possible... I probably need to just try it and see...<br />
<br />
I also wonder how far the &quot;text only&quot; thing would go... you would probably still need the graphics in the inventory window and a couple other places...<br />
<br />
Just throwing ideas out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lurker99</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the major pro's about an all TEXT GUI would be scalability (sp?). depending on what resolution you use, just increase the font size. no more having to worry about fitting all those graphics in a 800X600 window..<br />
<br />
I think all images can have a text representation, at least that's what I noticed while using SIDL XML editor.. <br />
<br />
I just DL'd Sidl, so I will attempt to learn it and see if I can come up with something usefull...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lurker99</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, now I know why I don't make my living as a coder.... I can't figure this XML out. :(<br />
<br />
If anyone is willing to give this idea a shot, I would really appreciate it.<br />
<br />

Thank You</div></div><hr />
