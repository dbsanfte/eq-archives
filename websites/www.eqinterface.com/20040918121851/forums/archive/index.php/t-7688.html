You can download it by clicking here (http://chase80000.freeyellow.com/weight.zip).<br />
<br />
Here's one that switches the numerical HP in the Player Window so that the Current HP is first. (Current HP / Max HP)<br />

<br />
Also, here's a mod for the Book Window that's been bugged forever.  This one is compatible with Vert2(1).5a LoY patch.<br />
