If possible having the casting time bar up on the very top would be sweet, otherwise in the position I labeled (alt). The EB and Casting time bars can be made really thin as well as the STA bar (and even the Mana Bar if it looks too tall, but I'd like to keep the XP and HP bars the normal thickness). That should help from making this thing get too tall. I would also like the background and schemes to say the basic way the rest of the UI is, instead of getting all high tech if you could :) <br />
<br />
I would like this to get as small as possible but still be able to read it (even if just barely :p ) I am pretty sure the stats and saves and such at the bottom will need to be in a pretty small size to fit without making the window too fat.  If possible it'd be sweet to have the window size just as fat as a normal sized Bar with a small % next to it. The % signs can be neglected as I will know it is referring to %. <br />
<br />
Any color coding you would like to do, feel free, but I can prolly change that stuff fairly easy. If you have any more questions, ask away. I know this is quite a big request, but I would be sooooo grateful to anyone who could make me something like this or even anything similar, and I know quite a few friends who would be pleased as well...<br />

*edit*: I learned how to spell and I changed the paragraphing to make more sense.</div></div><hr />
