I have not tested all of the animations available.<br />
<br />
[list=1] In your custom UI folder, right-click on the animations file and open the file in wordpad, not notepad. Click the Save button, once. Close the animations file. Run Thomus' install exe file and remmy.exe (keep the checkbox selected) Test in EQ[/list=1]<br />
Apparently, opening and saving in wordpad removes the horrible formatting which is what is causing remmy.exe to fail.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the workaround above doesn't work, you can follow the steps below to manually update your animations file:<br />
<br />
[list=1] Make a temporary working folder Make a copy of your animations file and place it in this temporary working folder. Run t.king's install program and unzip the files into your working folder, but do not run remmy.exe (uncheck the box). When t.king's install program is finished you will find the graphics files and two text files in your working folder. The text files contain the required code to update your animations file. Copy the contents of rem_tex.txt into your animations file Copy and paste the contents of rem_anim.txt over the existing class animation you are trying to update. Copy your working folder into your EQ uifiles directory and test the new animations file in EQ.[/list=1]If all goes well you can copy the animations file and graphics files into your custom ui folder.<br />

The formatting of the EQUI_Animations.xml file is back to normal and my program should read it properly again.  I'm sorry I didn't get my fix out to everyone in the first place, but I am still working on a version that won't crash for the many people that are having issues with it un-related to the formatting of the animations file.<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />
