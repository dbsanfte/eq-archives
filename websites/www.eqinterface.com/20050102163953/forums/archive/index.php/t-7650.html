<br />
I log on or zone.. my map pops up automatically, and show's everything...check map later, only to have no information showing, no map, no labels nothing.<br />
<br />
I double checked to make sure I had the map in the /maps directory. that was ok, I checked to make sure the hight filter was off and that I was using the correct layers.. still nothing<br />
<br />
this is in any perticular zone.. it happens randomly.<br />
<br />
I have tried downloading the maps again and installing them. -- did not work<br />
<br />
I have tried to re-load the UI while in game -- did not work<br />
<br />
I have tried to use default UI --- did not work<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or fixes would be greatly appreciated as I have died a couple of time due to this ( got lost while exploring).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks so much</div></div><hr />

First, check to see if the height filter is on. One thing that I have noticed when using my maps is that when the height filter is on, I can't see diddly on my map, except for the little marker showing where my character is. Secondly, check to see how &quot;high&quot; up the view is. Personally, I prefer to see an entire zone as opposed to one teeny tiny portion of it. When the height filter is off, you should be able to adjust the view to whatever you feel most comfortable with. It does seem to turn the height filter on and off at the games leisure, and I'm not sure why this is or if there is any fix for it. :(<br />
<br />
Any way, hopefully this helps a bit.</div></div><hr />
