<br />
Aya's had none of that and was quite good, and I liked it a lot.. so I started playing with it for my cleric.  It had way too much pet stuff and the hp bars were far too spread out, so I made some modifications to 4 of the windows:  Group, Target, Player and Pet.<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of it in use.  I haven't posted this but if theres any interest I will.    It is built to work with 1600x900 but I'm sure that the windows can be moved around easily for any resolution.  I did this all in SIDWIDL so no idea of the programming - hence limited support.<br />
