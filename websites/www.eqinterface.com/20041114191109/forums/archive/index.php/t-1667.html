<br />
great UI! was curious if more wc3 icons are gonna be added so as to as some variety to the buff icons, most use the yellow/green sheild. no clue i play eq too much so never got into wc3 hehe! well good job, if can some more icons would rock<br />

<br />
One request, on the main player/group window...any possible way to get the % numbers added to it?  I know they exist on the tabbed version right now...but having them added to the player/group window would be a great help as well.<br />
<br />
Once again, awesome work, spell icons are great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mozartz</div><div class="date">08-31-2002, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me echo what Existe said... I use your group/player info window and it is excellent. I would love to see a couple mods as well:<br />
<br />
(1) % as to each bar... may require you make the window just a tad wider.<br />
(2) current hp/total hp indicator on the player info<br />
(3) Something I have only seen in one other mod.. have the STA bar double as the casting bar.. real nice for casters. If there is no cast going on, the bar represents STA, once a cast starts, the bar changes to the casting bar...<br />
<br />
Fantastic work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mebashin</div><div class="date">09-01-2002, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a great mod, one of my favorites so far.  I like the way that all the classes were taken into account in the design.  I would rather have different setups of the same mod than a totally different mod for each of my toons, and this mod makes that very easy.<br />
<br />
I agree with Mozartz's #3: doubling the sta bar with the casting bar is a great idea.  The small casting bar is kinda hard to see when my bard attempts to twist.  One other thing:  would it be possible to have the hotkeys on top of the tabbed area in the hk window, instead of side-by-side?<br />
<br />
Overall it's a great mod.  Good job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raxthorne</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Yes, I'll make those changes as well as others that have been requested. I'll be adding the modifications to the web site. I'll post when they are done. <br />
<br />
The number of icons that were used from WC3 were somewhat limited in scope. I also tried to keep the same kind of look and feel of similar spells so that things don't get too confusing. The spell icons take a long time to make, so I'll see what I can come up with in the future. :)<br />

Kinda like right after a patch.<br />
It is extremely agravating.<br />
Peeps you will be better off saving Rax's webpage in favorites.<br />
Did I just screw your bandwidth with that suggestion Rax?<br />
<br />
DOH!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only one thing that I noticed since last patch is I now get errors on screen saying skin is out of date. As I inspected what could be changed I noticed that file for merchants is updated since now merchants have up to 60 slots to sell items right?<br />
<br />
Rax are you going to update the file anytime soon or you are doing on some other things maybe as in that case I would have to move my lazy behind and update myself :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raxthorne</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will be updating the UI to make changes that poeple have request and to fix the patch. The only window that is afftected by the patch is (EQUI_MerchantWnd.xml) . The only thing that I did was to make the boarders of this window smooth. So for now you can simply delete that file from my UI and you should not get the warning anymore. The nice thing with these warnings is that EQ is not going to crash the UI as VI changes it.<br />

<br />
Only a a couple of mods I would like added.<br />
<br />
As stated before, % for all bars.  Including Mana, Exp etc.  Everything..if possible I'm sure it would make it a bit wider.<br />
<br />
The only other thing I wanted, was how can I change the slots in the combat pages..like for my monk he has legs that would be right click instead of a earring.  How can these be changed?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Can we get different colors too (I use different colors for each character)?  Would love to see 'Druid Green' or 'SK Red'...<br />
<br />
After playing with a number of skins, this is the one I will probably stay with.<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">biella</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love your UI.. I do have a couple questions however. Would there be a possibility of increasing the size of the mana xp and aaxp on the first page of that thing, in the green digits? I love that, but it's pretty hard to see (Lol I think I need sit closer to my comp but oh well)<br />
<br />
also , I was curious..do you think you could make another version of your target window? I love that also but if it had a % on the number,  and if you could make that number bright green like the others I don't think i'd ever switch UI's again..<br />
<br />
Thanks for making this anyway.. Great UI and matched with Tkings undead icons it makes my necro feel right at home :)</div></div><hr />

Is it possible to put the HP % next to the players name. This would help in determing rune time etc.<br />

On the casters tab instead of having the big box on the left monitor stamina, could you move stamina to the small box on the right and replace the big box on the left with MANA?  As a caster I dont care much about stamina I need to be able to see my mana.  If you can Thanks in advace and keep up the great work.<br />

I would agree with Havoc it would be nice to see mana in the big box ...rather than stamina<br />

How would one go about customizing it to have the tiems they need in, there?  For instance i need bp, arms, earring, face, boots, and one inventory slot.  I also agree witht eh previously mentioned changes involving the percantage on the meters.  Personally i would like a much more visable casting time bar as well, but over all i love the skin.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I absolutly LOVE this UI in general, but like veryone, there are a couple of things I would like different.<br />
<br />
<br />
% on the main group window(addressed by others)<br />
<br />
Totally remove the target and casting timers from the hotkey window. I would like to have a separate target/casting timer window that I can position where I want.<br />
<br />
As a cleric, I like a nice thick, very visible, casting timer that has a small separation between it and the lifebar of the target.<br />
<br />
Just an oddity of mine, but I would like to have my lifebar/mana bar/stamina bar below the group lifebars.<br />
<br />
Strip the exp and aaexp bars off the group window to shorten it a bit. Both exp bars exist elswhere and the hotkey window has nice % indicators for them.<br />
<br />
Also strip the players class/level/diety off the group window, it makes it kinda tall...<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of it is about the group window. Its very nice, the best looking one I have seen, but its to tall for where I have it. =/<br />
<br />
Thanks, absolutly love the hotkey window, it brilliant!<br />

<br />
1. I was wondering if it was possible to stagger the names of the spells next to the spell gems when you hold ALT.<br />
<br />
2. I like the 80 slot merchant inv. could this be implimented in this mod?<br />
<br />
3. I'd like either the little thing that has the xp, axp and mana's text bigger and/or add the % to the bars.<br />

<br />
I love your UI. But since Verant patched there UI I have been havening problems with my AA menu. All my selcetions are meshed together. If you can fix this that would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixa</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tyrnt I for one love the changes you made, and Rax this is the best UI i have used, and I have used most of them or at least tried them. We have 3 accounts and at least one of every class (what can I say, I like to have a change once in a while..and have a big family).<br />
<br />
This mod works so well for more then one class, I would like the different color idea but that is minor for me.<br />
<br />
only changes I ever make is adding in the personalized timer for each character found at http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp<br />
<br />
also I added one for beast that i can no longer find, it basicly added all the skills/spells etc to the help menu under a new tab. great job whoever made that..wish i could find ya again.<br />
<br />
Hope ya answer Tyrnt's question from above soon..would love those changes..<br />
