<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Son-of-a-Gun</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So now im sitting playing EQ , i get bored and decide while im waiting for something to happen i will read a book.  I leave the room and spend 5 minutes looking for the book, sit down , look for the page and by the time im ready to read the event happened.<br />
<br />
Now why do i go through all this , i have a computer right in front of me why do i go through all this trouble ??<br />
<br />
My idea is a story window mod that puts your favorite book (say Lord of the rings) in a format so that you can read it the the story window instead of looking for the book . It would be seperated into chapters mind you.<br />
<br />
So what do you guys think ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will still do it , except i think if i use LOTR it would count as theft i think . Then again using images from Warcraft in another game in also against the agreement .</div></div><hr />

You can do it for yourself, if you already own the book. <br />
<br />
I know that (at least here in Canada) you are allowed to make as many copies of audio files from albumns which you already own, for your own personal use, as you want to make.  Whether the laws on printed materials is the same, and whether said laws are the same in the US as here in Canada ... /shrug<br />
<br />
Beyond that ... out of my depth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my understanding of copyright laws.<br />
<br />
you may make copies for your own personal use, non-public performance,  of copywritten work.<br />
<br />
soooo if you can find a digital copy of LOTR,  then you could put it in a format that you could  use.<br />
<br />
the file linked above uses public domain files which have been given permission for public release (and why we have it here). <br />
<br />
and the War Craft Images give credit back to the orginal owner of Blizzard (yes, the could ask us to remove them, but its free advertising for them.. soo prolly wont) and we dont sell them, just make them available to download..<br />
<br />
hope that helps.<br />
<br />

<br />
Kudane i don't want you to remove the warcraft stuff , its makes amazing uis .  Im just defending my idea by pointing out the flaws in other peoples' which is stupid. <br />
<br />
But i have to correct you  you see Blizzard prohibits the use of anything that it made to make people play a game that they didn't make . IE Starcraft mod for unreal or tribes (one of these two) , because of the mod people play unreal or tribes more . These uis may make people play EQ more so they are illegal , but i doubt blizzard will do something since they haven't done anything yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vulcon</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you already have a copy of the Book in text format, copy it to your EQ/Storylin/ folder and rename it storyXXXXX.txt . The first line will be what will appear in the list of topics in your storyline window (ingame).<br />
<br />
Now the Bad news is that there will no line returns, It will just all blur together because of the lack of formatting. One way of doing this is to open your text file, select all (cnt A) then past it in excel where it will fill column A. Then type &lt;br&gt; in B1 &amp; =A1&amp;B1 in C1. Drag B1/C1 down ot the bottom of the book. Copy all of colomn C and repaste in your original file, replacing what was originally there. <br />
<br />
Should look a lot better</div></div><hr />
