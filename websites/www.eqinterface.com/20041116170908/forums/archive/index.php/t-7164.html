<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">03-16-2003, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is the question. I d/l and tried to install v3 with no luck, it left the default UI in place after load. I was pretty tired when I did it, but I don't recall any *.ini files in the d/l, so I didn't &quot;use INI&quot; when I performed the loadskin. I copied the most recent v2 from the old PC and it works fine. So, like the title said I don't really know if its the UI or if it was me not doing something correctly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">03-16-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I chose not to include the .ini file this time as it seems most people want to fiddle with the layout of the windows, and the fact that getting an .ini file to retain settings for 3 different reso's was a bit of a pain. The /viewport settings should be in the readme, and from there all you have to do is line up the windows around the edges of the viewport.<br />
<br />
I believe the v3 zip has a LunaWrapv3 directory where all the files are, whereas the v2 zip didn't have the files contained in a dir. You may want to check that there isn't a 'LunaWrapv3' folder inside the custom dir you created for it. I know this is real basic, but since it is a change from v2 to v3 it could easily slip under the radar.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I'm not sure what is causing your problem. Try a fresh dl and install, check your folders, and post your 'UIErrors' file, if there's anything in it. Anyone else having this problem?<br />

Thanks<br />
