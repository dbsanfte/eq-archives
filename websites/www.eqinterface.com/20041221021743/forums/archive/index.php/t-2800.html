MB, personally I think just Kunark Dragons should be resistant to MB, no need to nerf it that bad.<br />

Monks, no comment, never played one so I can't comment with any accuracy.<br />

Cleric doenst even have to turn around, or stop healing.. since its summoned to his inventory..<br />
<br />
this would be great for focus Items too... then when I am wearing them on my mage i could still give them out..<br />

I hope they expand this &quot;targeted summonable&quot; to other items..<br />

<br />
I do agree with the changes and see why they are needed. They just should of been a lot sooner. I guess better late then never lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shashah</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I agree with the changes.  I cant help but hope they overlook the monk-tanking portion of beastlords and dont nerf them.  But I know that it really should get nerfed the same as monks.  <br />
<br />
Beastlords just tank too dang well compared to other non-plate classes, especially with the amount of aggro we can attain.  Anybody in chain should do better, not phenominally, because we are adept martial artists and have those uber belly dancer moves.<br />
<br />
About mods, I honestly dont play my mage enough on high end raids, I've retired that toon.  But I hate making a stockpile of mod2s.  I hate it even more when half of them rot or a druid picks one up to overnuke, gain aggro, waste cleric mana, and die.<br />
<br />
Oh, MB and CH, they dont really affect me but for the sake of all others, i'm glad MB got nerfed.  CH? nobody will notice a difference till later in PoP when some 65th ogre warrior has over 255sta.<br />

Even when a plate class pulls, taunts and begs, by the time the mob is at 80percent HP - I have full agro.  The only thing I can do is attack less often which seems pretty stupid.  Tank agro has a been a primary concern for along time and it still isn't being addressed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably something along the lines of a point of diminishing returns on AC - something like what happens to INT/WIS casters when we reach 200 in that stat - the mana we start getting from that stat is less than it was before 200.  Thats what it sounded like to me at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asele</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 04:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My thoughts as a wizzy are...<br />
<br />
Mod Rods - They are making mod rods a buff that the recipient can use on demand now.  If they are gonna nerf mod rods the way they are then they should come up with a group mod rod spell.  The have stated in so many words that the mod rod is more meant to be a 1 per person thing.  Why not make it group or even MGB option for mage.  Talking ot a few mages in game tonight this seems to be the general mage consensus and makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
Complete Heal - This wont even hurt CH Rotations too terribly, the rotators will just have to rotate a little faster.  And even then only if the tank has over 8500hp.  Why 8500?  Well mobs that you would use such a rotation on typically can deal 500dmg like it's nothing.  So an 8k hp warrior would still see no diff.  Maybe at 8500hp+ the tanks would notice a difference.  Not a major loss.<br />
<br />
Monk AC - &quot;'Tis better to let people think you are a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.&quot;  That being said, I can't accuartely comment on the monk AC issue.<br />
<br />
Manaburn - :mad: I play a wizard as my main.  I can understand them wanting to aleviate groups such as the one at http://www.geocities.com/mana_burner/ and other similar groups across the other servers.  I disagree with the 1 minute rule however.  The reason I do is simple.  Now when you have more than one MB wizzie on a raid you have to set up a Manaburn rotation.  The same system they are trying to aleviate with the clerics is what they are encouraging with the wizards.  I know that I for one will now be wary of having to wait 2+ hours because someone MB'd a mob 58 seconds before I did without my knowing it.  They need to at least put in a check to prevent you form MB'ing a mob that has the effect still on it, otherwise they have potentially eliminated MB's effectiveness altogether.<br />
<br />
Thos are my humble thoughts and opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorddragon14</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. MB: was needed, but yes,  they need to prevent it from being wasted with this time limit now.<br />
2. Monks: Bloddy crazy way to deal with the situation. Make a class that gets regularly thrashed worse at taking it??? Why not just up the melee abilities of the warriors/shadowknights/paladins to where they can hold the agro against a monks hitting better? I feel pity for those poor warriors..my stuns spin them around and around....trollie top!<br />
The thing that really gets me is that they want to nerf a supposed 'advantage' that makes monks overpowered, while allowing the perpetuation of another. Clerics melee better than their hybrid counterparts in upper echelons, and still regenerate enough mana to effectively heal the group. Nerf Yaulp V and that problem goes away, thereby forcing the cleric into EITHER a melee role or a healing role, but NOT both. MWahahahaha!<br />
3. CH: Not really that big a deal. Even the 'uber' tanks that have that much life get healed before they reach 0, or they'd die. Your actual hps is not as important as your 'effective hps' that is, how many hps are actually beaten down before a heal lands on you.<br />
4. Rods: No comment, not a mage, not even a caster.</div></div><hr />

With MB or Mod rod CH chain, Druid don t be allowed to come in some place cause we are too bad, now like MB is nerfed DOT and Small nuke will be needed to kill High lvl mob<br />

DROOD POOWWWAAAA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would just like to point out that it's not all mod rods that are being nerfed... just the 'Rod of Transvergance'. I know, higher levels think this is a bad thing. But since it's not all the mod rods... it's not as bad as people are making it out to be. Besides, using 1 rod every 60 seconds it's that big of a limit. Consider how many hitpoints it taps to use the rod, and how much mana it gives. If you are in a position to need continuous mana rods, then it's likely that you're going to also need someone to heal you while you use them.<br />
<br />
As for CH... kinda sucks, but not really. Granted, CH is no longer a 'Complete Heal', but 7500 HPs is alot. Most characters don't have quite that many hitpoints. And as Varent stated, no one has yet to even reach the 10500 hitpoint mark that the spell originally healed. Granted, some people may have 9k hitpoints, and CH won't completely heal them. But it does give them back a great deal of what they lost. And if they do happen to have 9k hitpoints, it's likely that when the cleric does cast CH, they are probably not completely dead anyway since CH takes so long to cast. Chancesare, the character will still have 1k or so HPs left, so the heal for 7500 would put them back to around 8000 - 8500 HPs again. Also, like Varent said, it gives way to future heal spells being implimented later on.<br />
<br />
Monks? I'm sorry... I don't know anything about them so I am not in a position to comment either way.<br />
<br />
But the change to manaburn does effect me directly. My primary character is a high level wizard (not yet 60 but close). I can understand the reasoning behind this nerf (some people were just being plain selfish and were abusing their power). But, the choice of solutions just doesn't sit well with me. Yes, Manaburn is a very powerful effect. And yes, it does give wizards a great deal of damage potential compared to other classes. And yes, a group of level 60 wizards with manaburn could potentially over power most of the high level mobs. But it comes down to fair game play. If certain players are being selfish and abusive, add something to the game to make those persons pay for their actions. Don't take away from everyone else who isn't abusing those powers. And the idea of making it so the spell can only be cast on a single mob once every so often is ridiculous. It goes one step further toward removing the sense of reality from the game. How realistic is it that a spell would leave an effect when cast such that no others could cast the same spell on that mob? In truth, to balance out the game properly, if they are going to impliment such a change on a few spells/abilities, then they should do it across the board. Make it so that all spells can only be cast on a single mob once every so often. Make it so that 2 wizards could not cast Ice Comet on the same mob in the same time frame. They did it with DoTs, now Manaburn... why not do it with all damage spells. Personally I feel that such a change would suck royally, but logically speaking, if you're going to do it with some spells, you'd best do it with all spells. It's only fair. Either do it and do it right, or don't do it at all.<br />
<br />
As far as manaburn is concerned, I would have found a better way to solve the problem. Maybe even make it so that MB didn't do 32k damage, or even make it so that MB left a residue on the mob such that it's resistance to another MB attack went up drastically. Another MB could conceivably still hit, but chances are it would be resisted. They made all these changes to the way mobs are handled, which mobs could be hit, how resists are done and so on.... wouldn't it have been easier (not to mention more fair) to add something like a special resist that was applied to a mob after it was hit with manaburn?<br />
<br />
You asked, and I spoke my feeble mind.<br />
<br />
-Cormanth<br />
<br />
P.S. For all you druids out there loving the fact that this gives you a better standing in regards to killing some mobs... maybe Varent needs to add something that limits druids abilities to quad kite so darned easily.... it's such a pain to go somewhere to hunt, only to find that half a dozen druids have moved in and owned the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think this changes are good ... as long as they revamp uber bosses to be feasable with other tactics than mod rod fields.<br />
<br />
I would like to welcome the monks in ranger's world, where you have to manage your agro to avoid getting killed.<br />
<br />
I dislike the way they 'fixed' monks , as it makes them as dependant on loot as the others class are, where they should have been nearby as good naked as they are equiped. But I understand it was the only way to do for Verant, and i just hope it won't kill the average-stuffed monks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">man, this is the deal:<br />
<br />
People who complain about this tend to forget the other classes! Ok, so they nerfed the Mod Rod II... so you make mods and mods ii. Like someone else said earlier, if you're in a position where you need to use that many Mods, then you probably need healing yourself. (I play necro... I'm all to familiar with trading HP for mana!) As well, I'm not too proud to twitch when needed. I am always up for assisting in one way or another, whether it's twitching, dotting, or nuking... WHICH brings me to my nest point: MB<br />
<br />
Yeah, they nerfed MB... so you get a couple necros buffed up with uber HP's and they drop a lifeburn assist. Umm, yeah... I said it... LIFEBURN! I think that there are some necros out there that would love to assist a wizzy like that  )<br />
<br />
About the monks: Well, I may start playing my SK again soon... Played Iksar SK's since the release of RoK, and decided I was tired of it... they didn't really have much of a roll, less hp and armor than warriors, blah blah blah.. so what does this have to do with monks getting the nerf bat? Just because I don't play my SK anymore doesn't mean I don't watch out for new SK happennings.<br />
<br />
Ok, let me start over... monks are gonna be bitchin because they are mele'ing alot of damage and gaining alot of aggro and VI is nerfing them to take more damage. <br />
<br />
SK now have a new line of spells that directly deals with this issue! SK are (supposed to be) the masters of aggro. I hardly ever had a caster die in a group that I was in! THIS is why I may play my SK again. The new SK spells include varying degrees of aggro enhancement, plus the self buffs. This means that a SK can can basically put a GREAT BIG MIDDLE FINGER ON THE CHEST OF EVERY WARRIOR OR TANK IN THE GROUP! Ok, if a tanking group consists of 2warriors, 2monks, and say 2SK's, I really don't think the monks are gonna have much aggro. Really... <br />
<br />
Oh yeah... not to start a fight, but my SK can  (and could before) outtaunt any pally in norrath. Our spells are made just for that (still cracks me up to see a L45 SK using Disease cloud... even though I know it's simply for the taunt factor!). Wanna see a mob turn on you quick? Stand right next to it and light off your Harm Touch right after taunting it...:D  only casters I have main problem with is Wizzies, but this new line of spells should help with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kimagure</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to tell you this, but SK aggro spells have been nerfed big time since you last played your iksar sk...  I'd suggest you check out shadowknight.org forums or something.  The new SK aggro spells are not even close to what Disease Cloud use to do before the resist changes.  In fact, I doubt many SK use it for aggro anymore.  Paladins with their stun now are more likely to get aggro if you're comparing who is going to get whipback-type aggro from a mob.<br />
<br />
As for the new SK spells, there isnt anything that will give you hate like DC once did.  Sure the terror line says it gives 400 points of hate or whatever, but in the grand scheme of things, 400 points doesnt mean jack apparently.  SK have said they have been chain casting it as well as having the 8% hate modifying buff up and still not getting aggro when they need to pull a mob off a group member.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KarecK</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, personaly, i play a Monk and a Shadowknight.  As for the Monk defense being nerfed, that hits home rather hard, even being under the 14 pound weight limit and with halfway decent armor&lt;not to teribly twinked&gt;, i still get owned by more mobs in the 35 to 40 range even with Mend and all offenseive capability if i screw up, i take almost as much dmg as a cleric does fighting said mobs, at least the cleric has the option to heal themself, i can heal myself once every few minutes.  So the lowering of the defensive abilitys of a monk is going to hurt an otherwise fun class to play.  As for the Cleric CH nerf. i cant truly comment on that because i do not play a cleric, but from a Sk point of view, 7500hp is 3k less hp then i would otherwise have been healed. Granted, ive never even seen a time where i had more than about 3900hp with my sk, so its hard for me to comment on that.  The Mage Mod rod2 spell i cant comment on, due to not having much experience with it, nor can i comment on the Wizard MB change, due to not having exp, and for those druids out there who think its fun to quad kite, you have obviously never gone to a zone to try and solo only to have a druid take the mob your fighting and add it to his set of mobs saying hey, i can kite, its fair.:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kagetan</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monks tend to outdamage rogues, who are fairly decent in melee damage, in the melee category, have pretty good defense and evasive capabilities, which enables them to solo.. and they can feign death, thereby dramatically reducing their chances of dying. Long overdue for a nerf, if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melosa</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing that truly disappoints me is that instead of &quot;fixing&quot; a problem, it seems as if they are taking away from many classes. Some friends and I were discussing this, and some of the ideas that were tossed out were instead of nerfing monks, why not add a little bit more versatility to the warriors? For example, give them other &quot;abilities&quot; (perhaps in AAXP) to use. Like Knockdown, Called Shot (yes, we stole these ideas from NWN). Or maybe &quot;bonus&quot; feats when using a 2-hander, not just bash. Maybe even tossing in a higher chance for a stun if a high level warrior opts to use a sword and shield style of play. Obviously, we didn't come up with detailed ideas of these, but something like this would not detract from other classes, at least not that any of us could see. It would add more variety to the tanks, and then the rest of the classes could continue doing their jobs like they always have been. <br />
<br />
As for trying to get rid of the CHeal rotation, I can't see this doing it. Especially considering the recent changes given to druid and shaman heals. Instead of getting rid of the rotation on the uber raids, they'll just have to add in a druid or shaman to help with the heals. Of course, that's just my opinion. <br />
<br />
As to the Manaburn, having never played a wizard, I can't really say much. Though my guess is that this came about because a small number of folks &quot;took advantage&quot; and some others complained. On the other hand, I've watched a group of 6 take down those dragons, why not a group of 6 wizards? <br />
<br />
On the ModRods, to me, it's a toss up. I see advantages and disadvantages in the change, and in the current situation. <br />
<br />
But overall, I guess we just have to wait and see. Oh, and keep our fingers crossed that it's not as bad as we think it's going to be.</div></div><hr />

They're trying to take a long view on keeping the game healthy and running for as long as possible, because it's a garenteed moneymaker, whereas anything new is in investment, with concurrent risks.<br />
<br />
<br />
They probably sat down, and looked at these problems, and said something to the effect of: &quot;well, either we can take these four classes down a couple of notches and retune part of the game, then fix the bards we broke doing this, or buff the other 11 classes up higher, retune the entire game, and THEN fix the bards we broke doing this.

Monks are already gear dependent to stay alive seeing as they tend to draw tooo much damned agro... and the gear has to be really light weight because of the ac penalty...  So now we get to take more dmg than we already do on top of eating agro and being responsible for using i'd estimate easily more than half the cleric's mana in a FULL group!!!  WTF are they thinking?  And wtf are they talking about the all/all being Monk loot ... Um hello?  our weight penalty already sucks up our AC as is... i'd gotten so used to NOT looting anything but friggin &quot;a salil's writ pg. 60&quot; kind of thing for so long that when i started my bard (which i now love) that i completely forgot to bother looting at all for the first 20 lvls for crying out loud.... obviously they haven't actually bothered to play the class in a real live game atmosphere now have they?  <br />
<br />
To the person who says that monks outdamage rogues generally:  you must not be playing w/very effective rogues, (and must not have played a monk) =P  cause they are about the only class who i ever have to worry about taking agro off me (aside from the occasional early nuking wizza)  ROFLMFAO!!!

Anyhow sheesh we already only can use mend (woohoo 1/4 health back every 6 mins) ok, yes can be a lifesaver in a fight long enough to give you some time to FD, but as hard as high end mobs hit, they can take out your mend in only ONE round of attack...  And everyone wants monks to be pullers cause they're so great at it... yeah we are hunkey dorey pullers when buffed to the nines and w/great gear...  but when you get into the really hard hitting mobs you end up almost half down in health before you get back to yer group esp if you have to pull any distance!  And don't even get me started on mage pets... at lvl 20 i grouped w/a couple mage friends, and their damn pets were outdamaging me  (no i didn't have decent weaps at that time.. polished steel ulak and fist - i'm nowhere near twinked.  They don't do that anymore because now i have a FBSS and better gear, but the point is, is that at no time should a blue con pet be able to outdamage a monk at any time in the monk's life regardless of gear!  And if monks are supposed to be so great at dealing dmg then make them better... i mean sheesh my monk's fists are 11/32 dmg.... that's wonderful, but please...  do you know ANY other melee class that would dare sport an 11/32 weapon at lvl 42?  hrmmmmm, do ya????  no... they've got bigger dmg weaps w/ MUCH faster delay times...  the only extra cool thing is that we do have dual weild and double attack yeah, but other classes have that too...  Jeez we already have to rely on FD to stay alive as it is... and by the time our mend pops again or we regen to full health, the mob we were fighting is COMPLETELY healed!  we already agro like crazy so wtgdf are they thinking INCREASING how much dmg we take?  And whoever asked &quot;since when is a monk a soloable class?&quot; is right... we really aren't, and now that we're gonna be eating all that much more of the cleric's mana cause they haven't fixed the f'ing agro issue but are making us take MORE dmg w/o giving us more hp's to compensate for it, is that little bit of extra dmg we can do really gonna be wanted in a group?  naw go w/the warrior he has a haste item and can take the hits better it will save mana for when we get too many adds if i dun have to keep healin the damn monk is what the clerics are gonna be reasoning... and they'll be right too!  /rolls eyes at Verant...   <br />
<br />
Sheesh Verant needs to actually play their own friggin game specifically the classes they propose to change before they start releasing these so called &quot;fixes&quot;  jeez the fact that my monk dies despite the special abilities way to often is why i quit playing her to begin with... i'm not twinked at all, and the fact that i have to be just to compete w/others of my same lvl and class is already ridiculous.  If they are going to do that, then they should at least make us more effective w/o having to have ubergear...  We already get piddly amounts of hp's compared to other melees, even hybrids!  and now we are going to take more damage too?  making us even MORE gear dependent?????   THANK YOU VERANT!  Wow what a great job!  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Also:  um, we've ALWAYS had to manage our aggro to avoid getting killed even w/our special abilities, and we don't get to cast sow on ourselves to run away, and we don't get to wear really good ac items because of the weight issue or we lose more ac than we gain w/it, we can't wear chainmail, we cant weild awesome swords, our &quot;uber&quot; items cost way more than comparable 1hs items, we HAVE to have jboots or buy sow potions or rely on other classes to buff us to make us able to run away, so if FD fails, or a caster started casting before we hit FD, we are really screwed, and believe me timing is EVERYTHING w/FD! and lag will kill a monk who has less than 2 bubs of health in no time flat because it's impossible to ensure you have the right timing w/FD when you are lagging badly, and often times clerics and other healer types tend to group monks w/other melees and don't even think about healing untill they see it's down to 2 bubs of health, and to a monk who has so few hp's compared to the other melee classes, this can mean (and has often meant) death... - and, no offense but every single ranger i have EVER grouped with made a much better TANK than me... not damage dealer, but tank.  FD is not infallible, even at mastery lvls... while it rarely fails higher up, mobs also do get a chance to &quot;disbelieve&quot; it as well as the whole trying to time it w/casters...  and if you're in a fight w/lots of adds, and one has already begun their attack when you FD, it knocks you out of fd while still laying on your ass, so even though it may have worked on the other mobs, the fact you were still hit lets the mobs know you're faking, and they start whomping on ya again...  So i dun wanna hear word one about welcome to aggro management and ranger world =P  heh<br />

<br />
But they're supposed to do it nekkid :D <br />
So far I haven't thought of anything that's really that bad with the changes. Maybe I'll be proven wrong when all that's said is done, but I doubt it. It's kinda fun though, like making it a slightly different game every so often... if they do this until the release of eq 2 they'll probably keep me hooked long enough to buy that one too :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vangoo</div><div class="date">10-13-2002, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the monks....<br />
<br />
Ummmm...Can't Human Monks wear plate? Duh! Yes, they can.<br />
<br />
So does that mean they're a &quot;plate&quot; class to Verant?<br />
<br />
Where does that leave the Ikies? <br />
<br />
And Ikies have a higher AC than human monks...Boy, human monks are MORE screwed now.<br />
<br />
I must admit that I have yet to see a Tank that can hold agro against a monk. (unless they're a pally.) :D <br />
<br />
This change could be devestating to the Monk class if Verant pulls their normal &quot;Oops, we screwed up. Again....Welcome to the &quot;new&quot; Bard class to Verant...monks.&quot; <br />
<br />
Things they SHOULD've looked at for monks:<br />
<br />
1--Watch the Stuns...sheesh..On countless occassions Ive watched my health drop 4 bubs in about 3 seconds from a pull...just from being hit and stunned.<br />
<br />
2--Give the Tanks more freakin' ways to get the agro...perhaps a /spit skill? (Heck at master lvl you could increase the chance to blind'em) <br />
-----------------------or-----------------------<br />
give the Enchanters BETTER agro increasing spells..the ones they have now suck.<br />
<br />
We're already out in the open......tappin' the mob on the shoulder, offering them a smoke.. then haulin' butt back to our buds waiting to try to pry'em off us..even after an FD.<br />
<br />
One last thing....SAY NOOOOO to EQ 2......tell them bastards that they have the get the FIRST One RIGHT BEFORE you can make a 2..sheesh...common sense peeps...look at Legends...it sucked. <br />
<br />
Sorry, I'm tired...cranky..and down right disappointed in Verant (yet again)..I thought I was safe this time from them...nope...<br />
my Enc dies in .000005 seconds from a tank who &quot;forgot&quot; to taunt..My bard..umm..well.. you know Verant and bards...My druid...hell, even at master in 1h blunt still can't finish off a mob with 4 HP left...and now my monk....whats next? Oh yeah...Complete Heal...doesn't really complete heal...well thats an Oximoron...kinda like Verant, 'We care what you have to say about our games.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kill'em all and left the Gods sort'em out...Wait..in 10 days we can kill the Gods....aww hell, there goes that saying.<br />
<br />
Night peeps sorry for the rant,<br />

NO monk can wear anything better than leather. no chain, no plate. Iksar monks have regen and higher inate ac, human monks have slightly faster and stronger fists.</div></div><hr />

It looks like it's all going live today, so we'll finally see just how bad it really is. I hope (crosses fingers) and pray (begs Tunare) that these changes aren't as dramatic as they sound.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">[Monk changes]: Makes me a little wary... my primary hunting partner is a monk and I hope this doesn't come down too hard on their ability to at least semi-tank. Pulling is going to be a lot more rough on these fellas... and regen spells might now become an important buff for monks (I think this might have been considered when designers decided on this change).<br />
<br />
[Manaburn]: Saw this coming the instant greedy players started forming manaburn teams.  The MB teams were a plague on almost every server... and I'm VERY glad to see them put a reasonable restraint on the use of it.  Your MB is not used if the mob can't be affected due to the change - they added a check for that.<br />
<br />
Now if a group of wizzies tries to MB a large mob (dragon or such), it's gonna be a pretty wild sight! 1st Wiz MB's... they all run around like mad dying left and right waiting for the timed effect to wear off.  hehe<br />
<br />
[Complete Heal]: Doubt I'll really see any difference.<br />
<br />
[Druid Heal]: Good going. This is something I really think druids needed to be considered more seriously in group roles.  Every Idgit out there that tells you druids are meant for soloing needs to be smacked on the back of the head with a 2 x 4.  Druids are the handymen(women) of EQ.  They can heal a little, nuke a little, and buff a little - not being exceptional in any category.<br />
<br />
A good druid will handle quite a bit in a group. When there isn't an enchanter around, the druid can handle moderate crowd control with the use of ensnare and root... sticking extra mobs to the ground off to the side to be dealt with later.  They tend to the other casters, such as the wizards/enchanters/mages keeping them full on hp so the cleric(s) can devote their mana to the tanks.  The heal makes this much more viable, as even casters have a fair amount of HP with buffs up.<br />
<br />
[Shaman Heal]: Also good... but shammy's already had quite a load on their mana pool, I'm wondering how much this will add.<br />
<br />
Anyway, those are my opinions.   :)</div></div><hr />
