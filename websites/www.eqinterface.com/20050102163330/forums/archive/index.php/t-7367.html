I downloaded the files, unzipped them, made new files in the ui folder next to the defult one, and still i get nothing. What am I doing wrong?? It just loads the original one. ??? This is all new to me and i have no idea what to do.</div></div><hr />

If you did all that, (which you currently have not) then you will know what to do.  Please follow all directions in the README.  We get many posts everyday by people who don't read the README page.  Don't want to sound rude, but I figured somebody would have to tell you what to do.  Read the README page and do what it says.</div></div><hr />

Check this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5210) thread and see if perhaps it applies to you.</div></div><hr />
