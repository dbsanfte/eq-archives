<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to alter the frames for RoundedNoTitle to better match my style, but I was left with irritating gaps in the frame.  I located where in windows01.tga the frame image is without any trouble.  I drew my image over it with no problem, and I double-checked that the alpha channel matches my image correctly.<br />
<br />
However, the right side of the frame only draws a single pixel wide, and the top right corner doesn't meet up.  There is a one pixel gap between the top bar and the right bar.  Because the right side of the frame is only one pixel wide, the top and bottom bars extend a few pixels past it leaving ugly overhangs.<br />
<br />
So is the frame rendering code bugged?  Did I do something wrong?  Can I change the frame rendering code or make my own frame definition somehow?<br />
<br />
While I'm at it, I've noticed that the Inside frame style acts a little strange too.  The corners of the box seem to be shaded slightly differently than the edges.  It basically matches my image, but the shading is quite annoying.  Does anyone know about this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has to do with minor sizing and cordinate information.<br />
<br />
I ran into problems like this a while back, but unfortunately it's been so long I really can't recall everything I did.<br />
<br />
I would suggest to double/tripple check your cordinates and make sure everything is sizing as you would expect it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolleo</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">can you attach a copy of your window_piece.tga that you changed? Perhaps a second pair of eyes could help locate the problem. It might be that you aren't specifying the 100% exact coordinates in your/xmp files, but from my experience, the borders for the chat windows aren't user editable to that degree.<br />
<br />
It (in my opinion at this point) is probably that when you positioned your image within the image map, you got it one pixel row off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm at work right now, so I don't have access to the images.  I'll take another look at it and post the TGA file as soon as I can.  Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I found the problem.  It's now fixed.  For anyone who might be suffering similar problems here's the deal:  It seems that the image for the rounded frames has the right edge of the frame several pixels to the right of where the top-right and bottom right corners are.  This is just bizarre, and I can't come up with any explanation for it, but there it is.  So to create your frame correctly, you need to take the right edge of the frame, cut it out of your image and paste it several pixels to the right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are parts within the Animations file where the defined dimensions of a graphic actually extended the actual physical graphic within the tga file.<br />
<br />
So, when creating custom graphics, you really do need to try and keep within the exact physical graphics's size, or add your own dimension information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I definately was trying to keep to the original dimensions.  It's just so bizarre to have arranged the frame the way they did, that I never even considered it was a possibility.  It took me quite a while to realize that they really had done this.  The way their images are so mottled, I just figured they wanted to create frames with little holes in them, and I corrected the holes when I made my images.  After that it took me longer still to believe they really had done it on purpose.  &quot;Gee we have this frame graphic here, where shall we put the right edge of it?... How about we put it right here assembled like all the other frames?... Naw&quot;</div></div><hr />
