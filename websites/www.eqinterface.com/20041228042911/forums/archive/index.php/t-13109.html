EQInterface wishes Everquest a Happy Anniversary and we hope for many many more!<br />
<br />
It looks as though S.O.E. has some activities planned to celebrate. The following is posted on the Everquestlive.com site:<br />
<br />
EverQuest Celebrates Five Years. Join us for the 5th Anniversary in-game celebrations for EverQuest. Starting next week, and over the course of the next few weeks, you will be able to join in a massive scavenger hunt, battle fabled NPCs, experience enormous firework displays and defend your city against armies of skeletons. <br />
 - Scavenger Hunt: What will be the prize?  <br />
 - Fabled NPCs: They're back! They're buff! Are you ready?  <br />
 - Fireworks display: Lighting up the sky in celebration! <br />
 - Skeletons Marching: They're marching, and they are angry!<br />
<br />
You can also find some interesting facts at GameSpot:<br />
<br />
Over 2.5 million copies of the game and its expansions have been sold in box or digitally downloaded since 1999. <br />
<br />
If stacked end to end, the total number of EverQuest boxes created would reach a height of more than 265 miles, which would stretch out of the Earth's atmosphere and past the orbit of the International Space Station. <br />
<br />
EverQuest averages about 250,000 new subscribers every year. Currently, there are more than 420,000 people playing the game. <br />
