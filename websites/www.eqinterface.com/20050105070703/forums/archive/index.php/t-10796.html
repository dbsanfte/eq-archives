Druids and Shaman both have illusions to draw upon.  Druids even have the ability to group illusion wolf.<br />
With LoY they added the ability for Shaman (an enchanter wanna be) to mix Illusion potions for all playable races.<br />
<br />
For whatever reason, rogues were allowed a series of different masks (typically as no-drop loot) which allowed illusioning.  Perhaps to justify their use as assassins and bards a actors.  Got me on that.  <br />
For sheer variety - Illusions are the realm of the enchanter.  <br />
There are also a number of items which grant illusions to various or all classes.  Typically these are no-drop and self-only.<br />
<br />
What good are illusions?<br />
Aside from the obvious change in appearance and faction standing to PC races, there are ability enhancements.<br />
For instance Boon of the Garou (werewolf form) adds +100 dex.<br />
Illusion Dark Elf includes gaining their innate Ultravision.<br />
<br />
If you are creative, all illusions can be important tools.<br />
<br />
Do we need more illusions / illusion items in game.<br />
While they have being toying with gender illusion on the test server, i'm not sure if the Text system was ever set up to distinguish True Sex from Displayed Sex.  Certainly something they would want to have nailed down before moving such a change live - otherwise whats the point?<br />
<br />
The only additional illusion that is really needed in game is: Illusion Target.  Basically allowing the caster to take on the appearance of the targeted PC or NPC or even a mob.  This again would raise the gender issues.  There would also need to be restrictions on this spell to prevent it from being used on certain types of NPCS - for instance - NO, you cant illusion yourself as a Tunare.  I believe they have already made some headway on this particular spell.  Compare the use of the necro ability Wake the Dead which basically copies uses the model of a corpse and animates it as the Necros secondary pet.  While this works nicely - in this instance they dont need to deal with the gender bending issue that would be created when trying to apply a male model to a female pc or vice-versa.<br />
<br />
Nights Dark Terror needs to become group/raid restricted - the ability to cast it on anyone at will is just a bit annoying.</div></div><hr />
