Copy the appropriate file to your _base_ eq directory (usually c:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest Trilogy) and rename it according to your char's name and server number (for example mine is UI_Soes_35.ini, my char name is Soes, Veeshan is # 35...)<br />

Is there anyway to make the text in the chat window the same size as the one in the melee window?  <br />
<br />
For any chat window (as long as you don't have the &quot;always chat here&quot; option enabled on one of them):<br />
<br />
The command to change the font size is /chatfontsize #, where # is between 1 and 5 I believe...1 being the smallest and 5 being friggin' huge.  Just make sure you're typing the command IN the particular window you want.</div></div><hr />

Actually SoesUI was released before Jaryn, and in the first version it states:<br />

&quot;- Based of Drakah's Drakahmix (Excellent work Drakah!)&quot;</div></div><hr />

WHAT A TOOL! Know what the heck you are talking about before flaming Soes<br />

I'm so glad you came out with this revision 'cause I was having trouble after the 2/4 patch.<br />

Its great that you show us what to change. Simply saying to rename this file as you did in your instructions means we can name it anything we want and that will fix the problem. Tell us exactly what to name it- show us an example of a changed name if you have to. Ive watched your reply to this throughout a few posts and the reason that people keep having this problem is that you are not communicating it clearly. That is why the problem still persists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if I can make it any more simple... you have to do the same procedure for any other custom UI that has preset locations for it's windows. Read the first post more carefully, there is a clear explaination of what to rename the ini file and an example.<br />
<br />
P.S. Hundreds of people are using this UI with no problems...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimflyerfan</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is is possible that people are renaming the .ini file but including the 1024 or 1280?<br />
<br />
it should look like this UI_Rotlom_83.ini (in my case)  notice there is no mention of the resolution in the filename. I think that Soes just used that to differentiate the two resolutions.<br />
I hope this helps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velisaris</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or, people could just cut and paste.<br />
<br />
Open up whichever UI you want (1024 or 1280).<br />
Edit - Select All - Copy<br />
Open up your existing UI_yourname_##.ini<br />
Edit - Select All - Delete<br />
Paste new info and save.<br />
<br />
Saves people the trouble of figuring out what exactly they need to rename.</div></div><hr />

Just change it to that, or delete his line all together and you will be able to load up. EQ will change it to what I posted either way.<br />

If you notice in the default UI, if you disable sound from Options that your Mp3 player will not come up. In this UI he is forcing a Mp3 player to come up so those of us that have Sound disabled, it is causing us to crash. If you have sound disabled your MP3 player line should look like this :<br />

<br />
- You can't tell wether a buff is positive or negative. Of course, you can look at the name, but what some other UI's have is a color around the buff icon, so I can see real fast what stuff is on me. Especially when buffed a good bit and some buffs have faded, it's hard to see, fast, what you have on you.<br />
<br />
- In 1024x768, the lower part of the screen is rather big. I think it would nicer if it got a bit slimmer (smaller hotbuttons, inventory buttons, kill the top edge of the lower interface and float the compass, integrate the mob health bar a bit more down.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll probably work on some of this myself, just wanted to let you know what my complaints are. Either way, excellent work. Particulary fond of the buff icons :D<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
Everything else works fine even the pet window works fine but I just can't move the bloody thing. :)<br />
<br />
ATM I'm just turning it on and off as needed but I'd rather make use of it since it looks so dam good.<br />
<br />
Anyways if you have any idea what could be causing this problem I would greatly appreciate any comments.<br />
<br />
I have reinstalled EQ and reinstalled the UI twice and I know what I'm going so its not a problem with me renaming files.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the input.<br />

First of all, amazing UI.  Clean and simple, thats the best type.  I'm returning to the game after a year's absence and I am planning on using your UI.  I'm planning on installing it Sunday night when I get back from a trip.<br />
<br />
Before I do however, I have a couple quick questions for you (keep in mind I haven't played with the new customizable UI feature of PoP yet):<br />
<br />
1) How do I get guild chat to show up in the group window and not the main?<br />
<br />
2) How do I get raid channels to show in the group window and not the main?<br />
<br />
3) Is it possible to hide the MP3 controls at the top?<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton!  Keep up the great work!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. and 2.  All chat channels are able to be filtered to any open chat window.  Right click the scroll bar on a chat window and go down to &quot;Filters.&quot; Anything with an * by it is filtered to that window.  Click what you want to be filtered to that window (you have to do it one channel at a time, which sucks).<br />
<br />
3. Alt-K toggles the MP3 player.</div></div><hr />
