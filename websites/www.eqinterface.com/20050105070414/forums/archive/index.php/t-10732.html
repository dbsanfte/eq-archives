*edit so ok i found the missing lines of code and i tried correcting them by adding similar lines of code.  i had to add 29 new peices for the pet buff window.  then realized there was a screen named petbuffwindow.  tried adding that and moving the peices to that window but no success. i have to raid now lol.<br />

I don't know if you are using one of my timers as your mend timer, but if you are, the solution is simple. I've already patched the XML generator (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp) to account for the changes in the 10/9 patch; just go to the site and generate new timer files, which are now fully compatible with the patch changes. See this patch thread (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10616) for more details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for the other question, whatever ui i downloaded uses the pet window for the timer (as most timers seems to use).  i didn't create it so don't ask me why lol<br />
<br />
*edit* went home at lunch and loaded this ui.  it works great.  i really wish i could see the numbers moving though.  that's the one i had before, it was an actual 0-6min timer that just kept cycling through.  i like the slider mark on yours though as it helps you keep track of when you last pressed mend.  is there a way to combine both? i'll look at the code myself if i have time.  <br />
<br />
now the only thing left is my group window.  i keep getting the default hp %'s.  not sure how to get rid of them.</div></div><hr />

To create a digital 6-minute timer, you can go to Customize &gt; Dial/Digital Timer from the timer home page. You could select the following options, for example:<br />
<br />
1) don't include tick dial<br />
2) include digital timer<br />
3) duration 6 minutes (count up, or down if preferred)<br />
4) don't include title bar<br />
5) window: pick whatever you want to use<br />
6) make window transparent (in advanced section, scroll down)<br />
<br />
This would create a transparent 6-minute digital timer that continually counts each second. I personally would still prefer using the slider as it lets you mark when you used mend, but you can put this in a different window (or merge the XML, if you know how) if you want to use both.</div></div><hr />

is there a way to have a digital timer with a &quot;stopwatch&quot;?  on your timer with a slider, there is a small &quot;time&quot; in h:mm:ss format.  i was thinking that you could make that a &quot;stopwatch&quot; on the digital timer.  that way, whenever you hit a button on the time, the stopwatch takes a snapshot of whatever the timer says.The h:mm:ss on the slider timer is just a text label indicating the full duration of the timer. While it is possible to put a tiny digital timer in its place, there would be no way to start/stop/pause the digital timer, so it would be somewhat pointless (for example, it would always read 0:00:00 when the bar is empty, and reach 0:06:00 when the bar is full).<br />

You'll have to keep in mind that UI mods are not &quot;programs&quot;, and are subject to many limitations. They can only alter the appearance of the UI, and cannot supply any additional functionality. Please read my post entitled &quot;impossible enhancements&quot; for more detailed information:<br />
