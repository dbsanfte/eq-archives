<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shimmer</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started a thread in the requests forum, but turned out to have a question about equi_xml.  Don't quite know the proper etiquette, but thought I'd be better off moving my question to this forum.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I downloaded a slider timer from Arista and couldn't get it to work.  Reading about patch fixes, I thought that perhaps the problem was in my EQUI.xml file.  I made the change like Cairenn suggested... <br />
<br />
well, actually, when I looked at my file in notepad, I saw that after the: <br />
<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_StoryWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
I already had:<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_BodyTintWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
but not the:<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
So I added that last part (bigbankwnd) .<br />
<br />
I saved it with the change, but when I logged on to eq, it downloaded a new EQUI.xml file which overwrote the change I had made.  I tried one more time, and again when I logged on, it overwrote my change.<br />
<br />
My timer still doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Is that the problem, and if so, is there any way to fix it?<br />
I tried to open the xml that is generated with the timer, but my computer doesn't recognize the program, and from what I gather, that isn't what I'm supposed to do anyway.<br />
<br />
help please.  :) <br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
shimmer<br />
<br />
And next time, I'll try to have a more clear idea of what I'm trying to accomplish here so that I'm not starting extra threads and/or posting the same thing in seperate threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, first, it sounds like you were making changes to your *default* EQUI.xml file.  Don't.<br />
<br />
You (normally) never make any changes to anything within the default folder.  Last patch was a bit of an oddity, in that not all files required by *some* were being downloaded from the patcher, so I provided those files for folks to add to their default folder.  There were no files to be *changed* in the default folder, only 3 files to be *added*  Nontheless, this is *not* typical.<br />
<br />
Any changes to files I list (ala &quot;IF you have a custom EQUI_blahblahblah.xml file&quot;, etc.) is referring to if you have those files in your CUSTOM folder.<br />
<br />
Next, where did you put the slide timer you downloaded?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shimmer</div><div class="date">02-01-2003, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoops.  I must have misread or misunderstood your post.  Thanks for the info about not changing anything in default.  Good to know.<br />
<br />
Actually, /blush, I figured out the problem with my slider timer.  I swear in real life I'm not a moron, but apparently I missed the big bold letters in the instructions telling me to name my custom xml file with the name that it gives you if you happen to read it (which I didn't).<br />
<br />
So, quick fix, downloaded and saved as EQUI_FriendWnd.xml and presto... works like a charm.<br />
<br />
Sorry to have taken your time with this carelessness, and thanks for your patience.</div></div><hr />
