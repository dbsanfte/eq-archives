I'd say i'm about halfway done.  The only major window left to do is the inventory, and then a few minor ones.  Let me know what you think so far.<br />

Sorry for the post above.. But i love old eq more then the new eq... But i am waitin for this one to come out.. :D  :nana:  :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DOACleric</div><div class="date">10-22-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The UI is basically done, and has been for a few weeks.  No one really seemed interested so I didn't bother releasing it.  Also, the UI has been specially remade for the EQClassic project that I am working on, so i removed a lot of functionality that would no longer be needed for a classic enviornment - shared bank slots, 9th spell gem, many toolbars, and many &quot;advancements&quot; that players might have come to get used to, such as exact mana numbers.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, I also took the time to remake the login interface, so that part also looks similar to the EQ of 1999.  Because of that, this UI needs to OVERWRITE the default UI - that is the only way that i'm aware of  to change the login part of the UI.<br />
<br />
Sony recently made some changes to that with the release of OOW, and I occasionally get a black screen upon logging in, so i'm going to have to double check to see whats going on before I release this.  Once its complete, I will be releasing it on my website.  I'll post more details later.  I might also decide to go back and redo the character creation part of  the UI, but i'm very pressed for time :)</div></div><hr />

I hate how the new spells look.. To flashy.. and dumb looking.. Is there some way to put them back to the way they were?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldschool101</div><div class="date">10-22-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will it have like the LDON window? Or is it just old school? Like it was? Could you say what windows it will not have? <br />

*bow*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DOACleric</div><div class="date">10-22-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All windows should work.  However, I did not bother remaking any of the windows that were not available in classic.  This means that things like AA windows, guild windows, friends windows, raid windows, etc , will look like the default UI.  I only bothered to remake things found in ClassicEQ, since I could see how those looked and easily remake them.  So yes, the LDON window will work - but it'll look like the default UI.</div></div><hr />

Now there is an old school UI for ya! *chuckle*  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aramil Dannodel</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Zanta, Talyns already released something very similar to the old &quot;small-screen&quot; UI...and in multiple colour schema, as well.  Mind you, they aren't exactly the same as the old &quot;small-screen&quot; UI, but they are quite close...definitely struck a few nostalgic nerves when I first saw them.<br />
<br />
Here they are:<br />
-Blue themed old &quot;small-screen&quot; UI. (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=1471)<br />
-Green themed old &quot;small-screen&quot; UI. (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=1472)<br />
-Gray themed old &quot;small-screen&quot; UI. (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=1473)<br />
-Purple themed old &quot;small-screen&quot; UI. (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=1474)<br />
-Red themed old &quot;small-screen&quot; UI. (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=1475)<br />
-&quot;Wood&quot; themed old &quot;small-screen&quot; UI. (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=2133)<br />
<br />
On a second note, keep up the nice work, DOA...I'm definitely looking forward to trying that one out, myself.  Especially if you could get the rest of the post-&quot;old school&quot; UI modded to match the theme.  If not, hey, another project to add to the 300 others atop the dangerously leaning pile.  Heh.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Yes, the coding to this post shows I had entirely too much free time on my hands this lovely Thursday morning.  Insomnia can be fun, like that...much more entertaining than a novel of my senseless drivel, I find.  &quot;OOH! Look at the pretty colours!&quot;  /smirk<br />

I recall someone doing the same thing at the old EQInterface site before they moved to this one, that looked just exactly like the picture I posted. I tried searching for it here, but have come up empty handed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldschool101</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. When is the Vel one comeing out? I really want to use this.. I miss it soo..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fallowmar</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too loved the Velious UI.  The thing that I miss most about it though is that you could hit the ` key and it would auto shade or remove the shading from the window.  The reason that was so key to me was zones where the background was bright, I liked having the shading to see white/yellow text and I liked removing it when I was in a dark environment.  Anyone know if there is a way to add that functionality back to the windows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DOACleric</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for being absent for so long, but i've been very very busy :)<br />
<br />
The UI is 95% complete.  However, chances are that I will most likely not be releasing it for seperate download until my Circle of Elements project is completed, as I mainly created the UI to be used for CoE, and there are several issues with it if used on a currect EQ character (mainly the spell book).<br />
<br />
To get more info on CoE, and to view some more screenshots of the UI, you can visit my website at www.eqclassic.net.  For those wondering what Circle of Elements is, its a project aimed at recreating classic EQ the way it was back in 1999.<br />
<br />
<br />
fallowmar: There is no way to put back the functionality of the ` key, since its been removed from the client.  The UI currently does not have the transparent background and is completly clear.  The grey background can be added back with relative ease, but there would be no way to turn it on/off from within the game.</div></div><hr />
