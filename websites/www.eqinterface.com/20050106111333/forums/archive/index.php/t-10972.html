<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">surveyor</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first attempt at any programming and i've managed to do what i want but with some lilitations. My goal was to create a horizontal container with 25 size slots aligned along the bottom of the open container and the done/comb buttons along the top with the label and picture. I have been able to achieve this modifiying the EQ default container and inserting some code from another container that uses the stretch button command. It does what i want BUT....when i open the container it is bigger than it needs to be and i would like to know how to set the code so it is just right upon opening with no space at the bottom and i dont have to &quot; true sizable&quot; to get what i want.<br />
<br />
My first instict says it has something to do with the template the code is using since i have changed the &quot;size&quot; and it does no good.<br />
<br />
Which leads me to my second issue. Where can I find a list of templates with their base inherent data?.....i.e: size, use yada yada....if in fact i need to know.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to help.<br />
<br />
Code im working with is attached</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mebeksis</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">keep in mind that i'm still learning this too hehe...this is what it looks like to me....i could be wrong tho:<br />
<br />
here is the section that effects the actual window itself:<br />
<br />
Screen item=&quot;ContainerWindow&quot;&gt;<br />
- &lt;!-- &lt;ScreenID/&gt;<br />
  --&gt; <br />
- &lt;!-- &lt;Font/&gt;<br />
  --&gt; <br />
  &lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt; <br />
- &lt;Location&gt;<br />
  &lt;X&gt;350&lt;/X&gt; <br />
  &lt;Y&gt;100&lt;/Y&gt; <br />
  &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
- &lt;Size&gt;<br />
  &lt;CX&gt;250&lt;/CX&gt; <br />
  &lt;CY&gt;50&lt;/CY&gt; <br />
  &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
<br />
now...this is the area that effects the size of the window:<br />
<br />
  &lt;Size&gt;<br />
  &lt;CX&gt;250&lt;/CX&gt; <br />
  &lt;CY&gt;50&lt;/CY&gt; <br />
  &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
<br />
now the CX is the width and the CY is the height...as in the X and Y axis (think plotting points from algebra +) so adjust these accordingly....but keep in mind that lets say you have a border on the LEFT or TOP sides....these coordinates will NOT change that...they only effect the right and bottom borders....if the top and left are where your borders are, then you need to edit the locations of the boxes/buttons accordingly for that....hope this helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">surveyor</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your input!!!! Only thing is there is still something up. I'm a surveyor so i know all about x and y and mapping. I appreciate your response but if you looked at the code you would see that the size i provided for the window would be ample for the application. I have looked at the default target window since it is alittle smaller than what im trying to make. The window &quot;size&quot; for it is way larger than what im trying to create which makes me think i'm over my head!<br />
<br />
If someone could look at the file I attached I would appreciate it.<br />

Being a cleric is tough. Being a cleric on rallos zek is even harder. Somehow this mod is going to help me keep my party alive and help me keep my hard earned stuff. Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am going to guess that your window size is wildly off in the vertical direction.  This would be because it computes a size adequate to hold five slots vertically, plus whatever space it thinks you need for buttons and labels.<br />
<br />
In short, you may be hosed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">surveyor</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think your absolutely correct Xym. Just for kicks i made a auto-equip window thats 1/2 the size i wanted my container to be and it works as long as i have a container open.<br />
<br />
If anyone else has ideas or solutions to this seemlingly simple problem please dont be silent....k?<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />
