<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaprotu</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this is my first real 'mod'.<br />
<br />
This is version 1 of Slim.  The goal is to get as much information available to the player at once in the least amount of space.  IT isn't really pretty or awe inspiring, but I don't think it's more of the same ol same ol either.<br />
<br />
Screenshot (http://www.amaprotu.net/equi/slim_v1.jpg) <br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
*) I use /viewport 0 0 1024 723 which leaves a 45 pixel high bar along the bottom, the size of my mod bar.<br />
<br />
*) You will have to rearange some windows the first time you use it (group and hotbox I think) because xml locs still don't work right.<br />
<br />
*) The yellow bar on the health bar is the stamina bar.<br />
<br />
*) The number to the right of the name is the character level<br />
<br />
*) From top to bottom the three bars are Mana, XP, AAXP<br />
<br />
*) The hotbox is small, but I always use hotkeys and just need the image there to know which keyboard button to press. <br />
<br />
*) The green bar under the target bar is the pet health bar.<br />
<br />
*) The group is arranged horizontaly (1 2 3 on top, 4 5 on bottom)<br />
<br />
*) Yes they have pet health bars.<br />
<br />
*) I don't use main or the pet window but I moded them to fit the mod.<br />
<br />
*) The stats explain themselves<br />
<br />
Whats next?<br />
Pre-Version 2:<br />
Melee character mod (no mana, no pet).<br />
<br />
Version 2:<br />
*) Spell book mod<br />
*) Inv and Inspect mod<br />
*) Spell cast and Breath bar mod<br />
*) Main window mod<br />
<br />
Version 3:<br />
*) New graphics (background, border)<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah I think that covers everything, let me know if there are problems or what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunn</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice job.  My only complaint about the new user interface is, by default, there are so many window borders and titlebars that I cannot (even in 1280x1024 mode) see more than a 400x400 view of combat.<br />
<br />
Slim is slick!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bled Lifeblood</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you should make a spell book with the Ouija board background like his signature =)   would look good for necro's hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaprotu</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is Slim v1.1<br />
<br />
Changes include:<br />
1) New inventory and inspect windows<br />
2) Fixed group pets.<br />
3) Fixed Spell book scribe and mem bars<br />
4) Fixed Bags/Containers<br />
5) Some minor fixes.<br />
6) Included a suggested default UI ini file.  Instructions on using it are in the readme.txt file included in the zip.<br />
<br />
I will upload a screenshot later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaprotu</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will also need these gem image files if you don't already have them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThundunB</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my favorite UI ever :D<br />
<br />
Seems to be broken (along with all the others) with the Aug 14 patch....hope you will fix it when you have time.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your hard work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaprotu</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will here is a patch for my UI, unzip it into the folder that already has this UI and overwrite any files it asks about (most all of them).<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
This is a fix for the ui I have in my 'MyUI' folder which is always my current work in progress (Slim V1.2 or something right now) so please let me know if this breaks Slim V1.1 . <br />
<br />
Should work though (crosses fingers).</div></div><hr />
