<br />
One question.  Could we get weight on there?  Seems I always have to look at my inventory screen.  I Master Loot a lot and watch my weight all the time.  It would really help.<br />

<br />
I can see why primary weapon and first inventory slot is extremely useful for a rogue.  Alas - I am a ranger.  <br />
<br />
Since I am a total dolt when it comes to computers .. let alone computer programming could you tell me how I might change the primary weapon slot to perhaps another inventory slot.... better yet make the primary weapon slot my ammo slot so I can just drop different arrows in there??<br />
<br />
it makes me nervous to see Earthcaller hanging out there ready for me to drop :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iare Tosevite</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm my group window has all of melee slots and main slot 7 and 8 in it. ( all bars was moved to player window )<br />
<br />
as a rogue i use it a lot heh. inv 7 always has one of following, BS dagger if im bs swapping, picklock tool if im using it a lot at time, or de mask as default. 8th slot has a bag in it with all my daggers ( ie: slow proc, snare proc and non daggers ) range and ammo comes i n handy when i summon daggers and put em in there without even opening inv window.</div></div><hr />

My biggest question is what are the windows to the right and left at the bottom with the numbers in it.  They dont show up when I installed this.  <br />
