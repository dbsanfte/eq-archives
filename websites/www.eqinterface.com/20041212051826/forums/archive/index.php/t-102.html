He cannot use the new UI because of the size of the font. It would be so wonderful if someone would develop a set with large font size for ppl with this disability. <br />
<br />
Thank you!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">psychogears</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How big is his screen? I made a UI that was just for me to fool around with the new SIDL which had big HP and Mana gauges (updated art inspired by Devil May Cry). I was thinking of scrapping it, but I could go all the way and make thicker gauges and bigger fonts... althought it would take some time for me to do it by myself. here's a picture sample http://www.bol.ucla.edu/~tolaes/interface1.gif<br />
<br />
If you like, I could go ahead and complete this UI skin.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bramblee</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He uses 800 x 600. He has a hard time reading the font in messages and reading what things are. He can change the chat to 5 and that helps but it's still hard to read. Any help would be appreciated. He is such a great person. When he has all the windows open at 800x600 he can't see anything on his screen but the bars. So I'm not sure how to go about it. I can get him on here later he can probably explain better. Maybe this gives you an idea.<br />
 His biggest problem is the font size.. <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;I looked at all of those but none fix my basic problem. I will make due with the lowest resolution settings untill they code the option to fix font sizes in each window. &gt;&gt;<br />

It would help if he took a screenshot of what his setup looks like the way it is now and posted that up, then proceeded to say what he needs enlarged and what he has trouble seeing still.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All text in the new UI has a default of size 3.<br />
<br />
Not sure how good his coding is but he could go into each file in the uidirectory (after he makes a copy of default and renames it)<br />
He'll notice under each item which contains text this line<br />
&lt;!-- &lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt; --&gt;<br />
So verant have the line there they have just commented it out.  Just change the line to<br />
      &lt;Font&gt;5&lt;/Font&gt;<br />
<br />
The only problem I can foresee is that the positioning of certain items relys on the smaller text.  Oh and things like the hotbuttons have adjustable sizing depending on the amount of text in them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me the 640 by 480 screen resolution makes every Icon and font size readable to me with a chat font of 4.  This resolution however if you know doesn't allow a whole lot of screen left over for actual combat and seeing the world, but it is doable.<br />
<br />
All I was whining about to my guild was the 800 by 600 resolution is much better for seeing the world but the box sizes and fonts/icons get so small at that resolution, I almost have to put my nose on the monitor to see it.  Not a good way to play EQ mind you. :) <br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion about the UI files I will look at them and see if I can change the defaults myself.<br />
