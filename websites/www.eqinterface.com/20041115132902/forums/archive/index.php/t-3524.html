<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobeken</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have two skins, both identical save for one minor change...<br />
<br />
essence, has a mana bar, with the stamina bar inside it.  The Mana percentage left is to the right of that.<br />
<br />
darkness has a stamina bar, with the mana bar inside it.  The stamina percentage is to the right of it.<br />
<br />
Some hybrids might want to go either way... ;)<br />
<br />
1.  The small empty area at the bottom of the player window.  It isnt empty if you have an AA title ;)<br />
<br />
2.  The gap between the Health bar and mana/stamina bar.  Turns into a white textured casting bar only when casting.  It slightly overlaps both health and mana.<br />
<br />
I am releasing these only on this thread and not via the distibution/downloads section...The reasoning is, yes these skins are thoroughly tested and work wonderfully however...I would like any feedback before officially launching them on the downloads section.<br />
<br />
So please feel free to download either or both sets and provide your feedback...<br />
<br />
PS: I included the spellbook/etc in the darkness version, just in case you have a caster/hybrid twink ;)<br />
<br />
My thanks go out to everyone here.  This stuff certainly has drawn on alot of peoples thoughts and I am still using a TKing spellbook and Icon set and Sylverpaw's compass ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it looks like a nice start.  I like the color alot make it easy to see which is good.  I think a quick item change in the hotkey area would be good for like Primary secondary and such.  Also some inventory slots also in the hotkey area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teannas</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">looks great so far. Maybe fine tune it a little bit and you have yourself a winner</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobeken</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two reasons I really hate to put slots on the hotkey bar...<br />
<br />
1. I cant mash a number to make em work like I can just dragging the item into a hotkey slot.<br />
<br />
2. They take up more room on screen.<br />
<br />
I hates using my mouse ;)  <br />
<br />
But since it does seem to be awfully popular with other peoples...I considered putting primary, secondary and ranged slots along with the top two inventory slots down the right-hand side.  Might be a nice one...<br />
<br />
Oh I also changed the name to be centered on the top ;)  Much more appealing visually that way ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input!</div></div><hr />
