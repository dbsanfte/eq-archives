<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mezolin</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I followed the directions to the tee and can't seem to make it work? My screen Resolution is 1280x1024. The one thing I was not sure of was which Resolution file to use. I will paste a copy of the readme file at the bottom if that helps. Thx<br />
<br />
So here is what I did step by step I Downloaded from this site to my desktop then extracted the files to this path C:\Program Files\Sony\Everquest Trilogy\Uifiles. Then I opened  the Uifile and inside I have a new file named KatlynTKBriar-Fixed along with the default. So everything looks good and is exactly as the Readme file says. At this point I opened the new folder and saw the Resolution folders I then opened the 1280 one then changed the character name and servernumber as it said in the readme folder so that file name was this UI_mezolin_64 and copied that into the Everquest Trilogy folder then I copied the entire contents of the 1280 file into the KatlynTKBriar folder and that should have worked according to the Readme folder. At this point I tried to log in and nothing so I restarted my Computer and nothing then I deleted the file and started over with the Resolution file named 1024 and that did not work either So What do I do next?</div></div><hr />

Should it say more?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That doesn't make sense at all.   Did you copy your default folder over first?  (If so, don't, delete it all and start fresh with just the custom files.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Despite the name, the KTn-Fixed uis have NOT been fixed to work with LDoN.  To my knowledge, no official fix has been made.  But here is what I did to force it to work.  The problem is with the custom EQUI_Animations.xml file that KTn-fixed uses.  It is NOT compatible with LDoN.  I simply renamed the file in the KTn-folder (which forces eq to use the file from the default folder).  Doing this, I got an error message when EQ first loads up, but everything otherwise looks and works fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I might have read it wrong but I did nothing with or to the default folder. Was I supposed to?  <br />
<br />
K my next step will be to remove the KTN-Fixed file and down load it again then follow the readme file to the tee. ( I have done this already but will try it again)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mezolin</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well no luck with that either.Am I SOL? :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Change to the ini files recently, try changing the ini file to UI_mezolin_&lt;server name&gt;. (ie mine used to be UI_weskat_26.ini now it is UI_weskat_tunare.ini) I don't know what server was #64, I also don't know what the server name would be for your ini file. However, if you look in your everquest root directory you will see the ini file in the proper name format, just change the provided one to the same name and hopefully that works. It is always a good idea to copy your original file someplace safe as it will be overwritten when you copy the new file into your everquest root directory.<br />
<br />
I hope the above makes sense and works, if you need clarification, feel free to PM me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mezolin</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will try that Thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Robrob</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i love the look of KTN's UI, but i cant get it to work either, ive done the exact same thing as the guy who opend this thread, please help uss both cuz i realy love that ui! its perfect! big gratz to KTN!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I may have fixed the problem with the KATN UI.  In this case, I was using the Celtic version, and was having the same problems as above.  I was able to get the UI to load... without any errors.  I've attached a screenshot of what it looks like.  The icons in the bottom right circled in red are the pet buff icons.  <br />
<br />
Note:  Since I can't figure out how to post two attachments to the same message, my &quot;fixed&quot; files will be in the next post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK.  Here are the fixed files.<br />
<br />
Just unzip them, and copy them over the existing files in your KATN UI folder.  Although I tested this on the Celtic version of KATN, it should work on any of the versions.  Two notes:<br />
<br />
[list=1]<br />
 I consider this an EXTREME beta fix.  So, please backup your entire KATN  UI folder before attemting to use this.<br />
<br />
 The placement of the pet buff icons was completely arbitrary.  I think they look pretty where they are.<br />
<br />
 Full credit to the original creator of this series of UIs.  If' he's still around, much thanks.<br />
[/list=1]<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Doh!!!  Forgot to attach the fixed files.</div></div><hr />
