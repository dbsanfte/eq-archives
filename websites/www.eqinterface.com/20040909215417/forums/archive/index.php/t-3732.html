While there are some absolutely amazing mods/skins out here, they are all generally minor tweaks to the old system.<br />
<br />
Maybe the old system isnt bad, maybe its perfect, maybe we will never know.  I intend to find out.  I want to make a single mod/skin that feels correct.  I want to have an interface that I can forget.  I want to not think about where things are on the screen.  I want to be immersed to that the UI seems like my thoughts.<br />
<br />
In the past the closest thing to this concept that I can realize is a heads up display.  Know your connected to a machine, but not be constrained by it.  I dont want to alter my field of view, or obstruct it.  I dont want to change my viewport depending on which twink I am playing.  I dont want to notice the difference on my screen just in my head.<br />
<br />
So, I am tasking myself with creating a totally new UI, not reusing any of the existing UI templates or graphics.  It may take me a long time and I may never finish, but I want to try.<br />
<br />
Use this thread as a place to post, as your class what you find is lacking.  Clerics want to see group information more efficiently, tanks want to see HPs...But how?  Post what you think is right, personal preference.  It will help me to try and make something for everyone.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
Not to nit-pick (ok, maybe to nit-pick) - but how many years have you been working on the new UI?  I'm especially curious since the new UI hasn't been out for a year yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, besides that - sounds like a cool idea.  I had several little concepts juggle around in my head, and may even get a chance to implement them eventually when I get a job/steady (any) income.<br />
<br />
While coming up with a bizarre design is cool, many people prefer something they are much more familiar with in the end.  In that respect, I think Vert does an excellent job keeping things &quot;normal&quot; in layout.  For a while, Techno Donuts (which my mod was based off of for it's basic design) and Fat Reduction were the two &quot;bizarre&quot; and more unique approaches to the UI - there was also one based off of Quake III - Industrial or something like that - but it faded.  Quartz appeared and almost just as fast as it was released, it's designer seemed to fall off the face of the planet.<br />
<br />
There is many things that can be changed in a UI, and many things which can't.  There is also a rther broad category of &quot;tricks&quot; that can be done to reduce the number of &quot;can'ts&quot; from the list, which would be more impressive if the XML structure used wasn't so limiting.  Personally, I like to blend form with function - not too gaudy a design, yet still cool; and enough information without the overload aspects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean most UI mods dont look very similar to the original UI...Or the first changed UI that came with Kunark?<br />
<br />
I have been working with the UI ever since I first logged in March 13, 1999.  This is the third UI for EQ and the first one we have the ability to truly change.<br />
<br />
Not only are you nit-picking but your mis-reading me ;)<br />
<br />
hehehe, anyway yah - send those ideas out...We would love to see them!<br />
<br />
I have been working with Avienda, we think alot alike and have similar goals...I think we will be able to produce a comfortable UI that breaks the traditional layout, is more functional and easier to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blazel</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been thinking about this since my last post.  The things that need the most attention to are the things important during combat.  This is the sensory input intensive aspects that need the most work.  A cool inventory is nice but really wont make you a better player.  I use the fatreduction ui or at least a mod of that i found called fatm on my cleric so i have a very clear view of the groups health during battle.  The most important things are field of view of the action.  Self health and mana, group health, and the feed back from the group during battle. So that I know when the second healer is lom or the tank needs invigor.  So much of my screen is wasted by chat windows.  I have one off to the side for shouts and ooc so that i can mostly ignore them.  Guild chat more prominate but still out of the way.  My dream chat would be for 5 chat windows that were opaque and with a small font that i could place at the bottom of the screen and one with large fonts with narrow characters and is transparent so i could place that more prominantly in the screen so i wouldnt have to take my focus from the action to read the group chat during battle.  After the battle everything should look nice but to me if i dont care much how my inventory looks and such.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you out.  Basically my suggestion is to focus on the information needed based on criticality and to work from there outward on the UI.  If done cleverly one interface will work for all classes.  On the fat reduction there is a pet health bar in green that is normally below my own health bar.  But as I dont have a pet I have never seen this bar. And have lost no screen realstate because of the way it was implemented.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the UI changed after Kunark?  I didn't notice a thing.  Velious saw it pushing more for the fullscreen UI, the 10 slot hotkey banks, the increased social banks, etc., but I didn't notice anything really different after Kunark (been playing since launch March 16, 1999 in case you were about to mention that).<br />
<br />
As for a UI itself, I'm a fan of a well-organized, information packed, compact UI.  Statistical/Vital information should be in one part of the screen.  Interface/Controls should be in another.  Less referenced data should be either out of the way (&quot;pop ups&quot; like Inv and such) or compact and placed in the remaining areas.<br />
<br />
FOr me, being right handed tend to draw my mouse down and right.  Therefore, I feel controls I would need to click on (action window, pet window, &quot;right clickies&quot;, and buffs) should be in the lower right corner, sandwiched in as tight as possible.<br />
<br />
All the target and vital information should be in the lower left, with stats as merely a bonus (some people are very concerned with stats, and often I like to check my stats).  Again, sandwich this stuff in as tight as possible.<br />
<br />
Hotkeys have been on the left for so long, and I use the keyboard to use them with my left hand, so they remain on the left, vertically aligned to consume less screen real estate.  The buffs in a single column down the right side of the screen is almost natural as well, and again consumes very little screen space.<br />
<br />
The problem comes with Chat windows.  Chat windows are the bane of a high visibility UI, but a neccessity in MMORPGs.  COndensing them as small as possible helps, but also degrades the amount of info you recieve.  Extra windows help this greatly, but in the end, the chat windows are up to the person using the UI.  SOme like theirs on the bottom, some on the top.  Again though, the best flow of information means keeping hitsmode windows near your information display, while other chat can be placed relatively wherever you want.<br />
<br />
As for dissing the viewport:  that again is a player's preference.  For some, the viewport command is a godsend, for others, it's a non-issue.  Me, I play a high enough resolution that most windows do not obstruct view in much of a way that makes a viewport seem necessary.  Besides, the viewport makes me feel like I have tunnel vision.  My roomie, however, plays in such a low resolution that I don't know how he ever sees the world around him through all his windows.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, your ideas have merit.  But remember that this is a UI that we don't have ultimate control over.  Also, All UI's will have a certain amount of information to them.  There are only so many ways of arranging that information while keeping it aesthetically pleasing and easy to process with a glance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand the desire to have a UI that you don't have to think about...but while to some people that means a nearly-invisible UI with the minimum information, to me it means having everything at my fingertips, but as small as possible so it doesn't get in the way, and to some others it means having most of the game world covered in various big windows so they never miss anything because they consider the information presented by the UI and chat to be more important than the game world itself. And some people play in F10 mode, using keyboard commands, so they don't have to look at any windows at all, or perhaps close every window except for one essential chat. <br />
<br />
Nobody will be able to make a UI that everybody's happy with- so instead of putting down other developers for &quot;just making variations on the original UI&quot; because their creativity doesn't match with what *you* want, try fiddling with the xml yourself and see whether you can come up with anything you like more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to add:  Think of a UI as a HUD in a fighter jet/starfighter (depending on the types of sims you play most or whether you like SciFi or not).<br />
<br />
Your HUD displays the most critical information within your field of view, but not in a manner to obstruct.  You can easily sweep your data in a quick pass.  In about 1 second I can tell my bearing, speed, weapons levels, general target data, fuel levels, etc.  In the case of space sims, I can tell hull strewntgh, shield levels, etc. in addition.  More detailled info can be seen, but is usually glanced over until the action dies down a bit, or a moment can be had to look closer for more info.<br />
<br />
Some of us flyboys can, like was mentioned in the previous post, play blind, with little to no inforrmation displaying.  I've gone entire Muliplayer dogfights in Tachyon without ever once looking at my guages.  I've (and many other have as well) done the same in almost every game I play (or played).  Same can be done in EQ.  I do it alot, minimizing or closing all but the most critical windows.  The point?  keep reading ;p<br />
<br />
It's mostly all based on a players style, however, the information should be there (or be able to be there) for when the player needs it.  When they do need it, they shouldn't have to look all over the screen for it.  The same can be said for controls.  While there are many of us who use more keyboard shortcuts than mouseclicks, those who do use their mouse to click buttons should be able to do so quickly and with a minimal amount of wrist movement.  Not everyone is a mouselooker.<br />
<br />
This brings us to flexibility.  A UI (for any game) should be flexible, providing the most amount of information to a wide variety of players.  Sure, Warriors don't need a mana count, they don't need percentages, and they don't need pet windows.  However, other classes do.  You could code the UI to have different versions, but in the end, it's extra code and extra work for little purpose.  Warriors don't need that mana bar, but is 15 pixels in height really going to make a big difference?  Rangers don't need the percentages, but is the 10 pixels in width going to make a big difference?  Making the UI flexible enough that all classes can benefit from it and all types of players can benefit from it seems the most logical choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried a solid green, but still got lost in some areas.... works REALLY good in dungeons tho... I was thinking about making a skin like that... all transparent like HUD just for &quot;dungeon crawling&quot; since I love dungeons. Looks pretty gaudy tho unfortunatly.<br />
<br />
Here's the graphics for it. The backgrounds are &quot;semi-transparent&quot; by means of the Alpha channel. The options buttons have new transparency as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres the XML files that I did. Basically just dropped the background out of the main windows and changed the fonts to green. Nothing much.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just decided to put it in Beta. You can check out the screenshot and get the full zip HERE (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3870)<br />
<br />
If ya want to use it at all, go ahead... figured that if nothing else it may spark some ideas here  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobeken</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just got back from London...Had a great weekend ;)<br />
<br />
Anyways...Lets reply some ;)<br />
<br />
I dont think I put anyone down.  I included myself in the list of &quot;rearrangments&quot; and never said it was bad.  Just that I want to *try* to make something truely original and see how it goes.<br />
<br />
Yah the HUD is the general idea, however instead of going with the typical red/green semi-transparent I want to focus more towards the fantasy aspect but using a kind of HUD arrangement.  I havce seen quite a few good examples come thru here and excellent ideas!!<br />
<br />
As far as content, I am partial to displaying mostly everything but again I am a keyboard user.  All the clickies people want, I drag them to my hotbox...With 100 squares I dont need to click anything really.  However I understand some people have soo many things that switches pages constantly during battle feels slow to them.  So some clickies are needed for that type of player.<br />
<br />
My personal preference is to focus on the Cleric and Warrior for UI decisions.  All casters generally want similar displays as clerics and all melee generally want the same displays as warriors.  I think a happy medium can be found to suit everyone.<br />
<br />
I am working totally with Avie on this as a joint project.  The two of us have similar ideas and bounce off each other very well.  Hopefully we can, with helpful ideas and input, release something that everyone can enjoy, even if it isnt a preferred method for them.<br />
<br />
Mind the Gap...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm totally with you on the keystroker. First bank (shift+1) has my sit/book/spells, second bank has pet commands, third is full of stuff like forage, /loc, sense heading, etc... only thing I really click on is to target and swap items around. I never thought of it, but why not make a stroker mod? get rid of EVERYTHING except display stuff. Even with my SK I don't click much. Just have to leave in the options bank so we can all tweak our setups, lol.<br />
<br />
You could call it the Raid Mod... teach people good raid ethics at an early age :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what exactly do you mean by good raid ethics? I have a physical disability that makes it very difficult to reach keys that are far apart on the keyboard. I can't touch-type and I certainly can't use alt or shift combinations in-game, and any key that I can't easily identify by touch won't get used (which excludes all but the arrow keys and a few of the keys on the corners of the other blocks). I use the mouse for EVERYTHING except to chat. I want to minimize both my mouse movement and the number of keyboard keys I have to press to play the game. I only have one page of hotkeys because I have to click to switch pages which takes an inordinate amount of time. Therefore, the mod I use is very, very mouse-friendly. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, my brother has such bad graphics lag that he can't use the mouse for much of anything. He plays EQ for hours on end without touching his mouse once. I think he even has his clickies hotkeyed somehow. He also has to play in 800x600. I made him a mod that takes up less than 10% of the screen at 800x600 and has only vital information displayed.<br />
<br />
There are considerations in UI design far beyond how you think people ought to be playing.<br />
<br />
As far as cleric and warrior- add in mage and paladin. Pet casters and hybrids have a whole different range of requirements from either non-pet casters or melees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobeken</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good points Aeluin ;)<br />
<br />
Personally I currently play a 39 Beastlord 55 Magician and 52 Cleric.  I previously played a 49 Druid and 55 Monk as my mains.  Never really got into hybrids or the true melee (taunt having) classes.<br />
<br />
Again, I considered the pet window to be useless to me, because I hotkey all pet commands.  I do see that it has a specific impact on alot of players.<br />
<br />
I may have a suggestion that could ease your playing.  You can remap almost every key in EQ now, under the options menu.  You might find it abit easier for yourself to remap a few of your commonly used keys to combinations that are easily reached.  My sister has arthritis and has remapped everything to make it easier for herself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've actually thought about doing that-but even when I do remap them I find myself having to look away from the screen, carefully place my fingers on the right keys, hit them in the right order- each step requires a lot of concentration, and by the time I've done all that I could have done it three times with the mouse without having to look away from the monitor. I've remapped certain things to keys I can find without looking- inventory, for example- and set up my hotkeys on my screen horizontally to match the order of the number keys, so these days I sometimes use the keyboard for those too. It does make things go faster. But when I get into a stressful situation I need to be able to act without thinking which means having an efficient and mouse-friendly UI available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm another keyboard player.  I use my mousr mostly for moving.  I do like a cliky page though so that in the event of me running about somewhere, I am not performing complex contortions with my left hand (I may mouselook, but I'm still an WASD mover).  Most of my keys have been remapped, although I really need to sit down and go over them agains since we've gained some keyboard commands since I last remapped them.<br />
<br />
I agree that the standard red/green HUD is a bit boring.  That's why I'm beating myself into insanity trying to make new borders for the windows while allowing them to be easily moved to more comfortable positions in the window for the user.<br />
<br />
I think you and I have a lot of the same ideas, just wording it differently. :)  I liek to have all the info at my fingertips as well, but I don't want it hogging up my screen.  If I can do that and add some graphical flair, well then I am a happy little ranger.<br />
<br />
I actually was going to shrink down the spell gems a bit, but I didn't want the tooltip text overlapping, and I haven't figured out a way to reduse it's font size yet.<br />

I run in 1280x1024 and my latest version of my UI takes up an area only 200 pixels high at the bottom of my screen, with the only thing outside of that space being my spellbar because I must have it vertical and next to the things I'm trying to target and cast on or I'll get all confused and start healing the drolvargs :eek:. I'd shrink it more but then my chat windows wouldn't have enough lines visible, so I'm working on adding more useful information into the current space.<br />
<br />
My other issue is: people keep debating between looks and functionality. Why can't we have both? Why must a functional UI have the feel of an airplane cockpit? I'm not talking fantasy borders on every window. I'm saying make the UI pieces you have to have anyway look good. You need spellgems of some sort- make them attractive! You have to have some sort of graphic for your buttons- why should it be boring? You need some sort of background texture (even if you go completely transparent everywhere else, the ground in EQ doesn't make a very good background for chat, because it changes colours every time you zone) so why not marble or forest patterns instead of something that makes me think of linoleum or naugahyde? Take out all the unnecessary parts- titles, borders, extra space in the windows- and make the rest look GOOD!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll just dump a few suggestions here since I've made a UI myself and have had some user input.<br />
<br />
When I designed my first version I had planned on an entirely keyboard layout. I only use the mouse to move items; targetting, opening doors, etc. I use hotkeys. So at first my plan was to only show data but kill practically all buttons.<br />
<br />
I got response from people that it bugged them to not have the buttons available, so I took a second shot at it. And then I realized what uses some of the buttons can have. You can click pet window butons while casting! You cannot use hotkeys while casting. So instead of having to type out /pet attack and press enter when the cast bar is at 20 percent (I have a long cast time) I just click attack. So I began tor eorganize my UI to reinclude more buttons or have them available to be shown/not shown. I made the bottom edge of the pet window (only the bottom edge mind you) resizeable so you could drag it down to expose the hotkeys, or drag it up if you only wanted tos ee pet health.<br />
<br />
The response for this release was better. Basically, my advice would be to make it mouse friendly by design, but make it so the buttons can be hidden if the end user so desires. Since developing my own UI I have started using the mouse more and have become a better mage because of it. No more typos that = pet not attacking, etc, because I just have to click that button instead (my mouse cursor basically just hovers over my pet window).<br />
<br />
Uh, hope my input, uh, something something...<br />
<br />
Enok<br />

All of the items are in a simple place and require little or no mouse movement. It also takes into consideration that hot keys are used for many of the commands for pets and attacks etc.<br />
If someone knows how to make this please post this as this is only created in photoshop and I would love to have this UI where I could use it as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now in this pic HERE (http://webpages.charter.net/nytcrie/EQ000024.JPG) (the game is running at 1280X1024X32 @85 refresh rate)the chat boxes are a little larger than normal when I play, but most of the ground in front of me can be seen.  We were doing the ringwar, so I wanted to be sure not to miss anything, therefore drug them out larger.  Optionally I couldv've used the viewport.<br />
<br />
Anyway, notice the click type stuff on the right and the data on the left.  I feel if I shrunk it much mroe they would be unreadable/unusable.<br />
<br />
I'll state again that chat boxes are the bane of all well planned UIs.  Too big to shove out of view without reducing their effectiveness.</div></div><hr />

What I mean by good raid ethics is basically using your mouse as little as possible. A problem arises when a player is trying to use their mouse to target an already pulled mob and can't target and people die, instead of simply assisting or making an assist key. That's only one of the problems of using your mouse on raids. Another would be a healer trying to target with mouse, a person trying to click to cast spells instead of making a hotkey bank, trying to hit small pet command buttons, etc.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you have any disabilities , or even bad carpotunel(sp?), it may be necesary to do what you must. Just if you can, it's better to keystroke as much as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah. response to that is that it clearly demonstrates the need for a mouse-friendly mod. One where you barely have to move to target a group member and then hit assist, for instance. I agree, it's ridiculous to try to use your mouse to target things in the game world- they're hardly ever where they appear to be, and if they are there's usually something in the way. But in a well-designed mouse-friendly mod, even if I do get too flustered to be able to deal with F-keys or figure out which number key corresponds to which hotbutton, I can still click on my MT in the group window and hit assist in almost the same amount of time.<br />
<br />
If I'm playing my beastlord, I have 2 hotkeys, one of which reads /assist off, /g assisting %t, /assist, and the other one is /assist on, /g My warder and I are assisting %t, /assist, /pet attack. So in general I don't have to deal with the pet buttons in groups. But if I'm soloing I cast a lot so the pet window is invaluable because I can command my pet while casting- and as my pet window is immediately next to my hotbuttons and spellbar, it's very quick to use.<br />
<br />
Mousing players have a bad rep because most newbies do it the wrong way and screw up their groups. But a correctly designed mod in which everything you click on in battle is close together can make an experienced mouser indistinguishable from a keyboard player. Remember that all your keyboard commands are merely shortcuts for something that you could click on if you wanted to; if the shortcut is slower or less efficient for a given player than the long way, that player shouldn't be using the shortcut. No?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that a mod with all clickable items and buttons should be close together... like a spellbar on the right border of the screen, with group/player/pet/target right next to it on the left of the cast bar (keep a person from accidentally casting when he meant to just click a target, like reaching across the table to grab food and knocking stuff over). Actions window right under that. Hotkey bank where it is normally, and chat windows in between. Or even, just for astetic purpose, chat windows and stats across bottom and hotkey moved up slightly to rest on top.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't be too hard to get everything clickable in one area, more of a problem of keeping everything large enough to keep from missing, yet small enough to be unobtrusive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its clicker friendly, encompasses people gauges (not XP) sits in the bottom right corner of the screen and takes VERY little space.<br />
<br />
To cover both tanks and clerics, the target gauge is quite large and the other gauges encompass it.<br />
<br />
All Player gauges use a *fine* gauge, like the blue line in your XP bar that shows how much of each bubble is full.<br />
<br />
The pet bar is slightly detached and sits just underneath with its own fine gauge.<br />
<br />
The gauges are all &quot;glass&quot; styled.  Window borders will match this style.<br />
<br />
Background graphics and buttons will have the &quot;plastic&quot; or &quot;aqua&quot; look and be more or less colorless to match the glass idea but to make them stand apart enough to notice the difference between a clicky and a border ;)<br />
<br />
I will convert the player window and target windows into seperate styles and leave the pet window as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I'd like to point out:<br />
Many many people are using the precision guage underline thingy on practically every gauge; while this seems to be a good idea because you get a more precise reading, it isn't because the guage ISN'T precise. Because of lag, and the fact that the data doesn't update constantly and perfectly, the value that the guage shows isn't necessarily accurate, in fact I usually give a 5 percent margin of error for every value except exp and AA exp (since those are accurate and that's why Verant gave then precision lines). Target HP, your current mana, and usually group member HP is quite innacurate. The guage for pet HP is HORRIBLY innacurate, I rely on /pet report health because that is an accurate report of it's HP.<br />
<br />
Uh, that's it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobeken</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you think I should leave the *fine* gauges out?<br />
<br />
I am thinking even with the margin of error you mention tanks and clerics will like having it...Not sure tho...Is it not worth the extra screen space?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think you should leave the fine gauges out to save space, I think you should leave them out because they give people a  false sense of accuracy, if the cleric thinks the gauges are accurate and times it so that complete heal will hit you when you're at 1 percent health, you'll probably die cause, uhm cause that cleric's an idiot. =D<br />
<br />
By the same token, mana is not synced very well between you and the EQ servers so having that accuracy is basically pointless. Even a percent for mana is generally impresice by an entire percent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only gauge that really wants a linefill is xp. (and aaxp) The others work best with just a regular gauge and a percent label (the gauge for status-at-a-glance, the percent for more detailed calculations like how much your heal does or how many times you can cast a given spell).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobeken</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, I hope I never meet that cleric....<br />
<br />
I am aware that the client tries to keep the gauges accurate however the server overrides the client gauge whenever it refreshes.  Thats where the &quot;lag&quot; in the client bar comes from.<br />
<br />
I guess, rather than cause some confusion by putting it in, I will leave them out...But it did look spiffy to see it working!! ;)</div></div><hr />

Yay! The interface has a nice look to it although I sorta prefer more clean window edges (I can just apply my UI skin to &quot;fix&quot; that). Although I realise it's not complete it is pretty nice.<br />

<br />
Soon the window edges will be semi-transparent and well shaped rather than the defaults.<br />
<br />
Also I like to leave windows seperate as much as possible to allow people to tweak the look for themselves...I tested this at 800x600 and it is a little tight so I wouldnt dare go to 640x480...BEST is 1024x768 or higher...<br />
<br />
Oh and PS: Avie will be doing the final coding.  My temporary code is just to get everything available for her to make final ;)<br />
<br />
PPS: Thanks for the compliment ;)<br />

PPS: Hoping to see what Aeluin thinks of it, since she is the concerned mouser that got me worried about keeping it easily clickable ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-16-2002, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, that makes sense about the edges, I was wondering why they were default. =D<br />
<br />
I personally used vert as a sort of template and just adjusted it to fit into the default window template constraints (so it could be a standalone skin) then &quot;improved&quot; it (in my opinion, especially the vert gauges, they're nice but what the heck is the point of the little lines in the far left bubble, why aren't they in every bubble or not in any?) and it turned out being quite different but still vert-esque. Uhm, my point was that the vert buttons are a good base to work off of, not sure if you were planning to completely make new ones.<br />
<br />
I made my UI the same way, where the user can place windows anywhere they want and at any resolution, the ones with set positions and resolutions really bug me. I'd never use Abattoir, Quartz or any of their knockoffs.<br />

In the next pre-release...I have coded my own window definition...WDT_HUD...<br />
<br />
It is the same as WDT_RoundedNoTitle except it loads window_back.tga as the background image for the windows.  That is by default transparent.  You can change that file to be whatever color/transparency/image you want and all of my changed windows will take that background...<br />
<br />
It works really well for allowing users to have the colored glass or &quot;aqua&quot; look in any color scheme they choose.  To make your background custom just open window_back.tga and play with the picture to your liking ;) <br />
<br />
(I advise against R50 B220 G100, really nasty nasty color for a background)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I made my DungeonCrawler background partially transparent by making a &quot;grid&quot; of sorts... I made an extra layer in PS6 that had every other pixel as black, then did a select color to select all the black dots, then loaded that as the alpha channel for the background, essentially making it  50% transparent by default.</div></div><hr />
