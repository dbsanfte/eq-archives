<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shard</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the October 9th patch, some PoTime cloaks are showing up as pearl necklaces. I am using the latest versions of Solaria and Vert with the patch.<br />
<br />
Is anyone having the same problem? Is there a fix or is it something that EQ has messed up with the patch?</div></div><hr />

Look in the default animations file and copy the section from there. That should fix it.</div></div><hr />

That's b/c it's dragitems26 + 27 you need I think</div></div><hr />

It was fine until the patch, but from what I can tell, they did not add or change any dragitem files.<br />
<br />
Also it is only Time cloaks that are affected. Anybody have any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Doh yeah that was it.  Didn't even realize there was a 26 and 27 until I went into the default dir and saw them.  Thanks for that heads up. hehe :)</div></div><hr />
