After much faithful service, it's time for us to bid a fond farewell to EverQuest's Classic and Velious user interfaces.  In yesterday's Test Server patch, the old interfaces were disabled.<br />
<br />
While adding many features to the new interface over the past six months, including the built-in MP3 player, item links, compass, and enhanced /bug reporting tool, we've done the best that we could to keep all three interfaces, at the very least, usable.<br />
<br />
However, some of the features that we've been quietly working on over the past weeks have unfortunately forced our hand.  <br />
<br />
We don't want to spoil all of the upcoming changes at once, however, in yesterday's Test Server update, we released the first run of the new EverQuest windowed mode that's been in the works for quite some time now.  (In a game that was originally written for a much earlier version of DirectX, it's a lot more work than many would think.)  Soon, it will behave in a manner similar to other applications that support both full-screen and windowed mode and can be toggled back and forth.  As a part of this change, the account bans related to the use of third-party EverQuest windowing applications have already been reversed.<br />
<br />
In addition, the long-rumored &quot;Bard Box&quot; has also been revealed on the Test Server.  For those who are not aware, we've been wanting to add a second Effects window that would hold selected short-duration beneficial effects, most notably many bard songs.  Initially, for tuning, the new effects area will allow six additional songs to be placed upon your character.  <br />
<br />
These updates will remain on the Test Server only until after the new year, as we expect that much additional testing will be required.<br />
<br />
We hope you'll be as pleased with these latest changes as we are, and we look forward to bringing you many new features in the coming months.</div>

The answer as to why EQW is now allowed is because they are making everquest a windowed application like any other program (i.e. Internet Explorer)  At least they doin' something right now.</div>

Kevdawg, I know what you mean... I have a 15in monitor, and I've had to really play with resolution, window size, and font sizes to get something both readable and playable. Do try some experimentation and see what you can come up with, and remember, most windows are resizeable, and they can all be set to fade to invisible (I have most of my windows set this way).<br />
<br />
Also, check out some of the mods that have resized the windows to a smaller footprint... the recent &quot;Compression&quot; series comes to mind, but there are others. Also, some of the mods that combine windows (like player/group/target) or move info to easily toggled windows (like moving player info to a tab on the pet window) may help you clear up some real estate.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post questions in the Help forum, and make use of the Search function for specific topics. Good luck!</div>

*still* wondering if you can run more than one session at once.  I mean.. major cash cow for SOE.  Meanwhile I think I will just use it to check mods and mail.  I can barely bring myself to play one character let alone more than one.</div>

		<div>Window mode??  i guess that has its benefits.  I'm what you all might call a power gamer, i cant stand window mode apps.  i have a 21in  monitor i like getting the big picture  Imho  window apps just dont gve me that.  Although it would be nice to ALT-TAB out of EQ with out it crashing so if i needed to check a mob or item info  i could do so.</div>

		<div>This whole windowed EQ is prolly another way to stop cheaters actually. Before when they had the old license agreement you could stll open the window button and what not while it was still up. Then they made the new way which forced cheaters to use EQWindow to cheat. Now they prolly are doing this so that the cheat program won't be able to detect the game since its going through a windowed mode they made, which can prolly be coded to mask itself.</div>

Anyways, I don't mean to be rude or anything but just getting my point across.  All SOE is trying to do now is pleae the customer until their next big game comes out.</div>
