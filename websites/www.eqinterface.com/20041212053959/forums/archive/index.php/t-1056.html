<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to see what mods people are making, and how they're doing it.  Especially during these first few weeks while we're figuring out how everything works.  I don't care what color scheme is used on the web site where I get that information.<br />
<br />
EqInterface has spent the last few weeks working on a new look and not posting any mods.<br />
<br />
Do you see how the second paragraph is the opposite of the first?  Is there any reason to even go there anymore?<br />
<br />
I figured out how a few things work and sent examples to that site.  If I'd ignored that site and just posted them here in the first place, I might have helped some other designers.  What a waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As both Dobly and I have stated.. but I will again<br />
<br />
EQInterface.com and EQGui.com have both been using  A LOT of bandwidth, soo we very quickly had to find a new home to host the site(s) on..<br />
<br />
We found a great new home, but it is taking a couple of days to move both of the entire sites over.. <br />
<br />
as for EQInterface.com its is ALSO getting a face lift, we are moving to a PHP Driven site, that will allow users to upload thier mods to the server for approval instead of email them, it will also included some features that people have requested such as &quot;most downloaded&quot; &quot;newest additions&quot; etc..  But this code take a little time to write.. <br />
<br />
I have been posting a few mods, but I would say that 50% of the mods I got before the July 31st patch were broken after the July 31st patch.. and after spending the better part of a week updating the ones we got updates on They patched again on Aug 14th and again broke about 95% of the mods on the site.. <br />
<br />
The UI is in Beta 2, Varent has said this repeatedly and after the first big patch Dolby and I both realised that we need a more streamlined way for people to get thier mods to us..<br />
<br />
In the next few days (read that as fri, sat, or sun) you will find a brand new EQInterface.com Look when you go there.. <br />
<br />
here are some of the features (and maybe a repeat from above)<br />
<br />
1. Users may upload thier mods, and after approval will be availble for download, if they make changes to thier mod, they can go back and *update* the original upload.. there will be no need to &quot;re-submit&quot;  <br />
for example. Vertebrae can upload his Vert 1.0 zip and screen shot, We approve it.. it goes to the download section.. a patch happens.. he makes version 1.1 he logs back into his &quot;uploaded files&quot; and selects Vert 1.0 and tells it &quot;here new file&quot; and &quot;here is new image&quot; and what version number he wants (ie 1.1) and it post the new files without any broken links. <br />
<br />
2. User ratings, you have seen it on other sites, we are going to try it here too.<br />
<br />
3. List such as &quot;most popular&quot; &quot;most downloaded&quot; &quot;most recent&quot; etc. will be availble (mentioned above)<br />
<br />
4. all of this is linked to *these* forums.. soo your login and password are the same.<br />
<br />
5. Keeping the &quot;tested&quot; &quot;untested&quot; and &quot;needs update&quot; feature<br />
<br />
all of this has taken both Dolby and I (more dolby) a while to get right. but we think you all will be very happy with the outcome. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so be patient.... :D <br />
<br />
we are getting there <br />

<br />
I am with you completely...  He has always been too nice;)  ROFL<br />
<br />
It does make you realize however how much people really don't know about what goes into this...<br />
<br />
This webpage is NO small undertaking!<br />
<br />
Hats off to you Dolby and especially you Kudane for the work involved in creating and maintaining this site.  I look forward to world class surfing on this site:)<br />
