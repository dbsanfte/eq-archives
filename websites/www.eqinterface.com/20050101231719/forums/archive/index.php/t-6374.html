<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cristo</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">today i logged in and noticed the Player window that I Got from here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=797) is now all screwed up in its alignment <br />
I have updated all the changed ui files that needed it. In my ui editor program it shows it as aligned correctly its only in game that it is messing up<br />
Any Ideas? im at a loss<br />
<br />
Here is a pic</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Setanta</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess its kinda related - display on my UI is showing up fine, except everytime I zone, some / all the UI pieces are relocated ever so slightly (i.e. just enough to be annoying - bit of a bummer when you try to hit your FD hotkey, find the UI has shifted since you last saw it and the FD button is located somewhere off the left hand side of the screen. Try to drag it back.... and realise you had it all locked nicely into place. In the end you really pray a little more than usual that it doesn't fail this time :rolleyes: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has to be something SoE broke when they patched today...it seems as if the offset values (at least the X value) is not working.  I know I have posted a fix for the Vert cast window because the spell gems were off, but as soon as SoE fixes thier end, it should go back to normal (at least I believe that is what's wrong...somebody please correct me if im wrong :p   it wouldn't be the first time)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've found the BASE issue with this may be the presence of negative numbers in the LOCATION sections.<br />
<br />
In the GROUP window SonaMod, I have only seen this effect on PlayerSlot1 the rest of the bubbles and guages are unaffected.<br />
<br />
In many cases we set the X or Y coords to -30 or something to just push the text off the display, and then leave everything else to fall into place.  Seems that the negative coordinate is what is making a mess of things for player health gauges.<br />
<br />
By taking the coords and setting them to real numbers (0 and above) and then modifying the TextOffsetY and GagueOffsetX etc to move the item around, I was able to straighten out some of the STANDARD gauges.<br />
<br />
For the life of me tho with the TKing Style Gauges ( )------- the bubble in player slot 1 is just WAY freaked out.... Even moving all the Bubble gauges to positive integers and then modding the GaugeOffesetX to account for the new location, this one just pushed everything in game to the other side....<br />
<br />
Still working at it, but may just forget it for the night to actually XP....been at it now for over 3 hours....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cristo</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok with all that i got the idea of the problem that was occuring<br />
I tinkered around and the only way to get it all to line up without having any negative locations was to resize the whole window by an extra 91 pixels<br />
<br />
Now when i /attack the red border obviously goes 91 pixels to the left where the window border is but with my layout it is overlapping other windows which is annoying. So my question is this, Can you change the placement of the red flashing border? or can you turn it off somehow? or is there a totally different way of doing this window without resizing it?</div></div><hr />

This is one of my mods.  Can you post the code, so I can see what you have done so far, please?  I haven't had access to EQ lately but I will in a couple of days, no need for me to reinvent the wheel by fixing or using options already tried.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Been thinking bout doing the same thing with my horiz group window, but just cant bring myself to make that drastic a mod.</div></div><hr />

Holy crap Batman that's a good idea.  I may play with that if the patch doesn't come quick enuff.</div></div><hr />

Actually you are describing a version I use already (not posted) but I don't have access to EQ atm, so I don't know if that one works either.<br />

<br />
As for moving the guage I set all the neg locations to zero and used the offesetguage to move the bubbles to the proper aligment but for some freaked out reason it distorted the bubbles instead of moving them. Think it has something to do with the way the gauges are actually drawn</div></div><hr />
