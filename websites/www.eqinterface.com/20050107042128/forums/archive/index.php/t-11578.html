My wife wanted a trackball, So I got her one. Problem is that moving across the screen takes longer with it then with the mouse. I went searching through the hotbutton section for something to help but didn't find what I was looking for. I am a Druid in game, support caster, And use alot of hotbutton casting. I have a idea of what I would like. I'm hoping someone can make it since I have no idea where to begin. I know the Time/Progress probably isn't doable. Just would be nice that way I wouldn't have to keep the adventure window open while LDON'n it. If you can think of something else to put in it's place that would be great. Maybe some armor slot button's? And that brings me to a question. I see these ui's that show the armor slot's, can you use clickable effects that way? This arrangement would work well for my monk to if at some later date the spell button's could be used for the new melee opening's.<br />

Thank you all.<br />

<br />
or do a search for Adventure Window.. and see what you come up with.<br />

good luck!<br />

I just have them set 1-9 skipping 5.  Take a look at my mods for a matching spellbar that helps cut down confusion.<br />
<br />
I don't think time/progress can be moved out of the adventure window, but then again I don't have much experience with that particular window.<br />
<br />
The right clicky windows can be reprogramed to be any slot.  Just pick a window you like and post a request to have it changed if the FAQ on changing EQ types is like greek to you.<br />

Edit:  I almost forgot.  You may also want to change the mouse sensativity to higher.  My friend has been using a trackball for the past 3 years of EQing and is quicker with it than I am with my mouse.</div></div><hr />
