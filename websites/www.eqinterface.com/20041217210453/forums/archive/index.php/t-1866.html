<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Changes to Player window, Target window, Player &quot;stats&quot; window (converted Pet window), Group window, Containers, Inventory, Casting window, Chat windows and Confirmation box.  Detailed descriptions of the changes are on the Screen shot.<br />
<br />
For a &quot;working&quot; view, go here (http://members.rogers.com/khobson/ui/UIWorking.jpg).<br />
<br />
For a screenshot which gives credit for all the work not my own, go here (http://members.rogers.com/khobson/ui/UICredits.jpg).<br />
<br />
Originally made for a resolution of 1024x768, it will work in any resolution equal to or higher than that.  It also works in 800x600 if you use a different buff box (eg, one that can be stretched across the top of your screen).<br />
<br />
As a ranger, I find this incredibly easy to work with, and I think it would work well for all hybrids.<br />
<br />
Full installation instructions, detailed descriptions of the changes made and detailed credits to other's work are all included in the README.txt file.<br />

(Also available in the MixandMatch Download section, but posting here too, to help with Bandwidth).<br />

nearby all i wanted :)<br />
<br />
a fully functionnal ranger UI. <br />
now i am just looking for a quick inventory access ( a mod had that in hotbuttons : there was , small sized , the 8 inv slot ) and that would be &quot;perfect&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 of the 8 inventory slots are already there.  I can look into getting the other six added, if you like.  Or even run all 8 (although that seems kinda redundant to me).  Would you want them down the left- or the right-hand side of the hotbuttons?</div></div><hr />
