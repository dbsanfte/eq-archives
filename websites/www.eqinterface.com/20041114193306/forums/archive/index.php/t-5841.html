<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This UI aims to reproduce the look and feel of the original EverQuest UI, while making all the new UI features available. <br />
<br />
UPDATE HISTORY<br />
<br />
23-Sept-2003 : I am no longer updating the UI, but hkTRox is working on a modification of this UI, and has been also very kind to update the Classic UI, along with his modification, for the latest patch. I am only copying the links to his work here to make it easier for new users to find the latest version of this UI:<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
Classic UI, updated by hkTRox<br />
23-Sept-2003:<br />
- added textures so LDoN graphics would display correctly<br />
- added LDoN windows such as Adventure Window that could not be displayed before<br />
- repositioned the lfg button in the group window to where I think fab wanted it<br />
- updated the way % works in the target window to the new standard<br />
- changed a few locations of windows when you type /loadskin to what they should be<br />
- fixed the UI_char.ini file, it was putting chat windows outside of the viewport<br />
<br />
Here is a link to download Fab's UI<br />
Classic UI beta 1.07 (http://hktrox.shackspace.com/Eqfilez/classic-ui-beta-07.zip)<br />
<br />
hkTRox's UI<br />
23-Sept-2003:<br />
- All LDoN windows will display now and graphics will look like they should<br />
- Percentages have been fixed in all windows and will only appear when group members join or targets are selected.<br />
<br />
Here is a Link to My UI<br />
Trox's Classic-Mana beta 2 (http://hktrox.shackspace.com/Eqfilez/h-classic-mana-beta-02.zip)<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
16-Apr-2003 : Spellbook has been updated, it's smaller and kinda neat, not entirely finished though. I'm posting it now because it was somewhat broken in the last update.<br />
<br />
14-Apr-2003 : A nice lil' update, finally I have included the old ui style class animations. They have all been optimized for texture memory, which was the major bummer and reason I didnt do it before.<br />
<br />
- fixed Group Member names not displaying if they were in a different zone<br />
- Trade Window done (player to player)<br />
- short duration buff window (overlaps the viewport, up to 6 song icons)<br />
- Old UI style Class Animations<br />
- Window : Casting<br />
- Window : Breathing<br />
- Window : NPC Note Window<br />
- Window : Player Notes Window<br />
- Window : Track Window (listbox background)<br />
- Window : Skills Window (listbox background)<br />
<br />
A NEW INSTALLATION STEP HAS BEEN ADDED TO REDUCE FILE SIZE :<br />
<br />
After you have unzipped to the uifiles folder, double click and execute the file mana-to-melees.BAT if you are going to play this UI with a pure melee character (rogue, monk &amp; warrior). It will copy files from the classic-mana folder to the classic folder. It pretty much makes the download half as large shaving 1.5mb of download.<br />
<br />
06-Apr-2003 : This is not a UI update, folks. See 'MODDING' below if you are interested in modifying this UI. <br />
<br />
04-Apr-2003 : OMG , a REAL update for once ^_^ Too bad I missed April's Fool, HA !<br />
<br />
 - finished Merchant window<br />
 - finished Loot window<br />
 - included the original 'parchment' style chat window<br />
 - cleaned up the new bits that were added to the Inventory window in last update : the Charm slot, and the Dye and Face buttons are looking better.<br />
<br />
Here a Screenie (http://web.wanadoo.be/def46/work/classic-beta-05-b.jpg) including the finished Merchant Window, Inventory with Charm Slot, and classic style Chat Window !<br />
Here a Screenie (http://web.wanadoo.be/def46/work/classic-beta-05-a.jpg) of the Loot Window<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
<br />
30-Mar-2003 #2  : Fixed the Pet Health Bars in the Group Window.<br />
<br />
I have not been able to test it in any easy way, so PLEASE let me know if they still don't show properly. Should be nice, thin, orange bars below health player health bar.<br />
<br />
30-Mar-2003 : UPDATED and tested as of today (works with latest patch : March 13, 2003).<br />
<br />
Quick summary : Story,  Journal, Guild Management and Cartography toggle buttons added to left pane. 'Face' and 'Dye' buttons added to inventory pane. No new graphics, sorry, just a post-patch 'fix'.<br />
<br />
11-Feb-2003 : UPDATED and tested with February 6, 2003 patch.<br />
<br />
A bug in the previous version was also fixed, which would cause the game to exit to desktop on some computers. This was due to my UI file pointing to a mp3 that was on MY computer, but not found on other people's computer. Thanks to Aalaxandar &amp; Steve 'hkTRox' at EQGUI forums for pointing this.<br />
<br />
30-Jan-2003 : fixed for 28-Jan-2003 patch (the game would exit to desktop upon zoning).<br />
<br />
<br />
Please forgive me for the delay of post-patch UI updates. I am not playing EQ at this time, and am not checking the news frequently. Feel free to email me ( oukoulele@yahoo.fr ) if the UI breaks after a patch and I will try to look into it asap. PS: Please don't send me screenshots, post them here or let me know so I can give you another email , this one is a free mail box with a size limit, thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />
DOWNLOAD<br />
<br />
( Note: see last updates above for an updated version by hkTRox )<br />
<br />
Classic UI beta 1.06 (http://web.wanadoo.be/def46/work/classic-ui-beta-06c.zip.x) 2003-Apr-16 (1.6mb zip file -- remove '.x' in the name before extracting :) )<br />
<br />
FEATURES<br />
<br />
The UI has been designed for 1024x768.<br />
<br />
Compared to the original EQ UI, the Classic UI's viewport is larger, so it should appeal to more players :<br />
<br />
http://web.wanadoo.be/def46/work/ui-classic-0.jpg<br />
<br />
On the top left, we have 3 selector window buttons working. Clicking the bag area will open the inventory.<br />
<br />
http://web.wanadoo.be/def46/work/classic_beta10.jpg<br />
<br />
On the top right you have Player Info, as well as Experience gauges, mostly useful for solo sessions. While you are in a party, toggle on the Party Window (Alt-P) and this area will show the group members info. You may also leave the Party Window open at all times if you do not like to see the Experience bar all the time.<br />
<br />
http://web.wanadoo.be/def46/work/classic_beta14.jpg<br />
<br />
Bags and containers look like this. All windows are using this 'theme'.<br />

<br />
See attached picture for a gameplay screenshot.<br />
<br />
INSTALLATION<br />
<br />
The installation instructions are included in the download.<br />
<br />
MODDING (06 April 2003)<br />
If you would like to 'mod' this UI, you can work out all the coordinates you need by looking up the layouts in Photoshop. Due to moving files over my homepage, I will not host the 6mb file. If you want the Photoshop layouts please email: oukoulele@yahoo.fr and request for classic ui layouts. I will attach a 6mb zip file in the reply !<br />
<br />
<br />
FEEDBACK<br />
<br />
I am looking forward for suggestions and feedback on the UI.<br />
<br />
I am not playing EQ anymore, this is in part the reason why this UI took so long to even reach the beta forum. To be honest I didn't touch it since about 2 months *blush*.. here I should thank Rodney (Luminea) and 'Tim' for testing it, and eventually making this UI reach the beta stage :P<br />
<br />
It's basically up to you now to play test this and let me know what you feel is still missing and what you feel is not optimal gameplay wise.<br />
<br />
As for the future of the UI, the plans is to get it finished first. I am leaving it to the community to create graphic modifications based on this UI, or to include other mods such as maps, recipes, 'clickies', etc.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These are KNOWN ISSUES with the beta version :<br />
<br />
- Pet health bars on the Party window are messed up. It should be fixed with the next update.<br />
<br />
- Merchant window is not finished, the Buy and Done buttons appear out of place.<br />
<br />
- Only the ROGUE class animations have been converted to the 'old' look. Hence they look better in this version. The others do work, but they have the ugly dark gray background of the new UI. I am still trying to figure out if I'll reduce the old UI animations in size to save up texture memory or if I will do it Micro$oft style :D<br />
<br />
TO-DO<br />
<br />
Out of my head, those are the windows that I'll be looking on for the next update.<br />
<br />
- Loot<br />
- Trade (player to player)<br />
- Merchant<br />
- Track<br />
- Mp3 Player<br />
- Spell book<br />
- Song (bard songs)<br />
- Pet Info</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, for some feedback... We need a spellbook clicky link under the inventory bag :/<br />
Currently, the only way to enter the spellbook is /book<br />
<br />
Also, do you plan on making the chat background the old color, or leaving it this current color? Or maybe an option to choose which we like better?<br />
<br />
Other than that, I'm set for now. Thanks for your hard work, it is much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you.<br />
<br />
About the Spellbook, I would have SO LOVED to do that you know, unfortunately there is no Spellbook Button on the Selector Window (I haven't checked recently though).<br />
<br />
If that darned spellbook button worked in the selector I was able to simulate exactly the old spellbook animation thingie that opened when you clicked it.. :(<br />
<br />
Because of the arrangement of the windows, I would have to make a very small button below the spell gems, so for now I'd rather just use CTRL-B.. I assumed most people would do ctrl-b as it is very fast (ctrl-s to sit, etc.. )<br />
<br />
As for the chat window.. here you can see a gameplay screenshot of the old ui style chat window (http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/classic_beta18.jpg) that I had working. I did it out of curiosity, but I thought it was heavier visually and more difficult to read.. I guess I'll just wait and see what people prefer.<br />
<br />
That said, the current chat windows are barely worked on, I like the background but the frame around it should be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm very interesting :)<br />
<br />
Did you do the chat window with a static animation or is it a background and border pieces??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">01-24-2003, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there is no background, so everypiece is tied to the borders and the parchment in the middle adapt to the size of the chat window.<br />
<br />
One problem with that design is if someone want to make say 3 windows, the 3rd one being a small column just for damage numbers, it will be bigger than needed .. because all chat windows use the same template :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumguror</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just can say that this is the BEST ui i have downloaded from this site. Great job and great UI.<br />
<br />
Thanks for it.<br />
<br />
I just have a little problem. I press Alt P but the group window is not appearing. I cant see the group window. Can anybody plz tell me what am i doing bad ? The rest of the UI is working really fine.<br />
<br />
Errrr, just one more question : Bard songs window ?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your work about this UI and sorry for the inconveniences that i am causing.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I have not seen this problem myself, I assume the position of the group window is outside of the screen, maybe you were using a higher resolution before ?<br />
<br />
Copying back the UI_characterxxx_xx.ini file over your character UI files should reset all the windows into place.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this works and how you fixed it.<br />
<br />
As for the Bard Songs window it should show up as well.<br />
<br />
One thing you can do is edit your character UI files, and search for the corresponding section, for example for the group window you will find this:<br />
<br />
[GroupWindow]<br />
...<br />
XPos1024x768=903<br />
YPos1024x768=0<br />
...<br />
<br />
check that those coordinates are inside a 1024x768 screen, if not just set em to 400, 300 for example, and you should have the party window in the middle of the screen next time you run the game.<br />
<br />
Let me know if that helps,<br />

My previous resolution was 1600 x 1200 heheh.<br />
<br />
Pretty pretty pretty nice UI. Thanks a lot for the time that you are investing on it and thx for your interest.<br />
<br />
Will keep you informed if i see any bug on it but for now it is working really fine, better even that some Uis that are posted on RELEASED forum.<br />

I was like... so pumped, I am in love with this UI... sadly our relationship is going the way of Romeo and Juliet. I logged on the other day, excited to finally see my girl in action, when all of a sudden I was kicked to the server select screen! Not to give up so easily on the love of my life I redownloaded it and tried again, I clicked &quot;Enter World&quot; and the loading screen apeared! Rapture! Alas, it was not to last, moments later I was staring at another beautifull woman, this time on my desktop though =(. I am *able* to run this but only if I do not use the UI_yournamehere_64 file that comes with it, obviously I renamed it correctly. Is there a bug in that file? When I load it with my normal UI file it's all in pieces, but at least it loads... please help, I need her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EDIT: THE UI HAS BEEN FIXED FOR JAN 28 PATCH, SEE 1st POST<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
COuld this be related to a game bug ?<br />
<br />
from eq casters realm after Jan 28 patch<br />
<br />
&quot;ZONE CRASH BUG FIXED<br />
The zone crashing bug from earlier in today has been fixed without a need for further downtime.<br />
<br />
The problem stemmed from some xml data missing from this mornings patch. If you are still crashing be sure to log fully out and repatch. &quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aalaxandar</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Possibly. But I doubt it's very closley related. I read the fix for that bug and it's got a lot to do with the files in the classic folder... All those files work fine for me, it's the UI_Aalaxandar_64 ile that is busted. I deleated it and I can run your ui, but everythings out of place... I pieced it together but it's missing hitsmode and I'm sure a bunch of otehr stuff, I've not really given the new UI a seconed thought untill I saw yours, and have no idea where to begin =\ Btw wow, what a timley responce!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you guys, I have fixed the UI.<br />
<br />
It is now up to date with the January 28 Patch.<br />
<br />
If you would like to keep your current window positions, you may just overwrite the EQUI.xml file in classic/ and classic-mana/ folders with the one from the updated archive.<br />
<br />
Enjoy,<br />

<br />
I would like some screenshots of how you have the UI chat windows configured with your preferences.<br />
<br />
This will help me decide how best to relook the chat windows.<br />
<br />
Please leave any other overlapping window you usually have open around the viewport, for example mp3 player.<br />
<br />
Please zip the screenshot if possible and send to akgw0004@wanadoo.be, thank you.<br />
<br />

Also, I would like to hear from you about the chat window 'looks'. Do you like the old parchment look ?</div></div><hr />

Yes, I had this problem also, I would very much like to see this UI work out, and will do all I can to help trouble shoot it.  The new patch does seem to have fixed it!<br />
<br />
Thanks for everything!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hkTRox</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings, I came across your UI and really liked the idea.  So I downloaded and went to load it and crashed to desktop (this is after you fixed it for patch) I figured I was doing something wrong so reread the entire file you have with it and these boards and didn't see anything I did wrong so I tried again and It crashed to desktop again.  I got it down to the UI_username_64.ini (renamed for my char and server) file was the problem.  With yours not in the directory I could load EQ.  In the game everything was out of place, which I expected but was glad it loaded.  I then went line by line of you UI file and the most recent one from SOE and tried to figure out the part that was crashing it.  I believe it is <br />
[MusicPlayerWnd]<br />
LastM3U=D:\NEW-downloads\Diablo Mp3\diablo.m3u<br />
Playing=1<br />
Random=1<br />
<br />
Command that was messing me up when I changed it to <br />
[MusicPlayerWnd]<br />
LastM3U=***<br />
Playing=0<br />
Random=0<br />
It would load.  Took me about 4 or 5 hours to get to that point since I started from the top going down line by line loading EQ coming back changing next line loading EQ, ect.  Here is my UI file if you wanted to take a look or try it http://www.shackspace.com/~hktrox@shackmail.com/Eqfilez/UI_Zygollas_40.zip<br />
<br />
On a different note the spell gems on the left for caster classes I think are to narrow of an oval I can barely see the background color which tells me if the spell is self only, group, area effect, and such.  But other then that haven’t seen much else wrong.  Thanks a ton for releasing it for us that still play EQ :)<br />

<br />
Let me tell you I am really pleased to see someone helping with this. <br />
<br />
Thank you very much for the fix, that explains why it would work on my computer but not on other's.<br />
<br />
I didn't have any other ideas because effectively after Jan 28 patch I was also exiting to desktop, then fixed something, then it worked again so I thought that was it.<br />
<br />
I'll post an updated download soon, after I try your fix with the latest patch (a bunch of XML files changed).<br />
<br />
Thanks again, you Rox!<br />
<br />
faB<br />
<br />
PS: This is once again, sorry to say, a very stupid coding on the part of Verant, like &quot;oh we can't load that mp3 file, well instead of just ignoring it, let's exit to the desktop and annoy everyone&quot;. Sheesh.<br />
<br />
I mean, look at it this way: you play EQ, listen to some mp3's you downloaded, leave EQ, delete the mp3's to free up space or cause you have burned them on a CD, and run EQ again, and BOOOM.<br />
So unfortunately this may happen again, but thanks to your help we'll know where to look.</div></div><hr />

sorry for the lack of updates, <br />
<br />
I'm pretty much done with this UI, to tell the truth. I'm not exactly extremely busy so I figured I could keep it working after patches, since fixing the xml files is easy enough..  but judging by the feedback I have recived since putting it into beta I assumed there was not much interest to it, hence I had no interest in trying to update it since.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to post a 'fixed' version after any patches in the future, please do so. If you want to make something based on this, but including new additions, please post it in another topic as a new mod, 'based on this mod'.<br />
<br />
Now the reason I came by this board is I figured I might try the french version of EverQuest for kicks, I was always curious how they managed to translate the story and dialogues, and so I installed this free 1 month eq classic version that came with a magazine, but for some reason I can not connect to EverQuest with my dial up modem. I tried my 'english' install of EQ, that I still have on the harddrive, for testing the UI, and I also get a 'connectiin failure' rom the patcher.. so I guess it just won't work with the dial up modem (a 56k modem).<br />
<br />
That sucks, I figured, I might as well fix those pet health bars at least before I call it a day, but I can't even run EverQuest until my ADSL connection is restored :/   what a world heh<br />
<br />
So, thanks hkTRox for posting an update to this, maybe you can post the non mana version if you have one ? (I assume you only play caster types ? :))<br />
<br />
For those interested.. some dev. notes ahead :<br />
<br />
splitting the UI in two directories, one with mana and one with non mana was certainly not practical, but was mandatory to get the UI display properly. That was due to a limitation of the UI not allowing to open the spellgems window when you play a pure melee class.. hence creating a 'hole' in the UI when playing the pure melee class.<br />
<br />
So what Idid to make it managable was make a batch file (.BAT) that copies over the files from the classic-mana directory to my classc directory.. this way I only edit the xml files in one directory.<br />
<br />
Only the selector window xml file I believe has the specific (small) differences betwee nthe two versions.. every other file is exactly the same in both directories.. silly isn't it ?<br />
<br />
Oh well, I'm off again now :)<br />
<br />
faB<br />
<br />
PS: hkTRox are you sure you dont  just need to open that party window ? <br />
It won't open automatically I'm afraid. The idea is you show up the party window whenever you need it by using the party window keyboard shortcut (should be ALT P).<br />
<br />
If it really doesnt show even by pressing alt + P a few times, then let me know.. maybe there is something wrong with the window's coordinates on your settings ? you may have moved it and then reduced the video resolution since and now it wont show up inside the screen ? Normally, restoring the UI files as is in the archive (your character xxx . UI if I recall ), should put all windows back into place.<br />
<br />
(technically, I liked the overlaps idea, and I spent sometime checking what was the 'default' overlap order of windows and which windows always showed up when you entered EQ, and the Party window is part of those, hence if you put it on just once whenever you leave and log back in,. it should be there. Furthermore, the overlap was done in a way that when it is on, you can not click what is behind , and thus you can not make the top window disappear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I'll look into posting an update and fixing the pet health bars in the next two weeks hopefully, that is when my ADSL is restored because I'm on dial up for now..</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing I'd suggest is prehaps checking the spell gems again - they don't seem to exactly match up with the old ones, but that's an extremely minor nit pick.  Adding the parchment/stretched canvas as the chatbox background would be awesome, too.<br />

Simply download the UI, and read the text file that comes with it.<br />

All you need to do to get it working is set your video mode to 1024x768, and then copy some UI files around.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">04-04-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey Haliken<br />
thank you,<br />
yes this would be a good addition, I personally use the keyboard shortcut but I have seen mentioned several times that people didnt find the group window.. I guess they are not used to the keyboard shortcuts and wonder where the window is<br />
<br />
sure,  I'm a bit curious in fact, because there's no real programming involved with the xml engine, only definitions, so I'm a bit curious as to what tweak you use to make the group window appear<br />
<br />
honestly I am not playing since many months now but I still enjoy working on this UI .. when I m not busy elsewhere *grin*.. so I am totally oblivious to the developments in the XML, if Verant added any functionality or fixed something in the XML engine I haven't heard about it./</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">04-04-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not an addition, I could've done it from day one. Here's how it works:<br />
<br />
Pet gauges in the group window have a screenID, this is what EQ uses to determine if they'll show up or not. move that screenID to a tabbox and that tabbox won't be visible until that group member makes a pet. That's how I make pet hp percents invisible til they make a pet.<br />
<br />
Now, this is a guess, since I haven't tested =/ sorry. But anyway, I assume screenID for group members is what makes their gauges not visible til they join. So make a tabbox with screen ID 		&lt;ScreenID&gt;Gauge1&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
<br />
and put everything in the window in it, and the group window won't appear til you have at least one member.<br />

As you can see that's the general idea for the two chat windows I use : the main one for talk and the smaller one has the 'middle' size combat messages, and a smaller font size<br />

You could also use the smallest size combat messages (just numbers If I remember well..) and make the other chat window longer</div></div><hr />

<br />
nice to see someone modding this :)<br />
<br />
your screenshot is interesting.. looks like you put the Inventory always on and to the left ? I see what you are trying to do heheh effectively the stats were there in the classic UI, however I couldnt find a practical way to 'split' the inventory window  on two sides, unless to make a huge window with empty space in the middle.. but then when it is up.. you can not click anything in the view. The problem is to switch both sides together when the inventory shows.<br />
<br />
But I think I see what you do.. a pretty good solution too : I am guessing you have the inventory stats always on, and then the slots in another window ?<br />
<br />
Here is a link to what my modded ui looks like, I'll clean up the coding in the next week or two and I'll release it. <br />
<br />
I'll be happy to test it!<br />
<br />
I was going to suggest I include yours along the 'classic' and 'classic-mana' folders in the archive, but I know I will be off for a while sometimes if not for good..   So, it's best you post it separately so you dont have to wait for me to update the archive, BUT.. whenever I come by the forum, I will update the 1st post here with a link to your version too, if that's ok ?<br />
<br />
I'll check your Group window see if I find what is this problem with people's name not appearing on zoning ? I ;m just guessing here, .. could be I'm not showing the label that comes with each gauge,. but using a separate label, for positioning.. and VI didnt implement the same behaviour for the separate labels, even though its exactly the same date.. that wouldnt surprise me.. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">04-06-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BY the way, here's an idea I had for the inventory iff you want to play with it.. I couldnt find the space to fit it into the layout I used :<br />
<br />
see, in the original UI, you ahd this space in top right with a little viewport with the camera pointin at your character.<br />
<br />
Well, for a while, I was planning to include a space like that, and have aone texture displayed in that space.<br />
<br />
Then , players would be free to edit that texture, since it  is the whoile texture, it is easy to edit, and they dont have to edit any XML, and then could have had their character 's portrait there, if you took it form a screenshot it would have looked pretty much similar to the ortiginal UI, bout you could have put anything you liked there..</div></div><hr />

Check out the 1st post, I have added a 'MODDING' section, there you can download the layouts I use, which should be very useful to work out the coordinates in the XML and modify it.</div></div><hr />

Sneak Peak:<br />

<br />
Main thing to notice is it is a window.. I have wondered whether I should stick in in the border UI as in the original 640 UI, or leaveit as a window. I have chosen the 2nd option, mostly because it is less work to adapt to a higher resolution if someone ever do this (ie 1280x1024). Secondly;, it does not cover the quickslots, being q separate window, so you could drag from the quickslots directly to the trade window (those 6 quickslots on the left side of the UI I am talking about).<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think, before it gets included in the next update.<br />
<br />
On the same spirit : should I include the TRACK window to the side UI or leave it as a separate window ?<br />

It doesnt use any new textures, it makes use of the Default UI's Note window images.<br />

I'm afraid I didnt make a nice shadow for it, or rotate it around 90 degrees, so that it 'rolls up' nicely when you minimize it, to avoid creating 4 new textures.. :/<br />
<br />
The UI textures are pretty much loaded in the graphics card ALL the playing time.. it';s not like,say, you have a dwarf model's textures that will get swapped out of your graphics card once you're not looking at that character.. (did that make sense ? :-)<br />

<br />
- fixed Group Member names not displaying if they were in a different zone<br />
- Trade Window done (player to player)<br />
- short duration buffs : they show up in the top right of the viewport, similar to old buffs<br />
- Classic Style Class Animations : this is the major fix, I have finally converted ALL the class animations so no more ugly dark gray background..<br />

<br />
You're right, those icons from the selector window dont look very good, I think when I fixed the UI after LoYkesha, I added those quickly without knowing what they were for, just to make sure it was working. I dont think I want to keep those there because not everyone wants to buy LoY.. I SO wished the Spellbook button was working in the selector window unfortunqtely it doesnt, and so I can not reproduce this from the old UI (clicking the spellbook to open it)<br />
<br />
Here s a gameplay screenie of tonight, as you can see I have moved the party window over the 'effects' window. Since Im not playing the high end  guild raids and am rarely seeing more than a handful of buffs, much of the effects window is empty..<br />
<br />
After more playing lately I found that I wasnt using the Actions window much either.. so I have thought of adding a new Tab to it which will show the same as the Group window. The group info will be in the bottom right then, leaving more space above for Player Info and Experience gauges.<br />
<br />
On to the left, I 'm thinking of redesigning a little the 6 shortcuts I have placed to make it a little more obvious.<br />
<br />
Suggestions are welcome; I just dont see any.. so I'll assume everyone who uses it thinks its just perfect ^_^<br />

<br />
The SHORT DURATION BUFF WINDOW aka the song window is invisble pretty much but you should see up to 6 song icons overlapping the top right of the viewport whenever they're on.<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate if someone can report and/or send me a screenshot of the latest update (14 april 2003) to the UI and up to 6 song buffs showing up.<br />
<br />
I need to make sure the 6 song icons actually show up I dont have any high end character to test this in a guild raid type situation where its most likely to happen.<br />
<br />
See attached pic  thats where they should show up<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping<br />

<br />
I figure you meant something along the lines of that right? Just making an extra tab or whatever.  If so that's perfect, cause I love seeing my exp bars while i'm hunting, and myself as well, hardly ever use the action window, as I have all the actions mapped to the keyboard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS  : sorry sorry I didnt check but the latest update includes a 'work in progress' spellbook, it looks broken, but is usable<br />
<br />
I', going to remove all borders of the spellbook, clicking in the middle will close it<br />
<br />
clicking the sides will flip the pages etc<br />
<br />
If someone wanna chat about the UI  I ve added my icq number to the profile in the forum<br />

<br />
You can make a macro with the following command and put it on a hotbutton :<br />
<br />
/viewport reset<br />
<br />
Then; in the keyboard options assign the F10 key as a 'secondary' key for that macro button (whichever one you have put the macro on).<br />
<br />
Now when you press F10 to toggle off the UI the viewport will also go fullscreen.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately to go back you 'll have to make another hotbutton with this command<br />
<br />
/viewport 119 0 784 608<br />
<br />
Place it on hotbutton page 2 for example and click it to restore the smaller viewport..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">04-16-2003, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spellbook has been updated. See attached picture and 1st post for download.<br />
<br />
The titlebar has been removed to make it smaller, you can click anywhere inside the book, and drag the window around.<br />
<br />
The arrows for next and previous pages appear on the borders when you move the mouse over there, but you can also use the CURSOR keys to flip the pages 5I found about those keys just today &gt;_&lt; )<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've got it nicely at 1152x864..<br />
<br />
I was planning to post a 1152 version sometime, maybe.<br />
<br />
If you wanna try the viewport would be<br />
<br />
1280 -  (119+121) =  1040<br />
1024 -  160 = 864<br />
<br />
thus<br />
<br />
/viewport 119 0 1040 864<br />
<br />
or whichever height you like for the last number depending on how tall you set the chat windows.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't seem to be a very popular UI probably because of the idea of using a viewport.. but you get used to it.<br />
<br />
In fact, I was looking into ways of making this UI better and I'm running out of ideas, I find I dont really need anything special that isn't there.<br />
<br />
I have tried starting a new UI, fullscreen with overlapping windows, and foudn it to be very confusing.. I just cant revert back to the default UI :P<br />
<br />
So.. in the meantimes I have tried switching to 1152x864<br />
<br />
You can see in attached pic (http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/1152xcvb.jpg), if yo uswitch to 1152 and move windows around you can get something like this..<br />

<br />
I have already sent this as a /feedback in the game months ago .. :(<br />
<br />
I think for ALL vviewports UI out there it would be very nice that the viewport toggles FULL screen when you press F10, so that you have fullscreen screenshots if wanted, and then pressing F10 again will revert to the /viewport settings.<br />
<br />
That'd be pretty much like the old UI behaviour I think.<br />
<br />
Why would one want to see empty borders around a reduced viewport when the UI is toggled off ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) No compass window...I worked long and hard on getting my sense heading maxed, and I like that window hehe<br />
<br />
2) Can't move new windows...I found a work around by just resizing, but I like to have seperate windows for my tells and other junk, keeps the main clear<br />
<br />
3) Even at 1024x768, the viewport is too small, I like the full screen version of the old UI becuase it let me see more around me...<br />
<br />
4) I think the autoequip area should be a touch bigger, and labeled, I had to try out spots to find it...<br />
<br />
5) Is it possible to make the hotbuttons the greyish color they were in the old one? I liked the look more than the new stuff<br />
<br />
Other than these, and prolly some others I didn't see, great UI, I loved the 'time warp' effect hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback Kyrian,<br />
<br />
1. the compass window is not 'integrated' in the UI but is there like any other window you should see it if you press alt + D a few times, you can move it over to a corner, I agree it would need to 'fit' in the UI, but I dont really like the compass window I find it annoying really unless you have maxed the skill.<br />
<br />
2. I assume you mean the chat windows ? Indeed there is no title bar and it's easy enough to drag the corners and the side to position your 2nd or 3rd chat window.<br />
<br />
Another window that is not movable while in the game is the Short Duration Window (songs).. this one should appear to overlap the top righ of the viewport and has no use to be resized<br />
<br />
3. The viewport, well, it will be better if/when I ever release a 1152 version or maybe a 1280x1024 version. In the meantime I got really used to it. Obviously if you just switched over the viewport is very apparent.. but imho with all the overlapping gone it's well worth it.<br />
<br />
A little tip: you could use the /viewport command and extend the viewport a little over and behind the UI borders, this wont make the 'window' larger, but might make things look a little larger.<br />
<br />
Another way to enlarge the viewport vertically is to reduce the height of the chat windows.. but I find the viewport is best left to a rectangular shape.<br />
<br />
4. It is not ideal, I agree. I had a few ideas for the inventory but since it has been the most intensive one to edit (eiting over hundreds of coordinates in the xml file by hand).. I have not dared try a new design yet, though I have a few ideas.<br />
<br />
5. Unlikely, I thought the current ones look kinda neat. You should use contrasting colors on the new ones, such as orange and yellow, light cyan and green work well too. But it is not out of the question, in fact it s very easy to put these in. I could probably post a modified texture file if you;re interested enough.<br />
<br />
COMING UP..<br />
<br />
There might be a UI update for the upcoming patch.. I am quite busy playing atm, and have bought LoY. I'm hoping to integrate the expanded bank and the LoY selector buttons (cartograpohy, journal ...) better in the UI.</div></div><hr />

At last VI has fixed some 'bugs' with the UI and now the percentages in the group window will not appear unless there are group members.<br />
<br />
Similarly, the target window will no longer show 0% when there is no target selected.<br />
<br />
I am attaching just the Group Window file in here, should you want to get the fix now. I have added '.txt' to be able to attach the file, so make sure you remove that extension and replace the file EQUI_GroupWindow.xml in classic/ and classic-mana/ folders.<br />

I'm sorry to hear you had to go<br />
into the hospital  :( <br />
<br />
I've been a long time user of your<br />
UI -- I just haven't been able to post<br />
to say so )<br />
took me forever to figure out that<br />
the activation code for board membership<br />
kept getting deleted by my hotmail!<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for making<br />
this UI! I almost quit EQ over them<br />
getting rid of my nice classic one, <br />
but using yours, I actually find that<br />
I enjoy EQ even more than before :D <br />
<br />
The only thing I've had to adapt to<br />
is going from 640 x 480, to 800x600 in EQ hehe )<br />
(Yeah yeah, I know -- most people keep telling<br />
me that 640x480 is WAY too small .. but it worked for me:)  )<br />
the ui is still a bit too big for 800x600, but<br />
I'm making do!<br />
<br />
I had two questions about your UI,<br />
if you have the time to reply =)<br />
<br />
1: I think I remember reading somewhere<br />
in one of your posts that you couldn't put a spellbook icon <br />
on the spells like there was originally, which makes it<br />
impossible to use the new spell sets unless you exit<br />
out of the UI and go back in. (Unless I just haven't<br />
found the way around it yet hehe)<br />
Is it possible to add it now that the spellbook icon<br />
is clicked for spell sets? <br />
(and if you *didn't* post that somewhere<br />
then I'm totally stupid -- please forgive me! lol)<br />
<br />
2: I also believe I read somewhere<br />
(and again I could be totally wrong because<br />
my memory is like a bucket with holes)<br />
that you wouldn't and/or couldn't shrink the<br />
UI down to a smaller size.<br />
<br />
is there a way for someone else to<br />
shrink it down without<br />
starting over from scratch?<br />
<br />
Please forgive both my rotten memory,<br />
and my ignorance.<br />
<br />
And Thanks for listening,<br />

<br />
For the spellbook edit the <br />
uifiles/classic-mana/EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml file<br />
<br />
search for this line and replace the coordinates as such :<br />
<br />
	&lt;!-- hide outside of window --&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;9&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;309&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
<br />
then save the file and restart EQ<br />
<br />
(the old coordinates were 40,300, which basically put the spellbook icon outside of the window and hide it)<br />
<br />
Try it, and it should show up under the last spell gem. It wont look great but it should work.<br />
<br />
As for the resolution, sorry it never was my intention to emulate the old school UI. My intention was to capture the look &amp; feel of the old UI, but use modern resolutions.<br />
<br />
Adapting this UI to higher resolutions  would take a little work, adapting it to lower resolution (i.e. completely obsolete 640x480 would need to reowrk it all).<br />
<br />
My account is closed and the UI is discontinued.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone using it may 'fix' it whenever the UI files have been affected by a new patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hkTRox</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings everyone, I made a post about editing fab’s UI months ago, shortly after making that post I was offered a full time job and started working.  My version of the UI at that time was mostly a concept drawing not much coding, since the job was priority the UI was put on the back burner along with EQ.  I still worked on it here and there when I got the chance/felt like working on it and I have made some progress since then.  Now most of my concept drawing is coded and even windows that were not in conception have been coded.  When I first said “I'll clean up the coding”  I planned on leaving a lot of fab's work the same just changin a few locations but the more I got into it the more I wanted to change. My UI is in workable form currently although the code/texture efficiency is a bit cluttered at the moment but since I have not worked on the UI like I should have I figured someone may like to use it until I clean things up a little which could be a few weeks...(months). If you guys like it I'll probably work harder to clean it up and add in some more windows that I have not done yet.  So please tell me what ya think! :)<br />
<br />
Here are a few screenshots of what the UI looks like in action.<br />

I will post fixes for both fabbe’s and my ui tonight.  Worked on them last night and this morning just not enough time to finish before work.  So anyone that is interested they will be fixed tonight with new downloads and a list of what was fixed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hkTRox</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay here are the fixes for the last few patches<br />
<br />
Fab's UI First<br />
23-Sept-2003:<br />
  - added textures so LDoN graphics would display correctly<br />
  - added LDoN windows such as Adventure Window that could not be displayed before<br />
   - repositioned the lfg button in the group window to where I think fab wanted it<br />
   - updated the way % works in the target window to the new standard<br />
    - changed a few locations of windows when you type /loadskin to what they should be<br />
    - fixed the UI_char.ini file, it was putting chat windows outside of the viewport<br />
<br />
Here is a link to download Fab's UI<br />
Classic UI beta 1.07 (http://hktrox.shackspace.com/Eqfilez/classic-ui-beta-07.zip) <br />
<br />
Now My UI<br />
23-Sept-2003:<br />
   - All LDoN windows will display now and graphics will look like they should<br />
   - Percentages have been fixed in all windows and will only appear when group members join or targets are selected.<br />
<br />
Here is a Link to My UI<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laukai</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the latest update, but there is 1 significant problem I am finding with this.  Every time I target something new, my target window comes to the top and blocks out my group window.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to prevent this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hkTRox</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay the quick fix for this will be to disable the new way eq does percentages to the old way.  What that will do is leave the 0% in the target window all the time but it won’t put the group window behind the target window, which could get very annoying.  The other way is to put the group window in another location or maybe to work out a solution by editing all the background coding and textures but having the target window look exactly the same to the user.  With the “quick fix” changes, eq will now display a warning that is a little annoying but it only happens when you load the ui so it won’t be like the disappearing group window.  Here is the warning you will see “Your XML files are not compatible with current Everquest files, certain windows may not perform correctly.  Use “/loadskin Default 1” to load the Everquest default skin.”  Thanks for the feedback Laukai  :)  Here is the target window fix, I tested it and it works great!<br />
<br />
Just download the file like you normally would then unzip it to your classic-mana folder when it asks click yes to overwrite your old EQUI_TargetWindow.xml file.</div></div><hr />

Just passing by as I received an email about the UI, last time I checked here I thought the thread had disappeared :P<br />

Thanks hkTRox for updating the classic UI along with your modification. I have copied the link to the updates you did on the first post. If there's any way for you to take over the thread and edit the 1st post, let me know. My email is oukoulele at yahoo . fr.<br />

I am looking for the inclusion of the new feature that lets you save your spell line up for quick memorization. I am looking for an update for this for the original classic UI done by FaB which you were kind enough to update. If you could include a small (as small as possible) little button or icon that could work as a spellbook icon that can be right clicked to save spell line ups I would be very happy. Hopefully it can be added somewhere that doesn't ruin the design. I think there would be room on the current spell bar if it was very small but I don't know any XML so I'm not sure how it works or if it will work at all.<br />
