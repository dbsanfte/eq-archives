Input  &quot;4098&quot; for the vendor ID<br />
Input &quot;20040&quot; for the hardware ID<br />
DO NOT check anything!<br />
<br />
This will tell EQ that you have a Radeon 9800 card and you should now have the ring.<br />
Since you are not forcing software TNL there are no artifacts.<br />
This worked for me. It's not my idea btw, I found this over on the SOE tech forum.<br />
Good luck,<br />

<br />
I think the 9500 is supposed to work as is.<br />
Do you have these lines in your eqclient.ini file:<br />
<br />
UseTNL=1<br />
Show3dTargetIndicator=1<br />
<br />
If not add them.<br />
Have you copied these two files from your default ui folder:<br />
<br />
TargetIndicator.ini<br />
TargetIndicator.tga<br />
<br />
If not add them.<br />
Do you have 3D target ring turned on in the in-game options window?<br />
If you've done all the above and still no ring...then try the same values as in my original post. Shouldn't make any difference really, will just report the wrong video card.<br />

 <br />
<br />
Not a stupid question at all.<br />
<br />
EXE : eqgame.exe<br />
PRE-RUN EXE : everquest.exe<br />
<br />
In both cases you need the full path to the files so browse to the file location<br />
All other boxes are blank and nothing is checked off.<br />
Good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jamiya</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant the EXE, DLL, and PRE-EXE fields that you have to fill out.  I used EXE = eqgame.exe, let the DLL path be the Everquest folder, and PRE-EXE = Everquest.exe.  Hopefully that was correct.<br />

***edit:  It seems to have worked.  Thanks all. ***</div></div><hr />

I've used the 3D analyzer, made sure the scripting was right, ran the test server, etc etc etc...  Although my graphics do look a bit better now.. I still have no rings.. This is becoming an obsession cause I can't get them to work.... hehe<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions I can try, short of replacing my vidcard (which I may be doing at the end of the month anyway)....</div></div><hr />

If your card is not listed Sony says that you won't be able to see the ring...sorry.<br />

NVIDIA GeForce MX 440<br />
<br />
well, actually, the ring is showing, but it's TOTALLY not where it's supposed to be.  It's way the hell on the wrong plane what seems to be on the Y axes, instead of Z.  <br />
<br />
There have been several reports of this happening.  Sony hasn't posted anything about it and personally, I'm getting quite fed up with their seemingly lack of interest in helping their customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rathsrants</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is something funny, I use the GeForce FX 5900. I dumped my custom UI turned on 3d targeting. Did not work. I copied over the files in my default directory, zoned and targetting worked. I reloaded my UI and all was fixed. I logged out during the login process the patcher overwrote the files I had changed and now it don't work again. Could it be something with there settings...<br />
<br />
The other thing is the targeting works on some characters and not others, go figure...</div></div><hr />

:( Then they should make it compatible. It's not like there is a monoploy of video cards for cryin' out loud..:mad:<br />
<br />
Guess I'll just have to continue as I've been doing and watch for the blinking name during raids - that's about the only time I'd need it anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sariis</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, after using the software previously quoted I now get the ring, but I have a new problem....When another character, wall or mob gets close to me the whole screen starts to break up. How do I de-activate the software and go back to my normal card settings.<br />
<br />
Also according to the previous posts, my card is supported by SOE so why doesnt it work by default<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arimus</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">on a short term basis, all you have to do is type &quot;/indicator off&quot; to get your video card to stop doing the freak-out thing.  happned to me when I forced video card to display the target ring too.<br />
<br />
In your main EQ directory, there are a couple of files that are installed by the &quot;other&quot; software... (forget names) but you have to delete those to fully uninstall said piece of software.</div></div><hr />
