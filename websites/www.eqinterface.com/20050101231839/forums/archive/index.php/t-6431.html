<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monty</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
   I'm posting this from work, so I can't post the exact line from my UIerrors.txt (Although I know the error off by heart. :) ).<br />
<br />
I've had a search through the help section, and there's a coupla fixes present for my problem (although again, like I mentioned, I'm at work, so I can't test them). First, the problem:<br />
<br />
I downloaded the TKing G2 Spellbar, and proceeded to put it in one of my characters skins. When I load that certain skin, it refuses to load, throwing me back to the default skin. When I look at the UIerrors.txt, the last line contains this:<br />
<br />
[Line:10 Source:UIFiles\necro\EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml] Schema error - Duplicate item TKingspellbar.tga<br />
<br />
If I replace the above XML file, and the tga with the backed up XML file and the previous TKing spellbar (The circular V1 one, the name escapes me at the moment), everything works fine again.<br />
<br />
Ok, now, my understanding of the other threads:<br />
<br />
From reading them, I'm assuming that there's a duplicate schema/include (sorry, I'm not familiar with XML.....yet) in the EQUI_animation.xml file (I'd sorta figured this out, since the only other place that contained a ref to the above tga file was in EQUI-Animation.xml). I also understand that I gotta remove said duplicate call from EQUI_Animation.xml(?).<br />
<br />
What I need to know is which bit of code am I looking for to delete, is it in the EQUI_Animation.xml file, or in the EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml file?<br />
<br />
Also, if I delete the reference out of EQUI_Animation.xml/EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml, won't that remove the small animation of the spellbook that TKing/Remelio coded into the bar?<br />
<br />
Oh, and while I remember, there was also the thread which just renamed the tga file in the EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml file, and, I'm assuming copied the orginal TKingSpellbar.tga to a name that reflected the change made within EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml.<br />
<br />
Sorry to have created such a long post, but I'm just trying to understand what I'm about to do, so that I know what to do in the future if something similar happens. :D<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
Cheerie,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">[Line:10 Source:UIFiles\necro\EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml] Schema error - Duplicate item TKingspellbar.tga<br />
<br />
Translation:<br />
On Line 10 of the EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml, the item: Tkingspellbar.tga, is being defined (most likely as a new texture) and has already been defined either in another file (EQUI_Animations.xml perhaps) or just before this entry and Should not be defined a second time so like a tempermental UI, I will now close down.<br />
<br />
Suggestion: <br />
  1)  Make a backup of the file.<br />
  2)  Open the file and locate Line TEN.  If it is within a definition (TEXTURE) delete the whole section &lt;Texture&gt; thru to &lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
  3)  Save  it and load EQ again.<br />
  4)  Check for other errors if they come about.</div></div><hr />
