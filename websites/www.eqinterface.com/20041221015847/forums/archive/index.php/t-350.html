<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">comtesse</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i ended up working on it to fit, this onto the smaller res screen and what i did was drop the pet menu and actions menu from the screen, i never keep them on any how as i dont play a caster, and put them back to the default windows, for the most part this all went in effect with the exception of the buff window wich didnt show,<br />
<br />
heres what i did, after downloading the and extracting into the file quarts dir i made a copy of the default skin and called it quarts2<br />
<br />
then copied the small buff window the streamlined spell book and small tracking window for non rangers, then i went in to the quarts directory and copied all the graphic files into the quarts directory, after this i went into eq and changed the skin to verify that it was all working<br />
<br />
after this worked i copied the xml files 1 by one skiping the buff, tracking, spell book, pet info and actions files, verifying that it worked after each file was copied, <br />
<br />
once i did this i went in and moved the windows to thier locations by hand and set the fade/normal levels to 100% and locked the windows in,  then i set viewport  0 1024 491 <br />
and presto it all fits in fine<br />
<br />
hope this information helps</div></div><hr />
