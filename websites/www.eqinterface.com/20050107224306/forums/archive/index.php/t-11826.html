<br />
I'm looking for a UI that looks Dwarven in the style.  I've seen some very good Ranger/Druid/Elven type UI's that were beautiful and know a Dwarven equal would be popular.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to do what I can to help, though my knowledge of XML is limited only to tweaking other's work to suit my own needs. I am not good with graphics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you post some images of the type of style you're thinking. anything will do, maybe a fav picture you have from a book or online, whatever.  I'd be more than willing to try as long as i had a vision of a &quot;Dwarven Style&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wenjii</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you thank you thank you!!<br />
<br />
I am scouring the net for links to post here to give you some good ideas of a Dwarven style.<br />
<br />
Basic thoughts for the look: The UI might have a background look of worked stone. Hammers, Axes, Dwarven Helm type graphics could be a good fit as long as there was room without it being too intrusive on the game.<br />
<br />
Here is a website dedicated to Dwarves that has some pictures of Dwarves but not too much Dwarven architecture. I'm looking for something on the web to link. Their architecture is derived from Norse architecture. www.delving.com<br />
<br />
Tolkein's work is the best reference for what I am thinking, and Jackson's vision in the movies was a good representation. Let me continue to dig for more graphics and links.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for considering this =)</div></div><hr />

If you brought the same ideas with a Dwarven look it seems like that would work very nicely. <br />
<br />
Thank you again for considering this as a project. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.</div></div><hr />

When i get some elements I like put together i'll give you screenshot to see if thats the right direction.</div></div><hr />
