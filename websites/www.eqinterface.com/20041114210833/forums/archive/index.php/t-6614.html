<br />
11 May 03 - Patch for the upcoming SOE patch on 14 May.  Can go ahead and install now, won't break anything.  Can be found here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8407).<br />
<br />
24 Feb 03 - t.king has released the updated inventories that are totally compliant with today's patch.  You'll want to update.  They can be found here (http://pub165.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=218.topic).<br />
<br />
19 Feb 03 - Patch for the Release of LoY on 24 Feb, can be found here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6802).  Please be sure to READ the comments on that post.<br />
<br />
15 Feb 03 - Please note that t.king has released his updated Inventory with the Charm slot.  You need to get this file and add it to your custom directory, overwriting the existing files.  It can be found here (http://pub165.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=218.topic).<br />
<br />
14 Feb 03 - Updated to have &quot;Unclickable&quot; windows. Also tweaked the player window options in 1280x1024 reso.<br />
<br />
12 Feb 03 - Updated original skin to Version 2<br />
<br />
Resolutions 800x600, 1024x768 and 1280x1024 are all supported.<br />
<br />
READ THE README FILE for details on how to install this skin.  Instructions for changing the class animation as well as instructions for updating your files if you are already using the original version of this skin are all included in the README file.<br />
<br />
Inventory is included, but spell book, spell cast bar, gem icons and spell icons are *not* included.  Please note, however, that the Inventory included is a temporary one until t.king and Remmy release their updated one with the new charm slot.  So, watch for an update to this skin.<br />
<br />
Credits to t.king and Remelio for the original graphics and most of the coding.  I just tore things apart and put them back together again.  Credit to Xymarra for her Highlight Compass that I’ve included, as well as to Vertebrae and Sokol for a bit of code I borrowed.<br />
<br />
Feedback welcome.  <br />
<br />
(PS. No, that is not an Auto-Equip on the main screen, just the words were on the graphic I included, as can also be seen in the Inventory.)<br />
<br />
Now for the good stuff.  Screenshots:<br />
<br />

As always, click screenshot for fullsized view<br />
<br />
And in the hopes that it may explain the Choices folder a bit better, here are screenshots of the various choices found within it.  You must choose one each of the player, group and pet windows:<br />

Hey sorry to ask for a lil o change for me but i love the UI and use it / Praise it all the time,  but i have a small request.<br />
<br />
is there any way you can move th Target bar to the piece of the border that is just above the chat windows and group window?<br />
<br />
and perhaps make it a lil larger ( i have bad eyes) make the bar longer / % of hp larger  / name of mob larger . ?<br />
<br />
(on the piece labled  Group with healer spheres   1024x768)<br />
plz<br />
 <br />
<br />
thanx.  <br />
<br />
Hey Cairen do you still post on this anymore ?  are you able to pull of this request ? just hopen to read a reply  so i know one way or the other , i check daily</div></div><hr />

This is ONLY with the group window with health spheres and in 1280x1024 resolution.<br />
Also, and I don't know if this is related but i couldn't change to any other resolution in-game.<br />
Error file is normal.<br />
Any ideas Cairenn?<br />
Thanks,<br />

That's rather odd.  I'll look into it first chance I get.<br />
<br />
cyrus1469 - Yeah, I'm still here, just life keeping me busy.  I'll look into this, the &quot;problem&quot; is that in 800x600, there is no space on the pet&amp;healerhelper to add a target bar.  The rest of the bars, and the rest of the resolutions, there is space, but I've been trying to keep the entire thing &quot;uniform&quot;, so that no matter what resolution you are running at, it all looks the same.  I'll see what I can do.</div></div><hr />

Cairenn,<br />
It's got something to do with the position of the LFG button at 1280x1024. I tried moving the button to the left side of the group window and the button works fine, but over near the intended position it doesn't work :(. I settled on an x position of 400.<br />

I'm just having troubles downloading this UI file. When I try to open the file to view the read me file, it says &quot;Compressed (zipped) folder is invalid or corrupt. Is this some sort of bug or do I need to change some settings in order to get it to open?<br />
<br />
And what does it mean by changing your .ini files &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;pet&quot;?Where do I find those .ini files?<br />
<br />
My apolgies for the questions, I am just new to this computer download/file transfer thing and this is my first UI download. Been on default UI since it came out, and just want something different and fitting for my paladin character! =)  Fantastic job on the UI though, it's by far my favorite that I have seen! =)<br />

Is anyone else having these problems? It all has to do I think with the problem downloading the file, being corrupt according to my comp. I hope you can help, I'm looking forward to using this UI! =)<br />

I know you're busy... but was wondering if you'd been working on anything new in the past few weeks?  I love your work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the &quot;servernumber&quot; part of the .ini file, and could not knowing/having this be the reason that it's not looking right on my screen?  If so, where can I stumble over a list of servers and their corresponding numbers?<br />
<br />
Thanks, and great job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In your main EQ directory, there is a (list of) file that says:<br />
<br />
UI_CharacterName_Server#.ini<br />
<br />
for example, mine is:<br />
<br />
UI_Cairenn_70.ini<br />
<br />
Find what yours is, rename the one I gave you to match it, then move mine up to your main EQ directory.  It will ask if you want to overwrite it.  Say yes.<br />
<br />
And yeah, that would be why it isn't looking right on your screen.</div></div><hr />

I still get the incompatability message when I try to load it.<br />

Just wondering if there was a way to make the MP3 window at the top of the screen stay sticky, as it gets kind of repetitive to hit Alt-K after each zone... if not it's no biggy, just something that would make things easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should stay open.  Mine does. :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the things I liked about it from the screenshot is the spellbar/gembar that you have which has the icons on the left numbered 1 through 8 and they look nice and match the border. They also have the text name of each spell next to it.<br />
<br />
How would I go about finding that and adding it to the UI?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much<br />

<br />
I managed to add the spellbook, and the cool gem/spellbar (g2) with text.<br />
<br />
Everything is great. I just want to be able to have a casting bar. If I have music on I can't tell I am casting. I know it shows over the manabar (i would like to keep that too), but I sometimes forget to look there.<br />

Sure, no reason why you can't.  You may have to go into the new one you add, and change the name from &quot;casting_gauge&quot; to something else, but other than that ...  <br />
<br />
So. the Arcane casting gauge for example comes with its own EQUI_CastingWindow.xml<br />
<br />
<br />
So I should copy that file over your EQUI_CastingWindow.xml included with the UI. or copy it into your file?<br />
<br />
I already renamed all the casting_gague to casting_gaugeArcane in the EQUI_CastingWindow.xml that came with the guage, but I have not overwritten your file.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much and sorry to take up so much of your time for my problems.<br />
<br />
You really have done an awesome job. I _LOVE_ this skin.<br />
<br />
It is so awesome AND beautiful. Plus it has easy access to everything without opening up other windows much.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work and thank you.<br />

If it causes problems, let me know and I'll see if I can figure out why it is (although it shouldn't).  Glad to help, and glad you like it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasus</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I installed the arcane casting right over the ui without changing any names or anything.. Just dropped the files in and bingo it worked.  Think it starts out in the upper left corner or so and takes some time to move it where u want it (i wanted it by my spell bar) but it is movable with the mouse..<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kithal</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just started using this UI today and I like it so far. I do have one request if it possible as my main is a caster. I personally and I am sure there are prolly a few others out there that do not use the /mp3 window. I would like to suggest, instead of the Mp3 window lining the top, there be an option for a Spell bar instead?<br />
<br />
Also, I noticed that the Spellbook is using the default spellbook, but when I tried to add another spell book, it whacked out the UI. Any idea why?.. it could be the Spell Book that I was trying to use, but not sure.. I plan on trying some others that I like as well. Thanks..<br />

BTW Great Work!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mizazureth</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all... just wanted to say that this is one of the classiest UI's I have ever seen.  However, with my bad eyesight, it is so hard for me to see alot of stuff, being that it is so small, and being that it shrinks the main window view space, so I will have to switch to something else.. /pout.<br />
     That being said, I am having a really really hard time restoring stuff to default.  Cairenn under your post about &quot;when all else fails&quot; I did exactly like you said and typed in default in both areas.  However the problem that I am having is that the window view space is staying the smaller size.. with a black border running all around it.  When I loadskin default, the blackness stays and it just adds in the default spellgems, windows, etc.  I am not computer or tech savvy at all so I am pretty much at the end of my rope trying to fix it lol.  I will copy and paste my errors for you below.  However I am not sure how useful they will be, being as I have downloaded a couple of different UI's before I found yours, and I am not sure how all this stuff works anyways.<br />
     Any suggestions from you or from anyone else (I know you are busy busy ;) ) on how to return my viewing area back to full screen again would be soooooo appreciated!!<br />

As for the error log, if that is after running mine, you are missing the two patches I released for it.  Snag them and you'll be gtg (links can be found on the first post of this thread).<br />
<br />
If they are after someone else's, you will need to find (or do yourself) the updates for LoY and 14 May patches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been using the UI happily and think it is so awesome. I even took some screen shots and showed it to some friends who are now using it. It really is nice.<br />
<br />
One thing I noted though, is that after the last patch my bottom border disappeared. I dunno where it went. I unlocked most of the windows and bars to move them around and see if it was hidden behind them for some reason. Alas, it is not there. Odd. Hehe. I had to put the windows all back together after not finding the bottom border. That was a challenge to line them all up properly again.<br />
<br />
If you know how to find the bottom border please let me know!<br />
<br />
Thanks and keep up the awesome work.<br />

<br />
Also. Depending on if you went with pet bottom left or group bottom left it will be either Alt-F1 (pet) to turn it on and off, or Alt-P (group/party) to turn it on and off.<br />

Hope this helps!<br />

Unfortunately the UI will not load properly, it says the XML files are not compatiable and I'm a dunce when it comes to that sort of editing. <br />
<br />
Are you going to issue a patch update for your UI, or details on what to change so we can make the proper adjustments? &lt;crosses fingers&gt; I feel naked without your UI, lol I absolutely love it... not having it feels so alien to me!!!<br />

<br />
Those are your errors, and they are because you have added a customized bank window to your UI which is no longer current due to the changes in today's patch.  There was no custom bank mod in my skin.  Options for you are:<br />
<br />
a) Wait for the author of your custom bank mod to release an update;<br />
b) Delete your custom bank mod from your custom UI folder and just use the default one;<br />
c) Find a new custom bank mod that is current with the changes (fyi, mine were released yesterday); or<br />
d) go to the Patch Fixes forum and make the appropriate changes yourself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qualtar Shylok</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great UI!<br />
<br />
Just wanted to ask a few questions.<br />
<br />
First off, what does this UIerror.txt mean? and how do I fix it?<br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 30 05:44:20 2003] Error: Could not find child HPLabel1 in window GroupWindow<br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 30 05:44:20 2003] Error: Could not find child HPPercLabel1 in window GroupWindow<br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 30 05:44:20 2003] Error: Could not find child HPLabel2 in window GroupWindow<br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 30 05:44:20 2003] Error: Could not find child HPPercLabel2 in window GroupWindow<br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 30 05:44:20 2003] Error: Could not find child HPLabel3 in window GroupWindow<br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 30 05:44:20 2003] Error: Could not find child HPPercLabel3 in window GroupWindow<br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 30 05:44:20 2003] Error: Could not find child HPLabel4 in window GroupWindow<br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 30 05:44:20 2003] Error: Could not find child HPPercLabel4 in window GroupWindow<br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 30 05:44:20 2003] Error: Could not find child HPLabel5 in window GroupWindow<br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 30 05:44:20 2003] Error: Could not find child HPPercLabel5 in window GroupWindow<br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 30 05:44:20 2003] Error: Could not find child HPPercLabel in window TargetWindow<br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 30 05:44:20 2003] Error: Could not find child HPLabel in window TargetWindow<br />
<br />
Secondly... is it possible to change the hotbox window to the bottom left corner, rather than the bottom right corner, so that it corresponds with eye/hand coordination?<br />
<br />
Also, I agree with a few of the posters that the target box needs to be separated out of the group window and enlarged... its very difficult to distinguish a players health from mob health with it in there and adds to some confusion.<br />
<br />
Even though, this is still the best UI out there, and your commended for a job well done.  Would be nice to see some of these suggestions come to fruition in the near future.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The errors you are experiencing are due to not snagging the patch I released when those changes went into game.  Go to the first post in this thread for the link to the patch.<br />
<br />
As for the various comments, suggestions and requests made, I will be looking into all of them after I get home from my vacation.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the kind words from all, nice to know that others like this UI as well. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damlyn</div><div class="date">08-03-2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I've gotten every part of this UI to work except the MP3 player... not that I use it, but the XP and Alt xp bar are on that part of the UI, so I kinda want it.  The file is there, but nothing is poping up.  <br />
<br />
I see the red text for the error, but I'm not sure where I can find the explaination you keep asking for from people.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help ahead of time</div></div><hr />

You need to get the LoY and the 14 May updates that I released.  Links for them are on the first post of this thread.<br />
<br />
To check whether sounds are enabled in game, alt-o is the command.  Also make sure that you don't have a nosound.txt file in your main eq directory.</div></div><hr />

~ I don't have the nosound.txt in my EQ directory.<br />
~ The only sound related things in Options on my screen are:  Sound Realism, Music Volume, Sound Volume.  There are no other options.<br />
~ I downloaded both your Feb 24 and May 11 patches<br />
<br />
I was able to get the rest of the buttons to work, but the MP3 Player is still not there... And here's another list of errors &gt;.&lt;<br />

Right now this UI works like a charm for me...but if I try to put in the 2 patches mentioned above...no UI... *shrug*<br />
<br />
I can deal with using key shortcuts to open windows added with LoY...that's all I can see that would be 'patched' from these patches.<br />
<br />
If I'm wrong and I'm missing something spectacular plz let me know...of course then I'm going to need to figure out how to install the patches so the UI WILL work.<br />

It seems that everything (combat spam and regular spam) is appearing in the left window, with nothing appearing at all in the right one.  I'd love to have chat spam and combat spam in separate windows =(<br />
<br />
I followed the directions exactly, changed the icons around, put a new spellbook in, new casting window, etc... didn't touch the chat windows.  Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyndylla</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, sounds like you just need to make a new chat window and filter what you want to it. :) <br />
Here's how you do that. Right click the top bar of your original chat window. Select &quot;New Chat Window&quot;. Now right click the top bar of the new chat window. Scroll down to &quot;Filters&quot;, and you will get alot of options of stuff to filter out. I've got Melee in a different window, as I want to see what songs are playing for me. :D<br />
Filter has always worked on mine, and I've got the Drakah chat windows mod, that matches this UI very nicely.;)</div></div><hr />

I went through and did the modifications you had listed under the patch fix section of the message board, but unfortunately in doing the mods to the BigBankWindow somehow something has gone way wrong and my bank window only shows 1 shared bank slot and the actual window graphic is skewed. Any suggestions and help would be nice. I went ahead and posted my UIErrors. <br />

An option for you would be to go snag my updated BigBank mod. ;)</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if it's a problem with the custom UI since it's in one of the default files, or if it's because I didn't purchase LDoN. UI worked fine up until this last patch. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Kookie3 - in your main EQ directory, you will find some files that show CharName_Server#.ini and UI_CharName_Server#.ini.  That's your server number.</div></div><hr />

I've been using your UI for a long time now and thoroughly enjoy it. I am having problems figuring out how to implement the patch fixes though. If this is the wrong forum I apologise but, I really want to keep using your UI and I just can't figure out where to find the files using notepad. I have used the find in the notepad  and it says can't find the file. Yet, when I use my regular search I can find them. Any help would be great.<br />

It's me again! I'm still only using your UI and I went through the patch today and checked this site for patch updates as well, but no matter what my UI will not load at all on any character. I'll post my UIErrors.txt for you below in hopes you can find the problem.<br />

I still feel naked without the UI! =P<br />

You now have a custom EQUI_Animations.xml file.  Make the changes to it as outlined in the Patch Fixes forum, and you should be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot get the UI to work like it should.<br />
All patches and fixes are done, but i cannot seem to get:<br />
- the group/self/target box ;<br />
- the bottom left corner ;<br />
- the upper bar (music player).<br />
<br />
Left (stats) and right hand (inventory + hotbutton) bars are working, bottom bar (the 5 mm height one) is also working.<br />
<br />
i have been trying various resolutions and various setups (with and without pets, healer spheres yes and no) --- all to no avail.<br />
<br />
<br />
Could ye (or anyone who mighty know a solution) give me a hand please ?<br />
<br />
<br />
