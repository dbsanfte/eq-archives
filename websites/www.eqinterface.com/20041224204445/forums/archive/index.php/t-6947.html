<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mutley</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I left off the new LFG button on the Group window since it was in the way and can be hotkeyed.  Go into Options, Keyboard, UI, and set a hotkey for it.  I used Alt-L. <br />
<br />
In the Inventory window, I left off Face since we have /facepick to use in game as always, and it's hardly ever used.  No reason to really have it there.  The other new button for Dye is there only because there doesn't seem to be a way to assign a hotkey to bring that window up.<br />
<br />
I won't give in and make the inventory window bigger :p.<br />
<br />
Post if there's any problems, but I've been using it and all seems fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mutley</div><div class="date">03-01-2003, 11:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found that the in game command of /bodytint brings up the Dye window, so I made another Inventory window with only the Skills button on it as it used to be.   I like the bigger grabby space under the Skills button. <br />
<br />
I also finally redid the graphic for the charm slot so it now matches the other inventory slots.  This zip file only contains the new graphic and the EQUI_Animations.xml file to correct the charm slot graphic, it is not the entire patch fix.  Just let these overwrite older copies of both files from the post above.</div></div><hr />
