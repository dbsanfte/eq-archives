New server is being tested, with some seriously different rules.  This could be a VERY interesting server to play on (especially with the death rules)<br />
<br />
From EQLive:<br />
<br />
Help us Test &quot;The Fallen&quot;<br />
Please help us with testing the new server rule-set for &quot;The Fallen&quot;.  If you would like to help test this exciting new concept, please patch to EverQuest using Testeverquest.exe, which you can find in your Everquest directory.  Once patched, select &quot;The Fallen&quot; from the server directory and you are in.  Here is the proposed rule-set for this server;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
-         Any character that is slain for any reason what so ever will be reset and placed back into newbie status.  Characters will not be restored or resurrected for ANY reason what so ever.  Once you're dead, you're dead.<br />
<br />
-         Each account will only be allowed one character on this server.  Any PvP death results in the killing player obtaining a number of points based on the levels of the characters involved.  Players can only gain points from characters that are within 5 levels of them.<br />
<br />
-        You may loot all tradeable items from the corpse of the character you just killed, all other equipment is destroyed with the character.<br />
<br />
-        The server will make use of the Firiona Vie no drop rules (few things will be No-Drop)<br />
<br />
-          The server will have the old world (Antonica, Faydwer, Odus) plus the Legacy of Ykesha expansion ,  and will only allow characters to reach level 50 with no AA.<br />
<br />
-        The server will have a doubled experience modifier to facilitate faster paced gameplay. <br />
<br />
-         Players will not be able to turn on /anonymous or /roleplay to hide their current location.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Help us out and let us know what you think.  You can use the Submit Comment link on the Dev Corner to send us your feedback and ideas.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help and I hope you enjoy &quot;The Fallen&quot;<br />

<br />
It would be interesting if they could adopt some kind of guild and player tracking like DAoC uses for kill and such.  Then us pussy blue server players could live vicariously through our favaorite gladiator, so to speak.<br />
<br />
If this server goes live I might log on and see what it is like.  I'd like to at least see what the experience modifier is like.</div></div><hr />
