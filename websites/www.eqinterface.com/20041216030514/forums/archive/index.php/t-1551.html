This is an actual transcript of a conversation of a US naval ship off the coast of New Foundland released 10-10-95 by the chief of naval operations.....<br />
<br />
Canadians: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the south to aviod a collision.<br />
<br />
Americans: Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to the north to aviod colission.<br />
<br />
Canadians: Negative. You will divert your course to 15 degrees to the south to aviod collision.<br />
<br />
Americans: This is the captain of a US Navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course.<br />
<br />
Canadians: No, i say again, divert YOUR course.<br />
<br />
Americans: This is the Aircraft Carrier US Lincoln, the second largest ship in the United States Atlantic Fleet. We are accompanied with three destroyers, three cruisers, and numerous support vessles. I DEMAND that you change your course 15 degrees north, or counter-measures will be undertaken to ensure the safty of these ship!!<br />

Typical American reasoning and stuborness. <br />
<br />
Wait, I may be going into the navy.  HEY    (oh well)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">haha .. Funny. My step-brother's in the Navy. <br />
<br />
It's hard for me to say if that's true or not. I've seen too many posts and &quot;transcripts&quot; that claim to be true, but never are.<br />
<br />
All it takes is one sentence: &quot;This is real&quot; And too many people will believe.<br />
<br />
<br />
So .. Anybody have some background on this transcript?<br />
<br />
(I'm such a party pooper, I know. I just want to make sure it's true and then I'll gloat it all up in my step-brother's face. :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angalus</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hahahahahha thats funny, but seriously doubt its true. Im quite sure a fleet would know exactly where it was relative to land, unless Forest Gump was commanding the lincoln that day, i dont think so :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlakGard</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This story isn't true. Stories like this, colloquially called &quot;Lighthouse Tins,&quot; have circulated in the Navy for decades. Every time the story is told, there is a different ship (sometimes aircraft carriers, sometimes battleships -- the bigger the ship, the bigger the &quot;fish story&quot;). Every time the story is told, it takes place in a different area with different nationalities.<br />
<br />
The biggest &quot;noticeable&quot; flaw is that neither radio operator used the international standard for communications and directing traffic.<br />
<br />
One of these, so-called, &quot;tins&quot; stories even made it into an Issac Asimov book (_Asimov Laughs Again_, 1992) released before the 10/10/95 date that's given for its release from the US Naval Department.<br />
<br />
Isn't it enough that you burned down our Capitol once? :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pavelov</div><div class="date">09-01-2002, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The captain of an American aircraft carrier would never personally get on the radio.<br />
<br />
 Plus GPS would not allow any American naval vessel to ground itself.</div></div><hr />
