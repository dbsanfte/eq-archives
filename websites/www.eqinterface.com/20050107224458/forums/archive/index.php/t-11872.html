<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darmas</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first attempt at mixing interfaces, and I'm having at least one problem.  I'm trying to mod the default UI one item at a time, so as not to create any conflicts.  Here's what I have done:<br />
<br />
I created a new folder in my EQ UI folder and unzipped a custom player info window to that folder.  Loaded EQ under the default UI, and then swapped over to the trial folder.  This worked fine.  I had the entire default UI with the exception of my custom player info portion.  So, then I added a custom group window.  Same result, everything worked fine.  So at this point, I have a trial folder with nothing inside but my unzipped custom player info and group info windows, and EQ was using the default for everything else.  Now came the problem.<br />
<br />
I unzipped a custom buff window to the trial folder, and loaded up EQ under the default UI, but when I switched to my modified folder this time, I crashed to desktop with the error message asking if I would like to send info on the crash to SOE.  So, my assumption was I simply had a bad/problematic buff window mod.  So, to ensure I was not getting any error from the other 2 mods I had put into the folder, I deleted everything from my trial folder, unzipped the buff window mod only, and loaded up EQ under the default.  When I tried to load up the trial mod, it crashed again.  So, I downloaded another buff window mod, same result.  Another 2 buff window mods, same result.<br />
<br />
I prefer my buffs going horizontal across the top of my screen with the buff names underneath, so I tried 3 different mods that were this way.  Then I tried another one that was in the standard, horizontal sqare, and none are working for me.<br />
<br />
I read through the FAQ here, and searched the forums, finding a couple that told me info I already knew:<br />

Any help at all would be great.  I'm on vacation for a bit and would like to figure this one out while I have time.<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />
