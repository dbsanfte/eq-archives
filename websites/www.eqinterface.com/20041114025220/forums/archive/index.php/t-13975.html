<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qualtar</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes... if you are using my original UI (QualtarUI -Drak/TK) and have added the new QualtarUI Playerwindow Extreme, you will also need to download the QualtarUI Hotbuttonwindow-WoW to make it compatable.  You can get that file HERE (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3373) <br />
<br />
The QualtarUI Playerwindow Extreme will only be compatable as a stand alone playerwindow *IF* you do not have any of the features shown in another window... if you do, it will cause the interface to default to the standard UI.<br />
<br />
If that does not fix it, please post your UIErrors.txt last lines and I will tell you how to fix it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info on the Readme file, I will make sure I update it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qualtar</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I have been thinking of modifying the actions box as it makes for a very good window with its multiple tabs and its concise size.... will add to list of things to tinker with.<br />
<br />
As far as the hits/miss boxes go... they are quite simple, that require you to modify your windows in game.<br />
<br />
Simply right click on the scroll bar of the window in which you want specific hits/misses to display. i.e yours, others, or you being hit (see first post proposed pic for example), then select filter melee &gt; your hits, others, or being hit.  You can then filter it to show the number only by using the same method.  Make sure you have all !hits and misses on, by looking at your options file (can access by clicking on the selector bar, or by pressing ALT +O)</div></div><hr />

Target's target is a Leadership skill for those who are GoD enabled.  The group leader MUST have this skill for it to function.<br />

I am working on making the target window blink when in auto attack mode.<br />

The blue bubble bar is the old breathing window for when you are in zones/water that require you to have some sort of breathing apparatus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To change the chat window backgrounds there are two files you need to replace in the UI.  First, find a UI whose chat window backgrounds you like and copy the files in that UI named, &quot;wnd_bg_dark_rock&quot; and &quot;wnd_bg_light_rock&quot; to the UI folder in which this UI is named and that will change the background of your chat windows.<br />
<br />
There is nothing else needed to do within the EQUI files.<br />
<br />
Your other options.... which may be easier, is to just change the color of your text.. this can be done in game, by using the options menu (ALT+O) and pressing the &quot;Colors&quot; tab.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can do it, but the reason I have not is because it is already part of the complete UI on the hotbuttons bar.  So it keeps the repetitiveness from displaying the same information more than once.<br />
<br />
I can move it down to the player window if there is a big demand for it.<br />
<br />
Are you using the player window as a stand alone and not with the full UI?</div></div><hr />

But my main is a beastlord.  I like the idea of integrating the pet window in the player window.  The layout looks great, but why did you move the exp bars to the inv window and put all the stats onto the player window?  Did you remove them from the hotbar?  I've always been particular in making sure I had my exp bars always visible on the screen.  Does that also mean your getting rid of the large AA exp bar that runs across the top of the hotbar as well?<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm trying to say is I think just adding the pet window to the original player window would work best in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nautilus</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nevermind with the questions.  I saw the new look at the top of the first page.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like, put the exp bars on the player page, and the stats (INT, STA, PR, FR, etc) on the inventory page -- <br />
<br />
I like to watch my hp/end/mana go to work when I am tanking for groups. That said, I like to watch my exp bar move too; and switching these things around would be nice I think. Plus, I would never be on the inventory window unless I was going to click a clicky item.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts :)<br />
<br />
Edit: I play a 65 Wizard as well, and even though I'm not a pet class, I'd still suggest the same thing.</div></div><hr />

I think most people would agree that having the exp bars visible is more important than your current stats.  I personally don't use a lot of clicky items, but I know a lot of people do, so maybe putting a few of the more used inv slots for clickies in the pet window wouldn't be a bad idea.<br />
<br />
One quick question.  Having the inventory tabbed on the player window, does that remove the use of the original inventory window?  Or is that strictly being used for quick access to click items?<br />
<br />
Oh, and thank you very much for all your hard work, and for taking into consideration the opinions of others who use your UI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, your normal inventory window will not be effected by this... its just an added way to have access to your inventory without having to block the screen with a big inventory window.  I still use TKs inventory with this UI.  Looks and works fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qualtar</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well one good thing about the complete UI is that your EXP bar is always shown at the top of the hotbottons window.  Look closely at it, you will notice a blue line that goes across the top of the hotbuttons window with a numerical value in the center just under the target window... that is an AAEXP bar.  <br />
<br />
I just released a newer version of this bar (pending review by the mods), and noted (in the README file) how anyone can make it either their EXP bar or keep the default AAEXP bar by making two simple changes to the window.<br />

By having the the EXP Bar visible it will help eliminate having multiple repetitions of information on different windows, yet flexible enough to satisfy most anyone.</div></div><hr />

Good observation and I apologize but I have not been able to get the full new UI released.  There are some minor issues with the Pet/Player window that I was hoping to resolve this weekend, but I have not had the time to finish it.  Expect a release of the full UI next week.</div></div><hr />

How would I go about putting my pets health bar in place of where the Raid XP bar is?<br />

I tried to mess around with it, but I know very little about EQ-XML.  Every change I made just broke the UI.  If it's something that will take a long time to explain, then don't worry about it.  I'll just have to keep trying to figure it out.<br />

	&lt;/Gauge&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Then find:<br />
<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;PIW_PetHPGauge&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
Cut that and paste it over top of:<br />
<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;PW_RaidLeaderExpGauge&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
That should get you to see the Pet gauge vice the raid leader gauge... you will want to do the same for the numeric value of the pet vice the experience value of the raid leadership.<br />

I'll give it a shot once I find some time.  Will let you know how it works out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qualtar</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you mentioned that, I have been thinking it may be best to try to squeeze a pet bar on the front tab under the player health... I'll see if there is a way I can make that work... Should treat pets the same as others, and I suppose it would be best to see their health all the time...swapping between tabs would probably be a hassle.<br />
<br />
What I was thinkinig of doing is removing the Endurance bar for casters and replacing it with the Pet bar... can't think of any reason casters would need the endurance bar.  And was going to make a pure melee version that removes the mana bar and stats for pure melees.</div></div><hr />

Like you said casters don't need to see endurance, not even myself as a beastlord.  There is the small bar right below my health when my pet is up, but it's so small I don't pay attention to it a lot of times.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry I keep offering or suggesting alterations.  I know you do this on your free time.  Maybe I should start paying ya, lol. :)<br />
<br />
It really is a great UI man.  I'm glad you keep it up to date after every patch.  I've used numerous UI's, but had to find a new one whenever the author stopped updating.  Keep up the good work!<br />
<br />
Quick side note:  I noticed the % for mana and endurance are identical.  Meaning, when my mana % goes down, so does my endurance %.  There always identical, like there using the same information.  When there both full, and I jump for example, my endurance does not go down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll check the XML... sounds like the mana code was copied to the end code.. I would think it would crash it though if that were the case, since there would be multiple entries... could just be the EQTYPE is incorrect... gimme a bit to see.</div></div><hr />

To close any chat window you will need to modify the EQUI_ChatWindow file as follows:<br />
<br />
Open the EQUI_ChatWindow file using Wordpad or Notepad.<br />
<br />
Find:<br />
&lt;Style_Closebox&gt;false&lt;/Style_Closebox&gt;<br />
<br />
Change to:<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Closebox&gt;true&lt;/Style_Closebox&gt;<br />
<br />
Save and reload the UI... you will see the &quot;close&quot; X on each window... When you load the UI you will see why I chose not to have the close option on the Chat windows....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play a monk and an enchanter, and on the monk, the UI looks great.  But on the enchanter, whenever i have a pet, the green pet health bar that's normally on the bottom part of your hp bar, is up by the name, cutting through the class title.  I don't have a screenshot to show you, but it's just distracting enough to allow my pet to die every once in a while :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nautilus</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had that same problem.  If you download the most recent zip file, that problem will go away.  The pet health meter will be right underneath your name.<br />
<br />
Also, Qualtar just released additional files for different classes.  So, if your a pet class, download that file(it's under pet windows here).  This will give your pet a normal health bar on the player tab, replacing the endurance bar.</div></div><hr />

You have that problem because a file in your playerwindow is named the same as the one in the pet window.... go into the EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml file and rename PW_STRNumber to something like PetW_STRNumber and then rename the &lt;pieces&gt;PW_STRNumber&lt;/pieces&gt; to &lt;/pieces&gt;PetW_STRNumber&lt;/pieces&gt;.<br />
<br />
That should fix your problem</div></div><hr />

Just wondering if there is an autoinventory spot, or if one can be created on the inventory window?<br />
<br />
I removed the auto inventory spot because I didn't really see a need for it.  Maybe others play different than I do, but simply right clicking on an item will auto inventory it for you.  <br />
<br />
Is that how others put items in your inventory, or do you actually pick them up, open the inventory window and drop on the auto inventory screen?</div></div><hr />

I'll see about adding it to the next release... should not be too hard to find a spot for it.  I don't play a pet class, so its difficult for me to see how useful it is for others... thanks for the feedback.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brillien</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I got it fixed last night. I compared what yu had for button positioning for buffs 0-14 and made changes to 15-19. Some of the changes were relative but the rest were just needed to be made identical. All the buff labels seemed to be correct already. I had to make one other change some xy coordinate thingy needed changed from 450 to 560. If you'd like my buffwindow.html file just let me know..<br />
