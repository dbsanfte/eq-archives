There are dummy entries for &quot;mem this page&quot; buttons...  They need to implement THAT, I tell ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they are planning on it..<br />
<br />
its one of the features that is being worked on.. like a function to replace /hitsmode<br />
<br />
I had heard they had a better version of /hitsmode in the works and that they wanted it to be on the new UI before it came to live server.<br />
<br />
<br />
guess maybe they ment &quot;before it went live&quot; not &quot;before it went to live server&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I find this ability useless as with the grouping of my spells in my book no more than 2 spells I mem are on the same page.  And even if they were you'd need to be able to make multiple entries of a spell for each of the different situations your in (solo spells, group spells, raid spells)  but with multiple copies comes the fact you'd want a spellbook that has at least twice the amount of pages you get now if not more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caen</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it would be better for them to implement 3 or 4 setups.<br />
<br />
I imagine something like 4 mini spell gem bars inside the spell book window, with a button at the bottom of each &quot;Mem&quot;. This would unmem everything you have currently and then mem that set in the order you have in the mini spell bar.<br />
<br />
This way you could drag the same spell to all 4 setups if you wanted to (along with 7 other spells on each setup)... would be pretty cool.<br />
