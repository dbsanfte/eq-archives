This is the 2nd generation of my GUI.<br />
<br />
Once again, I would like to give credit to Thomus King, Remelio, Xymarra, Gendal, and Arista.<br />
<br />
This version contains NUMEROUS enhancements over the last.<br />
<br />
This GUI is designed for resolutions 1600x1200 AND 1280x1024!!!!<br />
<br />
Windows skinned in this version include:<br />
Group<br />
Player<br />
Target<br />
Chat<br />
Actions<br />
HotButtons<br />
Effects (Buffs)<br />
Short Duration Buffs (a.k.a Bard Box)<br />
Selector<br />
Pet Info.<br />
Inventory<br />
Spell Book<br />
Spell Bar<br />
Spell Cast Gauge<br />
Air Gauge<br />
Containers (Backpacks etc.)<br />
Inspect<br />
Item Information<br />
Tracking<br />
Looting<br />
Merchant<br />
Trading<br />
Give Window (For handing items to merchants)<br />
Item Counter (for picking items out of a stack like bone chips)<br />
Compass<br />
Music Player<br />
Book Window<br />
Note Window (like guild newbie notes)<br />
Confirmation Dialog (like when you delete something)<br />
Friends<br />
Expanded Bank (NOT the old Bank)<br />
Skills List (accessible from the Inventory)<br />
<br />
I have also included all available class animations from Thomus King. If you have an old class animation and would like a new one, please check Thomus King's website at: http://pub10.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10<br />
<br />
I MAY release other windows as time permits.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have also included 2 version of the group window. Once is for casters and has the player’s mana and pet on it, the melee version does not. They are located in the \Daellig\Group Windows subfolder.<br />
<br />
The new GUI now supports SkinPacks! This means that you can EASILY change the look and feel of the entire GUI by changing just a few files. I will be posting a large SkinPack as a separate download. It will contain 3 sets of backgrounds, 6 different filigree patterns, and 13 Spell Books. ALL Graphics are courtesy of Thomus King!<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT NOTE: Thomus King spell books have been slightly Modified for use with this GUI and ARE NOT COMPATABLE by default. As new books become available, I will try and post them. Thomus King class animations ARE COMPATABLE as are his Inventory Windows. <br />
<br />
You will need to unzip the GUI into a folder in your Everquest\uifiles\ folder. You can call it Daellig for example so the full path would be something like C:\Program Files\EverQuest\uifiles\Daellig. You MUST use the appropriate ini file, XML, and Graphics from your corresponding resolutions folder. e.g. If you run 1280x1024 you will need to copy all of the files from the \Daellig\Resolutions\1280x1024 folder into the \Daellig folder overwriting any other files there. Once you have done this copy the ini file from \Daellig\Resolutions\1280x1024 into your Everquest directory. You will then need to rename it to have your character name and server number in it. This information can be found by looking at your other character ini files. For example if your character is named Bob and is on the server Tarew Marr then you should see a file named UI_Bob_50.ini. Rename this file to UI_Bob_50.bak and then rename the ini file you copied from \Daellig\Resolutions\1280x1024 to be UI_Bob_50.ini.<br />
<br />
Things to know:<br />
The actions window is a permanent part of the GUI. It is located in the lower right corner of the GUI and can be used to perform the same functions as the Pet Information window. I have also added 2 additional tabs to the window. Once includes all of your current statistics, the other contains a 10 Hour timer. The code and graphics for the timer are from Arista. http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp<br />
<br />
The Music Player now appears near the Compass and can be turned on and off by pressing Alt+K.<br />
<br />
The Buff and the Short Duration Buff Windows WILL ALWAYS appear behind the surrounding graphics whenever you log into EQ or Zone. If you need to access the buffs, you MUST press Alt+B Twice in a row or Alt+E twice in a row for the short duration buff box. There is no way to fix this since it is a limitation of the GUI as designed by Verant. I have modified the graphics so that you should be able to easily tell if the buffs are behind the other windows.<br />
<br />
The Compass and the top portion of the Item Information Windows use graphic textures larger than 256x256. This means that they may not display correctly on some computers using older graphics cards. There is no work around for this due to the way Everquest creates window borders.<br />
<br />
You may need to change colors in the Chat windows for you to be able to read the text depending on your background.<br />
<br />
The Pet and Selector windows are used to create the Left and Right Borders on the Viewport. The Actions window can be customized to have the same functions as the Pet Window. As for the new features available in Legacy of Ykesha like the Map, they can all be accessed with shortcut keys. E.g. by default the Map can be activated by pressing the backspace key. To check what keys activate what windows, please check your options by pressing Alt+O then looking at your Keyboard|UI commands.<br />
<br />
All Windows that used to have a close button and no longer do can be closed by pressing the Escape key. The only exception to this is the Friends Window which is opened and closed by pressing Alt+F.<br />
<br />
Again thanks to Thomus King for his wonderful artwork, Remelio and Xymarra for their coding expertise, Gendal for SidlWidl, and Arista for the timer code.<br />
<br />
<br />
The new GUI now supports SkinPacks! This means that you can EASILY change the look and feel of the entire GUI by changing just a few files.<br />
<br />
This SkinPack contains 3 sets of backgrounds, 6 different filigree patterns, and 13 Spell Books. ALL Graphics are courtesy of Thomus King!<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT NOTE: Thomus King spell books have been slightly Modified for use with this GUI and ARE NOT COMPATABLE by default. As new books become available, I will try and post them. Thomus King class animations ARE COMPATABLE as are his Inventory Windows. <br />
<br />
To install any of these graphics simply copy the files from their corresponding subfolder e.g. \DaelligSkinPack\Filigrees\Lore into your Daellig GUI folder. e.g. \EverQuest\uifiles\Daellig overwriting any files that are there.<br />
<br />
You may need to change colors in the Chat windows for you to be able to read the text depending on your background.<br />
<br />
In order to use different skins for different characters you will need to create a new folder under \EverQuest\uifiles you may want to call it DaelligBob if Bob is your characters name. Then proceed to copy all of the files in your \EverQuest\uifiles\Daellig folder into it and modify each GUI separately. Remember to also use the new ini file for each character as detailed in the ReadMe file for the Daellig 2.0 GUI. You will also need to edit your characters UI ini file and change the line UISkin= to be UISkin=DaelligBob if that is the name of your customized GUI.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
<br />

Try downloading it again. A friend of mine downloaded it and it worked fine.<br />

<br />
I just verified with some other folks. All of them downloaded and extracted it fine. I even did it myself.<br />
<br />
All I can say is that it sounds like you have a bad connection to the server. You may want to either reconnect, or try downloading at an offpeak time to reduce lag and packetloss.<br />
<br />
You also really don't want to put your email address on message forums. You may want to edit your post and remove it. I also do not have a way to email files of this size so email is not an option anyway.<br />

<br />
1. Possiblity of changing the spellbar from horizontal to being able to use say someone elses?<br />
<br />
2. Instead of the 21 buff boxes, could I have 10 in the middle and maybe 4 slots of bags and 4 slots of inventory on either side?<br />
<br />
3. also if I want to use someone else spell gems such as the WC3 spells gems and gemicons is that possible?<br />
<br />
as of now the spellbar and its circles wont do much for the WC3 gem icons.<br />
<br />
<br />
If u need me to draw this out for you or if there is any way of doing this myself please please contact me. I am so looking forward to possibly changing this , just a bit so it suits my needs.<br />
<br />
Totally aweosme job and I know for sure that many will be overly please with your fine efforts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try pressing Alt+S twice in a row. If you are referring to the Buffs, press Alt+B twice in a row. The Buffs load behind the other windows. There is nothing I can do about this.<br />
<br />
This is an amazing UI... the only thing that I don't care for is the fact that I can't change the background color of the chat windows to black. I can change the border... but for some reason not the background. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Without directly modifying the chat graphics and XML there isn't much. The Fine Marble backgrounds in the SkinPack works very nice in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Hey I finally got UI to work and inside my Inv the picture is all distorted like it's too big i dunno what to do. I'm running it at 1280 X 1024 so if you have a suggestion please tell me thanks in advance <br />
<br />
I know. :( I put the class animations in the autoequiup area of the inventory to conserve space. They are now twice as wide and twice as tall as they used to be. They really aren't distorted, but rather enlarged. Some of the animations look better than others when enlarged. p.s. I feel kinda bad making t.king's work look bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Possiblity of changing the spellbar from horizontal to being able to use say someone elses?<br />
<br />
In theory this should be as simple as installing the other users mod over this one. Which Spellbar were you referring to? I may take a look at it to make sure.<br />
<br />
Instead of the 21 buff boxes, could I have 10 in the middle and maybe 4 slots of bags and 4 slots of inventory on either side? <br />
<br />
This isn't possable due to the way the interface handles Buffs. All 15 from the original effects window need to be in the same window for it to work, so I cant limit it to just 10. This is the same for the new 6 from the bard box. That is why there is 21 total.<br />
<br />
also if I want to use someone else spell gems such as the WC3 spells gems and gemicons is that possible?<br />
<br />
You can use someone elses spell icons yes, however you will need to replace them for the large spell buffs as well as the small spell icons. (Buff Bar and memorized spells). You cannot replace the gems in which they sit without seriously modifing the GUI.<br />
<br />
How would I go about adding Filligree around the windows you did not modify?<br />
<br />
I'd like to modify the windows with that so that they are at least uniform. Is that possible?<br />
<br />
It is possible, however it is a HUGE pain to do. The easiest I can say is look at the other files and you will see how I did it. Each piece of filigree is added 1 at a time, and there are a LOT of them.<br />
<br />
I am also likely going to do several of the remaining windows and release them as an AddonPack for the GUI in a few weeks or so.<br />
<br />
What windows were you referring to specificlly?<br />

I was hoping there was a specific section to copy and paste.<br />

Or like Drakah's where I just have to change the Draw Template Name.<br />
<br />
You are right, there are a ton of &quot;Filagree sections&quot;<br />
<br />
Worst part is that it doesn't seem to be uniform as to how many pieces there are.<br />
<br />
Some have like 21 different pieces where others have like 7...</div></div><hr />

This actually isn't necessary, if the ini file is copied ahead of time and you setup the GUI totally outside of EQ. If that is what you did, can you let me know the exact steps you went through?<br />

I highly doubt I would add this, The goal is to make the GUI work for as many people as possible. I can't add specific requests always. :(<br />
<br />
resizable chat windows please <br />
<br />
This can't be done due to the way the graphics work for the chat windows. I wish I could.<br />
<br />
I was actually looking at putting the filagree around all the windows you did not. <br />

These will likely be all in the AddonPack I am going to do. :)<br />
<br />
I love the way this looks and would really like to use it but i can't cause my monitor won't let me play EQ in any resolution other than 1024X768. I read that you doubt on makeing the UI in this size but maybe you can tell us what to change to make it work in this size. Not everyone uses your dimensions and probably never will. <br />
<br />
The problem here is two-fold. One, it is faily complex to change the GUI to fit a different resolution. Two, If I were to change it, the chat boxes would be VERY VERY narrow and tall, and the dashboard section of the GUI would cover about 45% of the screen. That is nearly half.<br />

<br />
i can't talk for the others... but what i did : prepare my folder witouht being logged in (putting the melee group, choosing the 1280*1024 files, renaming the *.ini to match my name/server) and then copy the folder to UIfiles and the ini to everquest's root.<br />
=&gt; the compass was misplaced :/<br />
i had 10 hard minutes to understand what was going on :p<br />
<br />
I highly doubt I would add this, The goal is to make the GUI work for as many people as possible. I can't add specific requests always. :(<br />
<br />
dang ! :(<br />
now i'm sad... i guess i'll have to spend a few weeks trying to understand how it works :/ <br />
<br />
my points ae simple :<br />
- the 4 slots of the ohtbutton window are quite &quot;useless&quot; and in 1280*1024 they take too much space<br />
- the chat windows are, therefore, still in 1280*1024 too small<br />
- the only lack of this UI, to me of course, just expressing my own user opinion on your great work (:p) is a comfortable clicky window (and since not everyone has the same clickies, the best way to do it (still my opinion here :p) is the way Cairenn did it =&gt; a mini full inventory with armor and bags<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway this is an awesome UI ! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was the same reason I didn't use this UI back when it first came out. I was sure you'd change this for this new version, but I presumed incorrectly.  <br />
<br />
I have to say, I love this UI's look and streamlined appearance.  I only hope you'll do something to fix the problem I'm talking about. This is certainly a case of going too much in favor of form over function.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that this is a pain. However it is a design limitation with the way the game engine loads the interface. I have no control over the layering of windows (z-order). I wish I did. The only thing I can say is try and get in the habbit of always making sure you have the buffs in front of the other windows when you begin a battle or get to your destination zone.<br />
<br />
I noticed you said Alt+S, this seems odd. My spell bad always is clickable, I never have to turn it off and on to get in front of any windows to access it.<br />
<br />
i can't talk for the others... but what i did : prepare my folder witouht being logged in (putting the melee group, choosing the 1280*1024 files, renaming the *.ini to match my name/server) and then copy the folder to UIfiles and the ini to everquest's root. <br />
<br />
This is weird. I have had this work perfectly sometimes, and others I have had to move the compass.<br />
<br />
 my points ae simple :<br />
- the 4 slots of the ohtbutton window are quite &quot;useless&quot; and in 1280*1024 they take too much space<br />
- the chat windows are, therefore, still in 1280*1024 too small<br />
- the only lack of this UI, to me of course, just expressing my own user opinion on your great work () is a comfortable clicky window (and since not everyone has the same clickies, the best way to do it (still my opinion here ) is the way Cairenn did it =&gt; a mini full inventory with armor and bags <br />
<br />
The weapons on the hotbutton box are there for weapon swapping. This is far more useful in the 1600 version where you have the inventory available to you on the main interface. I kept it there in the 1280 versio due to balance. With the way the GUI is layed out, I can't make the hotbutton box skinnier without doing the same to the Actions Window. Unfortunatly, I cant have even 5 tabs (assuming I lost the timer) if the actions window is only as wide as a 2 button wide hottnutton box. If I lost the Stats page as well, then it might be feasable, but I am then faced with serious space sonstraints for the customizable buttons in the actions window.<br />
<br />
As for the chat windows being to small in 1280, I just used a smaller font size in my chat windows on my other computer.  (It can't support 1600.)<br />
<br />
I could replace the timer tab on the Actions Window with a clicky window without to much effort. If I do, it will be available with the AddOnPack I am going to do woth the remaining windows in it. But that leaves us with the need for at least 5 if not 6 tabs on the action window and therefore a fatter hotbutton box.<br />
<br />
If they can't be resize, can I at least create new ones which may be resized? This will allow me to put all that battle spam off in one window. <br />
<br />
The chat windows can't be resized because the everquest engine doesn't support tiling borders, it only stretches them. Therefore, if I made it sizable, and you resized it, the graphics would become totally skewed and distorted. You can however, create a new window and set its transparancy to 0 and have floating text that you could put anywhere on your screen. If you really want to resize the window you will need to find the line:<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Sizable&gt;false&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt;<br />
<br />
in the &lt;Screen item=&quot;ChatWindow&quot;&gt; section of the EQUI_ChatWindow.xml file and change it to &lt;Style_Sizable&gt;true&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt;\<br />
<br />
Actually, I don't think that would work either, because the chat windows don't have borders so you would have noting to grab onto to resize with.<br />

<br />
I use swapped clickies currently for the most part. I modified the slots so that the first one was a container that had my Wild Lord armor inside it.<br />
<br />
Second slot I switched to Chest<br />
Third slot I switched to Hands<br />
Fourth slot I switched to Feet<br />
Fifth slot I switched to Mask<br />
<br />
Personally I don't ever use timers, they aren't accurate, and are too high maintenance for my tastes.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind seeing it replaced with a traditional 8 slot in ventory section.<br />
<br />
I was actually looking at putting the filagree around all the windows you did not. <br />
<br />
These will likely be all in the AddonPack I am going to do.  <br />
<br />
Great! Would love every window to be uniform with the filagree. Thank you =)</div></div><hr />

When you switched to the TKing inventory did that use the <br />
stock sized Class icon? The only thing I haven't liked about<br />
this UI is that class thing is blurry. <br />

why? because I cant use 1600x1200 and at 1280x1024 the chat windows are far too small. well, at least the main chat window is. the melee window doesnt need to be that big, esspecially when using hitmode. it takes too much space. there are also too many gaps between all the windows which take too much useable space aswell. you also only see 1/2 of the upper line in the chat windows at 1280x1024. it would also be nice if the action window would be made seperately, since its not used much anyway. this would make evenmore space for bigger chat windows.<br />
dont missunderstand me, I find it still almost perfect, but those flaws make it impossible to use for me because I would miss too much in the chat windows in a tense fight. everything else is very very nice!<br />
I can only hope and beg you will fix what I mentioned soon in the future...<br />
or maybe can you explain how to move the group window and resize the chat windows, editing the xml files? that would be very nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wanted to contact you about this via email, but I couldnt find your email anywhere. so here it goes:<br />
<br />
since I WANTED to use this awesome UI at all costs, I modified the chat window, hotbuttons and group window to make the main chat bigger and the melee window smaller in the 1280x1024 version. it doesnt look as good as the original one but it will do its job (for me at least). I never edited or made one UI myself before.<br />
<br />
since a few people also mentioned they find the chat window too small, I wanted to ask if I can post it here. so if you agree to make those 3 modified windows available here, just let me know. I dont want to post anything that you may not want. but maybe noone wants to use it and then I wont have to post it.<br />
<br />
let me know what you think.<br />
screenshot attached<br />
<br />
<br />
note: the action/timer/social/etc window can be opened with a defined key and may be moved to anywhere you like (I prefer upper left corner). the chat windows, hot button window and group window can be moved anywhere you want aswell, so you can swap each others out if you dont like the hotbuttons where they are on the screen i.e.</div></div><hr />

    &lt;!--&lt;TooltipReference/&gt;--&gt;<br />
    &lt;Background&gt;A_InvSecondary&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
  &lt;/InvSlot&gt;<br />
<br />
Above are the sections of code you need to locate. They are counterintuitive in positioning.<br />
<br />
&lt;InvSlot item=&quot;HB_BonusInvSlot13&quot;&gt; is for the top slot.<br />
&lt;InvSlot item=&quot;HB_BonusInvSlot14&quot;&gt; is for the second slot.<br />
&lt;InvSlot item=&quot;HB_BonusInvSlot11&quot;&gt; is the third slot.<br />
&lt;InvSlot item=&quot;HB_BonusInvSlot21&quot;&gt; is the fourth slot.<br />
&lt;InvSlot item=&quot;HB_BonusInvSlot0&quot;&gt; is the fifth slot.<br />
<br />
Under each section you need to change the &lt;EQType&gt;#&lt;/EQType&gt;. To determine which slot you want, refer to Kaoriv's UI thread, it has a list there.<br />
<br />
To change the background image so that your slot for your &quot;Legs&quot; doesn't say that it is your face, you need to change the &lt;Background&gt;A_InvSecondary&lt;/Background&gt; tag.<br />
<br />
You can also figure that part out relativly easy, though I believe the Charm slot does not follow the A_InvSlot convention. All the rest seem to be uniform.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

All you have to do is download it and replace it with the current one you have.  Now, with the current UI, the Spell Gems window fits in perfectly.  What I'm guessing you would have to do is somehow edit the chat window to be a little less lengthy for the left side, and then you would just have to edit the them until you get them the prefered lenght.  Or you could just add this to the request forum and hope someone will pick it up.  I currently cannot do this because his chat windows are set in a certain size and I do not know how to edit them yet.  I do simple modifications for people :)  Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
First question is...I used /chatfontsize 5 to make the chat font bigger...but it only worked in the left window...How do I get the other window to have the same font size?<br />
<br />
Second, My mouse wheel stopped working for scrolling when I loaded your UI...is there some way to get it up and running again? <br />
<br />
And my last question is, I like to have 2 totally transparent windows along the left side of the screen for my hitsmode...and I like to have only the numbers showing, so I just have a thin little window that only shows 4 numbers.  But with this UI I can't resize the windows....any way to fix that?<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for your time and the UI  :D</div></div><hr />

When I changed to the 1600 x 1200 version I had the bags. Don't know if it was meant to be this way.</div></div><hr />

And since everything is smaller on the 1600 x 1200 variation, the room was there to add the slots.<br />

<br />
But . I have 1 little thingie ....<br />
<br />
On the top you have the compass and you also have a graphic (compass.png) ... the graphic does not show in my screen so I have the side bars nice and set but the top bar is not there.<br />
I looked if the compass.png was in the uifiles dir and also made sure I copied the files out of the 1280 x 1024 folder.<br />
<br />
All seems good but it just doesn't show :(<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any replies you are willing to give.</div></div><hr />

I love this UI's horizontal casting bar + target window, but I don't like using this particular UI because of how the buffs are behind a window and you have to hit alt+b to access them.  Is there anyone here that could tell me how I can take the casting bar + target and put it in another UI? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Kinda sad because this is one beautiful UI, I wish I could figure out how to add his borders to the other windows and make some other changes to the UI.<br />

<br />
I tackled the first part of keeping this UI alive. I added the shared bank slots to the Banker.<br />
<br />
I can't figure out the fillagree so it looks a bit out of place below the done button, but at least it's functional...<br />
<br />
Next is to add the book icon to the cast bar again so I can access the favorites mem stuff.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps people.<br />
<br />
EQUI_CastSpellWnd.zip (http://www.eqbeastlord.com/~makani/Ui/EQUI_CastSpellWnd.zip)<br />
<br />
Here is the cast bar that includes the spell book icon so you can click to create your spell sets.<br />
<br />
Again, it's functional, but not as pretty as it could be.</div></div><hr />

Im going to *try* to integrate the current target window (where the exp and aa guages are) into the pet window.  I have moved both gauges to the right of the buff boxes and plan to put the pet buttons on the left of the boxes (yea I know gotta make it pet window).  The problem Im having is I do not know how to change the current gauge style.  The gauges currently have the frilly designs on either side of the gauge.  Id like to get rid of this design to save on space.   How would I go about this?</div></div><hr />

It might be only me, but I find your UI not to work along with this recent patch 7/10/2003. Tend to fix this, or any advice on how to make it work with the patch?<br />

<br />
Now I'm trying to bring this UI over and am having some issues, but if no one with a detailed understanding of it is still around to help, I might as well just give it up...<br />
<br />
I was having an issue with the wnd_bg_xxxx_rock.tga files... but that is resolved. I also had to edit out a few things that are not available for Mac EQ (shared bank slots, MP3 Player, Charm slot, etc.). Now I can get it to load, but it is EXTREMELY laggy and none of the filigree elements seem to want to appear.<br />
<br />
I'd love to make the changes necessary to get this UI up on Mac EQ, but I really need Daellig or someone else knowledgeable of this UI to help.<br />

Is anyone still out there?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darl</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boy, this is a massive UI.  It's over 14 megs; the Actions window alone is over 1 meg.<br />
<br />
There were dozens of changes needed to bring this UI up to date and fully functional.  Frankly, I didn't do them all.  I did, however, make the Animations file current and added some missing code to a few other windows.  You could replace just the Animations file and the UI will load, with the &quot;files not compatible&quot; message.<br />
<br />
It's missing GoD-era spellgems and icons, too.  You'll most likely want to find those yourself.<br />
<br />
Here's a list of changes I've made:<br />
<br />
- Animations  file code made current.  It contains all the necessary code to be fully functional and up-to-date.<br />
<br />
- Actions  window code made current.  No change to functionality.  The window is missing the Find and EndFind buttons.<br />
<br />
- Group  window code made current.  No change to functionality here, I just added some code to eliminate the error messages.  I didn't change the caster/melee specific windows, just the regular window in the main folder.<br />
<br />
- Pet info  window code made current but not functional.  (The necessary new code is in place, but the window does not display any of this new code.  In this case, the buff icons do not appear.)<br />
<br />
- Player  window code made current.  No change to functionality.  It does not display the attack indicator.<br />
<br />
- Selector  window code made current.  No change to functionality.  It's missing the Combat Skills Toggle Button.<br />
<br />
- Skills  window code made current but not functional.  (The Make HotKey Button does not appear.  I'd probably just delete this one from the custom folder.)<br />
<br />
- Target  window code made current.  No change to functionality.  The window still does not display a 'con' indicator.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd recommend that you delete the following files from the Daellig folder:<br />
<br />
EQUI_AAWindow.xml - This is one window you really want to be fully functional.<br />
<br />
EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml - The current file is missing the Change, Autobank, Shared Plat and the two Shared Bank Slot elements.<br />
<br />
EQUI_LootWnd.xml - It's missing the Broadcast function.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you replace the changed files and delete the AA, Bank, and Loot windows, the UI will load without any error messages.<br />
