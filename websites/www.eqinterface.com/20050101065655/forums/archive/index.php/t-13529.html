<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Von Marr</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you look my stats up, it's been a while. I gave up on EQ, then after a break I went to SWG for several months. I'd recently heard of some graphics additions, even some interface mods from SWG being retrofitted to EQ, to make it more helpful and easier to play, so I thought it would be neat to check it out.<br />
<br />
Sadly, I've found that no longer is there an option in the character selection screen, to change any keyboard commands, interface commands... none of the things I remember. *this screen thing might just be my bad memory*<br />
<br />
However I *do* recall running around, when mouselook WORKED and all I had to do was move my mouse to the right, and my 1st person view moved to the right also... up down.. all that good stuff. I had also made it so that when I pressed my right mouse button that I would move forward.... look and move very fast, clean and effecient.<br />
<br />
Somehow, that 'seems' no longer possible. I've tried *in game* to use the options to do these things, and I cant bind any command to the mouse buttons. Not only that, but now it seems that even alternating with F12, or the 'keyboard command' to toggle mouselook on and off, I am unable to click with my mouse period. I can press CTRL O for the options box, but I cant 'click' on a tab to change which is up... be it right or left click NOTHING WORKS. <br />
<br />
Believe it or not, I *did* try a search for the forums and came up empty. Can anyone help me? Im presuming at this point, since I installed fresh, took 3 hours patching..etc, that my default UI is somehow screwed up and that installing a custom one from this sight *might* be able to fix what went wrong.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Sorry for the length of the post, but I felt it nessairy to explain the situation and beg for answers. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

The only thing I can think of, is that sometimes your mouse will go back to window, but the EQ screen will still be on top (Windows Bug).  You can try switching to windowed mode then back out again, or releasing the mouse and going back, but as I've never really heard of this problem, I can't offer much help.  <br />
<br />
As for changing keyboard commands and such, you can do all that through the default UI in options.  It's one of the tabs, then it has a little rollout for all the different sections of what you can change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mogur</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya but now you can only program keyboard hot keys for the options they give you. You used to be able to program a hot key for ANY command at all, IIRC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you could do was create a social and bind it to a hotkey.  Any sequence of up to five /commands can be programmed in a social, which can then be activated either by putting the social on a hotkey or by pressing the button in the socials pane.<br />
<br />
If you look in the options window under the Keyboard heading, there are tons of commands that you can bind to arbitrary keypresses.  These include opening and closing windows, casting spells, targetting, moving the camera, and most other single actions.  This window is available in game, not at the character selection screen.  I think these options were set from the character selection screen in DAOC.<br />
<br />
Some actions that can not (yet) be bound to keypresses are equipping an item, dropping an item, combining a trade skill container, accepting a confirmation dialog, buying or selling from a merchant, accepting a trade.</div></div><hr />
