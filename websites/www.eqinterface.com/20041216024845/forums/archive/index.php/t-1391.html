Sorry I couldn't have been more help when you first asked me but np. Well just FYI I am starting a small graphic art site soon called Digital Flex it will be for 3d and other computer art and I hope to get that running so I'm sorta using your boards as free advertising ;)<br />
Anyways, Gratz on the site and I'll be off now</div></div><hr />
