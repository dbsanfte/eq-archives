<br />
I spent the better part of the afternoon, setting up a skin that I really like, customized for each of my characters as far as invintory slots hot keyed, window positions and such.<br />
<br />
I decide that im going to try to add some custom spell icon graphics that I downloaded.  So I made a copy of my wizard's mod, &quot;Lomack&quot; and made the copy &quot;Lospell&quot; just so that I could test it without messing what I had up.<br />
<br />
The first thing that should have told me something was wrong was when I loaded the new mod.  It turns out the spell icons just wouldn't work with the mob I'm using.  Mod has tiny icons new icons are full sized.  Anyway, I loaded back my old skin no problem.  However, all the windows are back to the default settings and postions that they were when I started.<br />
<br />
WTH did I forget to do, that would save my window locations, fade percentages etc if I try to load a new skin and then go back to the old one?</div></div><hr />

Then if you ever forget the &quot;1&quot; at the end of the /load command, you can just replace that file and be back to where you were.</div></div><hr />
