<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bellena</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't seem to get the animation to run Remmy.exe after I unzip.  I'm not sure if it goes directly into the UI folder I have for my character, or if it goes in a seperate folder inside the custom UI folder.  The instructions on it are a little vague, and I don't have much computer savvy :(.  Any help would be most appreciated.<br />

 &quot;Error of Component MSCOMCTL.OCX or one of it's dependencies is not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gandar</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a fairly common error which simply states that the file is either completely missing or corrupted.  Most likely it's just missing.  <br />

A search on Microsoft.com revealed this link: Microsoft Download Site (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=6F94D31A-D1E0-4658-A566-93AF0D8D4A1E) <br />
<br />
and I hope it displays properly.  Alternately, you should be able to find the file on your Windows install CD-ROM, depending on your version.<br />
<br />
If you run the installer from Microsoft, all &quot;should&quot; be well when you finish.  If you download the file from an alternate site and/or the CD, place MSCOMCTL.OCX into your Windows/system32 directory and then click Start-&gt;Run and type: REGSVR32 MSCOMCTL.OCX<br />
<br />
This will cause your OS to recognize and properly register the file.  I would post my own MSCOMCTL.OCX file for you, but it's too large (a little over 1mb, 504kb zipped)<br />
<br />
RE: Where to place Remmy.exe...  Remmy should be placed inside your customer UI folder and run from there.<br />
<br />
If you have trouble locating the file, I will send you mine if I have an email address capable of accepting the attachment.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

And if it still doesnt work run the REG code you gave me?  If thats right then I'll give it a whirl if not then I just labeled myself the biggest n00b.  I know VERY little about the tech stuff so I usually don't get it right the first time.  All this confusion for a pretty screen in my persona menu for EQ lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gandar</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that should be all there is to it.  The link I provided in my first post is to Microsoft's site and is an installer of the common controls.  You only need to run the REGSVR32 MSCOMCTL.OCX command if you are getting the file off your CD or from someone else.<br />
<br />
Have you searched your computer for MSCOMCTL.OCX?<br />
<br />
Don't worry about being a n00b!  We all must start somewhere and the best way to learn is by doing it yourself - and when stuck, asking.  :cool:<br />
<br />
I'm setting this to notify so I can monitor the thread in case you have any further problems.<br />

p.s. If you do continue to have problems, I'll need to know what Windows version you're running.</div></div><hr />
