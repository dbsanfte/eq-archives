<br />
Try to get a updated versjon of GroupWindow.xml. Sorry cant help you with how to fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the problem is that it looks like that group window isn't meant to be a stand alone.  It was a fix for the Quartz UI.  <br />
<br />
You can try editing the XML, but I have no idea how it's going to look, I've never played with Quartz.<br />
<br />
The line you would look for is near the bottom.  It looks like this<br />
<br />
&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Group&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
change it to <br />
<br />
&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_RoundedNoTitle&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
And then see if it loads.  <br />
<br />
Again, I didn't look at everything, it's possible there will be something else in there that relies on other files found in the Quartz UI, but that will fix that particular error by changing it to a standard border.  <br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your suggestion let everything work except the group win is a squared instead of curved but i don't care about the shape it was the way it displayed the information so thank you very much for your help<br />
