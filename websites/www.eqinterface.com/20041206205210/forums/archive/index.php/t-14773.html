<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valgoth Ulv'Sag</div><div class="date">08-07-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought my problems uploading yesterday were due to firewall/sentinel issues on my office network. However, trying to upload an update to my UI this morning from home I'm having the same problem. I was able to upload fine on 8/1/04 (the last time I updated my UI), but now all of a sudden I can't.<br />
<br />
File is in the same location on my local drive, filename is the same, etc. The only thing that's changed is the contents of the archive, so the conditions should be the same as the last time I uploaded successfully.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else having problems uploading? Can one of the admins look into this please?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

With out knowing the error your are getting it could be many reasons.<br />
<br />
I could make a guess by seeing your username that it may be having trouble with the apostrophe in it again since we have moved to a new system. However that’s only a guess because no info was given on why you cant upload.</div></div><hr />

Same username as when I successfully uploaded on August 1st, so doubt that's the problem.<br />
<br />
Here's the exact error:<br />
<br />
Warning: halt(./includes/functions_log_error.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/eqinterf/public_html/forums/includes/db_mysql.php on line 389<br />

There seems to have been a slight problem with the EQInterface Forums database.<br />

The error was due to the same problem.. it didnt show up right away since it only applied after you have updated your interface more then one. It worked the first time on Aug 1st becuase that was the first time you updated it since our new system was in place. The problem was there was no  addslashes() to the lastmodifyusername field that is used in the category table and file table and is used to show the last user to update the file. <br />
<br />
The problem should now be fixed. :)</div></div><hr />
