<br />
I can't seem to understand how to do something.  I have added several things to my UI before but this time it's not working.  <br />
<br />
I wanted to add the Guage for time remaining on a disc. to my player window so I can just glance at it (and since melees don't need a mana bar anyway).  However, when I went to add it my UI breaks and I can't understand why this is so different.<br />
<br />
Can someone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">first guess would be that theres some sort of hard code that doesnt allow that guage to be in a different window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">omegamagni</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, what I did was the following steps (which worked for other guages but not this one)<br />
<br />
1) Copied the guage items including the type (which I think is 26) into the area in my player window XML file where the Mana bar used to go.  <br />
<br />
2) I included this same label in the pieces section at the bottom of the file so it would be included.<br />
<br />
3) I removed the old pieces for the mana bar so it would not be included anymore.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?</div></div><hr />

If you move that particular guage than you have to remove all of it's instances from the Combat XML file.  It can't co-exist between 2 files it seems.</div></div><hr />

Cutting it out of the parrent window causes those red &quot;not compatible&quot; messages in most cases.<br />
