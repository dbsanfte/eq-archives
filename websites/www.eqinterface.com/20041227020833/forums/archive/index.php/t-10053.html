This would make soloing more than one mob a non suicidale way to work.</div></div><hr />

A mage is still a brutal force. Just learn to use your character and train yourself to fight out of the worst case senarios.  If you are in your 40's, I recommend fighting in Dawnshroud, out in the open.... you'll learn pet control better than you ever have haha.<br />
<br />
The ONLY thing I would change about a mage is the damn spell partical Graphics.... Every level you get a &quot;BRAND NEW BOLT SPELL&quot; to look at...Gag...I'm so sick of seeing fire, fire fire fire....<br />
If we are masters of the Elements, lets see some spells that look like wind, water, and earth other than pets...</div></div><hr />

I think we need summoned enemy slows and summoned enemy snares (MAYBE a summoned enemy root) and dire charm for summoned enemies. It's fine with me that we don't get cold spells. I can live with being a master of elements (uhm, except not since wizards are better at nuking) of magic and fire.<br />
<br />
I also think beastlords should get their pet hastes taken away (they should just get to use their suck hastes) and they should lose slows completely. Uhm, and all BLs should be deleted. Did I mention I hate BLs?<br />
<br />
Other than that, pretty happy with classes. I don't think mages really even need a change; just beastlords.<br />

Beastlord here... the three things I would change about a beastlord...<br />
1. Gate<br />
2. Gate<br />
3. Gate<br />
<br />
And mages should have their nukes taken away and only be able to use BL nukes. (450 dmg, 30 second recovery time)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azuth</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I should have posted in my original message, reasonable changes.  If I was gonna go all out I'd give mages all the wizard gates, ice comet, and awesome healing spells before clerics got them.<br />
<br />
My changes are relativly reasonable.  Cold DoTs, maybe snare istead of root on the dirt ball pet so we can have a real root spell and some mana regen in the phantom armor spells would not unbalance the game.  Pretty much every other casting class gets root.  Even the paladin gets root and mages have to depend on a weaker /pet attack, /pet back off trick.  I'm asking for root not mez or charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a Paladin<br />
<br />
1) Gate personally  I think all casters should get this...sorry pure melee's.<br />
<br />
2) More stun spells, a Paladins role is rarely main tank but the support iwth stuns make them wanted in groups.<br />
<br />
3) More complete Undead line the DD's and the support like Nife spells. After all we are Paladins so we should be able to kill undead as easily as a cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1). Gate (as others had stated already)<br />
2). Bind Affinity<br />

<br />
1) Some kind of heal ability similar to Lay on Hands<br />
<br />
2) A better taunt. ATM, a warrior has a hard time keeping aggro away from some idiot paladin or sk (no offence, wait, yes offence) that can't control their aggro, because YES I'll admit it, they can easily steal aggro, I feel that that is very stupid, a warrior should always be able to get aggro since they are usually MT, the meatshield, the pansy hybrids don't like getting hit? then stop taking aggro joo foo!<br />
<br />
3) Um.... I dunno, added innate regen? like 1 or 2 standing, 3 or 4 sitting? I dunno.<br />

• I would correct all the bugs inherent in my class.<br />
• I would consolidate ALL similar songs back to the single and unique songs that improve as I level once again.<br />
• I would finally resolve all the open and neglected issues that caused my class to be nerfed over time (swarm kiting, mana, class balancing, charm caps, class dependancy on instruments but with poor available variety, and instrument creation)<br />
• I would eliminate the spell gem cap so that I can play any song I know at any time of my choosing so long as I can hotkey it somewhere.<br />
• I would improve class desireability by increasing the potency of my songs somewhat (afterall we're already paying the meleer's price begiven the jack-of-all-trades).<br />
• Lastly, I would add more weapons and instruments that sing (i.e. Short Sword of Harmony) and a non-magical primary-handed drum to round things off.<br />
<br />
Oops thats six! Nonetheless thats what I would do. <br />

<br />
Wizard is a perfectly balanced class most levels, what I realy would like is a single target snare to go with the AoE version. Other than that, I don't think they need much change.<br />
<br />
Shamans need something worthy calling CH, to even try to say the 1980 heal for 10s would be a CH is a laugh... The sad part is since it is 10s casting time it can't be effected by focus stuff so that makes it more or less redundant as soon as you get Tnarg's.<br />
<br />
Mages bolt at 61 should realy be moved to level 63 and be turn in spell... when a mage turn 61 he have a spell for granted that will outnuke even a wizard 1 level higher. That is just sad planning. making it 63 though and a turn in would balance the spell out perfectly. :)<br />
<br />
Hmmm... Something I always thought strange but I accept as a class balance issue, Call of the Hero is realy a translocate spell, and should belong to wizards :)<br />

<br />
a) The pet spell Flaming Sword of Xuzl - Should not disappear when the mobs dies or it should be given much higher hit points so that it is worth the mana casting cost.  Else, give the sword a 700 foot range so that at the very least it could be used to pull something.  It cant be controlled, has 100hp, only hits the target you send it after and dispells itself after killing it (unless you allow yourself to be hit by another mob)  I cant see any reason I would ever cast augments on it when it will only die soon after.<br />
<br />
b)  Rains should follow the targeted mob or we should be given at least one hardly resistable very low damage dot that wont break the stupid root everytime we cast.<br />
<br />
c)  Call of the Hero should at least be included on the wizard's list - pure lunacy that we are masters of teleportation and don't have this ability.<br />
<br />
d)  Translocates added for Emerald Jungle/Skyfire - I deleted sky simply because of the aggro in the spires.  Ill walk thank you and I can't take you there, sorry.<br />
<br />
e)  Gates to the planes you are flagged to access.  No Drop buy at zone in gate spell/portals maybe too, but not so sure.<br />
<br />
f)  Raise the Bind Wound cap for all pure casters.  I should be able to bind my own wounds at least to 150 skill, not 100.<br />

**  All LOY researcher books should be able to combine ANY classes research components, not just priest and self.</div></div><hr />

I've tried and tried to use what we have already, but usually when I do, I have to run away and zone, or I'm forced to zone due to death.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tafkamb</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arch Conkover's Thoughts<br />
<br />
I read through some of the Ideas here and wanted to post a reply to some issues made.<br />
<br />
1, warriors should definatly have better aggro abilities and possibly better regen as stated they are a Meat shield and to be honest I look for a pally or Sk to tank. They shouldnt have LoH as they are none casters and LoH is granted to paladins via there connection to their gods and the preist abilitied granted by them.<br />
<br />
2, CoTH is most definatly a Mage spell as it is a summon not a translocate spell. Wizzy's are the masters of translocation yes but they have no spells to call someone or thing to them this is a mage ability, we get the summon range not you.<br />
<br />
3, Magi do get mana regen spells incorporated into there phanom range but not till the high end spells, we also get the water form with AA which is also Mana regen ability<br />
<br />
4, target based rain spells should follow the mob as it was that target the spell is coming from so to cast and then lose the last 2 rains is stupid just because the point of spell origin is moving.<br />
<br />
Things I would like to see<br />
Intelligent pets mainly<br />
the use of a wizzy pet that tanks is stupid, a rouge that carnt tell back from front yet has Backstab is pointless<br />
I would like to see a wizzt pet that casts and sits when it needs to regen mana and a rouge pet that activly attacks the Mobs back.<br />
magi are very reliant on our pets and I want pets that work please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freya</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think as a beastlord, a track ability would be good, i mean  wolves, and tigers  hunt, wouldnt we be ables to &quot;pick up the scent of  mobs&quot;, and  sense animals  just  dont cut it.<br />
a gate  would be nice also,  i didnt like being stuck in dulak with out a ride  home.<br />
and lastly  a toss up between root, and more armor with graphics like our shoulders!!!!.<br />
  but id leave  everything  un changed, for more ac since we are basically shamonks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ascher</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I wouldn't change anything about any of the classes except maybe slightly better taunt to warriors, and even then it would have to be extremely minor.<br />
<br />
Nothing in this game should ever be completely 100% guaranteed.  It *should* take team work as it does now.<br />
<br />
But that's just my opinion and your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">umoto</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as a mage i would say.... give us self only mod rods with no timer.<br />
thats about it for mage..<br />
<br />
as for chanter. PLATE ARMOR! omgz i cant stand dying because the ranger wants to be a hero and save the chanter who has mezzed a mob. MORE HP! in a pathetic group chanter get hit more than the mt! lay of hands like instant cast mez!... why not?</div></div><hr />

1)  All disciplines on seperate timers<br />
<br />
2)  Level based runspeed improvement or Class AA's that give runspeed mod above run 3<br />
<br />
3)  Improved Avoidance</div></div><hr />

3. Faster Cast Time  on Life Tap</div></div><hr />

Warriors should get a instruction book tho on how taunt works so they ****ing stop whining on us sks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">talionjustice</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mages summon, hence Call of the Hero, put spires in NTOV, then you can xlocate people there. <br />
<br />
Paladins SK's tank in XP as well as warriors, quit whining when they start pulling aggro from you, the cleric is probably /telling them to so they don't have to heal you, the ranger, the 'chanter, and the wizard after every pull. In line with this would be FIX WARRIOR TAUNT. Even a mage knows it's broken. <br />
<br />
Mages: true wizzy pet, who does not move to melee range after casting, Summoned specific spells, like druids have animal, i.e. DC for summoned, summoned slow, summoned root. New spell that would allow me to /assist and summon lvl 60 and lower mobs to me. /grin YOU CANNOT ESCAPE ME<br />
<br />
EDIT: oh yeah, and mage spell to send inconsiderate quadders to a small box shaped zone for a penalty hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azuth</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea of the penalty box zone for KSers, camp incrochers, and other rude/annoying people.<br />
<br />
I'd actually like to see some extra summoned weapons that proc nukes or debuffs.  Start with a two handed sword, then daggers, then longswords with a proc of varying effects.  An example would be a level 20 dagger 'dagger of ice' that procs a, you guessed it, cold attack.  The R&amp;D team could make as a DoT proc or a nuke.  To balance out the spells make the only available in Erudin, Ak'Anon, and Neriak (maybe research only instead).  Also make it so they can only be used by pet with class: all race: none.  And give the weapons attack/delay of rusty weapons of the same type.  There you go, extra pet support spells that fit into the magician's summoning theme.<br />
<br />
Maybe some other usefull spells could be summoned like the EB and lev items.  I'd love to see, say, Summoned: Ball of Earth that has a clicky effect of root but only two charges.  Make the ability to summon one about level 30.  Only available in the three citys named in the last paragraph or research only.<br />
<br />
I actually don't want to see us get a mez, charm, haste, slow, or other support spell as we are basically wizards with an extra tank but some basic back up spell that every other class gets would be nice.<br />
<br />
Consider this a revised wish list for the mage class.  I think this is the longest post I have ever made lol.<br />
<br />
Shutting up now.</div></div><hr />
