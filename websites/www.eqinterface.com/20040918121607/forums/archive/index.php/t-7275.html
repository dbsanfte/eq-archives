<br />
Just wanted to let you know that I've updated and fixed all of my UI mods since the most recent patch (release of Ykesha). <br />
<br />
You can get them at:<br />
<br />
http://home.attbi.com/~aviendha/uifiles.html <br />
<br />
I have also alerted Kudane that these files have been updated, so you should see them on the servers here shortly.<br />
<br />
P.S. Be on the lookout for some new mods in the near future! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">03-02-2003, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool..but did you not rename them?? I keep gettting old ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danaelle</div><div class="date">03-02-2003, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yay! I came here looking for that exact thing, thanks Avi! :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Just re-downloaded them from your site and got an error when I did the loadskin. I *think* it's from the group-window-small file, since I loaded the normal one (with invite/disband) buttons and it was fine, swapped to the small one and got the red message of doom. Just an FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aviendha101</div><div class="date">03-04-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I didn't rename them... .just updated the zip files.<br />
<br />
Now, as for the error message... was it the message that said that it could not load the XML code?  Or the message that said &quot;This XML code may be incompatible... &quot; blah blah blah?<br />
<br />
Let me know and I'll fix it. :P</div></div><hr />

 &quot;This XML code may be incompatible... &quot; blah blah blah? Thats the one. Did not revert to default UI or anything, just gave me that message when I logged in. I just swapped back to the other window and no error. Thanks for your time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aviendha101</div><div class="date">03-05-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Danaelle...<br />
<br />
should be all fixed now.  I've updated the download on my personal webpage, and I'll send Kudane an email for him to update the file on his page, as well.  Thanks for letting me know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">03-06-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woot  great i got my 3 part back !!<br />
Have one request....can you put lvl on it some where???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aviendha101</div><div class="date">03-07-2003, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kasca...<br />
<br />
Which one are you talking about?  Ony my group windows, I have two certsions.  One version does show your level.  On the other version, I removed the level in lieu of the ATK and AC for melee classes.<br />
<br />
Try downloading the Normal one, instead of the Melee version. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">03-07-2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the the one with the 3 windows ( target ,player and group) called just window set. Iam not sure where you could put it. Maybe dump the sta bar???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danaelle</div><div class="date">03-09-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First: Thank you again for fixing! <br />
<br />
Second: I hate people that take something free and promptly start whining about wanting more .... so I haven't said this up til now ... but Aviendha, if you are ever so inclined, I would love to see a version of the player windows (the older ones, not your latest) that did not have the stamina bar. Truthfully, I never ever look at it, have no use for it whatsoever and it just takes up a smidgen of space and creates one more thing for my eyes to track over. <br />
<br />
Thanks again, and take care!</div></div><hr />

Your UI is amazing. Thank you very much for your hard work. I like your site too :) . I am an enchanter and really get distracted by the druid sword with animations. I have tried everything just to get a normal arrow for the cursor. If during your spare time, do you think you can tell me what I need to type to revert to normal cursor. I have tried taking it out, replacing it, and everyhing else you can imagive, but I end up with default UI or an invs cursor. This is my last resort to come here and ask because I realize that you probably have more important things to do :)  No rush I still will use it as is. Thanks again for the marvelous job.</div></div><hr />
