<br />
Among the issues he address is the future of EQ (which is VERY strong) and a new pricing plan for playing more than one SOE Game <br />
<br />
So, would you rather play in EverQuest II's Age of Destiny? Or does EverQuest's Age of Turmoil still have plenty of exciting things you want to do? Our goal is to make that decision simple! Having spent so much time in EverQuest, you might feel torn between which game you want to play more. We realize that many of you will want to play both EQ and EQII, so we're introducing the SOE All Access™ subscription. It allows you to play a large mix of our most popular offerings for only $21.99 per month. Our Legends customers will receive this same access to our games at no additional charge. This makes it affordable and easy to play SOE's games, including: <br />
<br />
*	EverQuest® (both PC and Mac version when it's released) <br />
*	EverQuest II® (when released) <br />
*	EverQuest® Online Adventures™ <br />
*	PlanetSide™ <br />
*	Station Pass™ Games (Infantry™, Cosmic Rift™, Tanarus®) <br />
