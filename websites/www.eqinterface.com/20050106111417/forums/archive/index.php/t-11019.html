<br />
Has anyone gotten the target color box to work in any other window besides the Target Window?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;sigh&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llaffer</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I did to work around this was to swap the contents (and the names of the screens within the files) of my target and player windows.<br />
<br />
So I now have my Target window working like my player window, and my player window acting as the &quot;timer&quot;.<br />
<br />
Here is what I have it looking like now.  I'll get it available to download as soon as I get some of the things cleaned up that I want done first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I changed the player window to not show any information and only be a background for the Attack-border.<br />
Then made the target window transparent and overlapped it over the playerwindow.<br />
<br />
It's kind of difficult to explain so see the attached picture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit...<br />
I figured out how to DL your mod and it is great except one small tiny thing I would like different.  I would like the life percent to the right of the mobs name.  I am going to compare my existing player (as target ) window and see if I can figure out what to change... but Im betting I cant. I havent successfully modded any files yet... I just grab pieces I like from everyone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunleyg</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too have a playerwindow as a my targetwindow.  Laffer what code did it take to make the 'targetwindow' turn the con color?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llaffer</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I had my player window using target window information, and only the target window can have the color change:<br />
<br />
 Back up the EQIM_PlayerWindow.XML and EQIM_TargetWindow.XML files<br />
 Copy the contents from one file into the other so that EQIM_TargetWindow.XML now contains all of the player information that used to belong in EQIM_PlayerWindow.XML, and visa-versa In each file, there is a Screen Item XML section near the bottom that contains all of the pieces sections.  These need to be put back so that TargetWindow is in the EQIM_TargetWindow.XML and PlayerWindow is in the EQIM_PlayerWindow.XML.<br />
<br />
Then your TargetBox con colors will work.  You'll have to edit the TargetBox.TGA file to fit the dimentions of your TargetBox.  I'm still working on that part of it so it does what I want it to do.  I'll publish it for others to use when I'm done with it.<br />

This help?</div></div><hr />
