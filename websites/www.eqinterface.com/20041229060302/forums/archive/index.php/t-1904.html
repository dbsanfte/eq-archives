<br />
One thing I am getting a lot of request for is expanding the download section with some further &quot;Sort by's&quot; including Newest, Author, and Date added.. <br />
<br />
We are working on it.. we want to make sure the site is stable as is before we expand to quickly. So we have heard your request and we are listening. Just give us some time<br />
<br />
By the way just to share some trivia with yout from Sept 1st to Sept 5th we had more that 1,500,000 hits (both eqinterface &amp; eqgui combined)<br />
