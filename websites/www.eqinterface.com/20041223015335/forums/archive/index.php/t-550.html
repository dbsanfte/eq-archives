one sad note on the XML capabilities Verant gave us...they didn't give us the ability to make Macro buttons -=( <br />
<br />
It's a pity....buttons on the Pet Window are hard coded ....and yes, you can click on them, hold for about 5 seconds, and they will pick up and become macros you can place in Hot Buttons....<br />
<br />
Cool thing about them is they don't put that annoying <br />
/pet attack<br />
/pet attack<br />
/pet attack<br />
/pet attack<br />
/pet attack<br />
<br />
in your text cache (the one you access with Shift+Up/Shift+Down)<br />
<br />
But, we also can't make a button to send text to chat...which really sucks...cuz a &quot;/pet health&quot; button would be cool<br />
<br />
Also, another thing that would be cool (and maybe we just haven't figured out the numbers cuz they're hiding them from us)...having pet buffs in a listbox like friends...now, that'd be sweet....<br />
<br />
I'm working on a full conversion of my UI and I'll post it when I'm done....the pet window is actually kinda cool the way I have it set up (it's a surprise...can't show it til it's done)...and I'm working on a way around that annoying Friend Window...to make it more useful....<br />
