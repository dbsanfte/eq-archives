<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khaozerker</div><div class="date">10-22-2004, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the 70-80 range usually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neori</div><div class="date">10-22-2004, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the longest time I was using a monitor that was unusually dark, even at its max gamma/brightness settings.  About a year ago I finally got my hands on a good standard brightness one (even has an &quot;ultra bright&quot; setting, which is a bit too bright even for me) because the dark one was killing my eyes.  So now I don't have to turn up the gamma settings in every game to nearly 100% just to make normal daytime brightness look like daytime and not dusk.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DOACleric</div><div class="date">10-22-2004, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">15% here.  I like dark, rich colors.  Anything higher than 25% and everything gets too bright and washed out.  I prefer night time to be dark and creepy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">10-22-2004, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep the in-game setting at 100 percent just so I can take screenshots that don't look really dark.  I adjust my video card and monitor settings to compensate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aramil Dannodel</div><div class="date">10-22-2004, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually depends on how tired I am...but 95% of the time, it sits at 31%.  I prefer darker shades, because of my photophobia, but I find that anything below 20% tends to be more a strain on the eyes to distinguish things individually than a help on my shyness to brighter sources of light.<br />
<br />
I mostly use the UI I modified and put up, so you can tell that I prefer darker colours right away (it's mostly grays and blacks; shades in between).  I also tend to keep a lot of my windows near transparent, as I prefer to not have them be totally opaque and block any field of vision beyond.  I know I could set my UI to wrap around the visible area with the /viewport command, but that still makes me feel as if I'm being robbed of viewing area, as it makes your viewable portion (albeit, still seeing everything, even what is obscured by the windows) smaller...one of the main reasons I bought a bigger monitor was to get away from that.  Helps me focus, I suppose, just like the darker gamma settings...also why in Windows, I have the backgrouns set to a gray, instead of a white (which is Microsoft's default), as it's much easier on the eyes.<br />
<br />
Heh, just a touch off-topic, on this one, but all the same...31%.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Side note.../agree 100% with DOACleric.  Heh.<br />
