<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After Microsoft has decided to chuck Win98 to the wind beginning in January, I've been on the prowl for a new OS.  I've seriously contemplated Lindows because personally I'm fed up with Microsoft's &quot;pay us out the ass for our product&quot; philosophy.  However after doing several searches on playing everquest in a linux environment, I've come to the conclusion without other 3rd party software this just isn't possible.  I also found this little tidbit in an article dated from 1999 on IGN.com:<br />
<br />
The Linux version of EverQuest, renamed eVErqueST v0.302.00.4ac, will also be custom-made for Linux users. &quot;We decided to make the Linux version an entirely text based role-playing game. Your ultimate quest will be to decipher the counter-intuitive interface. With the included 4,203 page manual, it will only take most users three or four years to create their first character,&quot; Goudemon told us. &quot;And the best thing about the Linux version is that it will be completely free.&quot; <br />
<br />
Verant confirmed that there will be separate servers in place to handle the increased EverQuest traffic, and that Mac and Linux users will have their very own proprietary servers. &quot;We're expecting over a hundred Mac users to sign up within the first year or two and we figure the Linux version is good for at least four or five new subscribers over the lifetime of the game,&quot; Goudemon said. Look for the Mac version to be out sometime in 2001 with the Linux version slated for a 2006 release, about two years after the death of Linux.</div></div><hr />

Wow they got you with almost a 4 year old article.  hehe<br />
<br />
As for EQ running on Linux.  You'll need a copy of WineX (http://www.transgaming.com/) and be prepared to pull your hair out configuring it.  As with anything linux.  If you don't have some kind of clue on what you're doing you are in for a long road.  <br />
I know several here have touted there awesome Linux skills and how they play EQ onLinux all the time.  While that's all fine and good, in reality, Linux is just not ready for standard dekstop use yet (I can hear the Linux Zealots pounding on my front door know with pitch forks and torches!).  Besides, unless EQ in the only game you play...  your choices are rather limited on much else.  In other words.  Games are not really being released for Linux.  I'm sure the new version of Tux Racer is neato though.  :D <br />
<br />
Anyhow, Unless you are a computer geek who likes hours of troubleshooting just get Windows XP and be done with it.<br />
If you do go for Lindows (Eeeww) I wish you the best of luck and I really hope it works out for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow i knew that was fake about a 1/4 through. Yeah i've thought about using linux then I thought about how I like playing gmaes more then configuring it to play the games i play now on it. While being able to play &quot;windows&quot; games on linux with ease would be about the coolest thing on computers ever it doesnt appear to be happening anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggun</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would love to see a REAL EQ for Linux version released. After Microsoft removed WinME from the market I knew it wouldn't be long before they force us all to WinXP just so they could break even for producing that vile pile of crap software. I tried WinXP with DirectX games, and XP chokes on the graphics and crashes repeatedly. And this time next year, It will be the only version of Windows available LEGALLY. With everyone unable to really enjoy there games while the hakers find #9,999,999,999 WindowsXP security exploit and reformat your Hard drive. I think Lindows is on the right track to trying to help us recover from this fate. All we need is more Software company's to create Linux versions of their games. Not Linux Guru's making hard to use, and glitchy conversion programs that simulate windows to run windows games. Hope Linux becomes more popular so that this may become a reality some day.<br />

Just my 2 cents....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hadnt even started to read the article when I saw Verant in the text and knew it was a fake. Very much so, if it was suppose to be a recent article, since Verant hadn't been part of SOE for some time now.</div></div><hr />
