<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">A_Nolan</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you all are very busy with the server update, but the Misc. Mod. section is getting to the point its will be hard to find anything except what is brand new. I was looking over main download page and noticed that several of the sections had no link in the java toggle and the side bar.<br />
<br />
The main section I noticed was the for the selector window that showed only four in it and when I checked in the Miscellaneous Modifications section and there were at least 7-10 in there so it might step up travel to that page and releave some of the congestion in that section to add a java toggle link.<br />
<br />
In addition there are: two merchant UI's which I thought went in containers (where mine are); multiple patches, which need there own section (imho); several spell guages; and a few pet windows. All of which have or should have there own section perhaps you could make multiple sub-catagories like in featured interfaces and complete sets for the rest (at least separate the ui's from the pure art only files ;))<br />
<br />
It would also help if  you were to post somewhere (if I missed please pm me) which section the EQUI files go in either by name and/or what they should contain (I have my player window in the target section due to the fact I use it as a player-vs-target instead of a info box). My main thought is about the merchant, loot, and give windows. I have my merchant and loot in containers and my give in Misc. all were approved, but as I said above the merchant and loot windows are also in the Misc. section.<br />
<br />
There needs to be some cleaning up of this section before it is to late.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the ramble<br />
<br />
Update:<br />
<br />
I thank the powers that be for cleaning up the Misc section looks much better :)</div></div><hr />
