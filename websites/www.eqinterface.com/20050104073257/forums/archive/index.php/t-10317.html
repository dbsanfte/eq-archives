So I was hoping someone could pull everything together for me. What I am looking for is a group box that has the healer warning box's for the group members and their pets with the life percentage listed (the one's that change color and start to flash when a person is below 40% health) as well as having distinct health bar's for both players and their pets. I apologise if I'm not clear, however if anyone is interested and have any questions as to what I'm asking for please post here and I'll respond.</div></div><hr />

Take a look at it if you think it is what you need go for it...  SvartenUI (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2505)<br />

Actually your group ui mode is what I'm using atm for my characters. I like that you have the percentage's and seperate bars for pets. Prior to changing my group window I used someone else's (I apologise as I can't find the exact one atm to give proper credit) that had the color bar and as a healer that noticable change sometimes made the difference for me being able to see who needs help especially with my hybrids and my druid where healing is only one of the things I'm busy with.</div></div><hr />
