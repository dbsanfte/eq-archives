Wish I had the skill to make any of the fantastic UI's available here.  So far I can download and install them and modify the inventory slots..  (hehe)  <br />
<br />
My efforts to add this Mez timer to a UI that I like have failed.<br />
<br />
Right now I am using the SolariaUI with a Horizontal Spell Cast Bar. I found that it is the easiest setup for my enchanter.  I am wondering if it is possible to add the mez-timer in the target box?<br />
I especially like the Mez timer made by blaineholmes listed below.<br />
<br />
blaineholmes Enchanter's Mez Timer w/consider<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I also like the: *<br />
<br />
Delta UI's &amp; the Ravven's enchanter version of Delta. <br />
<br />
*I wonder if it can be flipped for a more right-handed  screen target and hotkey box<br />
<br />
<br />
Or any of these:  **  <br />
<br />
EtasiUI<br />
EllyUI<br />
Infiniti<br />
Tablets future<br />
<br />
** If a horizontal spell cast bar and a mez timer in the target could be added.<br />
<br />
If it is possible this would be one happy little chanter.  Hope I am not dreaming<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leama</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Nendyyl for the suggestion.   Those timers are really great!  <br />
I would however, like to add *blaineholmes Mez timer* to a current UI. <br />
It is a 3 in 1 timer that could be a big help to enchanters with so many things going on at once.  <br />
<br />
My problem is that I can only get it to load with the default UI. <br />
(or one that I have added very limited elements to.) <br />
<br />
--&gt;So I am looking for help to modify any of the UI's I listed in the first post to include blaineholmes timer.  <br />
<br />
Or most any simple UI.   I need to see what is going on so a UI with not alot of fuss.  Ornate designs might be beautiful but they just distract me.  <br />
I am using the SolariaUI now with a Horizontal Spell Cast Bar that I added. <br />
<br />
*blaineholmes Description: <br />
This integrates 3 timers into the 'Target Window&quot;. One can be changed to match the duration of the mez line of spells and changes colors as it rotates so that helps remembering easy. Designed specifially for enchanters. <br />
Thanks,<br />
