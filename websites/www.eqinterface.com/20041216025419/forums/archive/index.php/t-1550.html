<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightWolf</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, bad news. I tried to resize all of the Quartz stuff (every pic, spell gem, everything). I succeded with a lot of stuff, and I could get it all done (already spent a few hours). Going through the animation.xml and resizing every number was tedious, but I did it. <br />
<br />
One problem though. YOU CAN&quot;T GET THE FONTS SMALLER. Why the heck did they start their fonts all on about 2. What the heck. How are we expected to make a ui for 800 by 600 when you can't shrink the fonts at all. This really bites. I could go through and resize as small as I can get it, but it would be almost the exact same sizes since the fonts can only reduce by about 4/5ths. This is so amazingly freeked up. No matter how much you shrink this dang stuff, it will ALWAYS take up over 50% of the danged screen in low resolution. Why the heck would they even support a ressolution that they aren't prepared to adapt to? I always thought the 800 by 600 was a little crowded and when the new ui came out I though &quot;Cool, now I can resize stuff and get rid of clutter&quot; BUT NO, they went and made their fonts way to big for any res under 1020. This is the most fricked thing ever<br />
<br />
&lt;I am seriously mad, and I typed everything I would have said in RL, I almost never cus. But I almost never get mad either, and this is really ticking me off.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
FINE, I guess I'll go ahead and post &lt;/rant&gt;<br />

S.    so until they resize their fonts, I'm postponing my resize project.  (not trashing it yet, cus it'll still be a good mod when able to complete)<br />

heh, I gave my self some cool down time before posting this PS :)</div></div><hr />

You need a vacation! C'mon, i dev software and it's impossible to foresee every single aspect of a massive change like the new UI. That's why the /feedback command is in game.<br />
<br />
Let's be constructive. Ev1 always gets on VE's bum everytime a little thing goes wrong. They are humans as we all are, they make mistakes.<br />
<br />
I mean they did something right no? The DID create EQ, a new breed of drugs that poisons all of our minds!<br />
<br />
So let's help instead of blaming and make it an even better game... use the /feedback or /bug command in game and just state the nature of the problem :)<br />
<br />
Trust me.. you'll live a healthier and longer life by breathing deeply before ranting.<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the size has always been an issue with low ressolutions.  in 800 by 600, it's always taken up over 50% of the screen.  You would have thought that they would have created font sizes that look good in each of their &quot;supported&quot; resolutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guhldan</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those font sizes come from HTML.  Go talk to the W3C people.  (World Wide Web Compendium)  Basically, a size of 2 is an 8 pt. font size.  A 1 is 7.  A 3 is 10, and so forth.  You can use negative numbers, but I don't think you'd be able to read the text if it did load it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;size&gt;2&lt;/size&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;size&gt;3&lt;/size&gt;<br />
<br />
and 1 is very small, and 3 is fairly large... how small did you want it to go?<br />

Not exactly a news flash :p<br />
<br />
But i feel your pain, nothing worse then working your ass off then getting derailed by something retarded and out of your control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightWolf</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In 800 by 600 resolution,  &gt;1&lt; is not small at all.<br />
<br />
and the interface won't allow negative numbers from what I've tried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Game was designed for a large 640x480 ungly arse screen with Font 3 being equiv to, I think about a 10 pnt font. 2 is around 8 and 1 is around 6 or 7. (Maybe it's 12,10,8 - 12 is been the &quot;standard&quot; font sizes around I've seen)<br />
<br />
If you want small, increase your resolution. At 800x600, everything's gonna look big. That's the nature of the resolutions, not VI.<br />
<br />
Don't blame VI cause they didn't develop something to your liking.</div></div><hr />
