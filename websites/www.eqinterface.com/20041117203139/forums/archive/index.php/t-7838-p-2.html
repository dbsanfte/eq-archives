I'm not certain what OldCrow is asking precisely, but I know that, for myself, I would owe you a great debt if there were a hotbutton-only mod arranged as above, the exact same size as the SpellGem 2x4 mod.  :D  Only as time permits, of course.</div></div><hr />

One thing i noticed though is during an LDoN adventure, the blue marker isn't accurate and brings you someplace else.  Any idea on how to fix this?<br />

I also tried DLing different compasses but all it does is make it a smaller version of your current one.  I use Blue.  Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />

The chat box as well is a dark blue almost a black and not that... clean, slate black look it should be.<br />

And the last thing is my hot buttons.. intead of the solid color with the small number as shown.. mine have a big hollow number in each one.<br />

Only issues I had was that the map was too small and that the blue line indicator for a LDON adventure didnt work for me. I just saw that you have a mod directory which makes the map the default size so I will try that when I get home. I also noticed that someone else commented about the LDON blue marker. Thanks again for the great UI.</div></div><hr />

If you check the mods folder, there is a folder that says compass default size.  Using that mod should fix the LDoN blue line issue.The compass that comes normally is smaller then default which is why the blue line is a smidge off.  Uploading the Mod should fix the blue line issue.  The compass mod is in the latest version 1.7</div></div><hr />

I hope this gets fixed asap ;)  I love this UI, and am not in the mood to get &quot;used&quot; to another one.</div></div><hr />

It does all you have to do is expand it from the right side.  Put your mouse over the right side and make the box bigger the pet buffs will then show.<br />

PS, I am also getting the square boxes with the buff windows.</div></div><hr />

Find the EQUI_BuffWindow.xml and the EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml , open them with notepad, find the line <br />
<br />
&lt;Background&gt;t_blank.tga&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
<br />
Delete it.<br />
<br />
No more black boxes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with the black boxes seems to be a problem with .TGA alpha channel and the DX9 engine..  Got that fixed..<br />
<br />
I was working on the targeting ring.. I kept logging in and out to see the changes.. Now I can't log in at all.. I've been getting the 1018 Message for the last hour..<br />
<br />
So, The targeting ring will have to wait for now.. Just delete TargetIndicator.ini and all the TargetIndicator.tga files..<br />
You can use the default indicator for now.. Or find another working ring from the downloads here on EQInterface..<br />
I will try to get it working when I can log in again..<br />
<br />
Anyway.. I attached a fix for the blank.tga.. Should fix the visual problems with the Buff Windows and the Hotbutton window.. <br />
Just unzip into your tablets directory and overwrite everything.. (If you are using a buff window from the mods folder, You'll have to recopy it) <br />
<br />
Burgger: I looked at that file.. It seems to be a Vert player window mod..  I tried a couple of quick fixes but they didn't go as planned.. I will make a window that mimics it as close as I can.. Also I will get to  the other 4 or 5  request I've had.. But, I've been very very busy lately and haven't had much free time at all..<br />
Sorry..<br />

<br />
I tried that patch you posted above, but after loading the UI with that in, it resets to the default UI.  Am I missing something?  And do I need to rename or do anything else with that &quot;t_blank.bmp&quot; file included in there?<br />
<br />
Thankfully the black boxes don't seem to be causing any video lag problems, but I didn't hang around on it for very long... it might be that the error log file hadn't built up much yet and eventually it would and destroy the framerate.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for this little glitch to get smoothed out.  This UI is my favorite.  I'm so used to it that using any other UI feels strange now, LOL  :)</div></div><hr />

Some have it and other's don't.  Supposedly deleting all the files from  your maps folder and re-patching seems to fix the problem.  According to the eqlive site there is a fix in the works,  maps are only supposed to be 1-3 and i guess some weren't and when EQ tried to access the map it was causing the crashes or something like that.  I am guessing this next patch should fix the problems, they are going to code the maps to looks for something specific and if it can't find it to just load the default instead of crashing or something.  I know this probably doesn't help a lot.  Check the eqlive forums.  But the main suggestion was to delete all maps and re-patch and hope that you can load your custom maps once this latest patch goes through to fix the problem.</div></div><hr />

The pink problem is due to something that came up in the last patch.  Remelio posted a fix for it, and so far I know it works on the Vert mods (or at least the person who tried it said it worked for them).  I haven't had a chance to test it on the Tablets mod yet.<br />

<br />
If you haven't already noticed a new version of tablets went up.. It is mostly fixes for the god/dx9 stuff.. The only new mod is a melee player window with Str Sta Dex Agi on it for Burgger to check out..<br />
<br />
I also made a new target ring graphic with matching assist and mark rings.. However I do not have GoD and haven't been able to test them..  The marked number on the ring may not correlate to the one next to the mobs name..  I haven't been able to see them in action either.. a screenshot would be cool.. <br />
<br />
I also wasn't able to test the target of target window.. Would be great to know it works..<br />
<br />
Grekar &amp; Mage: I will look at it. Don't think it should be that hard..<br />
<br />
Jadormdrache: I will do a pet window with clickie slots on it for melees or non-pet classes. However CCake.exe will not work with it..<br />
<br />
Blakbird: Glad you like it!<br />
<br />
mareeuh: It may not be 100% yet.. I will make it available for download, After I get enough confirmation that everythin is working ok.. <br />

I can still use the UI from before the GoD patches, but I know it is not current.  Been busy since GoD came out, but I'd really rather not play at all if I can't get the UI to work properly.  Any suggestions?  Not the most technical of people here, so maybe some sort of simple fix would help.</div></div><hr />

Steppy, that AO ring isn't part of the download able UI so SHHH!<br />
<br />
all you can really do bearen is wait for the authur to update it, if he or she isn't going to or does not respond then best way is to do what you did, or post your UIerrors.txt file</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yevah</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would like to say that this looks to be a very nice UI and am hoping to be able to use it. I have followed the directions in the readme.txt and copied UI_TabletsBottom_1280_1024.ini and renamed the file into the main EQ directory.<br />
<br />
However, when I load EQ and then use /loadskin and select the Tablets_Blue folder (the one to which I unzipped all the files) nothing happens I remain with the default.<br />
<br />
The UI file changed the window layouts but the custom textures and colors did not take it seems.<br />
<br />
Let me also say that this is my first attempt at using a customized UI however so perhaps I am missing something else? Do I need to change any other files to allow customized UIs to be used etc?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yevah</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">... and they refer to folks like myself as N00bs!<br />
<br />
Figured it was likely something simple and went back to the EQGUI home page and stared looking through the FAQs. Well it took all of a minute to determine the issue was that I was useing a folder name with a space in it which I should have known to be a no-no in general anyway.<br />
<br />
I like the look thus far and am looking forward to a much enhanced EQ experience due to it. Love that the windows are still customizable too as I am a lefty and have grown very accustomed to having my hot buttons on the left.<br />
<br />
Would like to thank you for your time and effort in making these wonderful UIs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bag with ring, bp, neck, ear, 1st/2nd-hand, ranged and ammo shortcuts, is a thing i think all should have.<br />
<br />
I have add'd a few other things as well, but its really cosmetic.<br />
<br />
I have a request though, for a thing i couldnt find anywhere. A Vertical numorated Combat Ability's UI.<br />

I would apriciate if you could make one :)<br />

You then need to add these lines at the bottom of the file too:<br />
<br />

		&lt;Pieces&gt;Player_CurrentMana&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;Player_ManaSlashHolder&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
I just added them under the one for the HP entry.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neori</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When in doubt, the best thing is probably to pick up the latest version and start fresh.<br />
<br />
I usually rename the old UI install (like &quot;TabletsBlue&quot; renamed to &quot;TabletsBlue2&quot;) and then reinstall fresh to the original folder name (creating a new folder with the name you normally use, like &quot;TabletsBlue&quot; in my previous example).  That way if the new install of the UI works even less well, you can always ditch it and rename the old folder back to the original name and get back what might have at least been working somewhat before.<br />
<br />
But going with a completely fresh copy of the UI can sometimes rule out inconsistancies with older files or other files that conflict.<br />
<br />
So far my Tablets UIs are working (knock on wood), and I'm just waiting for Talyns to patch the updates in.  :)</div></div><hr />

I downloaded and installed Tablets Marble Blue v1.8 to a fresh directory and then set it up as I have Tablets Marble Blue 1.7 set up for my Warrior, and all is fine.<br />
<br />
However switching to my Mage and summoning a pet once again the pet window that I like to use is missing.<br />
<br />
I have made a post about this once before and on that occasion you claimed that this window was the default one, which I assure you it isnt, the default one for Tablets Marble Blue v1.8 is 'petinfo_thin'... I just double checked.<br />
<br />
I can't see the one I normally use in the mods directory. It has Buttons, Health Bar and Buff box. I can copy this over from my 1.7 dir to solve the problem, but it doesnt solve the ongoing problem that you seem to be missing this version from your releases now :(<br />
<br />
To help you identify the one I mean I am going to post the full xml for the pet window that I use, and the one that now seems to be missing from all your releases.<br />

I've tried many, many different ones and none of them have all of the features that Tablets have.  <br />
<br />
I would like to make a suggestion.  I was wondering if it was possible to make a spell bar sort of like the default one but add the names of the spells to the side.  Something not quite as big as the one in the mods.  Basically, just add the words, maybe in white text, off to the side of the spellgem but to where the background of the words is tranparent.  Kind of like the one here (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/p_large.php?id=2377&amp;tnow=1090353521)   only sticking with the tablets theme.<br />

Try casting a long spell and right click on the cast bar, it may be &quot;locked&quot; in place, so you'll want to right click and unlock it then you should be able to grab and move it.</div></div><hr />

I probably messed up and didn't include it :( I'll take a peek tonight. I know I did change the file. Before I do that...did you try expanding your AA window to see if the new tab is just off the end of the window?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ignore that, I didn't put the file in. I'll amend that first thing when I get home.</div></div><hr />

I did try to expand the AA window, but all I get is a move cursor and I drag the window around, but can't do any horizontal expansion.  Vertical expansion works fine.  Have the same problem in the Options window when I try to expand so that the latest video options aren't cut off on the right side.  I doesn't cause a problem for me as I can still adjust them, but is a little annoying.  Maybe something is wrong with my files.  I might try removing them and downloading a clean copy and see what that does.<br />

Thanks for your work on this.  I've grown to love Tablet UI as well.  But Since Tablet has a custom EQUI_Animations.xml file, which was also changed in the oow patch, shouldn't your update also include an updated EQUI_Animations.xml file??  I believe the only changes are the ones necessary for the inclusion of dragitems28 &amp; dragitems29.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. This stumped me for a few when I was fixing it. The EQAnimations.xml file in Tablets includes external files.  I think the one in this case is anim_dragitems.xml. I added the required entries to that file, just to maintain consistency with how Talyn did it.</div></div><hr />

Thank you very very much for working on these!  This is my favorite UI set (especially &quot;Future Blue&quot;) so I hate when patches interfere with it working smoothly.  Thankfully since I don't have OoW yet, most of the changes aren't critical for me ... but I still like to have a fully working UI, to avoid glitches and errors (or slowdowns due to problem files).  And so far it seems like the most recent updated version Talyns made works okay for me, but the game still complains about incompatible XML files.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing all the submods getting fixed too, since I use a handful of them.<br />

<br />
I would like to say sorry for lack of communication.. I'm not the most social person in the world.. I do try to read everything though.. <br />
<br />
This mod has become a virtual horror to update. :p It takes time to update! There are 10 Graphic versions out there.. Each need there own graphics sometimes.. Not to mention sometimes they also break my extra mods..<br />
<br />
I started a patch yesterday early in the morning but grew weary and needed sleep.. I saw that Caetenne made a patch and thought that would hold everyone over til the offical patch..<br />
<br />
I'm working on a patch that will fix the standard windows plus all the mods.. Also will add a new buff window mod.. I'm 90% done.. Hope to have the patches posted here in a couple hours.. <br />
<br />
Also.. Just like GOD.. I have no plans to order OOW.. Therefore, I have no way to test any of the OOW features..  So, when I release revision 10, if any thing isn't working like it should,  let me know!<br />
<br />
Caetenne :<br />
Thanks so much for the help.. I really appreciate it! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here they are:<br />
<br />
Instructions:<br />
1. Install a new copy of tablets 1.9<br />
2. Then Copy the contents of the patch to your new tablets folder<br />
3. copy all your favorite mods into the tablets folder<br />
4. have fun<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
All mods should be updated!<br />
<br />
In the mod SpellGems_4x2 is now garbage.. Delete it's folder if you want.<br />
In its place I added SpellGems_4x2+1.. Use that instead.<br />
<br />
I added a new buff window mod.<br />
It has the buff Icon and the name in yellow next to it. No blue or red  label &quot;banners&quot;..<br />
Folders are:<br />
Buffs_ClearLabel<br />
Buffs_ClearLabel_Reversed<br />
<br />
Also someone asked why I don't post/add screenshots:<br />
<br />
Well I don't post em cause they would be scattered all over the thread and that won't do any good.. If I add them to the zip file they would be more than half the size of the file.. Also, It takes time to actually take the 10 screen shots of each of the 30 some mods and crop them to a nice size.. <br />
<br />
Maybe if I get ambitious, I will start taking 2 screenshots for each mod.. One of StoneGrey and one of FutureBlue.. But that is still a lot of screenshots.. I already have to update the screen shots for every UI Description.. Thats 20 screenshots right there.. Ugh!<br />
<br />

One question was the spell bar window looks different now, the color that used to be around the spell icon (indicating DD; AoE, Buff etc...) is to the left of the icon now (it's a solid color block), wasn't sure if you meant for it to look like that or not b/c it makes the spell icon smaller now. If it could go back to the old way with the color around the icon that would be great. Thanks!<br />
<br />
Yes I changed the look of the spellbar.. It should look like a button though(not solid.) I had to compress them to fit them in the same space as before with one extra gem.. The icon didn't change size.. They are just a little closer together.. If you don't like them I included a mod (see above).. Only problem is it is taller than the default window included with tablets..</div></div><hr />

This should fix the XML error being reported by the eqclient.<br />

I attached the updated default file. If you use a HoTT window mod, you will have to make these changes to those files manually.<br />

Try the patch that unseenforces attached above this post..  And, see if that fixes it up for you..<br />
<br />
Kesmer: <br />
Did you try dragging the right side of the pet window.. <br />

Mythronder: <br />
Try resizing the options window by pulling on the bottom border.<br />
Sorry no picture :p<br />
<br />
unseenforces25:<br />
Thanks.. I love bug reports that contain fixes :)<br />
<br />
It's strange that I don't get that error.. Because I don't have GoD, I guess it doesn't report it for me.. I fixed two bugs in that window and missed those two.. I've never even seen that window in game.. Hope everthing works and looks ok.<br />
<br />
I will fix revision 10 and resubmit it soon!<br />

do you have chat boxes with input fields and chat boxes without input fields in the same UI? (at the same time during a user session?)<br />
<br />
No Sorry.. <br />
<br />
I wish they would add a way to remove TitleBar and InputField through the right-click menu in game..</div></div><hr />

Yes, The version in the download section should be 100% up to date to OoW.. However, I cannot personally confirm this.. I do not have GoD and OoW. The EQ client doesn't report errors for windows in expansions you don't own :(</div></div><hr />

First: I really like your UIs. They're pleasant to look at, but don't have too much stuff to distract from playing and I like the extras that the default doesn't have. <br />
<br />
Second: I don't have OOW and I have no problems. My financ has OOW and while there's no error message, he has the problem that if you have a NPC give you directions by marking the compass with a red line, it doesn't show the right directions (eg. it shows that you have to go north-east but you should go south, it works with the default skin). It however worked for me in an adventure (LDON), he had a OOW task where it didn't work out. <br />
I'm not sure if you can do anything about it, but I wanted to inform you. <br />
<br />
Regards, <br />
Illunyanye</div></div><hr />

The interface should be working 100% now.. I haven't heard of or seen any incompatible messages since my last patch..<br />
<br />
Illunyanye:<br />
Have you tried the compass_default_size mod in the mods folder?<br />
If not try it and see if that fixes it..<br />
<br />
Krash:<br />
Actually all the links were right at one time.. EQInterface and EQGUI upgraded the site and it moved some things around.. I'll get around to fixing them.. Sooner or Later :p</div></div><hr />
