You will know exactly what I am talking about.  In those games when a character is targeted there is a &quot;3D ring&quot; under them.  Looks like four equal wedges coming together in the center, a small amount of gap but not much between each wedge.<br />
<br />
Could someone make this into a target ring for EQ.  I no absolutely nothing about XML or even how to go about it.  I do use and love what is created here.  Just don't know how to do it myself.  No hurries, just if someone is bored.  They could take a look at the idea and let the community try it out. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the 3D thing... not sure what you mean by that. 3D might be impossible using the current UI. The best we could do is make an animation to simulate 3D-ness, but... yeah.<br />
<br />
If it's within my ability, I can try it =)</div></div><hr />

Was also pointed out that it is probably not going to be possible since the center of the wedges would disappear under the character.<br />
<br />
Thank you for trying :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right, they won't point in the middle.  What do you mean by the wedges were just outlines, like transparent in the middle with just a thin strip outlining them?<br />
<br />
I updated the target pic. See if thats any closer to what you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sedasi</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that is the closest it can get.  Would love the con color to match the target ring.  Well done.  Post it and I will gladly use it.<br />

Thank you very much :D</div></div><hr />
