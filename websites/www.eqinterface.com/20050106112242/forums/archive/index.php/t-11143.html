<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vandraad</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For reference, see the picture of where I'm starting here: http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1691<br />
<br />
Specifically, look at the Player/Group window and I'll explain what I've done and what I still need to do.<br />
<br />
I've taked the Player/Group window as shown above and cut out everything to the right of the % marks for the player HP/STA, etc.  The TGA file was cut down from 256x256 to 163x256 to keep the lines clean. Basically, the new window ends right after the 2nd column in the percentages.<br />
<br />
My problem now is that due to resizing of the window, the bars and their percentages now fall off the edge of the window. I've wracked my brain for days now trying to figure out how to reduce the width of those bars while still maintaining their correct proportional information.  Basically, I need the entire width of all the bars for the player + 6 group members reduced by 1 bubble as currently shown in that picture.<br />
<br />
How the heck do I do this?  All my attempts thus far has resulted in the physical reduction in the width of the bars, but the actual coloring and the corresponding %ages dont match.  It's as if the new reduced width bars cut off what's really there.  <br />
<br />
I'm lost..any suggestions?</div></div><hr />
