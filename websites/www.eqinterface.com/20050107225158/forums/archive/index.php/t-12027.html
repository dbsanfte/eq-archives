The vampire types and undead types in the BB-Gfay adventures and now just a simple texture I noticed in Nedaria:<br />

If this is any indication of how the graphics will change and look once the new graphics engine is live, I'm all for it.  Hill giants need a huge revamp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starshelle</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I agree. In fact I found myself wishing the player character models looked as good at the mobs designed in the last expansions.  I'm REALLY looking forward to the new graphic engine and have been crossing my fingers and knocking on wood that they don't screw it up like they did with Luclin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">¥oJimBo</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya, Luclin really did mess things up... lets hope that dont happen again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rredd</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. Luclin was same engin but new, more complicated models.<br />
<br />
A new engine is a whole new ball game - done right, they would be up to date with the latest and greatest Dx9 games out there.<br />
<br />
Not holding my breath!<br />

<br />
Hmm, to stay on topic.  I liked the luclin models in that it made the characters look older.  Rather than looking like a gaggle of 16 year olds, we all look 24 now.  Unfortunately, all of our armor looks exactly like everyone elses.  That, and I can't have my grey streak in my hair anymore.</div></div><hr />

i love the pc models that were put in....  they all look so smooth, not choppy or anything, like those hill giants :D <br />
heh, and some are a HUGE improvement, like ogres.... old ogres are bloody huge and ugly and obnoxious.... luclin ogres are streamlined in that htey aren't so wide, and they are actually kinda kewl, hehe<br />
but aye, i saw those frogs and thought KEWL...<br />
definately hope that's what the new engine will look like<br />
<br />
question about nedaria's landing.....  is there an actual zone line to get into it from JPF?   i looked and i oculdn't find one, had to use the Magus to get out...<br />
of there is one, could anyone tell me where?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azuth</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I once had all the luclin models on.  If I wasn't on a Ssra raid I would have logged and turned Halfling: male off.  My halfling friends looked horrid.  They looked more like tiny earth elementals than halflings.<br />
<br />
On a side note, unless you have a tiny god of a comp don't turn all models on.  I was actually lagging at the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play with all models on all the time and my computer isn't high end at all:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nwinn</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 01:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raids, or other places where you are standing with 70ish people in close proximity, are horrid with all models on for me... I have a similar setup but, 2x the memory.  I spend most of my time raiding with 35-71 other characters and I can't stand the lag when I have just 1 or 2 luclin models turned on. :\<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the models and their textures are not always designed at the size that they will be in-game... halflings look great regular size but, too pixelated when max grown... <br />
<br />
That frog you ss'd has a larger cousin in Plane of Storms that looks a little blocky but there are some mini ones in Plane of Water that look great... they're like 2/3rds the size of that one I'd guess.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, the designers don't really seem to account for the varying sizes when they create this stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">after looking at some exclusive images posted on castersrealm, im not too impressed with what they've done regarding the models of the creatures that have been posted over there.  I was expecting some flawless models, they still look blockish and not improved over Luclin models.</div></div><hr />
