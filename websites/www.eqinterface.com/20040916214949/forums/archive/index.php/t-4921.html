<br />
Anyways, please tell me what you think of this.  It will be (if I can make it work)  Large spell icons, and approx. 360x432 area as it stands now.  This is mostly for those of us who are click casters, and for people who want to be able to SEE artwork like TKing's or somebody else's.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem I have with it is the placement of the spellgem holders, kinda wonky, but let me know if you have any ideas.<br />
<br />
Any input I would be forever grateful,<br />

I just read the 'rest' of your message (I am tired - worked all night) I would make it look like the dragon is holding the spell gems.  Don't worry about covering part of the tail, it gives it that 3D look.  Just an idea, don't have a clue how to do it.  Will have to think about it.<br />

I am getting ambitious....lol.<br />
