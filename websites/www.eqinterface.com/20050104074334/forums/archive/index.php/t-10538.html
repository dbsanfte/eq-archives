<br />
I have found the Palidinus mod on your downloads site and think it is an excellent mod, really fits what I have been looking for.<br />
<br />
The only problem is it is not updated to work with LDoN and I have zero skills when it comes to making the fixes.  I have read all the different topics on getting the new pics to work etc, but I just get lost and am frankly worried about screwing up more than I could possibly fix.  I don't suppose the author (or anyone else with all these skills) could make the fixes for LDoN?<br />

Description: Folder name(Paladinus)<br />
This folder is a mixed and match of Tom King and Drakah and a few others. This is LoY compliant and runs smooth for graphics. None of this is my original work and what i have downloaded from the Tom King website and EQInterface .com <br />
