I'm sure that I'm missing a few, but you can find a complete list of supported video cards HERE (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/ts_video.jsp)<br />

You are using an unsupported Video Card, as is the ATI Mobility ones. (my laptop doesnt support it either!<br />

<br />
I had the same problems on my graphics with the wolves and other textures showing very strange.<br />
<br />
So, I did a search on the SOE site and this is what I did a while back.<br />
<br />
Here is the solution:  EverQuest: Textures appear mismatched or skewed in game. <br />
Open your EverQuest directory (usually C:\Program Files\EverQuest or C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest Trilogy). Click on the EDIT menu and select DETAILS. Sort the files by TYPE by clicking that column header over the file list. Look for files that end with a .txc extension and delete them. This is will clear the texture cache and allow it to rebuild properly. <br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
Yet another topic with little better description<br />
Here is the solution:  EverQuest: Why do characters, creatures and objects appear to have distorted or corrupt textures? <br />
If character creature and world textures appear garbled or corrupt you most likely have corrupted texture caching files. To repair this error you must delete all of the texture caching files from the EverQuest directory. Texture caching files are saved in your EverQuest directory with the file extension .txc.<br />
<br />
If you do not know how to locate your EverQuest directory, please take the following steps:<br />
-Double click the &quot;My Computer&quot; icon<br />
-Double click the &quot;C:&quot; drive (or whichever drive you have installed EverQuest to.)<br />
-Double Click the &quot;Program Files&quot; folder, then &quot;Sony&quot; and lastly &quot;EverQuest&quot; (this is the default location for EverQuest, if you specified a different location when you installed, please browse to that location.)<br />
-Once you are viewing the contents of your EverQuest folder, select &quot;View&quot; from the pull down menu.<br />
-Go to &quot;Arrange Icons&quot; then select &quot;By type&quot;.<br />
-Go back to &quot;View&quot; again, but this time select &quot;Refresh&quot;.<br />
<br />
You will now find all the files that end in .txc in one place in your EQ folder, and should delete them all by highlighting the file and pressing the &quot;Delete&quot; button on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
When you next run EverQuest your texture caching files will be recreated, but without the errors you previously encountered. <br />
 <br />
<br />
Here is the problem or goal: <br />
EverQuest: Why do characters, creatures and objects appear to have distorted or corrupt textures <br />

<br />
Can you at least tell me a fix is being worked on?  I posted what I'm seeing in previous messages:  When I'm in a spot with nothing blocking the horizon line, i can see the target indicator WAY off from the mob i'm targeting.  It's out of the zone axis, in fact.<br />
<br />
I have read that others have the same problem.  I just tried loading the test server and it still isn't working for me.<br />
<br />
I'm so fed up about this.  It's actually something that caused my dislike for the game so much that I've tried out other games and EQ just doesn't compete.  Especially with the lack of simple Quality Control before stuff like this hits the public.<br />
<br />
I know I'm not the only one with this problem.  I'd appreciate it if you helped the rest of your &quot;fan base&quot; besides the Radeon peeps.  Don't get me wrong, I'm happy their problems were fixed.  I just think it's our turn now, especially since my card is one of the ones listed on the &quot;supported&quot; list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kenny, that's not the point.<br />
Sony should be more methodical about testing their stuff BEFORE they release it to the public.  After all, that's WHY they have a test server.  <br />
<br />
Would you give your kid a candy bar and then turn around and tell him he can't eat it?  That's just not right.  If Sony is going to put this to the public, it should work for all or none.  I have no problem seeing similar effects on other games.  Why doesn't it work here?<br />
<br />
I think the fact of the matter is, Sony just doesn't care (and is probably not even working on a fix for others) because of the supposedly new graphics engine coming out.  Well if this is the case, they better release it fast.  I'm really sick of logging onto the test server only to be disappointed that it still doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

I have the 7500 (desktop not mobility). Before I would get kicked out after just a few moments on or if I moved a few steps then get the blue screen that said Error ATI3d1ag.dll and dumping virt. mem. Got to a point I wanted to kill my computer. ( or get a new Vid card. *grin* ) I'm just glad they fixed that issue. <br />
