<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krystae</div><div class="date">02-18-2003, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No matter what I do I cannot seem to comprehend this alpha channel thing.  I've modified my .xml's I've done a million other things to my UI but whenever my compass breaks I'm a mess.  Apparently my graphics program I use for my website image editing and everything else just doesnt' do this.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, if someone could take a look at my compass .tga file attached here and tell me how I can make these images actually show up in game instead of a blank nothing.  Is there an easy program somewhere that I can use to assign alpha channel stuff to my images or can someone do it for me or explain how to.  I'm super fussy with my UI and have it VERY customized to how I like it and this one window_pieces04.tga file is giving me a migrane hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help, suggestions,</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to learn how to make the alpha channel: Do a search on this site for Alpha Channel.. It has been explained a few times, for a few different graphic editors..<br />
<br />
Quick Explaination for Paintshop Pro:  Load the file and select everything you want to be displayed.. Then click selections.. Then Save To Alpha Channel.. Then Double Click New Channel (Or the existing alpha channel).. Then ok.. Save the file and you're good to go..</div></div><hr />
