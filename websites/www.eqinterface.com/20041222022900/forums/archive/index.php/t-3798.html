Brendan bumped into me in plane of knowledge while we were both LFG, now he is a 63rd level Epic Bard, I am currently a 53rd level bard (without epic).. Sooo you can guess who would have gotten a group first (neither of us got a group). <br />
<br />
After chit-chating about POP, he inspected me and said &quot;If you come to the bazaar i have some stuff that you could use.&quot; Soooo I followed him to the bazaar where he shared 3 items from his bard, and 1 item from his Warrior (big ol' Ogre). Now, the part of this that makes me mention him here. He didn't ask for anything in return, he actually was just trying to help another player enjoy the game and get farther along. <br />
<br />
Now I know there are people out there who help.. I am one of them.. But in the 50s and 60s people seem to get sooo tied up in the &quot;end game&quot; that I have seen people turn me away from a group because they were all 58-60 and I would pull down their XP.  Sooo Brendan's kindness had to be mentioned...<br />
<br />
Thank You Brendan! <br />

my 46 chanter has a very difficult time getting group.  And usually when I do get group its strictly as a secondary nuker.  Of late she's been running around PoK handing out results of the PoP baking recipes.  Its a good icebreaker and for the few plat it costs (as opposed to selling to NPC) I would rather make someone elses day.  Hopefully, they'll remember me when I want a group in the future.</div></div><hr />

I'm so glad that somebody else is havng the same problem. I'm finding it so difficult to find a group that my 50 Bard can join that's anywhere other than KC. Except for the one night I got lucky  and spent a night in the Plane of Innovation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldritch_goth</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's nice to see ppl helping out like that. I try to in my own small way, and the only thing i usually ask of those i help is &quot;do the same for somone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
   I've had a lot of ppl give me things as gifts just out of kindness. I have yet to sell any one of these things once i outgrow them. Instead, I look for someone lower level that could really use something like that, and pass it along.  (Right now i'm looking to give away a dagger of dropping)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too, much like Eldritch_goth give items to people once I have outgrown them. If it no longer benefits me and I have noticed someone in need of it I will donate it. My methods are different on how I do so. I usually go for the individuals who stand out of the crowd... These are your classic RP'ers. I will watch them to see how they fare, how they interact with me and others, and how much they RP. The more the better. And once I feel that they have 'proven' themselves, I will bestow upon them a gift. It's wonderful to see a person who wasn't expecting a magical item in their youthful years of adventuring to suddenly be handed an item without knowing it. And once the trade has been conducted, I wisk away with a well wish and and shout &quot;to do the same for others&quot;, followed by a jolly Ho Ho Ho! Beggers get coal. If I'm in the zone, I will watch for the naughty and nice! So ya better watch out!<br />

Its good to be the Klawz! :nana: <br />

I have been the recipient of such generous ppl and am very pleased with the items.  I also help people out, but I'm not of suffiecient level to help all ppl out so don't go raggin on me if I don't help you out and you're like 5 levels above me.  I'll always give a SoW or a Greater Heal if you are near and ask me for one.  yip<br />
