<br />
Any help?</div></div><hr />

<br />
copied UI folder, removed buffwindow XML file and loaded this ingame. The custom buffwindow is gone but the buffs still have the red line underneath the icons.<br />
<br />
Loading default UI, these lines are not present<br />
<br />
Must be something in my animations file perhaps? anyone with ideas?<br />
<br />
My UI isnt anything elaborate.. just a few windows, and the only thing i saw in patch that would possibly effect me was the dx9 file that was patched..</div></div><hr />

I also have the buffwindow2 but I have update the animations file with every patch, so dont understand why this is happening.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaulven</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have this problem. I don't know exactly what causes it.<br />
<br />
I was reminded of the older problem of having pink buff borders, or similar. Remembering that flipping your buff BMP vertically was suppose to fix (sorta) that, I decided it was worth a shot here.<br />
<br />
It seems to work.<br />
<br />
My buff window is custom, I don't even know its origin, but it comes with its own buff graphics bmp called buff.bmp. I flipped it vertically (aka, &quot;across the horizontal axis&quot;) and it worked.... The default UI has a buff icon BMP similar in function to this, and custom UIs probably have their own. Try using the &quot;pink buff icon borders&quot; fixes or flipping the image yourself. I used MS Paint.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't be more helpful, I only mess with this stuff when I have to.</div></div><hr />

My custom UI isn't on here.  It can be found here (http://www.mysstiewolfestar.com/cov/equi/mysstie_ui.shtml#buff) .<br />

Thanks for the tip!<br />
