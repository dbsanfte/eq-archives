<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mobutu</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5658&amp;highlight=a+vert+mix<br />
<br />
The pic there shows exactly the UI I want.<br />
<br />
However, the poster of the pic is not submitting it (likely he pieced it together and no longer remembers who to give credit to.)  So, we will never see this in mix &amp; match.<br />
<br />
Now, I know that it was made using various parts from around the downloads sections.  I found the Inventory screen, found the group window, and a few other pieces but am a bit confused.  What do I download to get the different buff icons?  If I download an alternate buff window, does is have its own icon settings or does it use the set I downloaded?  Does the spellbook use the same buff icons or does it have its own set?<br />
<br />
Please, help me make this UI -- links to what to download would be most appreciated.  I can figure out how to install it and stuff, I just don't have the time to wade through 50 billion downloads and I know many of you will know right from the pic what part is what.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am very sure you can make that your self by jsut downloading <br />
<br />
vert 2.2 (patch for 1/9) (go with neptune or nexium and it has the spell book ready to go)<br />
TT_inventory<br />
<br />
try that see what you get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mobutu</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded Vert_Neptune 2.2 and like it fairly well.  I've noticed the song window in 2.2 is not the really cool style buff window, I'll play with adding the vert buff window tonight.<br />
<br />
Could not get the tt_inventory to work with it, I figured all I needed to do was unzip that file into the vert directory but that didn't work, and I'm not a coder so I'll deal until someone uploads a working complete set, though I'm still going to try and play around with it as time permits and if by some miracle I get it to work I'll let you all know.<br />
<br />
On a side note, the vert_neptune readme mentioned a &quot;CCake2.exe&quot; or some such that is a simple configurator (is that a word?) for setting up what your extra 10 buttons are for, but this file does not exist, and I can't for the life of me figure out how to edit the EQUI_HotButtonWndw file or whatever it is that has all the stuff coded in.  But, I really like the UI and having all this information available, and in support of those who put in such hard work to have made it happen I'll be donating to this site when I get my next paycheck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">gotta download the patch 1/9/03 for the Vert 2.2 (look inthe patches forum) to get the song window correct.<br />
<br />
and I tried the TT inventory, and it work without any problem for me.. try unzipping on your desktop and drag the two pieces INTO your vert folder... instead of unzipping it into it. (bet it made a subfolder inside your vert folder)<br />
<br />
and Ccake has instructions in the folder, look for a Ccake folder inside vert.. if you dont see let me know i will attach it to a post here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mobutu</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, there is no ccake folder in the directory I unzipped to.<br />
<br />
Also, I see nothing about the bazaar window in the folder i unzipped Vert_Neptune 2.2 into.  ???<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mobutu</div><div class="date">01-24-2003, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Error gone  Post# 1 <br />
 <br />
The patch fixed the error message I was getting.<br />
<br />
Still can't get TT inventory to work with Vert, I did as you suggested and unzipped the files to a new folder, then moved those files from that folder into the Vert_Neptune folder and still won't load the UI -- just crashes out and puts me back in default (which is all messed up from having moved stuff around for Vert lol.)<br />
<br />
I guess I'm not too worried about it. Any chance, tho, of adding an autoequip spot to the Vert inventory? Or am I missing it?</div></div><hr />
