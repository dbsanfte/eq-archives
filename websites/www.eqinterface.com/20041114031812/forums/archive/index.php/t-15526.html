FINALLY! After sooooooo long I managed to get a working BETA of the new and improved Emulated: Worlds of Warcraft Interface (Version 3.0) completed for EverQuest. I think the Icons is really what took the longest /shrug.<br />
<br />
The files have been posted to the Supporters for full throttle testing.<br />
<br />
Approximatly 90% of the interface has been totally revamped and recoded from top to bottom. It looks as if it is now about 30% or so smaller than the original, and can be used in 1024 resolutions as well.<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of it thus far. <br />
Some things were not available at time of screenshot, for example, what it looks like when you are grouped, although the group window looks preety darn sweet with the new gauges.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is the Character Select Screen for your viewing pleasure.   :nana:</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Hitpoints number will be at the bottom of the screen so your eyes don't have to wander. There is also an option to have the Player and Target bars within the Group window for the same idea.</div></div><hr />
