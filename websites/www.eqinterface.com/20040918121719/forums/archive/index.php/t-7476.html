<br />
This will be the only place hosting it so please treat this site well (http://www.eqgui.com/donation.php).<br />

This is a utility that uses an easy-to-follow graphical interface to copy the contents of one of your character's UI INI files to another character's UI INI file. This gives you the ability to quickly set up multiple characters to use the same UI with the same window settings.<br />
<br />
It does not move or otherwise change your friends list, hotkeys, etc. and it also saves the UI INI you are overwriting before it writes any changes, making this utility risk-free. <br />
<br />
Please see the Readme file included with the zip for usage instructions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. It's a shame that the removal of this utility created more positive feedback than it ever got at release time or in the 2 months it was originally available. Think about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...hasn't it always been available under the misc. section of downloads?<br />
<br />
I dunno, I've had a copy on my system ever since I saw it first advertised on the boards, so... =P<br />
<br />
I use it all the time, especially when I switch UIs permenantly and like my alts having the same set up as my main. Very handy.<br />
<br />
The only feature I'd ask for is the ability to turn off the auto-backup. I generally don't use it, but I figure some do, so I wouldn't mind that option. If I knew how to code it, I'd add it myself for my own needs, but, yeah... =P<br />
<br />
Anywho, yeah, free bump too =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wasn't always available.  When I left EQ and at the same time became upset by a lack of feedback and even some outright flamage regarding all my releases (this was in December) I took them down from here and from my own site.<br />
<br />
Recently someone here tried to re-release it (giving me full props) but the copy they had seemed to not work right.<br />
<br />
I received a lot of feedback via email and several forums asking for it to be reinstated so voila - here it is.<br />
<br />
That's a decent idea you have there.  However, I don't have any plans right now to build a new version of GIC.  I'm already working on another, much larger EQ project that eats up my free time and attention.</div></div><hr />

At all, if I may add.  I'm not sure what it was that was causing it to mess up but I know there were a lot of people who downloaded, last number I remember was over 350, and I'm sure many people will be happy to get a working version of this.  I know I'll be downloading a copy when I get home. :)</div></div><hr />
