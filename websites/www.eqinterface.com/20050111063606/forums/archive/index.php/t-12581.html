<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DATAWRAITH</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Downloaded a new UI last night 10th feb 04, and followed the FAQ's and help on that I also read the readme file supplied with the UI, typed /loadskin and fair enough there was the file with the UI in, but wheni tried to load it up the screen did what is was supposed to (ie hang of a few seconds) but didnt change the layout of the screen. I went to the chatroom on EQ asked what server number i was on , got the info , filled the relevent info , but Im not sure if i have done it right. It was a KatnTKLore-fixed.zip   file and the readme said i was to adjust the unifiles line stating my characters name and server number..<br />
the line said something like unifile_name_servernumber.. now di i add my toons name after _name_ ( so its _nameotik_ ) or scrub out _name_ and put in _otik_ ?<br />
and the same for teh server number?.<br />
any help would be appreciated , TA VERY MUCH..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The .ini (which is short for initialization) file contains all the window postions and settings for the interface.  It is named like this (using my own as an example): UI_Lothay_tunare.ini<br />
<br />
The first part, UI, simply means that it is the initialization file for the User Interface. <br />
<br />
The next part, _Lothay_, is the character's name.  <br />
<br />
The last part, tunare, is the server name.   At one time the server name was not used.  Server's were refered to by a number.  This has changed. <br />
<br />
If the artist who posted the UI you wish to use included a file like that, they just meant for you to change the character name and server name parts (in the example, the blue and green parts).  The file contains all the window postions and settings.  <br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The UI_Name_Servername.ini file exists for all UIs (including default.) So to find what the file name should look like, just look in your everquest folder. There will be a UI file there for each of your characters and it will have the correct name format for your server. (So there should be a file there UI_Otik_AntoniusBayle.ini. NOTE: AntoniusBayle, as used here, may not be the correct format for server name, but it will be something close.) So just follow Lothay's  instructions and it should place all the windows in the correct positions.</div></div><hr />

You need to apply the changes to the file name before you load EQ (or if in windowed mode, while at the Character Select Screen) Otherwise the layout will not change and the file will be overwritten with the layout you have currently.</div></div><hr />
