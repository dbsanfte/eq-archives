<br />
His &quot;Narwael UI&quot; had a virus in it, to his credit he did tell me as soon as he found out. AND I have repaired it.. so if you have downloaded this file before 10pm PST on 10/3/02.. SCAN YOUR SYSTEM! <br />
<br />
I can not preach enough about scanning for viruses..  and having virus software installed!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kabbus</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was some other interface on here that I downloaded that came up listed as a possible virus too.  Although the author just made fun of my choice of virus scanner.<br />
<br />
Of course I just deleted the interface instead.<br />
<br />
Frankly my opinion is that none of these interfaces should be popping up any virus scanner warnings.  There is no excuse for it on the authors end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LeonneofInny</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are the files I have downloaded in the last 24 hours:<br />
<br />
timer_graphics_slider.zip<br />
xirinia.zip<br />
Tosevite UI - Compass.zip<br />
<br />
My virus log reports these virus:<br />
Nimda&quot;e&quot;<br />
Nimda&quot;a&quot;<br />
<br />
Luckily, this wasn't the infamious &quot;bugbear&quot;, but it could have been bad as I have a network of 5 computers.  I'm not sure which of the above files it was, but I will have my virus protect on when I open any more files from this site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
