<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mykol</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all -<br />
<br />
It started getting to be a mess recieving requests for tweeks to mods/skins and delivering them.<br />
In addition to this, I found that there seemed to be a number of people that would use a custom UI, if they didnt have to get technical enough to configure it.<br />
So, that started me down this path............<br />
<br />
uibuilder (http://uibuilder.eqinterface.com/index.html)<br />
Select the &quot;UI Builder&quot; link.<br />
<br />
You can enter in your desired skin name, select from a list of mods, build your skin, then download it.<br />
<br />
I use a hybrid of Vert/TKing/Remelio mods.<br />
So the base skin is vert 1.0<br />
(I will be looking into vert2.0 later)<br />
<br />
Included currently:<br />
- TKing spell books<br />
- Remelio TKing mods<br />
- TKing and Raxthorne Icons<br />
- Several player windows (int pet caster, wis pet caster, melee, bard etc)<br />
- Couple different HotKey Windows.<br />
<br />
I know the server will likely be a bit slow.<br />
If people, in general, like this type of tool I will look into some &quot;real&quot; hosting solutions.<br />
<br />
Looking for some feeback,<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

perhaps some browsers dont like that, I'll change that tonight and see if that fixes it.<br />
Possible that you use something other than netscape or IE?<br />

Its my stupid mistake of not storing the pictures with the .jpg extensions.<br />
IE dont care, but the good browsers do hehe Bit by Micr0s0ft once again!<br />
<br />
Regarding the EQUI File, another stupid mistake by me, that is a .bmp screen shot of my ui from some point.<br />
I missed taking that out, when I was creating the default files.<br />

Let me know if you notice any bugs.<br />

Also, <br />
If you downloaded a complete skin recently and had troubles loading it, it was a bug that i produced. It should be fixed now, just clear out your skin directory and redownload it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Vert 2.2 Skin worked AWSOME!!!!This is a great website for mixing and matching parts you like all in one easy format.  My question is if you want a diffrent color besides the Green is it possible to put in the diffrent colors out their like the Steel, Rose color, Purple, the Crystal Meth Blue and the others out their.  I was wondering if those selcections could be made for those window colors files be included in the selection?<br />
<br />
Also would you be intrested in a Container window mod I have that I did not make but I havent seen it any where on EQinterface.  This container window has the Range, Ammo, Primary, and Secondary slots at the top of the container for fast switch.<br />
<br />
Also just currious do you have any plans on putting diffrent Mods besides the 2 vert versions?  I personaly use the Vert 2.2 with EQAtlas and Athlees Loc Wizard in the feedback window.  <br />
<br />
Just thought I would leave you some feedback.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your great work on the website.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mykol</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback.....<br />
<br />
Ya, let me tell you whats on my plate/back of mind currently with this.<br />
<br />
1. Get a better method of giving the appropriate &quot;kudos&quot; too the mod writer/developer. (For example Sokol has done all of the vert2.2 mods, yet his name is no where in site)<br />
Perhaps some description fields in there, somewhere, for that.<br />
Maybe if not a description field, a resource or &quot;credits&quot; page from main page.<br />
<br />
2. Add the tking/remelio casting bar too the vert2.2.<br />
<br />
3. Different colored versions of the themes.<br />
    (this should be easy, but i havent looked into it deeply yet)<br />
<br />
4. Containers, Target Windows, etc that are missing from both vert1.1 and vert2.2 sections.<br />
<br />
I was trying to decide whether too add the vert2.2 section first, or add the rest of the desired functionality to the existing scripts.<br />
You can see which owned me :P<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten too many bug emails yet, and none that I haven't been able too hit myself on the head and fix semi quickly.<br />
I wanted too make sure this wasn't going too be too intensive on the machine and that the code wasnt too buggy.<br />
We are mostly past all that, on with MORE content!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps with knowing the planned direction.<br />
<br />
As always, the more feedback (good or bad), the better!<br />
<br />
mg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mykol</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Litte more since I didnt answer all your questions..<br />
<br />
1. ya send me the container mod.<br />
<br />
2. I doubt I will add other entire skins (unless another vert release), but I have also in the back of my head a section where you will be able too select multiple mods called something like &quot;Extras&quot;<br />
This would be where you see stuff like the Atlas mod, and Remelio casting bar, timers, etc.<br />
<br />
But granted, #2 above is a few weeks away, I have some file layout thinking to do about that one.<br />

Did you make any selections on the left hand side on all the diffrent options?  The only thing I could think of that could cause that is if you didnt select any of the mods.</div></div><hr />

You download the zip file off that website then you can use the maps off his site bye saving them to your hard disk in the folder eqatlas after you get all the maps you want to unzip the program and run the program he made it has a read me.  Muse of Eqatlas made it quite clear in a thread that since he made the program he wants people to download from his site.<br />
<br />
Thought I would let you know on that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just tested it and no problems on my end with the diffrent colors.  I chose the Golden Rod one because I am always broke so I hope it would show me the MONEY!!! Now we just need a Platinum look one so that would be better :D .  I thought that would be better then the Red Roses one unless I gave that look to my wife but then she might want Dozen Red roses all the time and that would be taking away my MONEY!!!:o <br />
<br />
Well I guess that is enough ramblings.  Wanted to give you feedback no problems on this end.  One thing I did notice though is that the Gold color only showed up on the Primary, Secondary and Range slots in the back ground color.  Not the Ammo or any of the other inventory slots.  Not sure if that is in your code or would that be a issue with parts of the Vert Mod or what not.<br />

Actually what you want to do is unzip the file in a folder off of  :/Everquest/uifiles/ The way the website was designed the zip is it will create a folder of the name that you named your UI when you created the skin on the site.   After this go into the everquest and type /loadskin &lt;name&gt; 1. <br />
<br />
<br />
Also as a note you can do a /loadskin [Enter] then you will get a list of all the Skins you have in the UIfiles folder.<br />
<br />
Hope this info helps and that it works.<br />

If you have a fast connection (Broadband of any type) your browser may still be looking at a dead link from the first time you tried to access the link. There is a discussion and fix that I saw on the screensavers site (http://www.thescreensavers.com and search for info.) I know this isn't the fix, but it might explain the link problems people are having.<br />

<br />
I was a long time advocate of not messing with the UI.  Just Tried this ui builder v1.1 (or 1.0 whatever it said), took about 15-20 mins looking through everything, selected what i liked, and downloaded.   <br />
<br />
I logged into EQ and typed /loadskin custom   and then it went to the default window.  So i tried again /loadskin custom (thinking I might have spelled &quot;loadskin&quot; wrong or &quot;custom&quot; wrong).  Back to default crappy eq window.  So for some reason i thought to try /loadskin custom 1  and /loadskin custom1  but both of those said &quot;no, sorry, you have to use the default skin kthxu...&quot; <br />
<br />
I am impressed with how easy it is and was very excited to try something new.  BUT, once again I was dissappointed by skin alterations.   <br />
<br />
Anyone have a suggestion?  Please let me know.  Do i have to use the 2.2 section only?  if so, I was much less impressed with that then the 1.0 area.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your hard work on this.  Let me know what i can do!<br />

You can also do a /loadskin (with no name after it will show you a list of possible UIs you can choose from) see if anything is their besides the default.  You might have installed it wrong or gave it a diffrent name then Custom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mykol</div><div class="date">10-12-2002, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what name did you type in for your skin?<br />
lets say you used &quot;myskin&quot; as your name.<br />
after you extract the zip to you program files/everquest/uifiles folder, it will create a subfolder named &quot;myskin&quot;<br />
<br />
Then you have to do a /loadskin myskin in game.<br />
<br />
If you dont enter a skin name, then you will get a zip called something like modbundle4321.zip.<br />
and after you extract that it will create a modbunble4321 folder in your uifiles directory.<br />
This is for the ppl that want say just a certain spellbook, they would have to copy the contents of that modbundle folder over to their current skin.<br />
<br />
you didnt mention the skin name you typed in, looks like you might have not typed one in, or are trying to load a skin that doesnt really exist. (i.e. that doesnt have a uifiles/skinname direcotry)<br />
<br />
If neither is the case, let me know all the selections you made, and I will verify it works here.<br />

<br />
I bet that &quot;copy of the default&quot; folder is old<br />
<br />
thats the reason you dont ever copy that folder.<br />
if you copy it, then VI comes along and adds files or changes default files to the default folder, you will be out of sync and it will cause this.<br />
<br />
leave default folder as is, and make a custom folder with only the custom skin files you want.<br />

<br />
Downloaded my modbundle, extracted the mod bundle into the uifiles directory.<br />
<br />
did a /loadskin once I was inside<br />
<br />
it gave me a choice of 2 default, and ModBundle7269<br />
<br />
Did a /loadskin Modbundle7269 it promptly told me it couldn't load and went back to default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mykol</div><div class="date">10-14-2002, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the modbundles wont work as entire skins, themselves.<br />
The purpose of the modbundles is to add files to an existing skin.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
I created &quot;mykol&quot; as a skin.<br />
and Mykol added new icons to the uibuilder I want to try.<br />
So I created a modbundle of just those icons.<br />
But at that point you would have to copy the contents of the modbundle folder to the &quot;mykol&quot; folder, and overwrite the exisiting files.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

After the patch it no longer loads. I've tried just about everything I can think of short of formating my computer and putting everything back on it(yes I know that has nothing to do with it. hint the sarcasm of it).<br />
---<br />
 I liked the UI I made very very much for my Monk. The hotkey/iventory was VERY! usefull for me as I'm always switching weapons around to match with what is going on in my group(from 2HBlunt to two high damage low delay H2H or 1HBlunt's for when something agro's and healer is oom). I've been looking all night for something I could use as a substitue untill something is figured out, but I've had no luck finding anything like the one you guys had on the builder. I refuse to use default becaseu... Well because it sucks.<br />
 =o( Guess I won't be playing my Monk untill I, or someone else, figures this out.<br />
---<br />
 And yes. It's installed properly... I'm typeing in the correct folder. I've spent 3hours trying to get my old UI I got from the builder to work again but to no avail. So please don't responed to my post saying 'did you type in the correct folder /loadskin blah blah' 'is it in your uifiles dirrectory'<br />
 I don't wanna sound rude right there honestly, cause I know you guys are really trying to help the people that can't get theirs to work right. But yes it is in the right spot, right folder, ect ect ect ect ect ect. I dunno why it doesn't want to work anymore. So is that two of us people that can't get our UI from the builder to work? =o( Our comps must be gimp.</div></div><hr />

However, if you want a jump on the fix, do this:<br />
<br />
1. Backup your custom skin directory in uifiles in case this, for some reason, doesnt work.<br />
<br />
2. Download the patch.<br />
<br />
3. Open your ./uifiles/customskin/EQUI_Animation.xml file with a program like WordPad.<br />
<br />
Add the follow lines to the end of the file but BEFORE the &lt;/XML&gt; tag.<br />
<br />
code: <br />
 	&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_CheckBoxNormal&quot;&gt;<br />
 		&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
 			&lt;Texture&gt;window_pieces01.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
 			&lt;Location&gt;<br />

 		&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
 	&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
 	&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_CheckBoxPressed&quot;&gt;<br />

This will hopefully avoid the spam of downloads caused last time the UI was tweeked by VI.<br />

Thanks,<br />

I'm just having one small problem:  I can't get a group window to display. Everything else I selected is there (and working perfectly) except the group window. Am I doing something wrong?<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Try Alt-P and see if that brings it up. It's also possible that it somehow got stuck behind something else, thus hiding it. I'm not sure of any &quot;quick fixes&quot; for that other than just moving everything around until you find it :(</div></div><hr />

While I had cut and paste various mods into xml and had to 'wing it' to make something to my own taste.. your UI builder is far more user friendly and efficient. Thank you so much for creating this useful tool.</div></div><hr />

It has to be in the &quot;uifiles&quot; folder of the eq dirrectory.  Then in game u type, &quot;/loadskin ( skin name here ) 1&quot;, with out the quotes and paranthesis of course.  That 1 tells the game to keep the window settings that you currently have.    :D <br />

  I will be using one for my warrior tonite. My wife uses one for her Chanter and loves it. You have done a great job on this /applaud <br />
<br />
 Will there be sections geared more for each class or are you going to keep it the same format it is in now? I have yet to see a Warrior or Cleric *new* animation ... is there one in the works? <br />

I noticed on the Sars that the Bazaar window and search is outdated for it doesnt have the search by money prices down in the bottum.  I did extend the bottum still didnt show up.  Also when using Sars interface with the TKings class Animations do not show up in the Autoequip box.  I am not sure if you have recieved feedback on those parts or not.<br />

Keep up the great work I love your site.  Maybe once again I will bump in to you like about a week ago in PoI I was the Gnome Warrior hehe....<br />
