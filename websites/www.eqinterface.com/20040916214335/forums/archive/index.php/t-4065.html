<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">11-17-2002, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new one looks a lot better, much more stylish and pretty, though I'm curious how you plan to use that neat font when you actually implement it &gt;.&lt; I'm assuming those aren't in-game screenshots of the new one, because of the names...still, it makes for a nice horizontal group window.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chai</div><div class="date">11-17-2002, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's true,<br />
it's only an example of how it could look like. I have most graphics done, and XML coding wouldnt take long time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chai</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new bar is done!  Slightly modified from the images above. Here's an actual ingame screenshot.<br />

<br />
Note that this version doesn't have any pet info yet. I might also add more info, but only if I can keep it visually clean.<br />
<br />
Attached is first version. It might contain minor glitches but I think I fixed them all. There's also an alternative tga file to get a red playerbar instead of blue.<br />
<br />
If you use this, please let me know if you discover any glitches, or have suggestions on how to improve it :)<br />

I can't wait to try it out. By the looks of it, it doubles as a player/target window? I'm rather confused by the top name, but then, i'm just a slow dorf :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think if you could implement the F-key assignments above each name it would be even better.  As it is horizontal I think it will make it easier to figure out which F-key is for which group member...<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep up the Great work!! :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought i'd bump this to get some attention to your mod, and also ask a question/request ^.^<br />
<br />
This is probably my favourite group window so far. It's excellent for melee, and really, anything else, because it shows exactly what you need to know at a glance: Your HP, target HP, group HP, and it does it very stylistically, without colour. I wouldn't *want* this to have any more stats, like mana, because that's what the player window is for. <br />
<br />
The only thing that I ask is that you do finish up on adding the pet hp bar, and that you add invite/disband buttons. To fit along with the theme of the skin, perhaps you could make them two small simple circles, on the lefthand side of the bar, that when mouseover'd would &quot;flick out&quot; the word &quot;Invite&quot;, &quot;Disband&quot;, &quot;Follow&quot;... or whatever the function of the button would be at that time. I'm sure it's probably doable, even a more simple version, but I really would like to have an invite and disband button version. Great work, Chai, and I can't wait for a future release.:D</div></div><hr />

I have his MSNIM handle and I'm keeping him in check.<br />

Chai will prevail! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So version 0.2 is now done, which includes a pet health. There's also alternative versions if you prefer mana or stamina instead. Will upload it to group windows area after I finished this post.<br />
<br />
Next version might contain &quot;stats display&quot; showing all stats on a single line, and perhaps also an entirely new kind of exp bar. Here's an image of how it might look like:<br />
http://m1.316.telia.com/~u31618627/eq/izyexp.gif<br />
<br />
This exp bar will ONLY show you 10th of 1% exp in a stylish but clear way, together with a label showing the whole % number. Still it would only take up around 125x20 pixels for both xp and aaxp. Impossible, no. Lots of tweaking, definitely! :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiladenrn</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">is possiable to take players health out and make the group mebers bigger and red?..also get rid of the box look around the group bar?<br />
<br />
<br />
i love this idea just as a healer its hard to see the group memebers as well..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chai</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too complicated to take the player health out without having to redesign the graphics. Although you could re-color the playerhealth to something less visible.<br />
<br />
The box around the group window is there on purpose so you can move the window more easily. Simply set window fade to 0 to hide the box after.<br />

&lt;newbie questions&gt;=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chai</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to load izy1.tga into an image editor, preferrably PhotoShop or Paint Shop Pro. Here, I can do it for you, only takes a minute. Download the attached file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was using this today on a raid, and I decided that it would be good to have a version with mana level on there somewhere. I like the layout of this, and if you can do something as cool and stylish as you have with that preview of the exp window with other stats, I say go for it. This has the potential of replacing the group window, the target window, the player window...<br />
<br />
^.^ Good job man, release release!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chai</div><div class="date">11-24-2002, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woohoo!  Version 0.2 now released. This is a major upgrade, check the attached image for screenshots. You should be able to download it in the group windows section in a day or two.<br />

Thanks for all suggestions and support, and bumps :p<br />
