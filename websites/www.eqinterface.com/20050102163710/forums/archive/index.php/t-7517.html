<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalcor</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I am attempting, for what seems the 1,000th time, to actually install a UI. None of my previous attempts have been sucessful, yet so many people have them, including many of my friends (some of whom aren't computer wizzes), so it cannot be as hard as it seems.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is what I am doing. First, the UI I have chosen is Talyn's HotButtonStatInvClickies (I think that's the full name). It can be found under Hotkeys on the Home Menu. It should be the first on its respective list (at the moment). <br />
<br />
After that, I have tried a few techniques. I am using an evaluation copy of WinRAR. I am not sure if that is a problem. Anyway, I go to C:/ Program Files / everquest / uifiles. Once I open the uifiles folder in C:/Program files / everquest, I have one file there called &quot;skins.&quot; Now, it should say default from what I hear, so I'm a bit confused in that respect. It may be that I unconciously renamed my default folder, but I can't be sure. In any event, the first technique I used was this:<br />
<br />
I created an additional folder within the uifiles folder, called &quot;hotkeys&quot; (right next to the &quot;skins&quot; folder). I then downloaded the UI stated above to my desktop. I extracted all the files from the download to my newly created folder. I then entered the game, typed /loadskin hotkeys true. After some loading, nothing happens, my screen is refreshed and my text box restarted with the MoTD. So scratch that I guess. I also tried first copying all files in &quot;skins&quot; (assuming it is my default folder) and put those files into &quot;hotkeys&quot; (my new folder). Once the files were copied over, I extracted the files from the download to &quot;hotkeys&quot; and replaced the files it asked to replace. I then tried to load the skin in game the same way as above, but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
So I'm a bit confused. I'm not great with computers, but it seems as if I'm doing what needs to be done, yet it isnt coming together.<br />
<br />
So once again, here are the problems I think I might have (I dont know if any of this is true or not):<br />
<br />
My default folder is gone, and &quot;skins&quot; is NOT my default folder<br />
<br />
WinRAR (an evaluation copy) is not suffecient for unzipping<br />
<br />
Something has been altered in my default folder. <br />
<br />
<br />
Please lend me some expertice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Found another problem. I have two Everquest directories. one is program files everquest, the other is program files sony everquest triology</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qool</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">\program files\everquest is your EQ directory.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go to \everquest\uifiles and delete the skins directory and repatch. Make sure you pick the full file scan. This should fixed you problem.<br />

<br />
Do not place your custom ui files in the SKINS folder.<br />
There should be a folder called UIFILES.<br />
Under UIfiles should be Default.<br />
Next to Default should be the new folder you make for your custom uifiles.<br />
C:\<br />
-- Program Files<br />
-----Sony<br />
-------Everquest Trilogy<br />
-----------SomeOtherDirectories<br />
-----------Skins<br />
+-------------Default<br />
-----------UIfiles<br />
+--------------Default<br />
+--------------CustomFiles<br />
<br />
OH.....and EDIT:<br />
   Looks like you installed Everquest Originally, then bought EQTrilogy and Reinstalled it all....this tends to really 'futz' up EQ in general....<br />
  Suggestion:  UNINSTALL the Orginal Everquest Folder (Possibly Both) then reinstall ONLY with Everquest Trilogy and whatever other expansions you have.  Forget that you even own the first CD you installed.</div></div><hr />
