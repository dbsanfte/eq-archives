<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">02-01-2003, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks like you have 2 windows in your UI that both have Ui2DAnimations named TK_ExpTube_Overlay.<br />
<br />
It is actually quite easy to fix, just follow these simple instructions.<br />
<br />
Go to the directory you have your UI in.<br />
<br />
Find the file named EQUI_Inventory.xml<br />
<br />
Right click on EQUI_Inventory.xml and click &quot;Open with&quot; on the popup menue, then click &quot;Notepad&quot;.<br />
<br />
The xml file will now open in Notepad so you can edit it.<br />
<br />
At the top of the window Notepad opens in, click &quot;Edit&quot;, then click &quot;replace&quot;.<br />
<br />
A little box will then pop up that has 2 boxes for you to enter text.<br />
<br />
In the box labeled &quot;Find&quot;, type in &quot;TK_ExpTube_Overlay&quot;.(leave out quotation marks)<br />
<br />
In the box labeled &quot;Replace With&quot;, type in &quot;IW_TK_ExpTube_Overlay&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now click the &quot;Replace All&quot; button.<br />
<br />
Now click &quot;File&quot; at the top of the screen and click &quot;Save&quot; in the drop down menu.<br />
<br />
You are now done and should not get that same error anymore. :)<br />
<br />
Try it and see if you get any more errors. Unfortunatly this particular problem causes the game to imediatly load the default UI without checking any further, so you could still have other things causeing errors. Just post your errors here and someone will help.</div></div><hr />

Follow the steps from my previous post, but in the &quot;Find&quot; box, type &quot;TK_&quot;, then in the &quot;Replace With&quot; box, type &quot;IW_TK_&quot;, then click the &quot;Replace All&quot; button and save the file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-01-2003, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While Caleal's fixes work, and are technically correct, the better option (imo) would be to open the EQUI_Animations.xml file included in the Kao mod and delete the duplicated information.  It is at the very top of the file, very easy to find.<br />
<br />
The reason I suggest doing it this way is that t.king and Remelio include the coding in *all* of their inventories.  So  if you use Caleal's method, every time you want to try a new one of theirs, you will have to make the changes again.  By deleting the duplicated code from Kao's Animations file, you will be able to drop in any of the t.king/Remelio inventories and not have this problem crop up on you again.<br />
<br />
Attached is the exact information that you need to *delete* from the EQUI_Animations.xml file, should you choose to use this method.<br />
<br />
Again, as I said though, Caleal's method *is* another correct way of resolving this error and I am in no way trying to disparage his suggestions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here, download this, unzip it into your custom folder.  And, re-install the t.king Inventory you wanted *without* the changes Caleal had you make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">02-02-2003, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason I was having him just change the inventory window is because I didn't know if the Koari UI actually uses those animations elswhere in the UI, so I didn't want to muck with UI itself. Also, it was quick and easy, and I'm basicly a lazy person when you get right down to it. =)</div></div><hr />

Doesn't matter if the animations are used elsewhere, as long as the info can be found *somewhere* in the custom folder, which they are, in the inventory window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">02-02-2003, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh, ok, I wasn't sure if the Ui2Danimations for graphics had to be loaded before or with the window that uses them or not. <br />
I had been thinking that they needed to be in the window that used them, or in a window higher in the &lt;include&gt; order in the EQUI.xml file.<br />
<br />
I'm working on some custom borders for the UI I'm currently working on, it will be a big help if I can just toss all of the new border templates into one of my modified files, rather than having each window contain its own template. Its a bit of a pain doing everything I'm doing with my UI without touching the default EQUI.xml file or EQUI_Animations.xml file. =x<br />
<br />
I have to confess, I have 0 programing background, minimal html background from 4 years ago and 0 xml background. <br />
4 months ago when I loaded up the Vert1.1 UI in SIDLEWidl and notepad for the first time, I was a complete n00b, though not completely clueless.  =)</div></div><hr />
