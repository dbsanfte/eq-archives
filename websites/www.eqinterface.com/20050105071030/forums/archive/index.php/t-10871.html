<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">duluvian</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have just recently downloaded the ui skin by Daellig and after installing and booting up eq i got an xml error. i imeadiatly came here and found the thread with the patches and fixes. i went through and coppied and pasted the lines for the equi, actions, lootwindow, and pet info xmls. rebooted eq and the ui wont load at all, i now get error loading skin blah blah blah, attempting to load default. i absolutely put all the text from the &quot;fix&quot; thread in the appropriate places and made sure everything was the way it should have been. im thinking that maybe the new lines where clashing with the custom ones in some way because all the lines where i had to change a size where different from what where posted in the &quot;fix&quot; thread to begin with<br />
<br />
another thing with that skin is there is no pet window, it is used to form one of the borders. there are two extra tabs added to the actions window, one shows all the player stats and the other is a timer. im wondering if anyone here can help me take out that timer and make that be my pet window. as im an sk without the pet hold command and having a pet running all over the place with me not having commands will be a bad bad thing indeed.i searched around the file where i downloaded it from and daellig said there was a way to do this but he failed to mention how (wasnt in the read me file either hehe). <br />
<br />
if anyone has any ideas as to how to fix this i would be most greatfull. otherwise i guess ill have to deal with no pet and that blasted little red text popping up evertime it loads the ui, cause i realy dont want to change out that skin, it just fits my sk so well heh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mostly recent ones.  You're missing the &quot;Find&quot; feature, the pet buffs, and &quot;Link All&quot; button in the Loot window. <br />
<br />
Check the Patch Help forum for the updates. <br />
