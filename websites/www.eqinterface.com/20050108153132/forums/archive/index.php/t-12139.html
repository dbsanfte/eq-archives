<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teddyboy420</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 04:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the processor (although I am an Intel fan meself), RAM (Make sure you get DDR not SDRAM) and the hard drive all sound ok, .<br />
<br />
Now for the Video card, there's no such thing as a GeForce4 FX 256MB. The Geforce# series is an older Nvidia chipset, and the fx series is the most recent one. SO, you either want a GeForce 4 Ti 256 (which are the best GeForce# cards if I recall) or a GeForce fx 5xxxx (ranging from 5200 to 5900). <br />
<br />
Here's my system:<br />
<br />
P4 2.53Ghz<br />
512 DDR <br />
60 GB Hard drive <br />
45 GB Removable Hard drive<br />
Nvidia GeForce fx 5700 Ultra 128 MB DDR2<br />
<br />
I recently upgraded my vid card from a GeForce 4 MMX 420 64MB. Before I decided on a new card I did alot of research, I suggest you do the same thing. Go Here (www.pricewatch.com) to check prices, and than after you see what's in your price range, compare the different cards by doing a Google search for the name of each and compare all the different reviews. Also, be sure each reviewer at least has numbers to back up what they say, the good sites will post results from benchmark tests they have done. You can do the same thing for all the components you want to buy, that way you get the best bang for your buck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Teddy, much like you said to ArcherPhate, there is no such thing as a GeForce4 Ti 256... In the Ti series there are the GeForce4 Ti 4200, GeForce4 Ti 4200 w/ AGP 8X, GeForce4 Ti 4400, GeForce4 Ti 4600, GeForce4 Ti 4800 SE, and GeForce4 Ti 4800 (all with varying memory from 128 - 256)<br />
<br />
Note: GeForce4 Ti 4800, GeForce4 Ti 4800 SE and GeForce4 Ti 4200 w/ AGP 8x are all AGP 8X products.<br />
<br />
But the Ti Series cards are fairly good for your gaming needs especially since you don't play that often but often enough to get out of the cards what you need. Of course you could spend more and get the FX cards series and not have to worry about upgrading unless your one of the those &quot;gotta have it&quot; game fanatics out there (but by your original post you don't strike me as one - so don't worry about it). The Ti will save you money in the long run and still deliver the performance you so want. But remember though, once the DX9 games come out, your Ti series won't get the true effect of DX9 graphics as the FX series will. But those aren't coming out in the truck loads. So you have to weigh the situation... do you want to be on the cutting edge of tech and plug out the money that is required, or be content to play the game and not really be worried about all that and save some cash...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two of the best rules of thumb for buying computer hardware are:<br />
<br />
1. Get the best component you can get, as new as you can get, for the money you are willing to spend.<br />
2. Always buy one or two steps below the fastest and newest.<br />
<br />
I would recomend to you that you stick with the FX series. Although there aren't really any games that make total use of directX 9 right now, they are coming very soon. EQII will be a direct X 9 game, just as an example. It makes sense to buy an FX card because right now the transition is happening from DX8 to DX9 and you want your card to last for a while. <br />
There's no sense in buying something now, if six months from now you can't go to the store and pick up any game you want and play it reasonably well.<br />
I'm not sure how much money you were thinking of spending, but I don't think it will cost you too much more to go with a Geforce FX card. Be very careful with the names of the cards, they are designed to be confusing. please come back here and ask if you are unsure about a specific card. I spend all my time learning about this junk, and live for the chance to show my geekiness.<br />
<br />
The best bang for your buck right now, and I would recomend this to anyone wanting a new graphics card, would be the Geforce FX 5900. Nothing after the number... just 5900. This card can be found from some manufacturers for under $200, and is a fantastic deal at that price.</div></div><hr />
