<br />
Ive been looking around, trying to find a UI that suits my specific needs. Most have way too much space, uneeded things, etc. This pic is a general idea of the controls I've been trying to go for, very easy and compact. Details dont have to be exact, just the average thing I was looking for is the layout. Target, my life n mana n all my details i need, plus all my groups info nicely fitted, with spells and pet info on other side, hotbars lined on the bottom, and a decent sized text window, along with spell effects perhaps put horizontal between the pet commands and target window as shown. Maybe if the text window is abit too long then split it a little into an extra window for chat or whatnot. As for the other details such as air, spellbook, inventory I dont care, just the main console I like to be clean and nicely laid out.<br />
<br />
Is there anything out there like it, or a place where I can study to make an UI, or someone who would be up to it? Any help would be appreciated, thanks.</div></div><hr />
