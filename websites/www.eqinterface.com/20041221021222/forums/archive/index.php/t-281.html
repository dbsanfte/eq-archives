AC showing means I keep my Armor Class listed in my Personal Info window, the reason is its small data not a clutter &amp; helps tons to remember to grab an Aego on a hunt or a PoC on a raid.  I would love to see your setup &amp; Grats on the pet, it will help alot ( I know you will get there).

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larul</div><div class="date">09-13-2002, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How Do I install a Mod?<br />
<br />
With the recent changes made by VI, it is now very easy. <br />
1. Download your chosen mod<br />
<br />
2. Find the folder in your EverQuest directiory UIFILES inside there will be a folder Default*<br />
<br />
3. Create another folder beside Default, for our example we will call it &quot;BARD&quot;<br />
<br />
4. Unzip all of the files from your download into the folder &quot;BARD&quot;<br />
<br />
5. Enter EQ<br />
<br />
6. in game type /loadskin BARD true the screen will look like your zoning for a moment, then load your mod.<br />
<br />
the command of true on the end will keep the UI from resetting all the boxes back to default posistion.<br />
<br />
*The default folder CAN NOT be altered in anyway.. any changes made to this folder are over written at Start-Up of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THATS IT! You are Done!<br />

<br />
I've been wanting to give this UI a try, but it won't load in game.  And I can't seem to DL your patched one, when I click the link it says content blocked.<br />
<br />
So umm, if I could get some help with that, I'd really appreciate it. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skark</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a shaman, we tend to swap spells an awful lot so I have an idea to maybe smooth things out a bit.  I'm not sure if it can be done, but there might be a couple of ways to do it.<br />
<br />
I prefer using vertical spell gems, but I imagine it can be done a number of ways, but basically here is how it goes.  Place a column of vertical spell book slots next to the spell gems.<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Spell                      Casting<br />
Book                      Gems<br />
1                            Canni      **These are always the same for me<br />
2                            Sup Heal **<br />
3                            Alac         **<br />
4 EB                       HoS<br />
5 Plague                 Agi<br />
6 Malo                    Sta<br />
7 Form of Bear       Slow        **<br />
8 Pet                      Root<br />
<br />
Anyway, I presume you cant have the spell book icons on the left column displayed until you hit your spell book button, but once you hit your spell book button, your first 8 spell book icons could appear on the left.  This would make buff swapping a bit simpler.  In fact, you should have a 3rd column, maybe between the two that contain your most common set casting gems (like the 8 i have listed) which would be page 2 of your spell book.<br />
<br />
So you see my idea, the question is, is it possible to make spell book icons like that?  If its possible, ui designers get on it! : )<br />

<br />
Just wanted to say this is a great UI, and I really enjoy using it. :)<br />
<br />
There were two things I had questions about, or maybe requests.  First on the mp3 player, I'm wondering if you could add the bar that lets you change what part of the song your listening to?  Like, your listening to 0:30 min of the song, but you want to hear 1:25, so you click the guage thing and then your there (sorry, don't know what you'd call that :\).<br />
<br />
Second, I was wondering if you could make the target bar bigger?  I'm a big fan of very long target bars hehe.<br />
<br />
Anyways, not sure if you take requests or suggestions or anything, but its a great UI, and I look forward to 3.0 of it :)<br />

well lets see,  1) Icons youc an DL by the handfull so pick a set you like, same for spellbooks... this is not a &quot;pretty&quot; UI its a &quot;Functional&quot; UI.  <br />
<br />
as for the rest.  I make no bones this is a Vert Base &amp; your most welcome to use whatever book you want.  I like Vert for its fast function. if more respond to this saying they want fashion I may slap some pretty stuff together &amp; call it Wolfing.  <br />

On a note, I have noticed on some that points were on the main display like other items.  Is it tough to add those to this?  Just curious, rather than always having to go into aa skills...and no I am not lazy ..just a question.<br />
<br />
I really like the feel of this.<br />
<br />
Great job.  Still taking me a bit to get used to but ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
small problem...<br />
<br />
When I loaded it, my screen went all jumpy... not really lag, but more like walking through a room with a strobe light on..<br />
<br />
Ok I'm dating myself on that reference to a room with a strobe, but WAAAAH...<br />
<br />
the game responded to my commands when I wanted them but was choppy... any Ideas why?  I reloaded the default ui (boring.. I want the wolf back)  How can I stop the chop?<br />

<br />
<br />
I am presently running a mod of KatnTKBeast-fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Being a Tiger at heart I fell in love with it and modified it for my Iksar Shaman.<br />
<br />
I started Tgout before Vah Shir were a playable race, had I not already been level 60 when Luclin came out I would have been seriously tempted to switch. I'll see if I cannot get a SS of the ui posted sometime.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like yours though, almost tempting to change. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sakurai</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.. I'm a newbie shamaness who just started about a week ago. I'm looking for a simple, yet effective skin that reduces clutter on my screen. If possible, I'd like to be able to name my hotkeys such as.. &quot;group str buff&quot; and being able to cast it, instead of just putting the group str spell gem there.<br />
<br />
I can't seem to find a skin that works well for these purposes, of course most of them seem to be malfunctioning right now and I'm guessing that's because of a new patch today I seem to be hearing about.<br />
<br />
Anyway, any help would be appreciated.. thank you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taxet</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would Suggest in the Mix/Match section the Tax.Zip.<br />
But in all acuallity all you have to do is<br />
Go to your Actions window and Make a Button to cast whatever spell slot you want it to cast..and Name the Button whatever ya want. Make a Button for instance Named (Slow) If the slow spell is in the 1st slot put in Cast 1  If in slot 2 put in Cast 2 easy :) Then just Copy the Button to the Hot Button Bar=Done</div></div><hr />

<br />
However if your looking for a UI for the Shaman &amp; do NOT have a meek computer &amp; connection try my Sars4Wolfcaller in the Complete/Mix n Match section<br />
<br />
I have only had about 1000 or so downloads of my UI's &amp; really hope this one peeks your interest, however its not a Lag free Minimalist UI, what it is is The UI I love &amp; use<br />
