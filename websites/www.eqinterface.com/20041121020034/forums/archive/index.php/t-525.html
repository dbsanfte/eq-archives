<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Token</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm attempting to put some hot buttons in another window.  I've been working on it just can't seem to get it right.   First off, is this even possible?<br />
<br />
Why?  I've gone thru my spell book and categorized each type of spell.  All gates on 1 page, all translocates on another, portals on another, Cold based, etc... You get the picture.   Now I've created some hotbuttons to go to these specific pages.   So when I want to look at all my portal spells I hit a button that does a /sit and then /book 11.  If I want to look at all my fire based spells I hit a button that does /sit and /book 15.<br />
<br />
If I could get these buttons into the spell book window...oh man that would be great!  I know that the hotbuttons are stored locally and I would want to only display a specific page of hot buttons.  My Hot button page 5 has all these buttons for the different spell pages.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buttons won't work outside their window or origin, but hotkeys are a weee bit different.<br />
<br />
Here's my guess:<br />
<br />
If it uses the 'Botton' element, it won't work. If it uses the 'SpellGem' or 'Invetory' elements, it will.<br />
<br />
Sorry, VI for ya. :(<br />
<br />
If you want to test this, Just take a botton, perferably one you have something in. Copy it, past it in say your spell book. Change the name, add it to the pieces, save and preview.<br />
It might sound like a bit of work, but honestly it's just quick 2 mins of cut and paste.<br />
<br />
I've used this a few times to test out buttons, etc myself.</div></div><hr />
