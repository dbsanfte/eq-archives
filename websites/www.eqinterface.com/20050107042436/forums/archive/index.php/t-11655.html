<br />
Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (SOE), a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online gaming, today announced Gates of Discord(tm), a new expansion for the incredibly popular PC Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), EverQuest®. This expansion will offer exploration of a newly discovered continent; a new class (the Berserker) and Alternate Advancement Abilities that will offer new and unique skills to master. Gates of Discord will be available February 2004 at retail outlets such as Electronics Boutique, Best Buy and Gamestop, and as a secure digital download from SOE. The retail version of Gates of Discord will also come with a unique in-box gift and special in-game magic item. By purchasing the retail version of Gates of Discord, players will be able to claim the in-game item.<br />
<br />
&quot;Players will face the greatest threat to Norrath and the chaos of a realm yet undiscovered. Norrathians will need to unite with the Wayfarers Brotherhood to oppose this mighty force,&quot; said Michael Lustenberger, director of product marketing, Sony Online Entertainment. &quot;In preparation for one of the most epic adventures yet, the Gates of Discord will offer players alternate advancement abilities, leadership experience, the Berserker melee class and vast new areas and zones to explore.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Gates of Discord directs players to the west side of Antonica where Nedaria's Landing is abuzz with activity in preparation for one of the greatest and most dangerous expeditions in the history of Norrath. Stories and events will lead players across an uncharted land twisted and scarred by an unknown force. New alternate advancements will challenge the most veteran of players while the new Berserker class brings inordinate amounts of strength and bravery.  <br />

the new graphic engine is SEPERATE from the expansion.. and it IS true... have some faith :)</div></div><hr />

Go to SOE's store and remove it from your cart.  Wish I had done that with LDoN.  I need another WR bag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100 new Alternate Advancement Abilities offer a different method of character progression with new and unique skills to master<br />
<br />
Woowoo, more grinding! ALWAYS FUN! Are you kidding me?<br />
<br />
Gain leadership experience and unlocks many group and raid-enhancing tools<br />
<br />
How is THIS going to work in EQ exactly, when there's usually only two or three raid leaders per guild? It will require, if it works the way I think it will, these raid leaders being on EVERY TIME the guild wants to do something if they want the full benefits of it. It just doesn't make sense, or maybe it makes a lot of sense to people with absolutely no lives. Again, though, it just smells like another reason to keep people grinding.<br />
<br />
20 new zones, ten new instanced zones and ten new traditional zones including a huge ship city zone, complete with merchants, tradesman, and quest-givers, where you can gather your party and launch expeditions. The new combat zones are for characters level 50 and above<br />
<br />
*coughs* Higher level Ykesha?<br />
<br />
New Berserker class empowers you to ravage your enemies with two-handed axes or by hurling large objects<br />
<br />
Look, gang, it's a ranger, but with throwing instead of archery! Oh, and no spells either. Bummer.<br />
<br />
Discover the newly found continent of Taelosia, which holds the secrets of Norrath's future<br />
<br />
You know, the last expansion that put significant, world changing lore into EQ was Velious. Everything else is just rehashing old stories. I have no faith in the lore of this expansion either.<br />
<br />
20 all new NPC models make for hundreds of challenging encounters unlike anything seen before in EverQuest<br />
<br />
Because there aren't enough monsters in EQ, or something... I don't know, I can't think of anything negative for this. I just hope they don't suck. Actually, this might be the best part of the new expansion, considering they're getting more creative with the mobs of late. Anyone who's seen the sillouette of energy, with the pulsing aura in LDoN knows what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
New Tribute System enhances gameplay by allowing players to choose beneficial attributes, skills, or effects through offerings at their home cities<br />
<br />
Finally! The world notices I'm doing something heroic and wants to give a little back. Wait, this sounds suspiciously like a new AA system... MORE GRINDING, AHOY!<br />
<br />
Dozens of new and exciting story-driven quests for the hardy adventurer<br />
<br />
75% of which will be broken on launch.<br />
<br />
New tradeskill recipes to produce hundreds of new items<br />
<br />
And they'll be profitable for about a month, and tradeskills will return to being all, but useless again.<br />
<br />
Unearth arcane spells, mighty weapons and other hidden treasures!<br />
<br />
BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH SPELLS IN EQ OR SOMETHING?!?!?!<br />
<br />
This expansion is going to suck. All expansions will suck unless they make fundamental changes to EQ. Unfortunately, why would they bother? EQ2 is coming out. Maybe it'll end up like AC1 and AC2... AC1 was fantastic. EQ1 isn't that bad either. AC2 sucked. Maybe EQ2 will suck too and they'll realize EQ1 is probably a more intelligent investment of money and development power.<br />
<br />
Until that (if) it happens, it's just going to be more of the same. EQ1 hasn't had a good expansion, in my opinion, since Velious, back when EQ was still slightly fresh. Now, they're just tacking on more stuff to do, but it's really all the same. You can make encounters more interesting, you can add oodles of items, but it won't make EQ any more fun.<br />
<br />
Do I hate EQ? Absolutely not. I wouldn't play it if I did. Am I bashing SOE? Absolutely not. SOE has earnestly tried to make EQ as interesting as they possibly can. The problem is, is that the game has limitations, and there's just so much lore you can integrate into it. The idea well is starting to dry, and it's visibly noticeable both in the story, and in the implementation of their ideas. I think that's partially because EQ1 is VERY slowly losing support from its parent company. They're shifting gears towards EQ2. I doubt they will ever actually dump EQ1, but I wouldn't expect development to continue much longer after EQ2 comes out. <br />
<br />
It's a shame, really, because EQ1 has so much promise. Unfortunately, a lot of that promise involves they rewrite the game from scratch, rather than tack on messy code to an already messy base. They're trying, they really are, and I salute them for it. I just don't have much faith in the next expansion. I was not impressed by LDoN at all, and really haven't been impressed by anything in EQ for a very long time.<br />
<br />
[Edit: Addendum]<br />

<br />
GOD IF ONLY THE CHARACTER MODELS ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE THAT! (Referring to the wallpapers)<br />
<br />
And those NPC models look directly inspired from anime of various sort. EQ is slowly losing its distinctive look =((((((((((((((((((((</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">laertise</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best advice I can give you togras is if you don't like the idea of an expansion don't buy it. Save your money. Me personaly I look forward to each and every expansion, It gives the game I love to play something new to do instead of just sitting in BoT and grinding if I'm not raiding.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcLite</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Checking out the couple screenshots and looking at the new models for the NPCs, do keep in mind those are rendered in a 3D program (Probably Maya or 3DSMax) and will look a little different from ingame.<br />
But one thing is for sure.  They must have fired the buffons who did the luclin models and hired real modelers.<br />
<br />
Someone posted how the Luclin models need to go and I completely agree.  I've never seen such bad model work before for the Player characters.<br />
<br />
I do hope they make some real models that don't look rediculous.<br />
<br />
I can't wait for the new Engine!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sthikik</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its nice they are adding new AA, new spells, new everything...<br />
<br />
But... are they removing the level 65 Cap?  can we grind even more and get level 70? 75? 80? so some of those High End game mobs can Con White/Black instead of Red all the time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">laertise</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wonder how long it will take them to release a list of all the new aa's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not the expansion itself, it's SOE's policy on its own product. SOE tends to ignore most bugs and such in favor of more content to cover it with. However, they release said content, and part of that content is broken as well. They fix some of it, leave some alone, add new broken things, add new working things, etc. Eventually, they end up with what is a big pile of some working, and some non-working quests, spells, skills, etc. <br />
<br />
'Working', by the way, doesn't necessarily mean 'working as intended.' If everything worked 'as intended' Everquest would be even MORE imbalanced. Something that is broken does not necessarily mean it's bugged. Perhaps it's overpowered, or underpowered, etc etc. Atleast 20% of the content in EQ is broken in some regard, and SOE has made little effort to fix it up. It lacks the polished quality of a lot of other games in the same genre, even if it is a better game all around.<br />
<br />
What I'm getting at, is that, I'd rather Sony worked on fixing old content, and taking a more active role in the balancing act, WHILE working on expansions. Revamp zones to give players something to chomp at, or add individual, new zones for free to show the players they really care (they actually do do this, but not for higher levels =/), while working on the bugs in the game. Keep content rolling out, but not in large expansion packs. Let it trickle down, so we get the most bang for our buck and get things fixed that deserved to be fixed years ago, as well as revisit things that may have been designed better. <br />
<br />
You'll have more happy customers, content will still be coming out (albeit slowly), and you'll end up with a much more whole game that has a few less problems to worry about.<br />
<br />
Speaking of content, I have suggestion for the PoP fandango: Change the VF system.<br />
<br />
My suggested rules:<br />
<br />
Twelve people must be flagged for XX zone and in group one (leader's group, thus, one must be the leader themself.) and two. As long as 36 people or more TOTAL are in the raid, flagged or not, and as long as both groups stay together (with, say, an hour leeway in the case of LDs and wipes. also, if another person that's flagged joins that group while the other is LD, it'll reset the timer), the entire raid will be able to zone in. This will take care of the backflagging problem for raiding guilds, and give some people who might not otherwise be able to see it, experience the content in those zones. <br />
<br />
Here's the reasoning for those numbers, and the possible conflicts:<br />
<br />
Firstly, for those in the elementals worrying about trains and people blowing spawns, and what not, it'll be hard to find twelve people willing to do it. Note, that it isn't impossible, but it is hard. This late in PoP where most high end guilds are mostly elemental flagged, it'll be easier to set up raids with a softer VF limit. Time is keyed, so there's no real worry there, and the content is psuedo-instanced, so blowing spawns and such is not a real problem.<br />
<br />
I can't think of any real problem with a softer VF limit. It still keeps a bold line between newbie guilds and end-game guilds, but allows higher end guilds to function in PoP without worrying about backflagging so much, and if you keep the current rewards for the real flags, it's plenty of incentive to try to get as many flags as possible. The final stats on the charm are sweet =)</div></div><hr />

I've read your posts and you are obviously an intelligent person, but if you think something is broken, why are you wasting your time if you don't think they will fix it, by posting in a weblog that is not directly linked with the creators of said broken item?  Wouldn't it be more constructive to go to the SOE website find a link to feedback directly to the developers (dev corner I think is what would be best and most direct), and spend as much time critiqueing the game directly, in a non-flamatory manner as you do here?  Don't get me wrong I agree with a lot of what you are saying, not all of it, but a good portion of it.  But I'm more of a wait and see type, than a b!+c# and complain type.  Yes I realize I'm paying for this content, but I think I'm getting my monies worth.</div></div><hr />
