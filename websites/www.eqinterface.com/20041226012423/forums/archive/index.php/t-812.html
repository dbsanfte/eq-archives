I put my Inventory Window on the right side of the screen. What I'd like to see... since I'm not a great coder... is my bags on the left side of the window swapping the placement of the player stats. Also I'd like the &quot;Done&quot; Button on the left side as well. The coins would have to be shifted over to the left as well since part of the bottom of the player stats goes to the bottom where the coins would be.<br />
<br />
I know there are &quot;slim&quot; versions out there.. but as this isn't a window that I have up all the time, so being slim isn't an issue with me.  The only time I have my inventory up is when I'm moving items around or when I'm doing Trade Skills.<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />
