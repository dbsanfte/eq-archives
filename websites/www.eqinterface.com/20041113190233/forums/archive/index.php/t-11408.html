<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rykahna</div><div class="date">11-28-2003, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have released a series of mods I made to suit my personal needs.  With a 15 inch monitor, things get cluttered up pretty fast, so I like my interface windows as compact as they can possibly be.  I figured I cannot POSSIBLY be the only person out there with this problem.<br />
<br />
Most of these are mods of other people's mods.  Hopefully I have listed all the parties due credit in the info for the mods.  I am new to the modification game, however, and need to know what isn't working and why.  So I am opening this thread so that anyone who has a problem can let me know, and maybe someone who knows more than I do can tell me what I can do better.<br />
<br />
The following are my released mods:<br />
<br />
Inventory Window<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2810<br />
<br />
Bank Window<br />

<br />

I'm using your trader window and inventory mods for my trader.  Even though I'm running at a high res on a 19&quot; monitor, I find the space-saving very useful in the bazaar.<br />
