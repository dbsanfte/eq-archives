124k (about double 56k) and rate will vary depending on area.. call your phone company.<br />

I used them before I got cable, playing EQ and most of the Half Life mods, TFC, CS, DoD,  you get the picture.  I usually connected at the highest rate you could on a 56k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I beg to differ on Earthlink. I had a most horrible experience with them. Numerous disconnects. But that could just been the server that I connected too. But all I know is that they couldn't do anything for me with the disconnects, except tell me to keep a log and to call in everytime it did. And let me tell you, I was nearly on a first name basis with tech service cause of that. After all that I went through, they gave me 6 months of free service for what I was going through. And even after that, they still couldn't figure out what was wrong. Other ISP's prior who I tried kept connection fine, except Earthlink. Not to mention their DSL bit big time, they never could connect me, even though they said that I was able to get it. Every service man who came there couldn't get a signal. Then the miracle day arrived in the form of a phone call from Ameritech stating that they could connect me to DSL for free and no service call was needed. I got the kit, and within 30 minutes of installation, I had DSL. Kudos to Ameritech for doing what Earthlink couldn't do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">laertise</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok this kind of sucks ISDN would cost me about $110.00 a month called last night. I guess because the neighborhood I'm moving into is on the edge of town there is no dsl or cable out there. Looks like I'm on dail up. Whoa is me whoa is me. I waited so long for DSL got it and now I'm leaving it behind.<br />

I dread the same thing myself. I have had DSL for about 2 years now, and simply love it and we are thinking of moving sometime soon. And I totally dread the possibility of where we may move to may be DSL inaccessible. But with how Ameritech is doing things around here, those fears may be laid to rest. Here's hoping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">High speed internet was actually one of the things we specifically looked for when we were house shopping. A lot of listings will actually include that now. 3 bd townhouse, 21/2 bath, fridge, range, deck/patio, cable internet, blah blah...<br />
I saw many listings like that... and we made sure to ask the homeowners how the connection was and if they had had any problems. I think it was probably higher on our list than four walls and a roof was. :D</div></div><hr />
