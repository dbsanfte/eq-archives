<br />
WOOT!! I hope he does do it!<br />
<br />
Now if he would take on the challenge to make Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles (Dragon's of Autumn Twilight, Dragon's of Winter Night, and Spring Dawning) into a trilogy set like he did with LoTR... Then I would be in eternal bliss! Finally we have a director who makes a fantasy movie a true fantasy movie that wasn't a flop or a disgrace to those who enjoy the genre (i.e., the D&amp;D movie - what a let down. I still cringe when I think about it).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Be sure to prepare accordingly.<br />
<br />
Don't drink anything 24 hours before the movie. Eat only essensials.<br />
<br />
Sitting in the Theater for 3.5 hours, you gotta make sure you don't have to take an RR break right in the middle of the best part.</div></div><hr />
