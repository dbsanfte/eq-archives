This is part of a bigger UI that is almost done. And yes these are extra bits and pieces that will allow people to mod thier UIs easily. So instead of waiting longer for some of the fun stuff that is in my UI, I posted it for those who want to enjoy! :)<br />

One wish to have a background on target.<br />
<br />
So used to have the grey background as hp goes down.</div></div><hr />

I can download any of your other files you just uploaded, but I can't snag the MP3 player.  Not sure where the problem is.  Would you mind<br />
<br />
a) checking to see if you can download it, and if not<br />
<br />
b) re-upload it, I'll re-approve it and see if that fixes the problem.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I'll go bug Dolby and Kudane to see where the problem lies.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I just downloaded all the new interfaces and unzipped them with out any issues. Let me know if there is still a problem and how I can assist.<br />

I can download everything else you uploaded and other stuff by other folks all over the download sections, just not that one file ... very odd.  Hopefully one of them may have an answer.</div></div><hr />

I used your &quot;blue&quot; Deadly Virtues UI forever and loved it, but finally couldn't keep up with the patch changes and switched to a bard UI.  If you ever resurrect that one, be sure to let me know.<br />

Thanks and it is good to be back. That was my first interface and boy did I have fun making that one. I never got around to posting it at eqinterface and have been busy at work on a new one. I'll be posting it soon enough and might take a look at bringing that original one back again. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, Rax...<br />
<br />
Your interfaces all look extremely cool, especially a few specific pieces that caught my eye. I REALLY like the look of your WC3-inspired target box, and am glad you have a &quot;dark&quot; version of it rather than gold, since the darker fits my UI more nicely. However, I was dismayed to find that it doesn't work--I'm given an error that, err..well, I lost it, but it was something to the effect that one of the pieces of that file already existed, so it loaded the default target file instead. It's dissapointing, because I was really looking forward to trying it out. If you need more information, I can probably dig it up.<br />
<br />
Also, I was having another problem with the target indicator (the &quot;Magestic Ring of Illusion animated fullrotation&quot;). For some reason, the thing is extremely jerky in animation, rather than rotating fluidly as I think it should. Perhaps there's a problem with the configuration file? I placed everything I unzipped into my ui's directory, so there shouldn't be a problem there. Hope you can help, it looks really spiffy :D<br />
<br />
And finally, I was wondering if you plan to make the nicely revised double casting gauges in a &quot;dark&quot; version to go along with the darker version of your target bar? I like the idea of two being there, for aesthetics sake. That's about all. I hope you'll be able to help with my problems, and look forward to using these fine interfaces soon!</div></div><hr />
