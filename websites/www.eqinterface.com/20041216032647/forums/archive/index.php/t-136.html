<br />
would love to move my exp info to the upper left corner of my screen and keep hp and such in its current location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmier</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe and here are some other requests. <br />
<br />
I would really love for a buff bar that wrote the name of the buff inside the buff icon( being a cleric and all). Not across like one of the mods I saw. but keeping it small but inside the square have the name. (note I span my buff bar horizontally across my screen at the top. in 1024x768 mode. starting at the end of my lag-o-meter to the width of the player info window away from the right side of the screen,  noticed a post about text being hard coded in position)<br />
<br />
<br />
for Player info though really only need HP, Mana, cast time is handy too. and unless its possable to make another idea of mine then exp bars. (bars with %'s where possable add HP current / max into the middle of the HP bar (less space)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea of buff names inside the icon is possible BUT the positioning of the icons is hardcoded (dynamic) and the resizing of the window can cause the icons to move  from their position, therefore the text (which has static positions) would no longer be 'inside' the buff icon.</div></div><hr />
