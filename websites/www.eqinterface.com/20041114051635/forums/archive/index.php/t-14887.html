<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK some folks have asked how I made the Avalon &quot;Ring&quot; (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/p_large.php?id=4346&amp;tnow=1092759808)  work after looking at the rings graphic..  so I'll try to explain...  IT'S ALL MATH!! :-)<br />
<br />
ok I'll need a sample..  that might help get things going.<br />
<br />

<br />
ok now that we have that, I'll try to explain how I understand the game loads the Ring from a 256x256 image.<br />
<br />
( imagine the black boxes aren't there, that is only for the sample ) first the game starts in the middle left..  so that would be the 0x128y<br />
  it looks for something that has a alpha setting above 1, if there is a object there that will be the starting point for the ring, and it will read untill it sees a alpha setting of 0 again.  this can be seen in many rings found on this site.<br />
  Now in the Avalon ring there is nothing there..  so it goes to the next poing 2x128y  and again it find nothing, it keeps following the stepping of 2x from 4x, 8x, 16x all the way till it finds a object at 128x128y and then reads, now that the machine has found it's starting poing and ending point ( some 2 pixels past 128x128y ) it folds the rest of the TGA or PNG back under it'self and then reads both folds to form the ring.  However on the back scan EQ finds a object sitting at 192x128y<br />

<br />
 this confuses it, it has allready found it's focus, so it is forced to fold that object under the one found at 128x128y.  now this allows the two arms you see in the sample to be read properly.  because the object gets folded first at the 128x128y the second object must be fliped when rendered.  thus you get fairly much what I have in my ring.<br />

<br />
and now a very very crude sample.<br />
<br />

<br />
I hope this helps anyone wanting to make a very complex ring or target object..  and please forgive the cheap samples..  I am not very good at explaining what is just random images in whats left of my mind  ;)</div></div><hr />
