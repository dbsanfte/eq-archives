<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Odibil Lauxes</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been having some fun messing around with XML lately, so I decided to venture into the player, group, and target windows. Basically, this is a more compact version of the Advanced Windows series:<br />
<br />
http://home.thirdage.com/Games/odibil/player.gif<br />
<br />
       *** UPDATE: Added Melee Player Window<br />
<br />

<br />
       *** UPDATE: Added Mana Percentage to Player Window<br />
<br />

<br />
      *Note: there have been no color modifications to the background, it is just the color of the scenery at the time.<br />
<br />
•         Player Window - The player's name has been replaced with CurrentHP/MaxHP as well as a percentage value of the player's current hitpoints. Each bar has a secondary bar showing the progression on a larger scale, just like the experience bar. Pets remain under the player's health bar, when summoned.<br />
-    Melee Version: AC and ATK have replaced the void which is left by the unused mana bar.<br />
-    Mana Version: HP percentage has been moved closer to the Current/Max HP and a mana percentage has been added.<br />
<br />
•         Group Window - As with the Player window, each bar has a secondary bar to show progression. Each group member's hitpoint percentage displays to the right of their name, while pets remain under each group member's health bar, when summoned.<br />
<br />
•         Target Window - The Target Window also shows a secondary bar to show progression, as seen in the above windows, arguably more important in the target window. The hitpoint percentage of your target will display to the right of the target's name.<br />

But that is only my 2 cp. <br />
<br />
