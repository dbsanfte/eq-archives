There are no errors in my UIErrors.txt file.  When I try to load the UI all I can see is the default UI.  Nothing else.  I've tried deleting the old UI and reinstalling a fresh version.  No luck.  Any suggestions?<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mathscitch</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so I found my problem.  A duplicate folder was inside of my original folder.  I just dropped the folder (with the ui stuff) on my desktop and deleted the empty folder.  Then dropped the folder (with the ui stuff) back into my EQUI folder.  Works like a charm.  Don't know if its something as simple as that for you but sometimes its the simple things we overlook.<br />
<br />
Good luck in finding your answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kyrnik</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I was able to get my problem fixed.  Here's what I did.  :)<br />
<br />
First, I completely removed any trace of the old zwnitrain files/folders.  I also renamed my UI_Kyrnik_Brell.ini file to UI_Kyrnik_Brell.old.<br />
<br />
Once that was done I deleted eqgame.exe and also the uifiles folder from the Everquest directory.  I then ran the EQ patcher to pull down clean files from the server.  (Had to run the patcher twice to get the files to download)<br />
<br />
I then went into C:\program files\everquest\uifiles\default and copied all the default UI files.  I created a new folder in c:\program files\everquest\uifiles named zwnitrain.  I pasted all the copied files to that folder.  I then downloaded a fresh version of zwnitrain and extracted the files to c:\program files\everquest.  When prompted to overwrite files I chose 'Yes to all'.  Once that was completed I went into c:\program files\everquest and renamed UI_zw1280_servername.ini to UI_Kyrnik_Brell.ini.  <br />
<br />
I then loaded up EQ and the Zeremus UI came up as my default.  The only problem I had was that the font was set to Georgia.  Under the options tab you can change the font back to Arial.<br />
<br />
Well, that fixed it for me.  Not sure if it'll help anyone else but I thoughtI I'd at least share my findings. <br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
