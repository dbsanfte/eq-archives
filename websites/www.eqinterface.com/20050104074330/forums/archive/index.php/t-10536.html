Or was it just a scare tactic? ... :( If you know what I'm talking about, don't say it! :p</div></div><hr />

The reason behind which was they were attempting to use the utf gimmick in nefarious ways.<br />
<br />
One or two symbols are ok I guess... but an incomming message with a whole pile of garbage characters intended to impress people with how special you are is just irritating, period. People go overboard with it.</div></div><hr />
