<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I am a few days late but &lt;span style=&quot;width: 1%; color: black; Filter: Glow(Color=blue, Strength=1)&quot;&gt;EQInterface.com&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;width: 1%; color: black; Filter: Glow(Color=red, Strength=1)&quot;&gt;EQGui.com&lt;/span&gt; has crossed the 40,000 member mark. <br />

I would like to take this moment to thank you all for making us so popular. We have come a long way and we are still moving foward. <br />

As Dolby mentioned he is getting ready to upgrade the server to a dual-pentium processor which will allow us to handle the higher volume of people and files. This is my one &quot;pitch&quot; for the  Donation (http://www.eqinterface.com/display.php?file=donation.html) Page. The one time cost of this upgrade is hefty, and we could use all the help that you can give. If you can not give, its ok. Your support is appreciated in any form. Our plan is still to have this site as a free and banner-less site.  And now that we have been up and stable for several patches, I don't feel bad in making this single pitch to help us with upgrade cost.<br />
<br />
Thank you all again!<br />

Personal Note:<br />
I had to thank a Bard I met tonight (11/5) in game. Read the whole story Here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3798) <br />
(ok sooo not really site related, but I just wrote the article hehehe)<br />
