<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Son-of-a-Gun</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well when i used to play EQ i taught languages and man i hated the long hours of constanly clicking the hotkey . Is there a way to have it done automatically?<br />
<br />
Is it possible to add a game to EQ ? I mean gems is fun but after a while it gets dull , these two things are related because i kept clicking the key while playing gems and frankly it was dull.<br />
<br />
Basically a self clicking hotkey and a new game.<br />
<br />
For the hotkey i don't want to do the same trick as with the sense heading where you make the up arrow key the same as the sense heading button so that with every step you get more skill im talking about it clicking itself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not anything that follows the EULA.  There might be something that breaks the rules, I've no idea, I've never looked for one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Son-of-a-Gun</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh im not looking for a hack im just looking for something to click the button for me . Something that can be bought in a store,put  on the mouse and have it click for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that something that &quot;clicks the button for me&quot; would violate the EULA. I base this on a thread at the Rangers Glade (IIRC) which referenced a thread somewhere else. The short of it was anything that would allow you to walk away and still play the game (ie smash a hotbutton) would violate the EULA. The bird thing from the Simpsons was actually used as an example of just such a violation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Son-of-a-Gun</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What if i was playing the game and that was clicking for me ? I mean like im typing and its clicking so i could be clicking but im not it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiarra Kai</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was something out a while back.. a usb device.<br />
Plug it in, use your mouse to put the cursor wherever.. and turn it on.<br />
<br />
It just keeps clicking.  Kinda lame imo.<br />
Could just get like a wireless mouse or keyboard.. and if you have a tv near.. watch a movie or something. :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, found the thread. Here (http://www.eqrangers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2997) is the first one at EQ Rangers, the post I was referring to is a couple down, and it references this (http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=1613) article at casters realm.<br />
<br />
Hope those two links provide the answer you are looking for.<br />

<br />
p.s. the macro for autorange attack would probably work for languages as well. The ranger boards have several threads on gamepads and autorange attack.<br />
