<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">widdles</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trying to make a new design for a group window, just playing around learning the basics of the xml setup for now. I started a new 256x256 transparent file in photoshop.. did what I wanted to do with the background, and saved it as a .tga, 32bit, non-compressed, etc. It is filling up everything that was left transparent in the image with plain white... so when I go ingame, around curves it fills it in with the white to make it a normal rectangle.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Targa files save transparency info in a separate channel. On your layers pallet, select the tab at the top for channels, and click the button at the bottom for 'create new layer'. This will create the alpha channel. In Photoshop 6, which is what I use, everything in the alpha channel which is black will be completely transparent, white is opaque, and all the gray values in between are translucent. Darker gray = more transparent.<br />
<br />
hope this helps,<br />

I saw something about 7.0 changing transparency info on TARGA to comply with the standard. Can anyone give a step by step workaround to get this working with PS7?</div></div><hr />

I made changes in &quot;Picture It&quot; and saw the white in game, so I went to Paintshop Pro 7 and made the background transparent and it still shows white in game ;( I've never messed with tga files before, but i'm very confused atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't used PSP in awhile, but I think what I did was select the areas that I wanted to be visible, inverted the selection, and then saved the selection as an alpha channel. I might be wrong, though, as I haven't used PSP in a year or so.</div></div><hr />

Note: The Photoshop 7.0.1 update contains all functionality included in the revised Targa plug-in, so downloading and using the revised plug-in is unnecessary with Photoshop 7.0.1</div></div><hr />
