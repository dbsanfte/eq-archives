I have tried many of the sets here and the one that works best is the quartz line and would really love to keep it without haveing to go back the the default UI. Please if poss can they be updated. Thanks in advance. A big fan of quartz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Piousity</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also use the Quartz UI. I have tried others just don't seem to compare. <br />
Statix last update was 9/9/03 for the Quartz UI, lets hope he can update it for the 10/9/03 patch.<br />

His page is at :http://skins.machin-shin.net/ <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Statix</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">technically everything still works in quartz, SoE adds in retardation all the time, anyway since the petbuff window is impossible to impliment with the current setup i'm reworking my buff organization and will probably re-release a completely updated version of quartz tonight/tomorrow might even write a program or somesuch to build quartz the way you want it (by setting variables in an include) that way you can have your spell icons ordere 1-8 or 8-1 or change the various locations of buttons etc later on without modding the xml itself<br />
<br />
all this is just weird ideas i've had<br />
assuming eq  allows globals finally i was going to tab index the buff window , 1 tab = player, another 2 = pet buffs to fix that issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjloa</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOOT Thanks Statix your hard work on this skin is most appreciated. And just a quick question  i play a pally in game and this UI rocks for me but since i dont use a pet you think there is a way that for a hybryd like my self instead of a pet window there maybe put a window for equip so we can interchange equip more quickly? Just a thought if that not poss i will still use this UI cause as i said for me it works the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Statix</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if SoE would grow a brain they would allow EQType on a button to open a new window<br />
<br />
ie &lt;eqtype&gt;newwindow.xml&lt;/eqtype&gt; so all of the contents were defined , then ui makers wouldn't have to deal with patching constantly on useless updates &quot;i remember renaming CAMP to CAMP(exit)&quot; they could just use an include system like quartz..</div></div><hr />
