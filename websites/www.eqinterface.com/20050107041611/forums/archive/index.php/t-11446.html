This could be great to has more chats grouped in the space of less windows.<br />
I was serching through the download site, but i dont see anything =((</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Majjor</div><div class="date">12-01-2003, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice Idea, and maybe have the tab glow when new messages on that page.<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reborn</div><div class="date">12-02-2003, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A friend say he has seen something... but i think i could missunderstand him.<br />
I hope Soe makes this possible, i had many chat channels and sometimes is a pain to have many windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">12-02-2003, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like a great idea.<br />
Hope it comes in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mallious</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just thinking the same thing. Maybe something similar to what SOE uses for the chat window/tabs in SWG. This is what I was hoping would be added into eq when I first saw it in the swg beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarsippius</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">unfortunately, all chat windows come from the same single equi_chatwindow.xml file.  If you were to set up tabs on that window, not only would you have to predefine how many tabs you wanted beforehand, you would also always only get one of the tabs to display any chat, and any subsequent window opened would display an identical window full of tabs with only 1 active chat window.   great idea though keep thinking!<br />

Make any window that will show in the game defined in the EQUI.xml.  This way you could edit any window, make any window, do anything you wish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balsalt</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">see DAOC or SWG as mentioned...it's doable, though it would break a few custom UI's I warrant.  <br />
<br />
In practice tabbed windows are not the cure, I'd rather have my main chat functions hot keyed so I can turn on and off , but still log so if I turn on say auction I could see the last 20 lines my system picked up.</div></div><hr />
