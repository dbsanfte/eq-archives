<br />
So.. just to alleviate any confusion.. here 'tis in game.  Logically all the pets should be in their respective 'spots' but my mage is a goof.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kopla</div><div class="date">10-12-2002, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like this spellbook, makes spells easier to find and switch between.  I just had a couple problems with this spellbook.  It was hard to read the spell labels.  What I found work best was to open the .tga files in photoshop and decrease the brightness and contrast.  Now this may just be because i play at a hi gamma correction, but i found this helped a lot.<br />
<br />
I also found that there wasn't enough room for the longer pet spell names.  At level 60 all the names are like Great Voceration:Earth.  That just didn't fit in the space between the elemental icons, so I moved the labels of the top 2 to above the icon.  I also center justified them and increased the font size.<br />
<br />
Other than that i really love this mod.<br />
<br />
Great work on the spellbook, thanks for sharing it with us.<br />

<br />
The only modification would be to change the text colors to them view easier.<br />
<br />
Your mods just get better and better, Tadashya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">10-12-2002, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the person who programmed this updated the XML to do that same exact thing - move the names of the top two spells ABOVE the spell icons.  I was just keep forgetting to upload the revision.<br />
<br />
for the moment, here it is here.. I will upload it to the download section as v 1.2 or something to that effect.<br />
<br />
just the XML - if you havent got the spellbook... still need to D/L it<br />
<br />
and thank you for the kind words :)<br />

p.s. I play at a fairly low gamma (like 20% ish)</div></div><hr />
