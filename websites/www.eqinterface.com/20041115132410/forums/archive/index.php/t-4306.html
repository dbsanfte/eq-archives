Ok, enough of my commercial voice emulator there, heheh. This MOD is small, and seems to cut down on the lag, like I said :) While made for small resolutions, though, it fit in the larger ones also :)<br />

To DL it, click on Vixyn's Skins on the left...<br />

I'm working on one myself but it's not coming out very pretty either :(</div></div><hr />
