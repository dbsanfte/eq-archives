<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizzestra</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My entire UI no-longer works. It was a piecemeal that I had put together and have been using since a couple of weeks after they made the new UI available. Now even though I load my custom UI, none of the custom windows load anymore. The UI defaults back to the Default UI except for the image files. All of the XML seems to be drawn from the default folder instead of the custom folder that I have (except for images).<br />

Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chinghis</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should look at the Patch Fixes forum, specifically Cairenn's posts about what changes in each patch.   The latest one is here. (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11669) But, if you have never changed anything for a long time, you'll have a lot of updating to do.... best to start all over again, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

I never had any problems that I could not overcome until now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
specifically your ERROR LOG which can tell us whats going on with your UI.<br />

Yes, the log file for UI errors (should be self-explanatory, I forget the exact name) will tell you which files are causing it to fail and load the default.  I had a similar problem, and just deleted the offending file, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizzestra</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thank you for your responses. I managed to get it fixed. Though this is a new issue I never had before. It seems that if 1 window is not perfectly EQ-compatible then the whole UI defaults to the default one. It used to be that it would just tell me that my UI was not &quot;perfect&quot; and it would load and work just fine anyways.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the error.  Some errors it will load the ui and work and just display some error message.  Other errors it can load everything but the one window and load the default for the window having incompatability issues, then there are more serious issues where it will load the default UI.  The mother of all UI incompatability will cause your eqclient to crash after selecting your character to load.</div></div><hr />
