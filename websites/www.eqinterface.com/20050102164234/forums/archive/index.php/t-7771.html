<br />
Issues are Selector window dose not have LoY buttoms<br />
Inventory dose not have Charm slot<br />
Group LFG buttom missing<br />
<br />
These are the fetures i would like to intergrate to my UI<br />
I want to add to that you can use the buttoms but the grapich is not there, like if i click on guildmanegement , well where it is suposed to be i get guildmanegment but i dont see the buttom<br />
<br />
BUMP BUMP!!! Edit gonna try to let you be able to DL the UI i need changed or rather updated unless you want to let me send it as an email to you then you could have a look at it.<br />
<br />

<br />
And what I would like to have done with it is simply update all the features that the new LoY has all those that i said above and i think i forgot the edit abillity on the map feature</div></div><hr />

All you need to do is go to the Patch Fixes forum or search for the patch fixes by using LOY Patch or something to that matter.  You can start here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6897)  and look for the things you need.  I think that post has everything you need.  Also, we can't really help you with this unless you either tell us what UI you are using or post the file if you are using a &quot;self-moded&quot; mod.  If you can't get this to work (or you're too lazy), let me know and post the file.  I'll try to get it to work.  Shouldn't take more than 10 or 15 minutes to do.</div></div><hr />
