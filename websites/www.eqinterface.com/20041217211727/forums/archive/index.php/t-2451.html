<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astin</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have made up my mind that I'm gonna make a Pally UI. I can think of good ideas for graphics for things like gauges, symbols, and stats. HOwever, I cannot think of anything to put them all in. For instance, the Hierophant UI thats on the boards (in beta). Its great, has tree brances and vines tying it all together. What should I do for a paladin? I was thinking something along the lines of swords, angels, and castles, but how the heck do I tie it all together?<br />
<br />
The only thought I had was trying to do something like the Oger Beastlord UI. I could just have textured windows using marble instead of brown stone.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   for hotbutton slots maybe a shield graphic, for the invitory how bout just a knight , and lines to the corresponding body part with a box to put the gear in. and use marble textures.  Good luck<br />

<br />
I need something for the following: <br />
<br />
-Group window<br />
-Buff Window (I am thikning about little metal shields with the buff icon in the center? I like the text though, thats a problem with that idea :mad: ) <br />
-Spellbook (I am pretty sure I know what to use, but ideas are appreciated)<br />
-Stat Window (Need a background for this)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Etherian</div><div class="date">10-03-2002, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmmm group window-there are so much out ther  already , the ones with the F2-etc next to the name with a HP%is nice, as far a graphics go thats pretty hard you almost have to go with a traditional squarish design unless you wanted to make a round shield design or just incorporate it into a pet window tab button so it dont take up extra room if you are not grouped<br />
<br />
<br />
buffs --a 2 handed sword  with the buff icons in the sword blade and words off to the side of it, or just a box with teh edges instead of being lines , bea sword graphic with the tip of one touching the hilt of thenext.  or a castle square like thing ...really depends on how much of yoru screen you want taken up by it , personally i like the corner one that curves with the upper corner of the screen.  that could bea angle laying in the corner kind of faded out and the buffs can go right on top.<br />
<br />
spell book-scrolls are pretty cool and you can have the slots like the little shields with the buff icon on them, the handles of hte scroll rolls could be maces.  but seems liek you got it covered<br />
<br />
background for stat window ...anything as long as you can see the numbers clearly<br />
<br />
on a side not , anotehr tab in pet window , with skills and spells for paladins would be great<br />
<br />
If i knew anythign about xml i would help ya out , but i just ordered a book on it so its going to take mea bit to delve into it<br />
<br />
I wish you good luck sir, and I hope i have been soem help I am sure it will be wonderfull<br />

In fact, if somone would want to do the programming/XML part and just tell me what to do for graphics, I would be ecstatic. I love drawing but not programming.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orin</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think all that sounds great. I to play a Pally. I did a mix-an-match for mine. I used the Crusader spell book from T.Kings site and his spell icons. I also found a firey sword for the target window. It is a bit big but I am working on resizing it. Just some stuff that I thouht would. Good luck and can't wait to see what it will look like.</div></div><hr />
