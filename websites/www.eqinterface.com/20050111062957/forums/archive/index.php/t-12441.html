<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reddisk</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These are things that I've learned over my years on EQ and I think I should share them with the world.<br />
<br />
1- Lag is annoying so just use the halfling bank in PoK instead of the main one... and do your mbg's somewhere other than the nexus stone like in the good part of the PoK. No one really goes there.<br />
<br />
2- Some people get really p***** when you look at thier inventory without permission.<br />
<br />
3- You'll most likely have to send a tell more than once for the person to get it.<br />
<br />
4- No one wants your out of date crap armor.<br />
<br />
5- Bazaar has an auto cast spell as soon as you enter that makes you spend all your money... just some advice, don't go in there when you're savin up for something, unless you're buyin and sellin for more.<br />
<br />
6- No matter what you buy, you'll see it being sold in the bazaar for 2pp the next day.<br />
<br />
7- Quest mobs that you need to hit pop right after you leave the zone and drop what you need. EVERYTIME!<br />
<br />
8- Don't go into a pvp area when an uber guild is there havin a ffa.<br />
<br />
9- Don't make fun of someone in the serverwide.sk chat.<br />
<br />
10- Can't think of anymore right now cause EQ has wasted my brain to nothing... Still love it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Genghiz Cohen</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not only will your item drop the second you leave the zone. Your friend will loot it and then spend a couple of weeks sending you links and telling you how easy it was and that there really wasn't any camping needed. No really, it dropped on the first kill, it was really easy. Did you see the link, btw? Nevermind, here it is. Isn't it a sweet item? I love it. You should get one too. Actually, with all the time you've spent here you should have one by now. Why haven't you been killing this guy? He, like, drops it every time. I thought you knew about this thing. I can show you where he spawns if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WanrenWizard</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">11- When your level is around 20-30 you can never find a group, but when you finally get to level 40-50 all you see are level 20-30 groups looking for more, and never any 40-50 groups.<br />
<br />
12- When you spend 15k on an item because its the only one you've seen in about a week. Then a few days later (which seem like years in EQ time) when your trying to sell that 15k item, there are 5 other people selling it for 8k. <br />
<br />
13- Never defend someone in a mass arguement in the market/auction chat before you know how well known and hated they are. You will for sure get a bad reputation.<br />
<br />
14- Dont jump in the bazaar arena when everyone having fun duels and your level is around 50. You may think you can kill some people, but you will soon find out how much more powerfull a level 65 with several AA is to your level 51 necro. <br />
<br />
15- You create a new character because your old ones class was overplayed, and everywhere you went you saw that same class. Chances are, you just didnt notice how many of the other classes are around, and when you create that new toon, you have the same problem.<br />
<br />
16- You are never the first to do or see anything in this game.<br />
<br />
17- No matter how unique you think your character is, theres atleast 2 people out there that have the exact same/similar character to you in more than one perspective (gear, skills, etc.).<br />
<br />
18- Don't rip on a healer cause there doing a less than perfect job. It seems like being a cleric would be an easy class to play that anyone should be an expert at (unless you've played one for quite a while). It is quite difficult to play unless you have ungodly gear with an endless amount of mana. <br />
<br />
19- Halas guards are tough. (Personal relationship between me and them. They don't seem to take kindly to DE Necros)<br />
<br />
20- The 10k horses are only good for not getting agro from sitting. (the biggest waste of 11250pp ever)<br />
<br />
Just thought I would add a few things Ive learned in my few years of play. <br />
<br />
I could go on but I wanna leave a few for others to add if they want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">21. No matter how much you try, you cannot right click on an item in a screen shot that someone has posted, to see what it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL Zantaklawz, I should have known I wasn't the only one that tried that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sundanzkid2001</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">22 If you log out, thats when every one finaly decides to go do the raid that you have been trying do for all Day.<br />
23 When you go to work ( or when your boss is around when your at work) thats when the rolls start for the items you need for your epic will take place .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reddisk</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">23 is it? whatever... Friends are friends till you need something camped... then they're busy<br />
24. Never ask what an item is for in a serverwide chatroom some examples are words of bondage, any item that has teh word fetish, something with the word hole in it etc.<br />
25. LFG is stupid and it sux and... it's... stupid <br />
26. Don't tell your guild to not invite you on raids till you've reached a certain lvl.<br />
27. And i have been the first to see somthing... I think the other day i saw some glitchy grey ball things rolling around on the ground in a certain exact spot that i'm pretty sure no one has ever watched from teh exact spot that i did... (this is for one of the things to know from a previous post)<br />
28. Everyone, besides the DE clerics who like to watch our tails while in a group, thinks iksars are stinky and dirty... we are kind, clean and mistreated.<br />
29. WARNING: After an excess amount of play (20 hours) your eyes will burn intensly.<br />
30. Stop trying to slow the archaic model<br />
31. The RL name guess game fills a lot of tiem<br />
32. As does gems but gems is stupid... like LFG<br />
33. You know you have bad luck when I...  you get invited into a group and make aquantaince with everyone and then told in tell that you were accidently invited.<br />
34. SoE is looking for more ways to make people mad as each expansion passes.<br />
35. Be jealous of bards and their death running ways... btw stay outta the way when you see one doin that with a mob... DONT TRY TO HELP.<br />
<br />
Hope more people continue to contribute :)</div></div><hr />

You know you've been playing EQ a bit too much when you start saying Lol in public instead of really laughing.</div></div><hr />
