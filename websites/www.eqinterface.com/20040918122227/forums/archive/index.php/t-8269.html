http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=2000 <br />
<br />
<br />
EQ PDA Version 2.2 (caster beta 3 and mele beta 1)<br />
<br />
Since the last update...<br />
<br />
2 skin colors<br />
2 pet window options<br />
Caster and Mele versions available<br />
Included T King and Warcraft buff icon art<br />
Chat window mod<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm looking for feedback on how hard / easy the readme is to follow with all the options. <br />
<br />
Getting close to final release (after the 14th  of course) and looking for anything I can fix or add before I stop editing for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome! Such a great idea !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Changes already in the work. <br />
<br />
Added Vert inventory backgrounds, recessed box background and buttons. They look much cleaner in the PDA than T. King art. I think the colors match better. Screen shot sometime soon.<br />
<br />
The blue line in the exp bars will be in for version 2.1.<br />
<br />
Made new buttons for the pet window that better fit in the tray and in fact follow the edge of the tray. Based on Vert button art.<br />
<br />
The cast bar now has the empty socket look when a spell is unmemed.<br />
<br />
The art for the main buttons on the group window will be revised to look more natural and give a better appearance.<br />
<br />
A LFG button will make the next release. (Unused button 1)<br />
A /book button will make the next release.(Unused buttons 2)<br />
<br />
More code cleaning. Removing calls to images no longer in use.<br />
<br />
Multi colored hit point gauges for Target, Player, Player Pet and all group members. (If I can learn to understand Enok code and it can be done in a way to allow me to add the code for 8 individual gauges without going mad.)<br />
<br />
Tab borders will be redone to look more Palm PDAish.<br />
<br />
Version 2.2 will include.<br />
<br />
MP3 player to match the selector window.<br />
Chat window art. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After that I do not intend to do anymore windows. The only windows I look at ALL the time I see the need to redo. The rest I find great art and code for already done. I use T. King inventory and spellbook. Warcraft 3 spell icons or T. King spell icons (both look and work great, personal preference really).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braraa Escrire</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious... where is the cast bar in relation to everything?  I ask because I am a cleric and typically have a tank targeted, I really like having the cast bar under the target bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cast bar is actually between the mana and stamina bars. I'm a cleric also and with the close feel of the PDA my eyes never need to stray unless its to the chat windows.<br />
<br />
PS: Because it is in the same window as the target bar, its literally a cut, paste and quick edit from being with the target gauge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use this when I play my Beastlord and really like not having the screen cluttered up.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing that I do not like is the pet window.  You did a good job with making it part of the PDA but when I am using this mod I like to have it tucked in to the lower left corner and having the pet window come off the bottom kinda sux. <br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of to fix this other than hot keying all my pet commands is to stick a very very tiny line under the last group member that has just the letter corresponding to the pet command you want the pet to do.  Other than that I really like this.<br />
<br />
I keep expecting you to come out with a new pointer that is like a stylus or a push-button ink pen or something...<br />
<br />
Great work! Keep up the good work...<br />
<br />
(as an aside, can we possibly see other colours than white?LOL)<br />

<br />
Because of the limitations of the UI, &quot;BUTTONS&quot; cant be moved out of thier respective windows. Otherwise the whole UI could literally be in one window. So I cant move the pet window buttons there. What I have considered doing is making a stand alone cast spell bar and putting the pet bar in its place. I could also make it appear to be a popout tray from the right side of the PDA. Both of these are doable.<br />
<br />
Maybe a dark grey tint might look nice for those who like thier screen darker. Hmmmmm.<br />
<br />
I have considered adding a stylus and prolly will do so when I find a good image ;) <br />
<br />
Version 2.1 is awaiting moderaion. Keep an eye out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Orp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would create a situation where you would click on the group window and your pet window would fall behind the group window in function. IE the buttons are no longer useable untill you bring the pet window forward again by closing and reopening it.<br />
<br />
Simply from what ive found there are 3 types of things in the EQ GUI.<br />
<br />
Information elements. (gauges, labels, compass)<br />
Function elements. (buttons, check boxes, search windows)<br />
Graphical elements. (things that look pretty)<br />
<br />
You can stack informative and graphical items almost freely because you dont need to click on them for them to work. Functional elements however must always be in the formost layer of your skin to work otherwise the UI thinks youre clicking on something thats in front of it.<br />
<br />
So again sorry Orp I cant do that. <br />
<br />
How do you like the darker PDA image?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The outside borders of that chat windows were removed for looks. No border = no movement.<br />
<br />
Open your EQUI_ChatWindow.xml file with whatever you edit with or notepad if you dont have an XML editor.<br />
<br />
6 lines from the bottom is this...<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Border&gt;false&lt;/Style_Border&gt;<br />
<br />
Change it to...<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Border&gt;true&lt;/Style_Border&gt;<br />
<br />
Save your changes.<br />
<br />
reload the UI by relogging or /load EQPDA 1 <br />
<br />
Your chat windows will now move. Once you have them where you want them, change it back to keep the look.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll add this to the readme for future reference.<br />
<br />
Thanks for using my PDA Eloora,<br />
Dream<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
XML guru's,<br />
<br />
Is there a way to not have the border and still have the window movable? If there is I currently don't know how to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 01:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Dream, after seeing your new concept I thought I'd give this a whirl.  I must say although a bit tough to get used to at first, it just makes sense and I like it a lot, everything being in one place like you said.  I noticed a few minor issues that could be mentioned.  First of all, the chat window is extremely tough to move and resize, i could only right click it in the bottom corners, and to move them I had to move it around in the default UI and /load the PDA again.  Although you addressed it, messing with the actual files is a lot of work, so perhaps this can be fixed in the next update.  Another thing is that there are like little red splotches inbetween the individual gauge sections on the EXP and AAXP bars.  And the last thing, another small one, is that there are black scan lines on the bottom of the chat window, perhaps a corrupted graphics file?<br />
 <br />
I forgot to take a screenshot of my UI, but if it's needed to see the things I've mentioned then I'll be happy to post it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Metro,<br />
<br />
The release adds an invisible border around the chat windows for much easier moving.<br />
<br />
As for the graphic bugs I dont remember ever seeing them. Please take a screenshot and be sure youre using the latest version of the EQ PDA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OH....... The red blotches are very intentional. If you empty out the rest of your guages youll notice they are there in all of them. I'm not the original artist of the guage but I love them as is, so I don't see them being changed. If you dont like they way the guages look empty.. Fill them up =) /giggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moved to released forum. See you there.</div></div><hr />
