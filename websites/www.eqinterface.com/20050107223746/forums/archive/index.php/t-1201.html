<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if it would be possible to have a mod to the compass window that would have the loc updated like constantly or every 5 seconds or something like that?<br />
<br />
I think it would be handy I could get rid of that stupid Loc Button.  and it would be helpful hopefully for my wife in RL who I am teaching the game.  That if she gets lost and dies then I could have easier time doing the CR.  She seems to find places in zones I didnt even knew existed.<br />
<br />
If anyone has some ideas on how to do this I would appreciate it.<br />

Only way I have seen would be to somehow merge a macro file into the compass. VERY bad :(<br />

Sorry unless someone else knows otherwise :confused:</div></div><hr />

However, adding the loc to it is, unfortunatly, currently impossiable. Not given as an EQType option, yet.</div></div><hr />
