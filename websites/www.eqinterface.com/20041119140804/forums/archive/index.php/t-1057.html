But I can not seem to find how to change the size of an object.  Would someone mind posting an example of the code I need to change?  If it helps I am trying to shrink down my casting bar.  Thanks for your time   :D</div></div><hr />

You should be able to find one already done so you would have less editing to do.<br />

I already have a shrunk vesion of the casting bar the ui came with.  I just dont know where to look in the code to make my modifications.  If I wanted the plain bars people have already modified I would not be asking for help =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are you using to hold the image you want to shrink down?  If it's Ui2dAnimation, there's a size element within the Frame child of it.  If you're using WindowDrawTemplate you probably want to use WindowDrawTemplate: FrameTemplate: Ui2DAnimation: Frame: size.  ScreenPiece has a size element within it.  The point is there are a few places for size, depending on what exactly you want to resize.  Look in the about SIDL.doc on pages 9-13, they have the &quot;extensive list of elements.&quot;  Within that, find the containing element for what you are using, then look within that for either a size Parameter (1st column) or for a Type (2nd column) that has a size Parameter.  The Type's refer to other elements within those pages.<br />

Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
