<br />
I stress suggestions because SoE is looking for this to be a creative session and I would like to keep EQI's envolvement positive.<br />
<br />
/bow<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
I prunned down the post to just suggestions, I am sorry to those who replied to someone's suggestion or offered feedback. I am trying to keep this a list of suggestions. It wasnt personal, just keeping it clean. <br />
<br />
and Kenwoodx2 if you go into EQCLIENT.INI you can change what UI is loaded at startup. (its there so I removed your suggestion)</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. In World of Warcraft beta they allow the creation of NEW windows and any element can be put in the new windows. Not sure if its possible for them to do in the games current state but I'm sure many people would like this. Drakah has more info: http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5132<br />
<br />
3. A way for the end user to scale all text in their interface easily.<br />
<br />
4. Some Authors would like an easy way to change the direction at which guages fill.<br />
<br />
5. Add x,y info to the lag-o-meter so people can move it. In some custom interfaces it gets in the way.<br />
<br />
6. When an interface is missing a custom graphic file being called from a customized window the error loops and it creates much lag for the user and a uierrors.txt that is 1gb and growing. There should only be one error line explaining that the custom graphics file is missing.<br />
<br />
7. Another Drakah suggestion: http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5514</div></div><hr />

I feel that this is something that must happen.  Most of the game companies now include tools to help you mod the game.  I understand that EQ is not a moddable game, but the UI is.  I think that it is almost irresponsible for them to make the UI moddable without the tools to help you do so.  Not all of us are programmers you know ;)</div></div><hr />

also maybe animated buttons and buff icons. nicer looking icons for items in inventory, the ability to change them and such. thats all i can think of atm  :p</div></div><hr />

At present there is nothing on the screen to remind you that you may have put up AFK or LFG. And how many of us have forgotten to clear AFK after running around with it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish i could remember where I read it; somewhere I read an article about future developments in the works for EQ.  In the article, it briefly mentioned a UI editor designed for everquest, that would allow you to edit the UI both inside and outside of the game.  The utility would load the entire UI graphically when outside of the game, just as if you were seeing it inside the game.  This was slated for release after the huge graphics engine updates they are currently implementing.  Not necessarily after this latest expansion; eventually all the graphics engine changes will be implemented via a patch.  Those who buy the expansions with the updates simply get the changes sooner.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Concentrate any new bells and whistles in their own seperate NEW window instead of craming things in existing windows.  This would make it harder to break an existing UI as well as give us the options for what we do and do not want on our monitor real estate.  It seems like everytime the do something, it requires that an existing window get changed, and we end up having to go in and do fix things even if we do not want the new information.  It would be cool if we had the full choice of what we wanted up, as well as minimize UI breakage.<br />

<br />
<br />
Maybe worth a mention<br />
<br />
might be a bug: when a &lt;gauge&gt; that is 0% filled show color fill in them and they didn't before DX9?<br />
<br />
for ex.<br />
one pixel width of &lt;fill&gt; is drawn on a 100 width &lt;gauge&gt; that 0% filled.. Or not even in use like the AA gauge on a level 1 character.. <br />
<br />
It thows off the accuracy of the gauges!<br />
<br />
Also, this makes &quot;disappearing&quot; gauges impossible..<br />
<br />
We used to be able to make the gauges vanish by not defining &lt;background&gt;and &lt;endcaps&gt; for the gauge and when the gauge was &quot;empty&quot; the &lt;lines&gt; would disappear..  Gauges no longer &quot;empty&quot; so the lines are always there..<br />
<br />
<br />
Did I mention..<br />
Resizable map window would be awesome..</div></div><hr />

5- more hot keys ..maybe a another set that uses alt+# or ctr+#<br />
 <br />
<br />
Those are already used - ALT# for spells and CTRL# for disciplines :)<br />
<br />
Although, it could be made possible for casters to use CTRL# for something else, since they dont have discs and pure melee to use ALT# for something different, as they dont use spells</div></div><hr />

Yeah - links in not only chattextinputarea - but also in hotbuttons :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I for one would love to see a default UI that doesn't suck. I remember when I first started playing EQ, pre-Kunark, when they still had the original stone-style UI in place. Sure, it was clunky and low-rez, but at the very least it was functional. Now, new EQ players who don't know anything about the UI modding scene are being greeted into the game by a default UI which is ugly, inexplicable, and utterly rudimentary. This isn't the way it should be.<br />
<br />
Certainly, it's nice that they've given us the option to change everything from the base UI...but people shouldn't have to do that. Some basic default window positions for each common resolution would be outstanding. Right now, if I load up testing a new UI which doesn't work in my usual 1600x1200 resolution, the default UI will load up with uselessly small windows--especially the chat window--arranged loosely around the screen. It's easy enough to rearrange and resize these, but even that can take half an hour, an hour, just to get the UI functional enough to make playing enjoyable. I imagine there are are a lot of newbies still running around with loose, ineffectively arranged windows because they don't know how to make it any better. Please, give us an official default UI that's customizable *and* functional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">voodoobrew</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) It would be nice for a necro to see how much mana everyone has, after all clerics can see how many hp you got.<br />
<br />
2) the f10 key togles the ui on and off. it would be nice if this performed other functions such as togeling a second or third UI.ini file so we could have diftent ones for diffrent purposes such as one for when were just chattinf and roelplayng and one for when we are heavy in combat. (how could you do this whith out deleting everyones already made hotkeys and friends lists?)<br />
<br />
3) anything that would make the UI more dynamic. <br />
<br />
4) oh yea and one million dollars or ill blow up the moon. <br />

here is the info on the  Fake Links (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=5430) you were talking about above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Star</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Program to Easily Edit and View UI Windows Out of Game:  There needs to be a user friendly program to change and view UI windows out of game.  It would be great to resize things and move things around by just using your mouse.<br />
<br />
2) Colored Map Arrow:  Be able to change the map arrow color on the map window.  The black arrow is too hard to see.<br />
<br />
3) More Font Sizes: For my screen resolution, font 4 is too small and font 5 is too large.  There should be one inbetween.<br />
<br />
4) Mana Bars for Group Window and Raid Window:  I think everyone's mana should show up in the group window.  Mana bars in the raid window, along with HP bars, would be really great.<br />
<br />
5) HP Bars in Raid Window: This would really help on raids to know who needs a heal.<br />
<br />
6) Buff Timers:  I have to use EQWatcher in order to know when buffs are going to run out.  There should be some way to do this in game.<br />
<br />
7) More Spell Gem Slots: 8 just isn't enough.<br />
<br />
8) More Buff Slots: 15 just isn't enough.<br />
<br />
9) Increase Number of Spells Going Into the Short Duration Buff Window:  I think heal over time spells, such as Spirit of the Wood and the cleric Celestial series, should go into the Short Duration Buff Window.  Basically all spells that are 7 ticks and less.<br />
<br />
10) Stylish Default UI: I agree with Casanunda that the game needs a new default UI.  The current one is so ugly compared to other games.  Also, there needs to be a different default UI for each resolution. <br />
<br />
11) Targeting:  Targeting someone with /target has a very small range compared to /assist.  I have to be very close to person in order to use /target.  Therefore, the range of the /target command needs to be increased to the same amount as /assist.</div></div><hr />

I've been trying to write a program that copies the UI over multiple characters.  I can change the UI in one character, and hit a few buttons and all my characters have the same UI layout without having to copy character_ui.ini over various computers and renaming them.  I also use two computers, so the ability to copy the UIs over multiple computers on a network would be nice too.<br />

If Sony doesn't implement this, I'll try to write one and upload it here.</div></div><hr />
