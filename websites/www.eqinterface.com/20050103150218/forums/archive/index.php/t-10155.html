<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakya</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a fairly simple UI that I put together out of mostly TKing pieces, and since LDoN, I've been having very weird problems with it (Just for reference, I don't use a custom cursor or class animation).<br />
<br />
Now, after a lot of trial and error I've discovered that it will load IF I copy the ENTIRE default folder into a new custom folder, then unzip the custom pieces on top of that (I read here that you generally shouldn't do this, but I was desperate). If I put in a custom Group Window, Spell Bar, and/or Spellbook, it boots me to the default UI. <br />
<br />
If I don't put in the default folder first, and just unzip the custom pieces into an empty custom folder (minus the ones I mentioned above as not working no matter what), then the UI doesn't load at all, just reloads the default.<br />
<br />
After all that, I realized I probably should have come here first, and put the fixes into my custom Animations file, etc. I did this in yet a third new custom folder, which I had set up exactly as I had my UI before LDoN. It didn't help, but I got a new error, and perhaps sorting this one out will solve my issues?<br />
<br />
(My error file currently goes through every UI piece that I do not have a custom piece for and tells itself to use the default, i.e. <br />

Sorry for the long winded message, but I'm really at a loss here. Is there anything else I can try? Thanks in advance for the help.</div></div><hr />
