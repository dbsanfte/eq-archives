I've just put up version 1.0 of Mine UI for download on this site (thanks to Kudane and Dolby for providing a nice place for hosting these). You may download it here:<br />

This mod isn't for everyone. I'm very not a graphic artist. This is more functional than it is beautiful. My goals in creating it since the new UI came out were:<br />
1) Compact<br />
2) Clean (badly aligned graphics or poor GUI layout from default sucks)<br />
3) Useful<br />
<br />
Developers may find bits and pieces of this UI useful. Feel free to learn or steal bits of XML where it helps yourself. That's very encouraged.<br />
<br />
Users, it should be awful easy to drop in whatever you like better. If you like Geddine's buffbox, drop it in. If you like t.king icons or a spell box, drop it in. I've not taken up the superfluous windows (except the Friends Window), so if you want to make the feedback window a right clickies or a map or locs or tradeskills, do it.<br />
<br />
Really, I view my UI as what the default should have been. Highlights from it include:<br />
1) All windows visited and relayed out for clarity and compactness<br />
2) Graphics cleaned up (less guady window borders etc)<br />
3) Click-free bags that still look nice (great for tradeskillers)<br />
4) Old-style inventory<br />
5) Player stats separate from inventory (stats in the friends window - alt-F1 by default - I remapped to P in alt-o-&gt;keyboard-&gt;UI)<br />
6) Compact mp3 player that looks great at 100% fade<br />
7) Compass fits in with UI and color codes neg/pos locs<br />
8) Redid default icons adding color coded backgrounds (this makes the default icons MUCH better)<br />
9) Standard useful upgrades everyone does (floating book, percents on gauges, hp/ac/atk on main window, etc)<br />
<br />
Feel free to grab it if you want to check it out. I've been using it since the new UI came out as have many in my guild. It should be pretty useable. No dragons in the background or leafy excitement. Just functionality.<br />
<br />
Feel free also to cannibalize it if you enjoy pieces like the mp3 window or the spell icons. You should just need my_window_pieces01.tga, MY_Animations.xml and the associated window XML.<br />
<br />
Have a good day!<br />
