<br />
Any of you XML pros mind giving this a shot please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cinius Shade</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's similiar to the setup I'm working on right now. A partner and I are re-doing the whole UI so we'll roll it out as a package. When we work on the target bar I'll see about posting it up. The only thing is it will be BIG. Once it's posted ppl can make adjustments and such tho or I can make a small one for ya.. give us a few days..<br />

<br />
Impossiable, sorry mate. That information is just never sent to the client to even be seen or known.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boosh</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want a Target bar that shows the Target's % health. (as seen on many mods)<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
just below that in the same window, my mana bar with % (also seen on many mods)<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
just below that in the same window, my spell casting bar (as seen on many mods)<br />
<br />
Hope that clarifies this request and thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What size you want this bar before I post it in the next day or 2? I'd say today but I have to get AA exp and recover from the last Seru raid we did.<br />

<br />
Just a matter of adding bars, I can play with it later today to see what I come up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boosh</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Size doesn't matter.......hehe<br />
<br />
I'd say just pattern it after the current target box and enlarge only as needed to fit the other 2 lines.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.  I really think when other nukers see this box, they're gonna like it.  These are the 3 items that I'm constantly looking at DURING combat.  <br />
<br />
We'll see though....<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
