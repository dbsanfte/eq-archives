<br />
It has 3 tabs.  The first one has player informatio, the second pet commands and hp/status, and the third tab is unused.<br />
<br />
The height and width are desigened to fit in a drakah ui, on the right of the main chat window.  (I resized the chatwindow horizontally)<br />
<br />
I have been getting errors with it, and the pet commands keep moving.<br />
<br />
Please, could one fo you more experiences skinners/coders help me fo fix this before I move on with the third tab?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have time to look at what you did, but it sounds like you might have tried to do this (we all have tried and failed :( at one time or another.)<br />
<br />
If someone out there has figured out how to move buttons onto a tabbed form, PLEASE let us all know how to do it.</div></div><hr />

Mine is similar, except I have a 3rd tab, and the size is different to accomodate more information.</div></div><hr />
