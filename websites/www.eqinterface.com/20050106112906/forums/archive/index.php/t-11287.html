I use the Celtic UI and did the 1.8 update to those files and my Pet Hammer still won't work. <br />
<br />
Is this a Celtic UI issue or a Sony one?<br />
<br />
<br />
***EDIT***<br />
<br />
Bah, just read on the Sony website that there is a known problem with the Cleric Hammer Pet. Supposed to be fixed next patch.<br />
<br />
FYI</div></div><hr />

Unswerving Hammer of Faith<br />

Hello! <br />
Unswerving Hammer of Faith (Cleric 54) Spell is broken as of last week's patch. <br />
The Hammer is summoned, mana burnt, the hammer appears. Then it behaves as if it has no target and disolves. <br />
This is easily tested and duplicated under any circumstances - and beleive me, I keep trying every night. <br />
I am majorly missing this spell =( <br />
Thank you! <br />
<br />
It is indeed broken. It seems that there is an issue with the hammer, the sword and any of the &quot;targeted&quot; pets. It should be fixed on Test soon and will be fixed on the Live servers with our next big update. <br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Today isn't a patch day, rather it's the day that there will be a live chat with SoE addressing new melee functions tonight at 6PM PST.</div></div><hr />
