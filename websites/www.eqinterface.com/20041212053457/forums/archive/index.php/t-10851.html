<br />
He hadn't had an update for this particular group window in a very long time. It's from last Febuary release. and was included as a &quot;stand alone&quot;.  I found it, and absolutely loved it.<br />
<br />
So, I emailed T.King on how to fix it so that it would continue to work after the patches. (patch updates posted here broke it, many times, and I was very frustrated)..<br />
<br />
So I decided since it is fixed now, I would upload the Updated version  :)<br />
<br />
Description: Contains all the information for group with group percentages, spaced nicely in a vertical position. Includes, self stats, resists, Name, HP/maxHp label at the top.  Includes, Self health bar, Self mana bar, and Self stamina bar.  And also has wt/maxwt at the bottom.  Has Invite/LFG/Disband as well. <br />
<br />
It truely is an All in one group window piece, and is easy to fit on a corner or center. rounded edges in gold trim, with a the famous T.King marble background.<br />
<br />
Hope you like it<br />
