It includes a minor change to the Options window, but very few mods have this in it, soo 99% of all working mods should see no change.<br />

<br />
And if anyone has custom bank windows, they will need to change as well. I think I read about increased bank space being added too.</div></div><hr />

execept that both of these are part of the selling point for Legends, sooooo if they did this.. it would cut a big hole in the Legend Server. <br />
<br />
I don't doubt it could be something close to this.. but I havea feeling &quot;new&quot; means new.... <br />
<br />
hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tobin Itharel</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that Legends was sold in part for the guild and map system but that was NOT the main draw of the Legends server. The interactive GM support and quests is the main Legends selling point. The already coded and I must say &quot;debugged&quot; Cartography System and Guild Management Tool would be a great draw to the expansion. SOE taking the &quot;as is&quot; systems and placeing them into an expansion that would get 100,000+ sales would more then offset a dip in Legends users. This would be a smart move on SOEs part and that is why I think what we will find is the Legends systems placed into this expansion.<br />
<br />
This is all just a guess on my part but knowing how SOE has gone as of late, I feel it is a good guess.</div></div><hr />

Right now it's listed as EQType 0  and uses the background image of the ear slot.<br />

Also there has been a new bank window xml file add to the defaults. It's named BigBankWnd.XML and does show having 16 slots :)</div></div><hr />

It tracked what zones you had been to, where you characters were camped/bound and where guild members were hanging out in.  Overall, a nice tool, but it wasn't in EQ itself.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping to see actual zone maps instead.  there's already a zome map mod for the healp window out there.  Why not just make something similar?<br />

<br />
Havn't heard one way or the other of it coming down to users not getting Ykesh but only the new bank window has a new name. The charm slot was added to the defaut inventory screen so that might mean everyone will have access to the charms.<br />
Atleast this is how it stands on Test right now. But things change here a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tobin Itharel</div><div class="date">01-26-2003, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adding CHARMS to all players WILL be the way that MUST go... Think about it... The item database will beed to be upped with new flags and drop tables changed. Tradeskill made CHARMS will be put in most likely and the UI is being changed. It makes NO sense to limit that ONLY to LoY players. What will happen will be that the BEST CHARMS will drop in the NEW zones and be NODROP. That way people will want the new expansion for &quot;better&quot; CHARMS.<br />
<br />
IMHO</div></div><hr />

/imagines ON<br />
So you will be able to map and get better at making maps (maybe buy and sell at vendors/bazzar) here's hoping.  So maybe we'd all be able to have maps that we can rt click and open like a book.... (could be cumbersome if it is not setup like the key ring thing)<br />
<br />
Depending on skil lvl is how detailed map appears. (may not be able to happen too cumbersome)<br />
<br />
Right Click map - Opens zone you are in automatically or pop up dialog check which map you want...that would be cool.<br />
/imagines OFF</div></div><hr />

Good to know if you already have the BACKSPACE key defined doing something else (like me).</div></div><hr />
