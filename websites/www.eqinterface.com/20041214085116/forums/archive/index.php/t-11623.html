<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gr8f8</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome!  I have been searching for just the right UI and this one ROCKS.  I'm not a wiz at the whole UI thing but I know what I like and what works and this one is just what I have been looking for.  BRAVO! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pr0phet</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree this is an excellent UI and it's really the only one I'll use. <br />
I have one problem, though. The piece with my HP/Stamina/Name/Level is missing it's background picture. It's just a transparent box with letters, it seems. The HP/Stamina graphics are there, somehow. And when I cast, I can see the background image kind of scan past...?<br />
<br />
Is there a seperate thing I have to put behind it? Or should it all be one piece?<br />
<br />
I'm a little new to this myself...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It should be there..  if you right click somewhere on the box (this is technically your group window) you should get a little menu. . select background -&gt; texture and see if that fixes it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pr0phet</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awe, yeah! That fixed it. :D<br />
<br />
one other thing i noticed is that when you're grouped with somebody and are in different zones, the F1 &lt;someones name&gt; goes blank ?? The graphic is there but no name. Is this another texture thing I should adjust?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, the name disappearing is probably due to how the name for the group member is being displayed.. it's not the name that is part of the gauge, it's a label with the same EQType as the gauge..  So that's just due to how the code on the server is handling it..  I can probably change it to use the name on the gauge versus using a seperate label for the name..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalamaku</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">awsome UI. there was only one part, that i could tell, that was a bit confusing.  when i went to the inventory screen, i only got a screen with a destroy button and the cash slots, no items or inventory slots.  i see that you have an item tab on the pet window, and you can see your bag slots on the horizontal bar, but nothing when you go to inventory.  is this intentional? or  something funny, just curious.<br />
<br />
PS, if you have the time, i was wondering if you would be able to break down parts of this UI into stand alone downloads? specifically i love the container/bazaar/trader/bank/looting windows.  is it possible to extract these into stand alone items?  i tried to pull them out but it didnt work.  thanks for all the hard work! keep up the good job<br />
<br />
kala</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalamaku</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh and the map window hehe that rocks as well<br />
<br />
kala</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The map window is from Drakah's Warcraft UI, all I did was reposition some of the buttons he had positioned outside of the window..  (probably because those buttons just aren't used very much) ..  I think you can use that one outside of the UI, you would just need to change which draw template it uses.. (and of course copy the .tga file for the artwork)<br />
<br />
Yes, the inventory slots have been removed from the inventory window on purpose.. Since they are always available in the pet info window (there is an option to keep it up at all times in the options) and the rest of the slots are on the hotbutton bar..  I didn't like having them in two different places..  What's left in the inventory window is what couldn't be moved.<br />
<br />
I think I can put out a stand alone mod for those windows you mentioned.. I had already posted a stand alone container mod on Drakah's website, and I believe I would just need to add the xml for the other windows to that (since they are using the same template).. Note that this would not be a drop in mod to the other warcraft mods as there are some elements that would be shared and cause it to crash..  (you would need to make modifications to the code to get it to work)<br />
<br />
I really don't have any plans to reorient the spell bar or the buffs..  for one thing there's not enough room on the screen for that orientation ..  I would have to completely resize them for that to work..  so sorry, you're kind of stuck with them in the horizontal positions  (note that you could delete the .xml files to revert back to default, but you'll lose the mana bar if you do that ..  also the casting gauge window is currently set to size 0,0)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I uploaded the container type windows as a seperate mod under the containers category..  This includes: bazaar, big bank, loot, merchant, container, give and trade windows.. works with the default UI - see the downloads section once it's available<br />
<br />
Those windows are nice, but I don't care to modify them..  they should work with the UI just fine though, and if they use the default templates (which I modified for this UI) then they will even look like they belong.. ;) ..  most stand alone mods should work if they were coded correctly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">numdayen</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I loved the UI but it crashed me so I don't know what I did wrong and 2 i had no yes or no buttons on my rez window <br />
<br />
But all and all nice skin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if it crashed the game (meaning EQ closed) then I'm not sure what to tell you... When that happens it generally doesn't put any error message in the UIErrors.txt file..  However if there is an error in that file let me know what it is and maybe I can figure out why it crashed..  <br />
<br />
As to the yes/no buttons not showing up, looks like this is a rather common issue, and is caused by some corruption in some options files..  You can look in the &quot;Help&quot; forum for more info, but looks like you need to remove some options files to resolve that one..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jennick52</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have just 1 question.  how do i make the exp bar that shows on the main screen show reg. exp and not AA, or visa versa depending on what i am goin for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanzermorf</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome UI btw, its the best one i've seen so far.<br />
Only problem i've had so far is that i cant see HP in numbers i'm so used to the numbers instead of just looking at the bar =p<br />
<br />
And when i go to a merchant..the merchant window is so big that when i press Alt to see the item names they jus stack on top of each other and its hard to see what u want to buy without goin to each item one at a time.<br />
<br />
Just some suggestions to make it more convenient..Lazy guy here hehe )<br />
<br />
PS. is there a way to put those cool character pics near your HP too? like the one Drakah made?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The exp bars (both of them) and the HP numbers are in the pet info window..   There is not a gauge in the hotbutton bar on my UI ..  So if you want to see either of those you should keep the pet window up at all times (and it should show the player tab in that window) ..  As for the merchant window, sorry, but I didn't want to make the merchant window any bigger.  if you don't like it then simply delete the merchant_window.xml file..  <br />
<br />
If you want to put a different image next to your name and gauges, you can follow the same instructions Drakah gives with his UI (note however that he doesn't include the racial images with Warcraft emulated 2.0) ...  Without looking, I think it's the Player_Picture.tga that you need to modify.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will try to get this UI modified this evening for the patch changes..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe any chance to get it for 1280-1024 ?<br />
<br />
(seems to be pretty easy to readapt, but im complety noob with xml code)  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I really enjoyed making the UI and I'm glad others like it..  This was modified from Drakah's Warcraft Emulated UI version 2.0 ..  If you want it for 1280x1024 resolution I would suggest using his UI.. (there are some differences, but overall it's similar) ..  <br />
<br />
I believe I mentioned the use of my stand-alone container mod with the other Warcraft UIs in the description of that mod..  Because the stand-alone mod has to define some elements that are already in use in the Warcraft UIs, it will not work with those UIs without modifying the XML..  Perhaps when Drakah has time to remodify his UI, he will include my container mod in it..  <br />
<br />
As for the hotbutton bar, you might be able to simply copy that html with appropriate graphic files (drakah_wow_buttons.tga and the drakah_wow_hotbuttons_xx.tga's I think) and use it with another UI ..  I haven't really planned on making seperate mods for each piece of the UI..  Most of the things that will cause problems when using these seperately is simply template definitions, or graphic definitions.. <br />
<br />
I will have to find the configuration file I used to take the screenshot with.. I think I still have everything in the same position shown, but I'll need to verify before I post the file..</div></div><hr />

I am very disappointed to hear that this is no longer going to be updated, especially with the upcoming changes with GoD.  The UI is a nice and clean, everything lining up beautifully.  One of the main reasons why I love this UI so much is the merchant and loot window with all slots showing.  I also love the fact that it is for 1024x768 where most of the UIs now require a much higher resolution.<br />
<br />
If anyone is planning on continue the support of this UI, please make a post.  Also, if anyone has any suggestions of UIs that are similiar, I would appreciate it if you would let me know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for a larger version, sorry but I won't be doing that..  Drakah's original Warcraft Emulated UI is in that size if you want the same style of UI.</div></div><hr />

With you saying that you were leaving and not updating the UI anymore, I've been looking hard for something that I could replace this with that had the same 'feel' to it.  Needless to say, I never found that UI.  I love this one!  Instead, I worked on updating it through posts of previous updates.  I made a Combat Utlities window along with updating with the patch updates.  I am sure there is something I missed. <br />
<br />
I hope you continue to work on this UI.  I appreciate your hard work :)</div></div><hr />

I could customize it for you but I'm not sure how you would use it with the way the current windows work (the group window - which has your player hp/stamina at the top - takes up most of the screen space on the left at 1024x768 resolution )  Of course if you are using this at a higher resolution I can see how you might like to rearrange things..  I might put it on my list of things to do and offer a seperate mod for that sometime in the future..</div></div><hr />

I went back to Drakah's original spell bar, but I have 1 problem. There's not display of current mana. And we all know that's a must.

Check it out and see if it works (I haven't tested it in game, just rearranged it in SidlWidl)<br />
<br />
I'll get around to some of the other requests &quot;soon&quot;.. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I finally did a modification to the Combat Abilities window..  This is version 1, I'll probably do another version later that would directly replace the cast spell window..  For now I just did a quick version that uses the graphics from the WoW UI..  Please try it out and let me know if it works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I modified the target of target window, but since I don't have GoD I have no way to verify if it works properly (only concern is whether the percent shows up on the guage or not, otherwise it should work properly) ..  <br />
<br />
I didn't make it exactly like the target window because the big circle takes up alot of room..  I did use the rest of the graphic though to surround the guage and the name..  You should be able to use this in place of the attack mode indicator and hopefully it won't look too strange.. I thought about actually modifying the background of the target window to include this, but it would take up some space for those who don't have GoD.<br />
<br />
Anyway, give it a try and let me know if it works:</div></div><hr />

This should make it a little easier to read the buttons at 1280x1024 and higher resolutions..   Try and out and let me know if there are any problems with it..</div></div><hr />

Thanks for working on this, I appreciate it.  I didn't expect it so soon as I have not gotten this ability yet.  Hopefully someone will be able to test it out.  If not, when I can I will let you know. :D</div></div><hr />

I really like how this looks.  I haven't tested it, just looked at it in SIDLWIDL.  I am impressed.  One question though, any idea of screen placement for this?  I'd like to see where others are putting this.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your hard work.  Love this UI.</div></div><hr />

I'd suggest putting this one just above the hot button bar, though I'm sure others might find a nicer place for it.. again this is just version 1..  I will probably create another version later to go in place of the cast spell bar, and then maybe another one when I come up with an idea for it that I really like..  (this was just the rushed version)</div></div><hr />

When I logged in today I got a UI error.  This is what the UIErrors.txt gave me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Error: Could not find child TargetOfTarget_HPPercLabel in window TargetOfTargetWindow&quot;.</div></div><hr />

bah, darn it..   I got rid of it because it didn't fit in with the rest of the UI ..  I was hoping it wasn't needed..   (it's just the &quot;%&quot; percent sign) ..  Well I guess I can add it back in and just put it's size to 0,0 .. hehe..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I uploaded a new file..  redownload and see if that works.. I also think I had the window setup incorrectly (had hp number where I wanted to have target name) ..  (I changed the file in the original post, so it's on page 4)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shoonasasi</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I adore this UI, but as a Beastlord I can't have a pet window that I can't see all the time, along with my health, mana ect.  Any way you might make a separate pet window for us pet users so we can still control our pet without giving up seeing our hp/mana?  I would love to use this fantastic UI! Thanks  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-04-2004, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is that that window IS the pet window..  So I would have to move the player info to another window..  Currently the real player window is simply the attack indicator..  Someone else also has made this request and I just haven't had time to do anything about it yet..  Maybe someday soon..  (you might try taking the pet window from Drakah's Emulated World of Warcraft 3.0 and a player window mod that includes the inventory slots and replace in the folder)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-12-2004, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It should load just fine.. make sure you didn't put it inside another folder.. I have the download setup to extract all the files inside a folder already..  also whatever folder name you use, make sure it doesn't have any spaces in it..  Let me know if that doesn't resolve your problem..</div></div><hr />
