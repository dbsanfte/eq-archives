Sick of no 800x600 UIs that are half decent, and absolutely in love with Zeremus Windows v3.0 (Crayola Release) with its color-changing HP gauges, I tweaked around with it to make it run slightly smoother and in 800x600.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think and I'll try to mess around with it some more if people like it:<br />

I am glad you made a UI that is 800 x 600.  Not many people do.  I don't use my keyboard much at all because I usually have a busy 2 year old getting up and down in my lap.  Being a wizard and needing to nuke/concussion with pointer is VERY hard if you are using a resolution that is greater. <br />
<br />
I really like your UI set up.  I would just put in T.King icon graphics (sorry I am hooked on them).  Other than that, you did a fantastic job.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for being considerate and making us NON-KEYBOARD using EQ players happy.<br />

By the way is this the only 800x600 UI in this whole website?  Just wondering!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing that I might request for a change or option is if it were lighter in colour as my second comp is always too dark...<br />
<br />
Good work!<br />
