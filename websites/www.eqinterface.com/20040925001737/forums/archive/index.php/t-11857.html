<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilcure</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I finally decide to get out of the dark ages and upgrade my old copy of Photoshop 5.  Here's the problem, I made my alpha layer just like I used to and goto save as a targa.  Photoshop tells me I must save it as a copy, which seems odd to me.  So I figure, ok something has changed I'll go along with it.  <br />
<br />
I finish all my editting do the final save and photoshop tells asks me if I want to save it in a format that will show all the features that have been enabled.  It saves the file as a targa but when I look at it again in photoshop the alpha layers are gone.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas? I never had this problem with earlier version of photoshop</div></div><hr />

I must be missing a setting somewhere.</div></div><hr />

There may be a fix, I can't remember. Do a search on the forums here, I know it's been talked about before.<br />
<br />
I'm still using my trusty PhotoShop 6... I have 7 here in the house, but I've never installed it. I'm so used to 6 that it's almost second nature. I'm afraid of new things. hehe</div></div><hr />
