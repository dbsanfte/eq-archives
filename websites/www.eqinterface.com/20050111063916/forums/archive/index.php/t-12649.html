Well, here's the story.  I love vert.. and i really appreciate sokol and kudane taking it over and patching it... (saves me lots of time).  But like others, i've made done a little mod'n to mine as well.  I really liked Dreamlife's vert mod map (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=2780), but it just wasn't exactly what i wanted... so i'm in the process of modifying it.  I added my own graphics to a .tga file, and i thought i did everything right.  When i look in FIDDLE it shows up just the way i want it to, but when i get in game, all of the graphics from cart02.tga never shows up.  Its the only thing keeping me from finishing... and its driving me CRAZY...  Anyways, any help that you guys can give me would be the best... PM me, or post a reply if you want... and here's some info:<br />
<br />
I'm using FIDDLE/XMLSPY to mod these:<br />
(don't know if xmlspy has a way to see your UI or not though)<br />
<br />
You can see my problem: HERE (http://www.umsl.edu/~erfhw2/problem.jpg) <br />
<br />
and you can download my code and .tga files: HERE (http://www.umsl.edu/~erfhw2/problem.zip) <br />
<br />
Thanks again for any help you can provide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mutley</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most every .tga file has a mask to it.  Open up another good .tga file and find in your graphic program's Mask area to show the mask and edit it.  <br />
<br />
You'll have to read up on masks to see what you need to do to create them and edit them off existing images.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What graphics program are you using?  Alpha channels are actually very easy to create/edit once you've done it a time or two (trust me, took me a while to get it figured out too).  If you are using either PaintShopPro or PhotoShop, I can walk you through it.  If you are using something else, I can tell you how it's done in those two, and you can hopefully apply that to the program you use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evytyn</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently using Photoshop 6.0 (i think that's the number).  I'm ok with it.. not great... not horrible.  Any help would be wonderful... i've been trying to finish that UI for a long time now.. i keep giving up, then  i'll try again a few weeks later... give up... wash, rinse, repeat.. =/   Yes, i would indeed like some help/tutorial if you have the time. =D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, easiest explanation.  What you need to do is get your &quot;magic wand&quot;, select all the parts you want to have show up.  With those parts selected, go to the &quot;Selections&quot; drop down list, choose Save to Alpha Channel.  Make sure you overwrite the existing channel.</div></div><hr />
