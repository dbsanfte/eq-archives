<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavarien</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I decided to start a thread for the UI so those of you who have chosen to use it can keep it updated.<br />
<br />
============================================<br />
<br />
You can find a screenshot of the Mav UI and Download it here:<br />
<br />
Mavs Ranger UI Ver 3.8 at EQ Interface Downloads (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2587)<br />
<br />
On patch days the latest version can be found here till its posted in the Download section:<br />
<br />
The Link formerly provided here to my webspace on Earthlink has been removed.  The reason is because Earthlink farms out their phone tech support to India and I will not knowingly support a company that sends potential American jobs overseas. I have a new ISP now and will get around to setting up my personal webspace sometime in the future.<br />
<br />
* Edit * 09-15-04  Omen's Update<br />
1. Had to redo the Spell Cast Graphic to add the 9th spell slot<br />
2. Had to adjust the Buff Window to add the 5 new Buff Slots<br />
3. Had to adjust the Hot Button Window to match Buff Window Height<br />
4. Added Group Leader XP Bar to the Hot Button Window for grins<br />
5. Updated the EQUI_Animations  (See the FAQ post or the Readme.txt file for how to change back to the default cursor)<br />
<br />
* Edit * 08-24-04<br />
1. Fixed that Damn container, FINALLY!<br />
2. Added Endurance and Mana totals<br />
3. Hopefully made the HP total show 10k HP properly, per request<br />
4. Moved Tabs to the Disc window, resized Target window and disc windows accordingly<br />
<br />
* Edit * 05-27-04<br />
1. Added the Auto-Bank Button to the EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml<br />
2. There are 2 EQUI_Animations.xml files included<br />
        EQUI_Animations_Default_Cursor.xml<br />
        EQUI_Animations_Epic_Cursor.xml<br />
    Rename the one you want to use to EQUI_Animations.xml.  The Epic Cursor is the current one, give it a try.  Believe me, you won't lose it in dark or light areas.<br />
3. Made some changes that are not redily apparent to the user.<br />
        a.  Made the tk_givewindow.tga transparent<br />
        b.  Made the tk_tradewindow01.tga and the tk_tradewindow01.tga transparent<br />
    This is for those who may use the UI with a non-Ranger charactor and would like to use different colored Windows_Pieces and wnd_bg graphics that are more suited to that Charactor.<br />
4. Moved some Texture defs and animation defs around to make patch days easier.<br />
<br />
* Edit * 05-09-04<br />
1. Fixed the EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
2. Fixed the EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml -- Added back in the Regular Plat slot and added the Change Button<br />
3. Fixed the EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml<br />
3. Changed to Ceno's Spike Spin aura  3D Targeting Ring<br />
<br />
<br />
* Edit * 11-12-03<br />
1. I completely re-wrote the EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml and it now matches the containers. Be aware I left out the regular plat slot and only have the shared plat slot defined. So if you haven't already, you need to move all your plat to the shared plat slot before loading the new UI revision.<br />
<br />
2. Made the cursor the same as the inventory Icon for the Ranger Epic.<br />
<br />
3. Changed the EQUI_BookWindow.xml to use the old TKing spellbook graphic. Just like the spellbook, you click the page edges to turn the page and click the gem in the center to close the book.<br />
<br />
4. I incoroporated Elindel's color changing health percentage background to the Target Window, Player Stats Window, Group Window and Pet Window. This changes the color behind the heath percentages in these windows from Green to Yellow to red to flashing red as health drops. I also added F2 thru F6 labels to the group member's respective health bars. Someone asked me to do this a long time ago, well, I finally got around to it.<br />
<br />
7. Added raidenelf's Nuclear TargetIndicator<br />
<br />
6. Changed the Chat Windows back to tintable<br />
<br />
* Edit * 10-09-03<br />
1. Updated the UI to comply with today's patch<br />
2. Made the Pet Control Window, Short Duration (Bard Song) Window, and Chat Windows transparent.<br />
3. Made some minor tweaks here and there throughout the UI.<br />
<br />
* Edit * 09-09-03<br />
1. Updated UI for the LDoN release<br />
2. Fixed errors that were apearing in the UIErrors.txt<br />
<br />
* Edit * 08-26-03<br />
1.  Updated for today's patch<br />
2.  Some other minor changes here and there<br />
<br />
* Edit *  03-20-03<br />
1.  Redid window_pieces02.tga and window_pieces04.tga<br />
2.  Switched to the latest Tking Forest inventory (slightly recolored)<br />
3.  Adjusted the EQUI_GroupWindow.xml<br />
4.  Updated the EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
<br />
* Edit *  02-07-03<br />
1.  Added Charm Slot to the Inventory Window<br />
2.  Updated UI_XXXXX_##.ini to help those with the sliding window bug<br />
<br />
* Edit *  02-04-03<br />
1. Updated Animations XML file<br />
2. Updated Windowpieces4 in an attempt to match the UI better<br />
3. Added a different Scrollbar Gutter<br />
<br />
* Edit *  01-16-03<br />
1. Updated the Pet Window<br />
2. Updated the Loot Window<br />
3. Made the Song Window match the UI<br />
<br />
* Edit * 12-19-02<br />
1.  Added TKing's new Ranger Class Animation<br />
2.  Switched to TKing's new Jade Spellbook<br />
3.  Minor changes here and there, I forget what they were<br />
<br />
* Edit * 11-28-02<br />
1.  Added Yuniargo's MP3 Player<br />
2.  Made sure Animations xml is current in both Rev 1 and Rev 2<br />
<br />
* Edit * 11-20-02  Version 2.2<br />
<br />
1.  Minor Tweaks here and there<br />
2.  Moved the buttons around on the inventory window<br />
3.  Made some text color changes in the inventory window<br />
<br />
Future plans:<br />
1.  Redo the Music Player Window.  I'll probably wait a bit to be sure VI is done screwing with it<br />
2.  Waiting for the TKing 1.05 spells, Ranger class animation and spell book<br />
3.  Statix had some interesting ideas on his webpage that I may try and integrate.  They will be transparent to the user, but make future VI upgrades easier to incorporate and less likely to break the UI.<br />
<br />
* Edit *  11-03-02  Version 2.1<br />
Rev 2 changes:<br />
1. Made minor changes to the Buff Box<br />
2. Two versions of the EQUI_Animations.xml, one with TKing Arrow, and one without.<br />
3. Changed Player Info box to have a larger HP label and moved AC and Atk to Stats Tab<br />
<br />
****  The Version 2.0 Changes ****<br />
The same basic layout and look of Version 1, but numerouse code changes.<br />
<br />
1.  Revised the Castspell Box.  Took the tabs out, added the Weapon Swaps and used a re-colored Celtic spell casting bar from TKing<br />
<br />
2.  Revised the Hotbuttons Box.  Took out the Weapon Swaps, moved the pageup/down buttons, made the buttons smaller and made the whole box smaller.<br />
<br />
3.  Revised the Player Box (Which is really the Target Box).  Added Tabs for the Stats and Clickers.  Added 4 more Clicker Slots.<br />
<br />
4.  Revised the Buff Box.  Made it so it's not resizable, added Buff names and used the graphic from Vert for the Buff Names.  So far it seems to have resolved the missing Buff Box issue.<br />
<br />
5.  Revised the Petcontrol Box.  Used the one from Rax's UI.  Moved the buttons and gauge around some, added Pet Health percent label and sized it to match the UI.<br />
<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
So many folks to thank for ideas and code:<br />
Thomus King - For the Compass, Spellbook, Inventory and Spellgems graphics<br />
Remelio - For the Spellbook code<br />
Dolyn - For the basic hotbuttons code (I added the slots for weapon swaps)<br />
Statix Cinderblade - For the whole UI Mod Ideas that have inspired many many folks<br />
Adolek Durf - For the idea to add tabs to other boxes (He tabbed the hotbutton box)<br />
Sylverpaw - For the Green and Gold skins<br />
Sean - For the Tracking Window<br />
ceno - For the Spike Spin aura  3D Targeting Ring<br />
<br />
I had a great time setting up this UI and most of all a great time seeing the creativity and generousity of the people who choose to play EQ.<br />
<br />
I hope some of you like what I set up.  Feel free to Email me at Mavarien@sbcglobal.net if you have any comments or questions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavarien</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Friends,<br />
 <br />
First off, I want to thank you all for the positive feedback on my UI.  I am truly surprised and delighted at how many folks have enjoyed the UI that I have assembled and download it to use.<br />
 <br />
Here are a few FAQs and their answers:<br />
 <br />
==============================================<br />
 <br />
FAQ 1.  Can I change the Colors, Buttons and Windows background Textures?<br />
 <br />
Yes.  This UI uses the Standard Everquest Windows Pieces layouts.  So, you can use any that you want.<br />
 <br />
==============================================<br />
 <br />
FAQ 2.  How do I move the Chat Boxes?<br />
 <br />
Apparently if the title bar is removed and the Box is resizable, it has to be moved by stretching each edge to the desired location.  For this to be changed, some form of feedback, by all of us who have this issue, to Verant needs to be done.<br />
 <br />
FAQ 3.  What if one edge of the Chat Box is past the edge of the screen and I can't grab it to stretch?<br />
 <br />
Type /Load then press enter.  Be sure the &quot;Keep Existing ini&quot; button, or whatever it's called is clicked.  Select defaut and click the Load UI button.  Move the offending Chat Box to the center of the screen.  Type /Load again and reload the Ranger UI, once again making sure the &quot;Keep Existing ini&quot; button is clicked.  Stretch the edges as desired.<br />
 <br />
Note:  These resolutions can be used for the Tracking Window as well.<br />
 <br />
==============================================<br />
 <br />
FAQ 4.  Is the Hotkey Box resizable to a Vertical format?<br />
 <br />
No it is not.  At first glance this seems an odd question to be asked, but in reality, it is a very GOOD question.  Here's why it is.<br />
 <br />
Making it resizable is not an option because each piece of information displayed is given a x,y location defining where that item will be displayed. So resizing it, would simply allow you to stretch the edges of the box around, but the text, buttons and slots would remain where the loc specified them to be.  It is this way for every piece in every box in every UI mod made.<br />
 <br />
==============================================<br />
 <br />
FAQ 5.  Can I use a different Player Info Box?<br />
 <br />
No.  Since the contents of the Target Box and the Player Info boxes were swapped, they need to be used together.   Now you CAN use both a different Player Info and Target box, but it needs to be both, not one or the other.<br />
 <br />
==============================================<br />
 <br />
FAQ 6.  What is the Viewport setting I use?<br />
 <br />
Honestly .... I don't remember.  It's something like /viewport 0 0 1280 950<br />
The format for the command is this:<br />
 <br />
/Viewport X Y W H<br />
 <br />
X and Y define the PIXEL location of the upper left corner of the viewport.<br />
W and H define the PIXEL width and height of the viewport itself.<br />
 <br />
Hope that is understandable.<br />
 <br />
==============================================<br />
 <br />
FAQ 7.  How do I use the Default Cursor instead of the Epic Cursor?<br />
<br />
There are 2 EQUI_Animations.xml files included:<br />
EQUI_Animations_Default_Cursor.xml<br />
EQUI_Animations_Epic_Cursor.xml<br />
<br />
Rename the one you want to use to EQUI_Animations.xml. The Epic Cursor is the current one.  These files are provided here only to provide a choice for you to use the cursor you prefer.  They are not required for the operation of the UI.<br />
 <br />
==============================================<br />
 <br />
FAQ 8.  I play a Pure Caster Charactor and want to use this UI but there is no Disc Window available to Pure Casters and I can't use the Stats and Clickers tabs anymore.  How can I get these back?<br />
 <br />
There are 2 EQUI_Animations.xml files included:<br />
EQUI_TargetWindow_Hybrid_Caster.xml<br />
EQUI_TargetWindow_Pure_Caster.xml<br />
 <br />
Rename the one you want to use to EQUI_TargetWindow.xml. The Hybrid Caster is the current one.  These files are provided here only to provide a choice for you to use the Target Window for the class you are playing.  They are not required for the operation of the UI.<br />
 <br />
==============================================<br />
  <br />
FAQ 9.  How do I change the slots defined for the Clickers?<br />
 <br />
This one is simple to do, yet difficult to explain.  I'll try to explain here how you can easily reassign the slots for different items.<br />
 <br />
1.  Find the EQUI_TargetWindow.xml <br />
2.  Change the file extension from .xml to .txt   It should now be:  <br />
     EQUI_TargetWindow.txt<br />
3.  Edit this file with notepad<br />
4.  Page down thru the file and look for the section labeled:<br />
     &lt;!-- Begin Clicker Page --&gt;<br />
5.  The 12 clicker slots are labeled like this:<br />
     &lt;InvSlot item=&quot;TW_Clicker_Slot_1&quot;&gt;<br />
     There are 12 of them numbered 1 thru 12<br />
6.  In each of the slot definitions there are 2 lines that need modfying.<br />
     They are:<br />
     &lt;Background&gt;A_InvEar&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
     &lt;EQType&gt;1&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
     DO NOT CHANGE ANY OTHER LINES other than these two<br />
7.  EQType actually defines what the slot will be and Background defines what background pic will be displayed in the slot.<br />
Here is a list of the types and the background for each type:<br />
            Type 1 is Left Ear and the background is A_InvEar<br />
            Type 2 is Head and the background is A_InvHead<br />
            Type 3 is Face and the background is A_InvFace<br />
            Type 4 is Right Ear and the background is A_InvEar<br />
            Type 5 is Neck and the background is A_InvNeck<br />
            Type 6 is Shoulders and the background is A_InvShoulders<br />
            Type 7 is Arms and the background is A_InvArms<br />
            Type 8 is Cloak and the background is A_InvAboutBody<br />
            Type 9 is Left Wrist and the background is A_InvWrist<br />
            Type 10 is Right Wrist and the background is A_InvWrist<br />
            Type 11 is Range and the background is A_InvRange<br />
            Type 12 is Hands and the background is A_InvHands<br />
            Type 13 is Primary and the background is A_InvPrimary<br />
            Type 14 is Secondary and the background is A_InvSecondary<br />
            Type 15 is Left Finger and the background is A_InvRing<br />
            Type 16 is Right Finger and the background is A_InvRing<br />
            Type 17 is Chest and the background is A_InvChest<br />
            Type 18 is Legs and the background is A_InvLegs<br />
            Type 19 is Feet and the background is A_InvFeet<br />
            Type 20 is Waist and the background is A_InvWaist<br />
            Type 21 is Ammo and the background is A_InvAmmo<br />
            Type 22 is Inventory slot 1 and the background is A_RecessedBox<br />
            Type 23 is Inventory slot 2 and the background is A_RecessedBox<br />
            Type 24 is Inventory slot 3 and the background is A_RecessedBox<br />
            Type 25 is Inventory slot 4 and the background is A_RecessedBox<br />
            Type 26 is Inventory slot 5 and the background is A_RecessedBox<br />
            Type 27 is Inventory slot 6 and the background is A_RecessedBox<br />
            Type 28 is Inventory slot 7 and the background is A_RecessedBox<br />
            Type 29 is Inventory slot 8 and the background is A_RecessedBox<br />
8.  Substitute the desired Type number and background for each slot and<br />
     once again I cannot stress enough DO NOT CHANGE ANY OTHER LINES<br />
9.  Once the desired changes have been made, save the file.<br />
10. Change the file extension from .txt back to .xml and load up your charactor to<br />
       check that the slots are defined correctly.<br />

I just wanted to tell you that this is the most AWESOME UI I've seen and it fits my needs perfectly (ranger of course)<br />
  Not only is it incredibly functional but it's beautiful also.<br />
Thank you, thank you, thank you for making my EQ experience just a little more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
  Also wanted you to know that the buff window fix you provided worked great for me!</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Since the contents of the Target Box and the Player Info boxes were swapped, they need to be used together. Now you CAN use both a different Player Info and Target box, but it needs to be both, not one or the other.<br />
Actually, yes you can ... PROVIDED that the one you are getting has done the same thing (swapped them).  Same for the Target Window.</div></div><hr />

Any idea if it's possible to filter out the &quot;Your Bow Shot Did Double Dmg.&quot; messages - and if so - what filter I need to disable to remove them?  <br />

Thanks in advance. <br />

<br />
Try this:<br />
<br />
Load up the &quot;default&quot; mod.   Grab the buff window and drag it into the middle of the screen.  Then /load (your mod) 1, to keep the buff window in the middle of the screen, from whence you can move it to where you want it.<br />
<br />
Hope it works for ya.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did cover this problem in the second post in the thread with this resolution:<br />
============================================== <br />
<br />
Ok, now ... for the first issue: The Vanishing Buff Box<br />
<br />
I have had this crop up myself too, so don't feel left out. I resolved it this way:<br />
<br />
1. Type: /Load default (No number one at the end, I know, I know, <br />
you lose all the Box settings you spent an hour setting up)<br />
2. Move the Buff Box to the upper left corner of the screen<br />
3. Type: /Load Default 1 (Be sure to use the number 1)<br />
4. Type: /Load &lt;Whatever you called your UI folder&gt; 1 (Once again be sure to use the number 1)<br />
5. Move and stretch the boxes wherever you desire.<br />
6. If all else fails, you can use the default Buff Box or any other Buff Box <br />
mod with this UI.<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
A lot of reading there so you prolly just missed it.  <br />
<br />
Cairen's resolution works too, but I've had a few really stubborn ones that it needed every step I outlined above to get it to work properly.  Hope these two solutions help you out.</div></div><hr />

I'm using your UI and LOVE IT!  I especially love the Melee 1 and 2 buttons making it easy to change weapons with bag #8!  Now 2 questions.  <br />
<br />
#1  Can I change the quick access slot 4 (the one next to Melee 1, Melee 2 and slot 8) for my bow slot?  I have 2 bows that I like to change, one for pulling one for stats (raincaller or whatever I<br />
buy later).  <br />
<br />
#2  I found a vertical buff menu that allowed me to see buff names.  As rangers are sooooo dependent on buffs I prefer this method.  I know you'd spoken of possibly creating one that matches your UI if you were given enough reason, so hoping I could nudge ya in that direction!  &lt;grins&gt;<br />

Hello there, Feanorr here, 55 ranger of Saryrn.  I'm using your UI and LOVE IT!  I especially love the Melee 1 and 2 buttons making it easy to change weapons with bag #8!  Now 2 questions.  <br />

Got your Email and you should have a reply waiting</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can I change the preset hot buttons in the clicky/spells window so I can direct those buttons to other slots in which I Have right click items in.<br />
<br />
Hmm. That make sense? lol. I just want to set those click item hot buttoms to equiped items I have and not the preset ones. How can I accomplish this?<br />
<br />
Eager to hear your reply.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

In the second post  in this thread, I answered several questions folks had about the UI.  The last section of the post describes in detail how to reassign the slots on the clicker page.<br />

If you have any problems shoot me an Email</div></div><hr />

Earthlink locked my webspace Oct 8th for exceeding bandwidth.<br />

I uploaded the latest version to the Mix and Match section in downloads over the weekend, so keep your eyes peeled for the Webmaster to post it.<br />

The file name will be Mav_UI_Mods_9-26.zip<br />
<br />
If you can't wait, there is a pre-patch copy there already.  It doesn't have the &quot;Warmed-up&quot; Tking inventory window and you'll  have to delete the EQUI_AAWindow.xml file so it will work properly.<br />
<br />
I really can't Email it to alot of you who ask for a copy.  The reason being that it exceeds the attachment size restrictions set for the Email accts on Hotmail and Yahoo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for a great skin - I used Statix skin, but switched to yours :)<br />
<br />
Is there anything that need to be fixed with the new patch today? Haven't logged in yet :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I am sort of an idiot when it comes to these things - but how do you manage to keep your UI skin settings once you swap back from another skin or update/patch?<br />
<br />
If I swap from one skin from another, I still have to fix fading and location of all my windows, even if I do /loadskin &quot;name&quot; 1...any better way to do it?<br />

Thanks,<br />

<br />
1.  Delete EQUI_Animations.xml from your custom UI  folder<br />
2.  Copy EQUI_Animations.xml from the default folder to your custom UI folder<br />
3.  Unzip the contents of the attached Zip file in your custom UI folder.<br />
4.  Run the remmy.bat file to update the EQUI_Animations.xml to be able to use the Arrow cursor again.<br />
<br />
All should be fine after that.  <br />
<br />
I stll need to check the changes with the Pet Window to see if they are worth re-writing it.  But the UI works fine with the Pre-Patch one.</div></div><hr />

       Im eager to see what your new mod is but I cant seem to look at the pic or download the zip file from your link because It said the web site has been too popular and ill have to come back at the start or next month and im too impatient to wait that long! Would you mind emailing me your mod at Happifoot@aol.com  Im pretty sure Ill use it with so much good feedback and all. <br />

<br />
1) the &quot;spells/clickers&quot; box - is there a way to make it stay bolded/bright all the time or only when you pass your cursor over it? <br />
<br />
2) the transparent chat windows - can you tell me the rgb colors you are using and what transparency levels yours are set at?  I can't seem to get that transparent gold effect you got going. <br />
<br />
3) how did you line everything up so neatly?  I always have these tiny differences in the alignment between various windows and I just can't seem to get them aligned perfectly - I realize that's a bit nit picky but yours looks so neat and aligned.  (can you maybe post your Mav_UI folder for download to have it all pre-aligned for those of us in 1280 x 1024 reso too?) <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavarien</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There probably is a way to make tabbed pages not fade, I made a 1/2 a$$ stab at trying to find it, but learned to live with it.<br />
<br />
Here's my charactor INI file.  <br />
<br />
1.  Load the UI, then exit EQ<br />
2.  Rename this file to you charactor name and server number<br />
3.  Copy it to Everquest folder overwriting the existing one there<br />
4.  Fire up EQ and load your charactor<br />
5.  In a perfect world, my settings should be in effect<br />

Hope this works for you</div></div><hr />

Actually the blue represents a beneficial buff.  If a Non-beneficial spell were cast on me, it would've been red.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about changing the spell name's text color to green though.<br />
<br />
What about the Clickers and swaps areas?  Do you think they are too small?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OjUI</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mav - I like the changes - clickers and swap areas are nice imo and I like the pet window being gone now - but do agree the blue tint on the buffs looks out of place.  Perhaps the green ones as seen in this Vert 2.2 Cannabis buff bar would be more appropriate - and using the T.King Buff icons? (without the numbers of course).  btw...the non beneficial buff colors with that one are red still. <br />

Once you offer the revision up for dload - please post your UI_mav file too so I dun have to fight with my windows.  The last one worked flawlessly.<br />

<br />
-edit- Personally I'd love to see &quot;your hp&quot; in a much larger font than it is now - and it be up to the right of the name area in the player window as seen in this mod: http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=482</div></div><hr />

One major niggle I'm having at the moment. Been playing around, and with stubborness and some luck, have managed most of the tweaks I have wanted to do myself, but having serious trouble with the clickers. I prefer to use the standard spell bar, and casting window, but it would be VERY useful to have clicky items paged and close to hand for use.

The changes I made for the Buff Box to the EQUI_Animations were very minor.  I just added six lines for the buff.tga texture and changed the lines that define the buff background to use it.<br />
<br />
Now it is possible the Tking Arrow cursor graphic changes to the EQUI_Animations are the culprit.<br />

Here's an EQUI_Animations.xml without the TKing arrow.  See if this helps you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just had a few things to say about Mavariens UI.  First off Mav is my RL significant other and has downloaded the ranger UI to my comp and set it all up for me.  *Thanks baby*  I play a 60 warder on EMarr and love that he has made it so easy for me to use and enjoy playing my ranger more.  Myself Im quite ignorant on the workings of my computer in general and basically check email and play eq, so having it made easier and more suited for my play is wonderfull.<br />
<br />
Second I just wanted to let you know Mav my love I truely appreciate that you do such things for me.  I know you enjoy working on this UI and see theres many others besides myself that like it and use it just as I do.  When you ask me questions and I say I like it but dont have alot to say I dont want you to think Im not interested for I am:)  Especially when I see you enjoying yourself and I reap the benefits from it on my eq game too hehehe!<br />
<br />
Just the other evening Mav saw theres been almost 9000!!!! hits downloading his hard work from eq players!  Not just rangers using it but other classes as well.<br />
<br />
Mavarien thank you for all your hours of making eq play more enjoyable for so many people around the world.  And a special thank you from me Sirennea Thunderspirit your proud EQ ranger wife in EQland and as her keyborder your lazy computer twinking girlfriend in real life.<br />
<br />
I love the UI.<br />
I love using it.<br />
I love that its so suited to my character.<br />
And <br />
<br />
I love you.<br />

I am very interested in utilizing this UI, as it would make my days in Norrath much easier to manage, the only concern that I have is the time spent installing this new UI and troubleshooting bugs.<br />
<br />
Give a novice a clue, how long would it take me to install this to have it up and running?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
For the Rev 2 version, simply do this:<br />
1.  Create a folder in Everquest\UIFILES folder called Ranger2<br />
2.  Unzip the Mod into the Ranger2 folder you just made<br />
3.  Fire up EQ and Load up the Char you want to use the UI with<br />
4.  Type /Load Ranger2<br />
5.  Move and stretch the Boxes to where ever you like<br />
<br />
Shouldn't take more than 10 or 15 mins total I'd think.<br />
<br />
If you have any problems, give me a shout</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't care for the Ivy background and green buttons, you can simply delete these files:<br />
window_pieces01.tga<br />
window_pieces02.tga<br />
window_pieces03.tga<br />
(Number 4 is the Tking Compass Graphic)<br />
window_pieces05.tga<br />
the wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga<br />
wnd_bg_light_rock.tga<br />
<br />
You can also replace them with others that are more appealing to you as long as they follow the Standard VI layout for the graphics.  Sylverpaws has several in the Complete UI section of downloads that are of superior quality</div></div><hr />

Just currently d/led your new UI, but having trouble finding the file to adjust the clicker setup. I must really be blind, but I can't find it :(.<br />
<br />
I believe the one on the front page only works with the first UI, because I remember the memmed spells and clickers tab on the same box.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I'm confusing you in anyway, thanks for any help though as always. :)  <br />

I updated the instructions for doing this in the 2nd post of this thread to help you get this fixed.  If you have any questions, shoot me an Email</div></div><hr />

I want to take time, as have many here, to thank you so much for improving my gaming experience, that much more...<br />
<br />
I have only one question...I read through the posts but didnt see anyone with a similar problem, though I may have missed it...<br />
<br />
Does your UI support the new MP3 Player?  If so how do I get it to come up...<br />
<br />
Ive tried Ctrl + K, as well as going to options and trying to bring up the window that way..Im guessing I dont have the version with the MP3 in there, if there is one.<br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry for the epic length post...I thank you again.<br />
<br />
Your assistance in this matter would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
I am,</div></div><hr />

Check your options before logging into EQ to be sure sound isn't disabled.<br />

<br />
2. Change the file extension from .xml to .txt It should now be: EQUI_CastSpellWnd.txt (EQUI_TargetWindow.txt for the Rev 2 version) <br />
<br />
How exactly does one &quot;change&quot; the .xml tag to a.txt tag?  Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.<br />

It's possible that it's a problem with the animations xml.   I did post a 2.2 version on patch day.  Have you tried that one?<br />

I'll put a 2.3 version up in a few minutes with the MP3 player I've been using included.</div></div><hr />

I'm having no issues with the mod from a while back and was curious just what the new revision looks like - before I update it.<br />
  <br />
Any chance you'll update the screenshot to reflect the mod in its' current state? <br />
<br />
~Oj<br />
<br />
edit:  yikes - I updated the UI and now it appears to be back to the old style with just the small square TK buff icons and the spellbar/clicker bar together?  Did you swap back or did I screw something up?  Really all I'd like to have is the updated music player - I prefer the more recent UI overall - what files would I need to extract to simply the the current player?</div></div><hr />

  After all the skins I have tried ( and failed or didnt like ) I downloaded youres. I must say, it is just excellent buddy! Great job! Way easy, no editing at all, just unzipped it and ran it. <br />
<br />
I do have a question though ... I want to change the ani to the new Druid one I have seen. Where exactly do I edit that? I dont want to break anything now that I have it all setup the way I want. Also, can I put a timer in there for something like Snare. root. ect...? without breaking something? If so where do I put that?<br />

<br />
In your Everquest directory on your hard drive are a bunch of files that end in .TXC.  These are you &quot;Texture Cache&quot; files.  You may already know this, but basically those are the files that Everquest creates (assuming you have the option turned on) on your hard drive that help make zoning faster.<br />
<br />
You can and should safely delete ALL of the .TXC files from your Everquest directory.  (Don't worry, EQ will re-create them when you get back into the game, and each time you zone into a new zone)<br />
<br />
After that, relaunch the game and check out your graphics.  They should be all fixed.  No more funny colored wolves running around. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OjUI</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the solution to screwed up graphics has nothing to do with Mav's UI - the solution is to open your Everquest folder and delete all the files that end with the .txc extension.  <br />
<br />
Everquest stores texture information for each zone in .txc files and if you have ones that are screwed up now - the game will not download new ones when you zone in.  <br />
<br />
Doing this will slow down your loading times in zones ever so slightly the first time you zone - but should clear up the funky graphic syndrome - and will go away once the game has updated the .txc files for each zone you visit.</div></div><hr />

I now can see the drooling and snarling little fuzzy wolves, no more red headed wolves with blue bodies.<br />
<br />
Next question, as this appears to be THE MOST HELPFUL WEBSITE I HAVE FOUND FOR EQ, I have seen some UI's that have seperate boxes for the different text.  For example, a text box that carries the SPELLS that are being cast, a different text box for crit hits and aother box for chat text.<br />
Give a novice the inside track, what can I do to seperate who is talking with me, how much damage I am hitting for and what spell was just cast on me for 350 damage besides using the colored text.<br />

You need to edit the animations file as she describes it - that was the part I was stuck on. It is not mentioned in the patch message from VI, but without that fix it will not work properly.

I use Mav's ui and had problems with it after this patch as well, even after adding the new files that Cairenn posted about (those in the patch message)<br />
<br />
After messing around a bit I finally got it to work. Cairenn has the solution in her detailed description of the files you need to change. You need to edit the animations file as she describes it - that was the part I was stuck on. It is not mentioned in the patch message from VI, but without that fix it will not work properly. So go look at Cairenn's fix from yesterday :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OjUI</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure Mav reversed them so the &quot;flashing&quot; red appears around the target window as opposed to appearing around your player info window when you press attack.   And I don't believe you can change that around easily in this UI without quite a bit of work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bleyse</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The above post that instructs people to edit all that info in thier custom UI file is correct and will work.  I found a shortcut though.<br />
<br />
In the skins folder you should have a default, and your custom folder, named whatever you want it to be.  The default folder is patched by verant and it will always be correct.  It is such a pain to open each file in a text editor, make the change and save it back to xml though. <br />
<br />
What I did, and this worked just fine for me, was copied all of the following files from the default directory to the custom directory:<br />
<br />
window_pieces04.tga<br />
EQUI_StoryWnd.xml <br />
EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml <br />
EQUI.xml <br />
EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml <br />
EQUI_LootWnd.xml <br />
EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
<br />
I read thru all the files in the &quot;default&quot; folder and discovered that in that folder, all these changes that I was being instructed to make had already been made.  SOE patched these changes in, at least at some point they did.<br />
<br />
My UI is up and running fine, but I have noticed two differences.  One is of course the new bard buff window, and the corresponding icon for it.  The window itself looks like default UI and so does the button itself for it.  This is subtle and doesn't affect gameplay.<br />
<br />
The second differnce is that the spells in the spell book have a more pronounced outline of red or blue around them, indicating if they are buff/debuff effects.  The same applies to my buff window, where before, the background area behind the spell description was green lines, and didn't run all the way across the space it could have.  Now the backgrounds are either red or blue and cover the whole area.<br />
<br />
Of course, going in and doing EXACTLY as instructed in the above post would probably prevent these two anomalies, but they bother me CONSIDERABLY less than having to look at the old UI.  If you want the quick fix, just copy the files I listed above out of the default into the custom.</div></div><hr />

I been using it and it's been working great!<br />
<br />
I do have a question for the smart people.  I am no computer genious and I don't try to be so don't laugh at my question!  :)<br />
<br />
I need to change the clicker slots a bit.  I found the post on how to do that.  I understand what to change and how to change it.<br />
<br />
My question is how do I change the .xml file to .txt? Then change it back from .txt to .xml once edited? I try to open the .xml and it opens with Windows explorer.  I figured hey open it then save as and change the file type like going from Gif to jpg.  Guess I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Any help would be muchly appreciated.  Thanks. <br />
<br />
Right click on the file and choose rename is one way.  You can also open Notepad or Worpad,  choose &quot;file&quot; then &quot;open&quot;, change &quot;files of type&quot; to &quot;all files&quot; then &quot;browse&quot; to the file you want to edit.  It opens right up for editing without haveing to change the file extension.  :)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />

I am currently using an older version of your UI, I like this version and do not wish to update it to the new one you are now showing.  Everything seams to work fine for me, except I still get the error message whenever I zone or log in.  I'm not sure the version number or what have you, I can only tell you that it is the the version with the spell gem window which is tabed with clickables.  I hope that is clear.  Anyway, I was wondering if you knew what needs to be done to stop that error message from appearing everytime I zone.  I do not want to ask you to correct the old one or anything like that, I just want to know if you can tell me what needs to be done to stop that error message.  <br />

It was taking too much of what little free time I have keeping two UI's current.<br />
<br />
What is the error message?<br />
<br />
Most likely it has to do with the EQUI_Animations.xml being out of date.  You can try deleting that file out of your custom UI folder to see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Some other files that have been patched are the EQUI_LootWnd.xml, the EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml and the window_pieces04.tga<br />
<br />
To keep the Pointer as the Tking arrow, you need to do the following:<br />
1. Delete the EQUI_Animations.xml you currently have in your Custom UI folder.<br />
<br />
2. Copy the EQUI_Animations.xml from the default UI folder to your Custom UI folder.<br />
<br />
3. Go to: http://pub165.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31.showMessage?topicID=56.topic<br />
and get the Tking Ranger Pointer from there and follow the installation instructions.</div></div><hr />

Mav - I updated to 2.8 and then decided to try your your UI file for the first time cause it looks so much cleaner.  I changed my res to 1280X1024 to make it work.  Everything worked great but the Player window was moved too far to the right.  It ended up aligned with the target window as planned but the Target window and the compas were swaped.  The target window is on to the right of the compass.  that makes the Playaer stats and clickies cover the two small chat windows you have set up.<br />
<br />
I don't know much about changing these kinds of things but I am going to go into the file and tinker around with some things and see if I can't get it fixed.  I could not drag the boxes around when I used your UI file. Did you lock them in place somehow?  Fortunatly for me I saved my UI File somewhere before replacing it with yours so I just put mine back.<br />
<br />
I do however like how you have yours set up and I hope to use it.  Either I have to get this fixed or if you could check to see why it did that and let me know how to fix it or something.<br />
<br />
If I can get a pic uploaded I will post it here to show you what it looked like.  That is if they allow images to be posted here.<br />

Thanks again for all your hard work on this awesome GUI!</div></div><hr />

Go to your main EQ directory and find the file:<br />
<br />
UI_YourCharacterName_YourServerNumber.ini<br />
<br />
(example, mine is UI_Cairenn_70.ini)<br />
<br />
Open it using a text editor (Word, WordPerfect, NotePad, etc.) and using the Search or Find function, do a search for &quot;Tracking&quot;.<br />
<br />
Set the following values all to 0:<br />
<br />
[TrackingWnd]<br />
XPos1024x768=0<br />
YPos1024x768=0<br />
XPos800x600=0<br />
YPos800x600=0<br />
XPos1280x1024=0<br />
YPos1280x1024=0<br />
<br />
This will have the window start in the top left corner of your screen.  Now when you log in, you can size it into the location you want it.</div></div><hr />

There are a few minor changes here and there to the UI that I have done in the past few months.  Darned if I remember what they are though.<br />
<br />
Just a reminder to those of you who are using this or any other custom UI ....<br />
<br />
Only the customized UI files need to be in the custom folder, any of the files not found there, will be automatically pulled from the default folder.<br />
<br />
An example being the EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml<br />
<br />
If you have an old version of this file in your custom UI folder, the new shared bank and plat slots will not appear.<br />

<br />
I loaded the new UI, and it loads - up to the point where I can reset all the windows/hotkeys/etc - but in one of my windows it says that my UI is missing some XML windows (or something like that - sorry, I'm posting from work, so I can't exactly tell you the error...I'll edit this tonight and put it in).<br />
<br />
Is there an error log you can go through for the UI when it loads so you can tell exactly what's causing a problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks much! :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Okay, here's the error that I actually get... /grin<br />
<br />
Your XML files are not compatible with current Everquest files, certain windows may not perform correctly. Use &quot;/loadskin default 1&quot; to load the EverQuest default skin.<br />
<br />

Heya, Mav.<br />
<br />
I loaded the new UI, and it loads - up to the point where I can reset all the windows/hotkeys/etc - but in one of my windows it says that my UI is missing some XML windows (or something like that - sorry, I'm posting from work, so I can't exactly tell you the error...I'll edit this tonight and put it in).<br />
<br />
Is there an error log you can go through for the UI when it loads so you can tell exactly what's causing a problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks much! :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Okay, here's the error that I actually get... /grin<br />
<br />
Your XML files are not compatible with current Everquest files, certain windows may not perform correctly. Use &quot;/loadskin default 1&quot; to load the EverQuest default skin.<br />

I checked the Group window XML and didn't see anything regarding the labels it shows here (HPLabel1-5and HPPercLabel1-5..for percentage HP for group members, and the other one for your specified target, perhaps?).</div></div><hr />

All it is saying is that it can't find those label names in your UI.<br />
<br />
To fix it, just change the Item, and Screen ID for those labels to match what Sony calls them, a very easy fix.<br />

If there are more than 500 traders and you try and open the bazaar searh window EQ WILL crash, no matter what. This will be fixed on the day LDoN goes live. Until then, just use /who trader to make sure there are less than 500 when opening the bazaar window (/bazaar, /baz and alt + A all cause the crash). The problem is with the search trader drop down box; it can't handle more than 500 values.<br />

I don't know what this will do to your custom UI but I love to use it.  I assume that you will have to make some changes when this information goes live.  I assume that these will break your custom UI.<br />
<br />
Source: EQ Live.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some things we're working on for the November update: (Please note: my producer is making me tell you that in addition to this list, we'll still be bug fixing and maintaining the live game and that, while we hope to get each of these features in, nothing is certain. But this is what we're working on at the present time.) <br />
<br />
New LDoN raids will go Live - We be moving the two new raids that were introduced on Stormhammer to the Live servers. These raids will prove an interesting challenge for the best of guilds. <br />
<br />
Another new LDoN raid - We will also be bringing one more new LDoN raid to Stormhammer with our next update. This raid will be created with Elemental capable characters in mind. <br />
<br />
Font changes - Since EverQuest was launched, there has only been one font available. With the next update we plan to introduce the option for players to choose the font for their interface. <br />
<br />
Targeting - Sometimes it can be difficult to tell which NPC you have targeted. With the next update we hope to add a targeting indicator of some sort (something like the ring that surrounds your target in EQOA). The exact form hasn't been decided, but the goal is to make seeing what you currently have targeted much easier. <br />
<br />
Consider - Along the same lines as the proposed improvement to targeting, we want to add a way to distinguish the /con color of your target. We plan an indicator that will be easily distinguished once you have a target (probably someplace in the Target window), that should remove the need to use the /con command. <br />
<br />
Other interface changes - We are also working on some other changes that will help you to organize your information. We plan to add a new text color option for damage shield reports that will allow you to pick what color those messages use. We also want to split the &quot;My Pet Attacks&quot; filter into two separate filters, one for hits and one for misses. <br />
<br />
/tell windows - It is very easy to lose /tells in the confusion of combat. We want to add an option that would work much like an instant messenger. Each time you get a &quot;tell&quot; from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window will only display &quot;tells&quot; from the particular character, and any message sent from the chat window would automatically be sent as a &quot;tell&quot; to that character. Obviously this would be an optional feature. <br />
<br />
Help for new players - New characters will start with a bag. This will give them a little more storage space and the opportunity to learn how storage containers work earlier rather than later. We are also working on removing one of the more tedious &quot;features&quot; of the game, the need to practice Sense Heading. Most folks have that skill mapped to trigger along with one of their movement keys. Not an exciting skill to practice. So we plan to have all characters start with a 200 skill in Sense Heading. This will allow new players to navigate more easily, and will reduce a bit of tedium over the course of gameplay. <br />

To fix the 3D Target Indicator, all you need to do is copy the TargetIndicator.ini and TargetIndicator.tga files from the default UI folder to the folder you installed the Mav UI in. (Be camped to desktop while doing this)<br />
<br />
Reguarding the Target Window Con color.  I fooled with this briefly and decided that the 3D Target Con was enuff and that I really didn't care for the other.  Consequently, the Target Window change will not be incorporated into the UI in the near future.<br />

<br />
I've finished updating the UI for the time being.  Here are the new features/changes:<br />
<br />
1.  I completely re-wrote the EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml and it now matches the containers.  Be aware I left out the regular plat slot and only have the shared plat slot defined.  So if you haven't already, you need to move all your plat to the shared plat slot before loading the new UI revision.<br />
<br />
http://home.earthlink.net/~jhatchit/bank.jpg<br />
<br />
2.  Made the cursor the same as the inventory Icon for the Ranger Epic.<br />
<br />
http://home.earthlink.net/~jhatchit/cursor.jpg<br />
<br />
3.  Changed the EQUI_BookWindow.xml to use the old TKing spellbook graphic.  Just like the spellbook, you click the page edges to turn the page and click the gem in the center to close the book.<br />
<br />
4.  I incoroporated Elindel's color changing health percentage background to the Target Window, Player Stats Window, Group Window and Pet Window.  This changes the color behind the heath percentages in these windows from Green to Yellow to red to flashing red as health drops.<br />
<br />
Target Window:<br />
http://home.earthlink.net/~jhatchit/target.jpg<br />
Player Stats Window:<br />
http://home.earthlink.net/~jhatchit/player.jpg<br />
<br />
I also added F2 thru F6 labels to the group member's respective health bars.  Someone asked me to do this a long time ago, well, I finally got around to it.<br />
<br />
Group Window:<br />
http://home.earthlink.net/~jhatchit/group.jpg<br />
<br />
7.  Added raidenelf's Nuclear TargetIndicator<br />
<br />
6.  Changed the Chat Windows back to tintable<br />
<br />
I hope you guys like the changes I made, let me know how you like it.<br />

<br />
It looks great.  I love the colors.  It definately give my play a more Ranger feel to it.<br />
<br />
I have a question about the spell box.<br />
<br />
I notice it does not have a load spell set button.  Am I missing the location or is one not on this UI yet.<br />
<br />
Thanks for keeping this UI looking great.<br />

Your work is appreciated.<br />

Try making a new UI folder with ONLY the new UI files.  Sometimes that works.  <br />

As for me, I figured out the chat thing.  /duh *smacks head on wall*  Context windows....right.</div></div><hr />

When I try to load it I dont get an error message, it simply does not load.  Here is something I have observed though.  I've downloaded and loaded up several other UI's, including the Steamworks one.  I just wanted something complex with a lot of textures and animations to test my idea.  I've checked most of the lines of code in the EQUI folders and matched with the ranger UI, what I found is that the steamworks UI of course doesn't have the ranger class bow emblem.  Other than that, nearly everything is similar in text.  Could this be where the error is comming from?  The one thing I have been unable to do is remove or replace the ranger class emblem...  Any thoughts or ideas on this?</div></div><hr />

In fact, a lot of the files they suggested fixing either could not be fixed as there was missing data, or the file didnt even exist.  I did fix what i could as it suggested, but to no gain.  I figured out how to leave the class emblem out and it still doesnt work.  I deleted the ranger UI file and made a new folder, named it RANGER and copied all of the files from the default UI into it.  I opened the ranger file back up and copied each file one by one.  Each time I coppied a filed I restarted EQ to see if the change was made in game.  Something as small of a change as the spell box wouldnt work.  Unfortuately this is as far as I got before giving up.  <br />

The EQUI_Animations.xml is the only file that I altered to get mine to work.  Try downloading mine and just sticking it in your UI folder that you run Mav out of.<br />
<br />
Hope it works for you.<br />

By the way, there is still a problem with the spell gems showing up default instead of the Mav ones.  I'm clueless how to fix this.  But everything else seems to be intact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry about the lack of support lately.  I have been on a break for a couple months.  I'll be working on updating the UI in a couple days.  <br />
<br />
The Fan went out on my 9700 Radeon and smoked it, so I can't even load EQ properly to test the UI Changes yet.  Never fear though.  I have an Asus Radeon 9800 XT Vid card on the way and a new 3.0 gHz processor so I can utilize the 800mHz FSB on my Motherboard.  <br />
<br />
So I'll be doing a complete Teardown of my system to clean all the dust bunnies out of it and Redo all the wiring so it's nice and tidy.  Maybe I'll post a pic so yall can drool!!!   :p<br />
<br />
Once that is all sorted out, I'll get the UI updated and posted.  Hopefully, this coming weekend it'll be done.  If not done, atleast I'll get started on it.<br />
<br />
Until then, good hunting!<br />

Regarding the UI, I found one thing.  In the raid window, the lines used to be color coded based on class.  All entries are white now.  I looooved being able to look thru there for rogues for SoT, find the hiding/anon Shammy to bug, etc.  Can this be fixed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nift</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The XML errors are most likely due to the bank window.  There was a change when GoD came out wich added the button to the bank.  The Mav UI currently does not have that.  I simple deleted the Mav UI bank window file and use the default and edited each window that exsisted for the GoD patch from the patch folder post.  After that I have been having no problems with the UI, no errors and it loads normally.  <br />
<br />
As to the Raid Window problem with the character classes not showing up in colors.. This I see anytime I load a new class without copying the UI_charname_server.ini file to the new character's file.  It seems that color selection settings for the raid window is stored there. Once I copy that over from my main I have no problem with the colors showing up in the raid window.</div></div><hr />
