<br />
I modified the player / target / group window with the following changes:<br />
<br />
- Removed AA EXP bar. Who needs a whole bar to weep over how little exp you get.<br />
- Added five new labels in its place. These are from left to right: AC, ATT, Fatigue, EXP, and AAXP.<br />
- Added a pet bar that fits right underneith the player HP bar.<br />
- Moved the casting bar over on top of the mana bar. When you cast, a purple line shows up half way up on the mana bar.<br />
- Removed all % signs next to figures. Once you understand that they are percentage values, you don't need a label to tell you that. Every element, every figure, should tell you something useful, not something you already know.<br />
- The whole window size was reduced by 5 pixils on the left and bottom. It doesn't sound like a lot but this is over 3000 pixils overall saved.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a screenshot:<br />

<br />
Overall the window should now support melees, casters, pet casters, healers and hybrids all equally well.  Please let me know how it works out for you.<br />
