Unless of course you were referring to ME as the 0 warrior when my name pops up in the UI title on the character select screen....in which case i resent that, but it is supposed to be like that!    <br />
<br />
If neither of those answer fit the problem, please post again with a little more details about the problem you are having.  I assure you that Sars 4 (Final) in no way, shape, or form turns all users into my assemolated band of level 0 warrior zerglings.....well at leaast not this version....muwahahahaha<br />

<br />
You log into you server and there is nothing but a level 0 guy spinning around named loading.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I don't remember how I fixed it.  Try doing a complete file check, and make sure that in your eqclient.ini the UISkin=default.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarsippius</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the target indicator you are missing is the new 3D Target ring, then first off make sure that your video card is a supported model.  Basicly, if you cant see the default 3d ring, you wont be able to see mine.   In order to check if you can see default, first make sure and use the /indicator on command to double check the 3d targeting is on.  There is a list of supported video cards in the SOE Corner forum threads.  <br />
<br />
If you are refering to the Target Window itself, then try first to toggle the window by using (ALT + T).  If this doesnt bring the target window up, then open your UI_Player file and find the section for [Target Window].   Make certain the x and y dimentions are &gt; 0 so that it would be visible.  There are detailed instructions on installation and frequent problems at my site http://sars.has.it as well as in the READ ME file included with the zip.  Also remember that in sars 4, you will not see the target window at all until you click on a target or you cast a spell.  <br />
<br />
Lastly i am in alpha stage for an auto installation/configuration/patching program that will be available for beta as soon as possible that should eliminate 99% of the problems people are having with out of date files or incorrect installation problems.  Look for more news  on this in my forums as i progress.  Hope this helps!<br />
