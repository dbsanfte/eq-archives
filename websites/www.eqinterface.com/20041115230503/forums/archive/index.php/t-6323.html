Then all you need to do is press Alt+N in-game to bring up the Storyline window and select Tinkering Recipies.<br />
<br />
The format of the recipes is:<br />
<br />
Animated Bait<br />
Trivial: 50<br />
Cost: 0.003<br />
Cork, Spriket<br />
<br />
I got most of the information for the recipies from the Clockwork Tinker's Union and EQTraders.  Be sure to visit their fine webpages!</div></div><hr />

This will help me a whole hella lot.  I'm always not knowing what triv is on stuff and what to combined hehe...short memory 8P  Now i Know..WOOHOO...I will tell fellow tinkers on my server about this.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. I haven't try it yet cause servers are down :(  but was wondering does it have the new PoP recipes in it?<br />
<br />
TY once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nostrilman</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went through Clockwork Tinker's Union, The Tinkering Companion and EQTraders to try and get all the recipes I could, I think everything is in there :)<br />
<br />
If you find anything missing, please post it and I'll put it in.<br />
<br />
Another note, the Storyline window seems pretty hobbled, just some very basic formatting or EQ locks up when you try to view a recipe page.  I've tried a couple methods to put links in, and either I don't have the format right, or it's just not possible in this window without changing something else.   I'm trying to make this as drop-in as possible, without requiring any true modifications or a separate ui directory.  Simple is good!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nostrilman</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just posted storyAlchemy and will probably do more when time permits.  Both of these are now under the Download\Misc\story... on the bar on the left side of the home page.<br />
<br />
As for creating your own, it's very easy.  Just open notepad and start typing.  The only thing you need to remember is to end each line with a &lt;br&gt;<br />
<br />
The color code is standard HTML, here's a real good site with example codes: http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutors/colors.html<br />
The code tag is &lt;c &quot;#yourhx&quot;&gt;colored text&lt;/c&gt;<br />
<br />
The first line in the text file becomes the Title in the Story Window, so you may want to leave it unformatted.</div></div><hr />
