Only thing is I now have a functioning cursor that came with mod AND one that was original one as a &quot;ghost&quot; in middle of my screen.<br />
<br />
Anyone out there with help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
P.S. I did do a search looking for help with this and didn't see anything exactly like it but may have just missed it.<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

Ok, well the alt-enter seems to eliminate it for duration of play time.  Good enuf for now.</div></div><hr />

I am currently experiencing the zone crashing problem so I don't know if it comes back when you zone, but it will come back every time you log in unless someone else knows a permanent fix for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">strag</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too have this problem, using a modified version of Kaori v3.  However, my alt + enter has never worked to get out of windowed mode, I just get a black screen.  No overly worried about that, but the ghost cursor is bugging me.  One thing I have noticed is since the patch of 1/28, EQ launch is changing my windows resolution before entering the game.  There used to be a bug with the ghost cursor appearing if your desktop and EQ reso were set to the same thing.<br />
<br />
I'm not experiencing the zone crash problem anymore, applied Cair's fix.  However if I try to change Reso in game, I get perma black screen and have to go to windowed mode to get out.<br />
<br />
Windows XP based.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated</div></div><hr />

<br />
On XP I get rid of it by<br />
<br />
- (on desktop) right click<br />
- disply properties<br />
- go to settings<br />
- choose advanced<br />
- choose Troubleshoot tab<br />
- take down hardware acceleration a notch<br />
<br />
Bit dumb that we'd have to bother, but seems to be happening a lot of folks on my server (AB)</div></div><hr />
