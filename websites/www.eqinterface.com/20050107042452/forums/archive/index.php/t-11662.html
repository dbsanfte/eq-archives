1. Stand up halfway through the movie and yell loudly, &quot;Wait... where the hell is Harry Potter?&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Block the entrance to the theater while screaming: &quot;YOU..... SHALL NOT..... PASS!&quot; - After the movie, say &quot;Lucas could have done it better.&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Play a drinking game where you have to take a sip every time someone says: &quot;The Ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
4. Point and laugh whenever someone dies.<br />
<br />
5. Ask everyone around you if they think Gandalf went to Hogwarts.<br />
<br />
6. Finish off every one of Elrond's lines with &quot;Mr. Anderson.&quot;<br />
<br />
7. When Aragorn is crowned king, stand up and at the top of your lungs sing, &quot;And I did it.... MY way...!&quot;<br />
<br />
8. Talk like Gollum all through the movie. At the end, bite off someone's finger and fall down the stairs.<br />
<br />
9. Dress up as old ladies and reenact &quot;The Battle of Helms Deep&quot; Monty Python style.<br />
<br />
10. When Denethor lights the fire, shout &quot;Barbecue!&quot;<br />
<br />
11. In TTT when the Ents decide to march to war, stand up and shout &quot;RUN FOREST, RUN!&quot;<br />
<br />
12. Every time someone kills an Orc, yell: &quot;That's what I'm Tolkien about!&quot; See how long it takes before you get kicked out of the theatre.<br />
<br />
13. During a wide shot of a battle, inquire, &quot;Where's Waldo?&quot;<br />
<br />
14. Talk loudly about how you heard that there is a single frame of a nude Elf hidden somewhere in the movie.<br />
<br />
15. Start an Orc sing-a-long.<br />
<br />
16. Come to the premiere dressed as Frankenfurter and wander around looking terribly confused.<br />
<br />
17. When they go in the paths of the dead, wait for tense moment and shout, &quot;I see dead people!&quot;<br />
<br />
18. Imitate what you think a conversation between Gollum, Dobby and Yoda would be like.<br />
<br />
19. Release a jar of daddy-long-legs into the theater during the Shelob scene.<br />
<br />
20. Wonder out loud if Aragorn is going to run for governor of California.<br />
<br />
21. When Shelob comes on, exclaim, &quot;Man! Charlotte's really let herself go!&quot;<br />
<br />
22. never shout out, Who's got a D20? <br />
<br />
23. everytime legolas grabs his bow, never shot &quot;TRUESHOT ON!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Gandalf is also a dirty hacker. Everyone knows the majority of most staves are 2hb. Besides, wizards can't wield 1hs weapons. Pfft.</div></div><hr />

The words are hidden so that it won't spoil the movie for anyone. Highlight the box with your mouse and you'll see them. :) Very funny! I loved the Mr. Anderson one because my annoying brother actually DID that when we were watching the movies on DVD! Fortunately he didn't do it in the actual movie theater though, or I really would have had to kill him! ~grins~</div></div><hr />

If I remember my MERP correctly, technically Gandalf would be a druid.  Druids can wield 1hs.</div></div><hr />

But then again I stopped reading at the second one just incase there was something that I would go &quot;I dont get it..&quot; only to have it ruin my movie experience. But I still love number two.. I haven't laughed so loud in a while.. Thanks for the gaffaw!</div></div><hr />

According to my Lords of Middle Earth Vol.1 (MERP RPG) book he is a Magician/Mage.<br />
