a few days later they did.. i dont remember changing anything, was just really surprised to see them. Then they went away (all thistime the button to use them was on in the options box )<br />
<br />
what do I need to do to get them to work?<br />
I tried putting a copy of the target ring files fromt he default ui into my custom ui and that did not work either. I read the post about the raidon cards.. I use Nvidia geforce3 ti200 (128mg), so I was hesitant to run the raideon fix app.<br />
<br />
any help?</div></div><hr />

 Here is how I understand it works. EQ looks for the files that activate the target ring only once when you first log into the game. So, if you copy those targetindicator files to your UI that you go into when you first go into the game they will work. If you copy them after you have logged in and reload your UI they will not work. If you only have them in your default directory they will only load if that is the first skin you log in with. It sounds as if you may have logged in with the right skin, then changed it or something. So try copying those files to the UI directory you use and it will prolly work. Good luck and hope this helped.<br />

<br />
1. TNL=TRUE<br />
2. Show3dTargetIndicator=0<br />
<br />
With these both in your .ini make sure you have both the:<br />
a. targetindicator.ini<br />
b. targetindicator.tga<br />
in whatever custom uif folder that you're using.<br />
<br />
Once you have the game up and running type /indicator off.<br />
<br />
Exit the game completely.<br />
<br />
Restart EQ.  Once you are in the game type /indicator on.<br />
<br />
These steps worked to get my rings working.</div></div><hr />

You can be in playing, change the file in your current UI folder, do a /indicator off, then a /indicator on and it should load the new ring.  I did find that the button on the option window would NOT reload the ring though...so you actually have to type the / commands, or make a hotbutton.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />
