The download area for the file I uploaded is now under Daggum's name...and the picture he posted looks just like my target only on an Even Con to show the skulls better...I do not mind if Daggum made an exact replica or even copied the file I uploaded, and said it as his own, If he uploaded his own file and it leaded to his own download area, that's fine,  but what I don't like is that the file I uploaded under my second post, leads to a download area not reckognizing my name.  Hope you understand what I am saying here...  Guess I'll just keep the things I work on to myself.</div></div><hr />

I am sorry that the links got crossed. It happens occassionally.<br />
<br />
There are nearly 150,000 people subscribed to these forums and it happens ever so often that links get crossed.<br />
<br />
I have checked and see no files uploaded to the download section by you. But it appears that Daggum has posted a skull mod in the download section since it was not there, sooo you can understand that 2 people both talking about the same mod could appear they are working on it togther. <br />
<br />
I have moved his link to his post, and re-linked yours back to your file.<br />
<br />
sorry for the inconvience.</div></div><hr />
