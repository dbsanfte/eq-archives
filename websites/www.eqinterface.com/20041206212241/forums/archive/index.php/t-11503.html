However I did make one change so it may work for you now.<br />
<br />
After having some problems with improper use of eqinterface images and bandwidth leaching, I decided to put code in place that would stop offsite linking, and direct linking, of eqinterface images.<br />
<br />
So if you're ON the website and you can't see the images, let me ask you the following:<br />
Are you behind a Firewall? Or a Proxy Server?<br />
<br />
There is code in place to stop hotlinking/ bandwidth leaching. This code does nothing more than look in the referrer header for eqinterface.com, eqgui.com, www.eqgui.com or www.eqinterface.com. If one of these are not present then the code believes you are linking directly to an image from off the site, which is not allowed.<br />
<br />
The reason I ask about a firewall or proxy is because they tend to block or edit the referrer header. So, even though you're on gucomics, it's not passing the correct referrer header information, and therefore, blocks the image.<br />
<br />
So, if you're behind a firewall or a proxy server, you will need to set eqinterface as an exception.</div></div><hr />
