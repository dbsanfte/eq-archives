<br />
I will be making more, BST is high on the list at the moment, and still trying to work on a Necro idea (I can't render the duck stick :))<br />
<br />
I am going to try and do one for each class, it'll just take time :)<br />

But I can't really post it here. :)<br />
<br />
You can find it at the bottom of this page:<br />

The other is one I did for fun because someone asked me what class she was.<br />

Hey, I'm a dark elf in another incarnation. What did you expect?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anatis</div><div class="date">03-26-2003, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it's possible, unless whichever UI you use is coded to use an inv_portrait.tga in the exact same dimensions as the one I uploaded.<br />
<br />
If I'm not mistaken the default UI doesn't use it. (But I'm not at home so I can't check.)<br />

Thanks for your portrait, I love it.<br />

Thanks, your other portraits are lovely!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TraleighRoV</div><div class="date">03-31-2003, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i love your portraits, but what i  &quot;Attempted&quot; to do was use a screen shot of my cleric, and the frame of your portraits and create my own for my tking based UI, i have photoshop pro, i used the same demensions in inches and pixels.<br />
<br />
it works in the TKing inv, BUT for some reason its skinny, it only takes up half of the portrait window and is kinda squashed to fit in that half ;(<br />
<br />
any ideas how i might fix that? Please<br />
<br />
and btw no offense to your work its awesome, i just wanted the pic to be my char ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anatis</div><div class="date">03-31-2003, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only thing I can think of... is maybe the width is too wide?<br />
Mine are about 180hx120w and in the same resolution as the tking frame.<br />
Also the frame needs to be bigger at the bottom and in tga format.<br />
Hmm.<br />
Yeah only thing I can think of is that your dimensions are wrong.<br />
Have a look at the original frame - including the transparent bit. <br />
You need that transparent bit at the bottom, maybe if you try to do it without, that's why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TraleighRoV</div><div class="date">03-31-2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what i had when i looked at the attributes of your picture was 128wX256h<br />
<br />
yes i had the transparent bit too and its a tga file . ok next question lol<br />
<br />
How do i check/change resolution sizes?<br />
<br />
btw tyvm for the assistance<br />
<br />
and it was squashed width wise if that helps ;p- the height was fine<br />
<br />
i'm boggled</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anatis</div><div class="date">03-31-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok (brain currently fried)<br />
Did you do the dimensions of the frame without the tranparent bit for the picture, but have the transparent bit at the bottom?<br />
Did you select the area of the image and CROP it to that size? Could be the height is higher than 256 and overlapping the top and the image is trying to squash it into the picture.<br />
<br />
Sorry tired. Me no can theenk :)<br />
<br />
You can check resolution in image size. Mine are 72dpi / inch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">03-31-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome work! these are great! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anatis</div><div class="date">04-01-2003, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Thomus!<br />
<br />
But I bow to the master :) Without your frames I couldn't have done them, and without the inspiration on your site - I wouldn't have thought of them. :)<br />

Any chance of getting them?</div></div><hr />
