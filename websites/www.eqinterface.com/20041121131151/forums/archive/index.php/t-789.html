Any suggestions?  No time to show code at the moment, getting ready to go back to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you make sure it's a good small size: 2-3 pixels in hight (Y).<br />
<br />
Did you also make sure that Player_Fatigue is *after* your Player_HP bar in the &lt;Pieces&gt; list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karsan</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me confirm the &lt;pieces&gt; chunk of it.  As to the other, yeah, it's small... I'm not home right now, though, so I can't tinker with it.  If the pieces list is positional, then that may do it?  I'm not sure though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure that you're taking into the account of the HP bar's Tag placement oddities when placing the STA bar.<br />
<br />
Place it at aprox 7,33. Have it about 2-3 pixels high and naturally 108 long.<br />
<br />
Shoot, for tests, have it 108x8, Just to make sure it's there.<br />
<br />
Once you can actually see it, then start playing with the cordinates and size.<br />
<br />
HP bar, by defauly is located at 3,33. Mana is around 3,41(ish)[might be a wee bit off on that one].</div></div><hr />

Well, I'm still at work...</div></div><hr />

<br />
HP_Pet window is hardcoded to the eqclient for show/non-show if you have or don't have a pet.<br />
<br />
I had only changed the EQType flags hoping to do a fast-swap.<br />
<br />
Went back and changed the guage names as well to switch those and voila ... worked beautifully.<br />
<br />
Now if you'll all excuse me, I've just put in a 33 hour day.<br />
<br />
I'm going to go to sleep.</div></div><hr />
