<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest weakness is the CastSpellWnd.XML.  I am going to be advertising it as &quot;working as intended&quot; though.  There are many very nice spell mem bars around, and it is a good chance to try them all out.<br />
<br />
This is with 1024 x 768 mode using a viewport to improve performance (Waiting on the Fx card to upgrade my hardware).<br />
<br />
It includes the Short Duration Buff bar as well as all 15 regular buff slots.  About the only thing I plan to change is to make the buff windows include a background as black just gets very old.  I will not release this until the Thursday patch so that I can make sure it works for the next month.  It isn't meant for eyecandy, but for functionality.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, is there anything that I might improve next time around?</div></div><hr />

I also have a larger viewable area in mine.<br />
