<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantomwalker</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well :) I've been mixing and matching lil pieces of UI's I've been downloading off EQinterface.com Only installed a few pieces and I don't believe any of them have overwritten any code... however I got 2 big problems that are quite annoying atm... and I'm not sure how to get rid of em ;0p First part is... I don't specify a custom Guild Window so It uses the default one from the default directory but when you open the guild window up the check box for show offline seems to do nothing and it also doesn't list any guildmates (including self) in there... also member count down in the corner doesn't list anything...<br />
<br />
The second problem is these three buttons are well gone from the button bar... Guild Map and Journal... they work as buttons... just don't show graphics for buttons ;0p /boggle.... Sorry if this doesn't make sence I'm still learning and for the most part really have no clue though I have tried messing with numbers and file names in attempt to get those buttons back...  In all failed and non failed attempts reverting back to unchanged :-\ so... I'm confused... the error log just has a bunch of &quot;could not find file blah using Default version&quot; lines in it... no real errors that I can see.. just confused though as to why the buttons don't show up... ohh and LFG button in group window is gone too but works like its there if you click the spot... *sigh*<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance that can be granted...<br />

Most likely you have a graphics file that doesn't contain the correct buttons, or a custom animations or templates file.</div></div><hr />

Any time you /load a custom interface you must zone for the guild window to populate with the correct information. The entire guild list is only sent when you zone. Only changes are sent while your in a zone. So you would see a guildmate if they just logged on after you loaded your interface but no one else that was already online.</div></div><hr />
