It seems to clear up once I zone. Thankfully it doesn't happen all the time. My wife and I have both sent in bug reports on this problem as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tephrox</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well... um, I guess the best thing to do is fix your mouse or something so you can =P Unless you're on a mac, or something... then... I dunno.<br />
<br />
But until then, you can do it a number of ways.<br />
<br />
If you open your options screen, you can set an overall transparency, so you can set the majority of your windows and stuff there.<br />
<br />
Then, for individual windows, look in your UI_Name_server.ini file. In there, scroll down until you get to your resolution's section, and find the window you want to modify, and change it there using a plain text editor or something.<br />
<br />
But, make a backup, as usual, because if you don't know what you're doing and change a lot of stuff, it might be hard to fix it.<br />
<br />
Hope you get the mouse fixed though, it'll make everything better =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right Click and spells suddenly stop working. Reloading the UI with /loadskin &lt;uiname&gt; 1 starts it all working again. Not sure what is happening but it seems to happen randomly. Really not helpful when my cleric heals suddenly wont cast :D<br />
<br />
Been happening on Soes 1.6 as well as Steamworks 1.3 so sorta confused.</div></div><hr />
