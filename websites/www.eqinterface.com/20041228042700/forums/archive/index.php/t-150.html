<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orocular</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone got any new or interesting ideas? I personally would love to know how to change my icons back to what they were BEFORE they had the new UI, EI, I want my fire spells to have the little red flame gem, the PB AoE to have the blue flame gem, my cold ST's to have the red snoflake, PB AoE's to have the purple Snowflake, orange snowflake for quadding, ya know. Also, I saw one mod that had the group bar horizontal, with percentages next to each group member, as well as streamlined... I feel that would work well for a wizard. My next mod would be to have the buff bar horizontal and streamlined. Now, chats would be very streamlined, and invetory would be with the hotkeys. I would have to play around with this stuff a lot to get it right, but eventually, I would use it as a PB AoE setup, and rock the house     :o)<br />

But, I am still looking around for some good mods, and I really want to change the color and texture of the background. That gray-black is BORING. :rolleyes: <br />

But the new GUI uses the files Spells01.tga, Spells02.tga... Spells05.tga.  All you have to do is a little cut and paste to put the old icons over the new ones in those five files.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a good image editor use Microsoft Paint to do the cut and paste.  Paint won't save in tga format and it won't do transparencies, but you don't need either of those things for spell icons.  Just remember that if you save them as bmp files, you need to go into EQUI_Animations and change all references to Spells01.tga to read Spells01.bmp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's working on spell gems, already has books for 12 out of the 14 classes, and is on a quest to make a complete UI.  Wonderful spellbooks for us who have to stare at them. =0)<br />

Good luck on everyone's work :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olurin</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a level 54 Erudite Wizard on the 7th, and I like using Quartz.  the new quartz1.6 is what I've got right now.  Threw in t.king's crimson spell book, t.king's spell gems, Rem's 2 row spell bar, athee's loc wizard, t.king's class animation, and the celtic inventory.  I like the set up a lot.  I'm going to try to get a horizontal buff bar to work and then start looking into putting maps in my UI.  I use the same setup with my bard too (except for the class animation).  I love the 2 row spell bar as opposed to the single column/row ones when using my bard cuz it makes twisting songs so much easier.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canorne</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:D  This is basically setup near the same fasion that I use in most of my UIs. I added a bluish background with red text coloring to give the lava/frost look.<br />
