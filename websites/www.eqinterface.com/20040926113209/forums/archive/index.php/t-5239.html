<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">01-05-2003, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The actual border graphics are in windowpieces1.  Each border is made up of 12 pieces of frame that get arranged to make the border. Frames are declared in the Animations file, and WDT's (window draw templates) are in the templates.xml. Check out AboutSIDL.doc in your everquest/uifiles/default folder for more on the WDTs.<br />
<br />
Vert mods are a prime expamle of altered window borders, I'd suggest opening up the Windowpieces1 from a vert mod folder and the default windowpieces1 file and  laying them side by side  to get a feel for what is involved in border alterations.<br />
 <br />
Hope this helps<br />

Now that I know where they define the WDT elements I can start putting together a library of boarders. (The 5 Boarders defined By SoE while functional are not what I'd exactly call pretty).<br />
Almost wish there was a developer's or rather experts downloads section on EQInterface where we could upload just skins and the code needed to run it without needing to download completed windows. An elements section if you will :D</div></div><hr />
