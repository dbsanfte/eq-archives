<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Logancreed</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had three goals when I made this UI:<br />
<br />
1.) Put everything button or clickable think in a single area of the screen. I hate roaming all over the place with the cursor, trying to target the right thing, especially during lag.<br />
<br />
2.) Put has much info on the screen as possible. I'm an information junkie. I look at my stats a ton, to check buffs and decide on loot, so I wanted it up all the time. Not only that, but I have two group windows.... One just for targeting and one for the hp of group mates. I took this idea from Romelo. <br />
<br />
3.) Do both of the above, while keeping most of the action visible. I like to see everything going on. I need see corpses, mobs, adds, etc so that I know how to act. I made a ton of stuff transparent, so I think I accomplished this, even though there is a ton of stuff on the screen.<br />
 <br />
I've been working on this for a couple of weeks....  I think it's the perfect UI for me, let me know what you think. <br />
