Instructions for loading skins/mods in game:<br />
<br />
1. Go to the uifiles directory in your Everquest folder, Right-Click on the DEFAULT folder there, and select &quot;Copy&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Then Right-Click in the same folder as default (beside it) and select &quot;Paste&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Re-name &quot;Copy of  Default&quot; a new name, keeping it short <br />
<br />
4. Download the file you want and un-zip them.<br />
<br />
5. Drag all the items in your un-zipped file folder into your new folder, (you just named a short name)  it will ask you &quot;do you want to copy over....&quot; select &quot;YES TO ALL&quot;.<br />
<br />
6. Log into Everquest<br />
<br />
6. use /loadskin &lt;folder name&gt; (this is why you keep it short)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Portlis</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.... ive tried everything that you posted, word for word exactly.  It doesnt work.  Ive tried logging in and out, doesnt work.  How am I supposed to get this new skin to work?  Anyone help please :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, you  no longer have to copy the default, rename, paste over with the new mods.  That takes up a lot of extra space and is no longer necessary.  If EQ doesn't find the file it needs in your new one, it will look in the default.  So you only need the new files in your new folder.<br />
<br />
As for the error you're getting, right after it crashes, look in your Everquest folder for a file called UIErrors.txt ... that has information on why it couldn't load.  Depending on the skin/mod you downloaded, it may not be compatable with the recent patch... I'm not sure if all the authors made their mods be compatable.  I could be wrong on that.  But first, find out what the UIError is so we can have a better idea of what to tell you to do.  :)<br />
