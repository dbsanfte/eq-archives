<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritseeker</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if it's possible for containers to be made more..compact. As they are atm, you open a container, and it has the full/empty slots, above which is a picture of the container, and above that is the name of the container. This is just wasted space - is it possible to remove the picture and name?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arantius</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried, and failed.  Containers seems to be one of the many annoyingly hard-coded things.<br />
<br />
The client decides how big to make the container, based on how many slots it is and if it has a combine button.  Can't do anything about that from what I have seen.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I have seen containers that added things like your primary slots in.  Have not had a chance to inspect these mods yet, but I suspect they have simply taken advantage of the otherwise wasted space that we can't get rid of up top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bled Lifeblood</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is probably due to the fact that you containers can all be different, such as combine containers and such.  some of that info has to come from verant so it probably messes it all up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tagarog</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I removed the container name and the picture of the container. I also moved the slots to the top and hid the done button. It would not let me save the file as a .XML so I renamed it to .TXT. Just rename the file back to a .XML</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arantius</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Tagarog :)  It is a step forward but not quite for us picky types hehe.  I still have un-even borders, the space on the left and right of the slots, above the slots and below the buttons.  The combine and done (i like the done button hehe) buttons are still not centered, they're off to the left a bit.  After I turn off the title bar it creates more dead space below the done button.  No matter how I change the co-ordinates in the xml, it doesn't seem to help much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tagarog</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was just a quick one, I will look into more. Remove the title bar, re- add the done button, and center everything.</div></div><hr />
