<br />
The hardest thing about making new spell icons is that as soon as you change it for one class, the icon is no longer correct for another class that uses same icon for that spell, and you say thats fine I play a necro and I made all my icons for a necro, but then you are not thinking, what happens when a cleric casts a buff on you, you know have Aego on you with a FD icon or something stupid, dont quote me and say but that spell uses this icon etc etc, I am just using those as an example.<br />
<br />
So please give us the ability to set what icon we want for each spell, that will make life so much better for those that want new icons.<br />

<br />
Or redefine all spells to have their own icon placement so that we can mod em up anyway we want.<br />
<br />
ini would certainly cut down on need for more tga files tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to see each spell with its own icon. It's so annoying to have a row of like six identical buffs; this is why people need spell name labels.<br />
<br />
(besides, I'm greedy, I want to see more t.king art)</div></div><hr />

So please Sony give us some options to modify every spell to a different icon and every gem to a different texture.  I mentioned this before (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=28806#post28806)  when I was working on modifying spell icons till I became too fed up with not being able to get all the icons to be how I wanted them to be because of the limitations that Sony has established.  <br />
One more thing I would also like for the Auto Equip to be universal so you can customize where you want it to be, why hardcode it to the inventory?  <br />
Thanks and I hope Sony reads these boards :)</div></div><hr />
