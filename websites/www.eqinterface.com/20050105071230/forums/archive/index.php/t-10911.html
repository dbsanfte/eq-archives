<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rykahna</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am making my first ever attempt to tweak xml code to modify some of the modifications I have downloaded recently to make them &quot;just right&quot; for my needs (original file is ArmeBigBank.zip.)  One of these is a BigBank window that did not have a shared platinum slot.  After tweaking the existing bank code for size adjustments, etc, I opened a different BigBank xml file, found the relevent code for the shared platinum slot, pasted it into the code I was working on, made the necessary adjustments for positioning and size, and added the block of code to the &lt;Pieces&gt; listing at the bottom of the file.  I have been over my tweaked file and other files that also include shared plat slots to figure out why mine isnt showing up, but I cant see what I am missing.  Perhaps someone would care to give me a pointer?<br />

Doh!<br />

Thanks anyway!<br />
