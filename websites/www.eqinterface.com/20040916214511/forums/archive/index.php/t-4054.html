<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladred</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've made a couple of changes to your UI Kellbringer, but I have a few questions. Hopefully someone can help...<br />
<br />
The target window has the large health, and mana bar going across it. What I was trying to do was take out the group meters, and make the target, mana percentages and just make it hp/mana/caster bar thingy stretching across the screen at 1600 resolution.<br />
<br />
I can upon several problems in trying to get this accomplished. Having no experience at all and just tinkering, I couldn't get it to stretch the entire way without making the target.tga 5000 width. I even tried to edit the target.tga in ps, just made it worse.<br />
<br />
If you, or anyone else has a second to tinker with this, I just want a 1600 width hp bar, a casting time line underneath, and a mana bar underneath that. Above the three bars will be a graphic Target_Name with the target names health % next to it. I'll try to do a mock up in PS in hopes to better relay my point.<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
Then I tried to remake the party window too, to include the group members stuff after removing it from the target window, and couldn't insert in there without getting errors. So in essence I just want to isolate the target window again back to just being target, and move the group bars, still horizontal cause it fits perfect, into the group invite/disband window. (the invite/disband buttons fit perfectly in the bottom right half of the target window letting you reduce size even more on the player window)<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
