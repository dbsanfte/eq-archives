<br />
<br />
These 3 .xml are the ones from Geddines 4xTarget and it's using the ones from the defaul directory... There's also a .tga named target that it's not looking (Cause it's using the default animation file) <br />
<br />
Thats the problem..<br />
<br />
Edit: I did a mod to geddines target window that takes away the requirement of the EQUI_Animations but it doesn't seem to be working properly at the moment... I will have to look at it. But don't have time tonight..<br />
<br />
Edit2: The problem WASN'T with my mod to geddines.. it was a 629 error (Whatever that is) and I just got it again with the default UI.. <br />
<br />
I reset my computer and tried my mod again and it's working now.. So here's the link:<br />
