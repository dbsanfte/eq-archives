<br />
No,  This thread is to discuss the pictures. ;)<br />
<br />
Also no need for Dual CPU's with EQ2. Its not multithreaded like most games. Now I wouldnt mind a setup like that for my web server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's not multithreaded?... knowning that would have been good.. not I have to revamp the board and proc :-(<br />
<br />
you can have the who thing for 9K as long as I get to keep the case<br />
<br />
how do you know EQ2 isn't multithreaded?  I didn't see that anywhere</div></div><hr />

Yes, <br />
<br />
Specially if you keep trying to derail my thread. :p</div></div><hr />

The thighs and various other regions are... um... looking pretty good. Go back and look at the pic again... you probably didn't see the hands considering how much the eye is drawn to other areas of the picture.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm really interested to see things like how much lag EQ2 will cause on computers that lagged with regular EQ, and what the new system specs and reqs will be. The new models remind me of some compositions I've seen using programs like Poser - certainly not perfect, but not in the same category as the Luclin models of EQ either :p<br />
<br />
Oh and this guy (http://everquest2.station.sony.com/screenshots/Befallen_Ghoul.jpg) is effing scary.</div></div><hr />

The luclin models looked incredible like that too when the first pictures were posted, but in the actual game they weren't as great as they were made out to be original.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Luclin models never looked like this in the pictures. The luclin models look the same as they are today in the game.<br />
<br />
They have shown the game in real life at E3 and it looks better then the pictures. They will most likely show it off in a couple weeks at the chicago FanFair.<br />
<br />
Also this game requires you to have a gfx card with pixel shaders. That is how they are able to do these awesome graphics. Check out HalfLife 2 demo video... that will show you what pixel shaders can do on an up to date computer system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antics</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks really great and everything, but I just wonder if it will be able to stand up and really shadow what EverQuest has already become.  It will take a lot of effort for them to make it so good that everyone ditches EQ and heads for EQ2.  If they make big promises and don't keep them, then it will be another Sims Online type scenario, sadly to say.  I have high hopes, however, that it will be the genre altering game that it is promising to be :) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In regards to my thinking I have to wait a year; I have never trusted game companies giving approximate dates.<br />
<br />
I was raised on Nintendoand suffered the heart break of delays getting announced the morning or release far too many times.<br />
<br />
As a result of this constant dissapointment i never worry about release dates I just buy it when I see and save myself the heartbreak.<br />
<br />
<br />
I remeber waiting for Secret of Mana for SuperNES was delayed with no word...I am sure I caused teh game store clerk a breakdown by going in every lunch break and after school to check on it.<br />
In the end he wanted the game to come in more then me...just so I would not bug him for it. :D <br />
<br />
So yes i am cynical about release days...but I am freaking excited about getting it....then trying to log in for the first time(anyone remeber SWG?).</div></div><hr />
