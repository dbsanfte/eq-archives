lets see if i put my health bar in the right place:<br />
<br />
-double click on the eq icon<br />
-wait for the patch server to finish<br />
-click accept<br />
-click connect<br />
-enter password<br />
-hit enter<br />
-pick server<br />
-wait....................<br />
-......................<br />
-pick character<br />
-wait............<br />
<br />
nope. <br />
<br />
-tweak x,y coordinates<br />
-hit save<br />
-repeat<br />
<br />
there must be an easier way!! can anyone make some kind of preview program, an xml compiler or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
my modding session:<br />
<br />
start eq<br />
start textpad<br />
change xml<br />
/loadskin<br />
change xml<br />
/loadskin<br />
change cml<br />
/loadskin<br />
...<br />
<br />
PS: Sorry in advance to the admins, not sure if this is allowed here.  If this gets deleted I wont post it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">psychogears</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well what I do is I load a screenshot with the game w/o the windows (hit F10, that's what I'm talking about), then I just start drawing what I want to see on the window. If I have a very clear image of what I want, I make a new picture and start drawing out what I want to see, like a new gauge or something. Then I take that picture, cut and paste on the screenshot and see where I want to place it. I take note of the XY coordinates of the picture, the size of the picture, the XY coordinates of where I want the gauge to be, the size of the gauge, then I put those coordinates in the EQUI_Animations.xml, do a little math, put the gauge where I want it to be on screen, voila. I think the number of tweaks that have to be done at the most was like 3 or so for me, mostly due to spotting logical errors in the XML file.<br />

Good luck<br />

<br />
Allows you to run EQ in a window. Hence you can jump back and forth from your notepad save it and then reload skin in EQ<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a thought</div></div><hr />

<br />
WixenDaBomb, do you even bother to read the thread before you reply?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aepod</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be great to write an editor for this. Something that could show what the elements look like, not just the code. I have been using xmlpad to edit them in conjunction with ultraedit... but thats far from good enough.<br />
I think something like this would not be to teribly hard to write, perhaps in php or something so it can be a web app... One potential problem i see is the tga's a lot of web viers dont view them... You can only do so much with just the xml...<br />
Another concern is that it would be a waste of time right now, I suppose prototyping and getting some of the basic stuff would not be, but I am guessing their may be a revision or two yet on the new gui....<br />
<br />
just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />
