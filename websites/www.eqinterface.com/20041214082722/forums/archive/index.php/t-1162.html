I found a target window that has the targets health and the  casting bar in it. What I would like to do is increase the size of this window by about 3 or 4 times. I do not have any xml experience. I did open the target window in note pad and was looking at the size numbers. I played around with it a little bit. Just couldn't get what I was looking for.<br />
<br />
One other addition, if possible, that I believe would be good for casters is to also have the mana bar with a % in it as well. So it would like like targets health %, followed by the casting bar, and then lastly the mana bar %. The casting bar would kind of race the targets health bar %.<br />

The spell gems in Verts mod are nice and compact. Space at a premium I am sure it has it's fan base. I know I have seen a few mods that have the spell name listed to the side. I think this would be nice as well. I would add one more thing to this window. I saw this on another mod just not one that was numbered or had the names of the spells beside it. If the ammo slot could be next to the spell book so that horse bridals could be right there in the same window. <br />
<br />
I have been bouncing back and fourth looking for a group window from Vert's mod that has the F2-F6 keys. I just haven't had any luck. <br />
<br />
Last thing would be to some how get the attributes on the front page.<br />
