<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jyrleen</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I would like to have is the following . . . if you have any idea if it's already out there, or how to make it, any info would be appreciated. :)<br />
<br />
Player Window<br />
<br />
*Remove name, insert CurrentHP/TotalHP (no description, just 604/1047)<br />
*PlayerHP, HP Percentage<br />
*PlayerMana, Mana Percentage<br />
*Stamina<br />
*Exp, Percentage<br />
*AA Exp, Percentage<br />
*Small Auto Equip area (for foraging, pick-up, quest, etc.)<br />
*Wt./STR<br />
<br />
<br />
Group Window<br />
Member# name/HP Bar/Percentage (name above HP bar, % to the right of HP bar)<br />
<br />
Inventory<br />
<br />
*Squish the equipment slots together in the style of old UI<br />
*Move Animation to bottom left, and make it the auto equip area (is this even possible?  To combine the two like this?)<br />
*Replace resistance lists with acronyms (FR instead of &quot;Fire Resist,&quot; MR instead of &quot;Magic Resist&quot; etc.)<br />
*Remove Exp. bar (since it's already showing on Player Window)<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell Icon Window<br />
<br />
*Use Compact Spell window (where they zig-zag down, making it wider and shorter)<br />
*Add time-remaining-for-spell-to-cast bar at the bottom.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the above two do not combine, maybe put spells on two rows, 1-4, then 5-8 under that, then dump the open spell book icon and add the cating time bar underneath the two rows?<br />
<br />
Remove all titles from windows -- they just take up space.  (Is there an easy way for me to do this on my own?  Not quite sure what code I'm looking for.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, any help or directions would be appreciated. :)<br />
<br />

<br />
For the player and group window, look in the &quot;pasi&quot; directory in the URL in my sig.  Look I would say at versoin 1.6, they should match closely.  But you won't get an auto equip button, that's hard coded to work only in the inventory window.  Inventory window from that skin should also be close to what you have asked for.<br />
<br />
Spell gems, I have seen that on www.eqinterface.com , the jagged arrangement at least.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I didn't mean &quot;I WANT THIS AND I WANT IT NOW!&quot;  I was merely hopeful. ;)  Anyway, thanks a lot for the info!  It sucks that auto equip area is hard coded, because it would be great to have it somewhere else . . . but we take what we can.<br />
<br />
I'd really love to get into the whole XML thing myself, but lack of time (okay, I admit it, I'm too busy playing) kind of restricts my learning process.<br />
<br />
Thanks again! :)</div></div><hr />
