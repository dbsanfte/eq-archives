This is sort of a dull existence,  does anyone else do this. Or am I the only person this pitiful.<br />
<br />
Well I guess I could always do some work or something, nevermind the boredom is getting to me.<br />

It is good to hear that I am not the only one that just hunts these boards during the day. You are not alone.... =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trick is to find enough boards... so that there will most of the time be a new post on one of them by the time you get back to it. I visit 5 different message boards right now... which isn't enough. :)<br />
Maybe if I could just figure out a way to get my boss to pay for reading and posting... I could add more message boards to my list.<br />
Yeah... I do that too. Whenever I can... hehe</div></div><hr />

So when I have finished the posts, I move onto another board and post there. Once I have completed the cycle of all boards I start all over again to see if anyone has posted new. So no... Your not alone.</div></div><hr />

I'd greatly appreciate any other good boards. All the ones I go to are pretty bad except this one, You should really see the haunted house board Iv'e been going to. http://www.hauntednetwork.com/phpBB2/index.php a friend at work got me going here. But yes I do prefer eq sites.<br />

But as for sites I visit that are EQ boards, are unfortunately most of them are EZBoards. But I do visit TNZ (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=The+Newbie+Zone&amp;number=4&amp;DaysPrune=20&amp;LastLogin=) for regular posts.<br />
<br />
But otherwise the rest of the sites I visit are of the paranormal variety.<br />
