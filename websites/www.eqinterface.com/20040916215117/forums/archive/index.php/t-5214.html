<br />
good job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">catharz</div><div class="date">01-05-2003, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like this UI, seems to work well at 1024x768 (the highest res my benq LCD monitor supports).  I do have some suggestions though.<br />
<br />
I can't seem to view any equipment stats or any spell information (anything I hit right-click to view stuff on).  Any ideas on fixing this?<br />
<br />
I'd also like to see the MP3 player reversed (so I could put it at the bottom of the screen) and the spell text (when you hit ALT) vertically (or the spell bar vertically) so the text doesn't over-lap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the heads up on the item window in 1024, It seems the .ini file only remembers one value for that window position, whereas it will remember positions for multiple rezes on most windows, so it was using the value from the 1280 mod, displaying the window almost completely off the bottom of the screen. The very top border does appear along the very bottom of the screen, near the left corner, but it will blend in with the borders of any window open in that area, so shrink your chat window, right click an item, and watch the bottom of your screen for the border to appear, then slide your mouse off the item icon (still holding your right mouse button) and you've got a locked open item descrp window to drag to somwhere visible. Alternativley, you can load the new character.ini file I'm attaching.<br />
<br />
Flipping the MMD skin sounds like something I might could do, I'll look into it. might be a good exercise to get me primed for trying an original mp3 player, give me a couple days to get time to work on it.<br />
<br />
The alt key popup text is HardCoded, AFAIK. If someone figures out where the code is to change these pop up descriptons, I'll be looking into modding it myself.  I could try shrinking the gems and offsetting them like this:<br />
<br />
&lt;&gt;    &lt;&gt;    &lt;&gt;    &lt;&gt;<br />
--&lt;&gt;    &lt;&gt;    &lt;&gt;    &lt;&gt;<br />
<br />
which would keep the text from overlapping. Just say so if you want it, but those gems take up a lot of real estate already, which is why I didn't do it originaly.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the feedback, glad you like it:D <br />

It's about 75% of the original size. You will need the new .tga file found in the .zip as well as the .xml.<br />
<br />
Enjoy:cool: <br />
<br />
Catharz - I was thinking about the mp3 player, and remember reading somewhere on this board that someone else was trying a bottom of the screen one. The problem they were having was that the playlist dropdown menu can only drop down which would put it off the bottom of the screen. Perhaps I will attempt to shrink it, instead...<br />

<br />
The only thing I notice is I get a nasty lag when trying to get the Mp3 player to look in the directories.  Is that on the MP3 window or would that just be a long seek time on my hard disk?  <br />

Thanks for the awsome work on it once again.</div></div><hr />

The vertical mod is way too small and I could not get the icons resized properly.<br />
<br />
I tried Moofo and Drakah spell gems, but the icons are all blacked out unless I crank down the opacity.<br />
<br />
I'll keep playing with it to see if I can get some big spell gems, but that is the only issue that I have had so far.<br />
<br />
Great mod.</div></div><hr />

It seemed really bad the first couple of times I tried loading stuff from my harddrive, but it got better after I used it.<br />
<br />
Torelorm - 1792x1344? what are you playing on, a 32&quot;plasma screen? :p I could make the gem holders bigger, but I'm not sure about resizing the actual icons, I'll probably need to fiddle with the Animations file, which may take a while. Someone must have tried this already. /em reaches for the 'search' button. <br />

Glad you all are liking it so far<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried it for the first time with my caster yesterday and I like the spell book.  But their is only 1 thing I had trouble finding was the place to click to go to next and previous spell book pages.  Once I found the place I kept on having problems finding it again to turn the pages.  Is their away to make the buttons to show for the page turning?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've finished a couple things that were asked for. The spellbook with visible page buttons, I mainly use arrow keys to flip pages, so I was keeping it minimalist, but for those of you who need it, it's in the attached .zip. <br />
<br />
Also in the .zip is a scaled down MMD player. It's about 10% smaller, to make it fit in the 1024 768 setup, but squishing it makes the button text a bit hard to read, the time and track display are still quite legible, though.  It uses the same 2 graphic files (bg_winamp.png and winampbutton.png) which aren't in the .zip if you are using it outside of the full mod.<br />
<br />
Still trying to hammer out large icons for the spellbar, but with the patch tonight/tomorrow, I may need to move it to the back burner for a bit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torelorm</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can just toss me a hint on what I need to change then I may be able to work out the spell bar.  Seems whatever I try does not do what I expect.  Most of the time it just moves the icon around, and I think that is partly due to the layer that is in there.<br />
<br />
In any case, I will hang out or keep playing with it.  Just can't figure out how to get other spell gems to work without the graphics blacking out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thanks to Odaku's post (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2937&amp;highlight=gem+icon) I got it figured out. Here's the bigicons zip. The icons are kind of grainy at 1600, due to the resize. Because of some hardcoding limitations, I was only able to double the size, where I would have liked to have them a bit smaller than double. This is the horizontal version as default, with vertical format also in the zip, just need to rename it.<br />
<br />
OK, the enlarged gem .tgas are too big to attach. If you have graphic editing capabilities, open up the 2 default gemicon.tgas and resize them to 512 512, then save them. If you don't have a .tga editor, try using the tgas from Odaku's page with these .xmls <br />
<br />
Hope this works for you :)<br />

<br />
i have the folder in the &quot;uifiles&quot; directory, and renamed and copied the .ini file into the everquest directory. <br />
<br />
i really like how this ui looks, any ideas on what could be the problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">borrumthedwarf you may want to make a screenshot of how the UI looks after you did the /loadskin lunarwrap 1 command.  That way we could have a better idea of what is going on with yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The name of the folder shouldn't matter. I'm guessing you double checked to make sure the UI didn't unzip itself to a folder within the custom one you created, since that's the most common error. Other than that, as long as all the .xml and .tga files are in the custom folder, and you're typing in the '/loadskin &lt;customname&gt; 1' command, it should work. Try checking your UIErrors file in the main Everquest directory to see if it is finding the main windows or grabbing them from default. (playerwindow, targetwindow, ect.) If that doesn't work, try it in a new custom folder.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps, post your errors here if none of this helps.<br />
<br />
Yes, a screenie would help, too. :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I think is happening:  Since the vertical spellcastbar.xml file has an older date than the updated horizontal one, it isn't actually overwriting the file, but instead, is choosing to keep the 'newer' file which is the horizontal default. Try deleting the EQUI_SpellCastWindow.xml file form your folder first, and then unzipping the vertical one.<br />

SanchalitoDB, I had the exact same problem and this is what I found to be the the problem. I had installed the EQ Tradeskill Companion into my mod. Have no idea why it was causing me to crash to desktop but after removing the files for it my mod worked perfectly and I was able to log in and play :)<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SanchalitoDB</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So now I am looking thru the folders and the ini file.  I only have the zip file installed, does it include the tradeskill companion?  I am not finding it.  Am I looking in the wrong place?  I appreciate all the assistance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The tradeskill companion is not included in the .zip. I believe Koradin had downloaded it seperatly and somehow mixed it into the folder with Lunawrap, and that was causing problems. If you havent' downloaded the companion from somewhere else, it's probably not causing you any problems.<br />
<br />
Here's a couple of things to try:<br />
<br />
Check the customcharacter.ini you renamed and look for <br />
<br />
[Main]<br />
UISkin=xxxxx  - and change xxxxx to 'default' (unless it's already set to default)<br />
<br />
Then look in the EQClient.ini and make sure that:<br />
<br />
NewUI=TRUE<br />
<br />
Can you get EQ loaded on a different toon with the default UI?<br />
<br />
I have had problems with EQ doing the same thing after adjusting the resolution on my window desktop, not sure why, but after I reset my desktop resolution back to it's original, I could log into EQ fine. Not exactly sure what was causing this, but figured it might help you out.<br />
<br />
Let me know how things go, I hate leaving people to trial and error (espicially after they have already been doing so much of it ;) ) but I'm kinda at a loss here....<br />

(The answer I am looking for is Yes.)<br />

Just remembered something... Used this with my BST last night and the pet health does not fill the pet health bar. That is to say, the red bar for pet health appears to only fill about 80% of the pet health bar. The percentage is correct, and the pet  health in the player window is correct, just not in the pet window. Minor problem all in all.</div></div><hr />

To those who are interested, I've attached a fix for the appropirate files to work with LOY. It also includes new windowpieces with new button graphics, plus I cleaned up border/title graphics and added a  brand new compass. The selector window now has all the buttons showing on an additional row under the original, the Group window has the lfg button, and the Inventory has the tint and face buttons added, as well as the charm slot, which is also added to the target inventory window. The animations file here is up to date as well.<br />

I unzipped your patch and then did the login and loadskin thing. Got the nasty red error message that my xml files blah blah blah. Only had a few minutes and was really just looking for obvious problems.<br />
<br />
Well here is the UIErrors.txt (attached, I hope)<br />
<br />
 I think the problem is: Error: Could not find child PlayerCount in window GuildManagementWnd<br />
All the others appear to be the standard errors from a custom UI.<br />
