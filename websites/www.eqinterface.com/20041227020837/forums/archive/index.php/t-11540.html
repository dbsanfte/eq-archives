<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">duncan_watson</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am newbie.  I am currently using the Tablet UI for my necro.  Great UI as I like to keep stuff from blocking my view of the action.  Also all the panes go transparent if a mouse doesn't stay above them.  Great for the panes that pop up ofer the viewport.<br />
<br />
One thing I don't love is that I don't get to see the buffs on my pet.  I have to use /pet health to see them.  Currently this is not a problem but I am only lvl 11 and have been mostly soloing.  A couple of pickup groups, etc.<br />
<br />
So my question is: what are your suggestions for a clean interface that is good for casters and pets.  One designed around limiting the viewport so that I don't have windows in front of bodies, or the action.  Viewing pet buffs is good, also a map pane that has a grid, to associate with loc.  The transparency effect is also good.<br />
<br />
Any idea?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

I'm a Sars lover for melees, but the pet window is just too small with his.  I have to use default for now, and like the original poster, I like seeing the pet's buffs displayed.  That's not a requirement for me, though.  Just a good pet window and nice tight stacking of the windows for maximum use of space (unlike the space-wasting default).<br />
<br />
EDIT: Hmm, lunix looks nice, going to give that a whirl.</div></div><hr />

My main is a necro, so I like to keep the screen clean and be able to see everything.  Also, my spell casting bar/keyboard setup makes for very good twitchy gameplay...a must for a good soloing necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sundanzkid2001</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found that I like the Delta familyof UI's. I 've been using them for all my classes tag lines with labels for spell gems and buffs  make it easy to tell what your hitting and it stacks well around thescreen. I use it for all my charactors and dont like when i got to use the default  on my one machine.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolvas</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play casters, or hybrids. I don't have any pure melee. So I use Infinity2 for all my toons. Everything is movable and sizeable, to suit most peeps. It's very clean and most windows are tansparent to one  level or another. <br />
<br />
There are alot of options in any UI you choose, I think it boils down to personal taste. What may work great for me, may not work for you. <br />
<br />
Just nose around the site, you can preview the different UI's. And find one that works for you. There are alot of talented artists and programmers here. So just find something that looks good to you and give it a try.  :D <br />

I just checked that UI and I have to tell you, it's clean.  I like the full view and un-cluttered screen.  Nicely done there Taleisin!<br />
<br />
I've been away from the game for about a year now and when I get back, I am going to learn about these here 'new' UI's and start using the Linux one you've posted.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I also love mine for being clean, and no-so-cramped.  I tried to fix my own UI, but it just doesn't work out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aramil Dannodel</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, another suggestion I could offer would have to be Drakah's World of Warcraft UI-emulating mod.  Personally, I don't use it for my pet classes (I've become too attached to the UI I use, I suppose), but it is very clean and efficient (as WoW's UI is), and though the pet window doesn't stand out like a big black dot over a white background from a burned out pixel in your monitor, it is noticeable enough, and relays all the information you'll need readily at hand.<br />
<br />
To see what it looks like, click here (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/p_large.php?id=4978&amp;tnow=1103756545).<br />
To download it, click here (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3796).<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will help you out in your search.  Another option I could see would be to check the various &quot;evil&quot; themed UIs under the Complete UI section...there's a few rather striking ones, there.<br />
