<br />
I'm trying to mix and match my UI's.  I will tell you exactly what I have done and the results along with which UI's I've tried.  What I have done is gone into my UI folder and created a new folder called &quot;Madeled&quot; then I unzipped all the UI's that I wanted to use and copied the files to the new folder.  I then went into EQ and I clicked on the load skin option and selected Madeled instead of default.  The screen looked as if I was zoning and all the boxes disappeared.  When they came back they were all the same as the default.  All the spell icons were also the same as before the loading of the new UI.  I have also tried creating a new folder and copying all of the default folder and pasting it in the new folder then putting the unzipped UI's in there overwriting the defaults...or atleast what needed to be overwrited.  (I hope this is making sense..hehe)  Anyway, I will now post the UI error log and the list of all the UI's I tried to run.  I hope you guys can help!<br />

Thanks,<br />

The error log you have posted shows that it isn't finding any custom files whatsoever, which is what leads me to believe you may have the subfolder problem.  Another possiblity is that your custom folder name has a space in it.  It can't.  Make sure that it is all one word, no spaces.<br />
<br />
And, you had it right the first time.  You do not want to copy your default folder, that just leads to major headaches down the road.  The only files that should be in your custom folder are files that have actually been customized.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madaled</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I unzipped all the UI's.  As soon as each of them unzipped I put everything in those folders into my created folder in the UI folder.  I then went into EQ and clicked on options(the nut symbol on the selector bar).  I then clicked Load UI.  I clicked on &quot;Madeled&quot;(which is the name of the folder the unzipped files are in) and clicked load.  It loaded like I was zoning and then all the windows were unchanged along with the spell icons when they came back into view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You say you're using a UI folder called Madeled, but according to the error log you posted, you're using one called celtic.  Try going into EQ, and type &quot;/loadskin&quot;.  Tell us what entries you have in the list that pops up.  Select Madeled, and you should get the brief pause you've been mentioning as new ui loads up.  Then, if it seems to go back to the default ui, scroll back up in your chat windows, and look for some sort of error message...&quot;Error loading Madeled... using default instead&quot;... or something like that.  Then, post the error log you get immediately after logging out.  Also, make sure you only have one everquest directory.</div></div><hr />

are your actual errors.  What it means is that the custom EQUI_Animations.xml file isn't current.  You need to see if the author has released a patch for it.  If not, you can manually fix it yourself using the information in this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=53176#post53176) post in the Patch Fixes forum.</div></div><hr />

I am confused as to why you had a problem with the t.king/Remelio Celtic full install, though.  I've downloaded and set it up just fine.  Not sure what was going on there. :confused:</div></div><hr />
