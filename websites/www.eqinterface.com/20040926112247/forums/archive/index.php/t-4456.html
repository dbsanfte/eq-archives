<br />
I am creating a custom border for the compass, however whenever I add the correct graphics files to the left and right border lines in the border section of the template I am making the window goes blank. SidlWidl shows it just fine. The other portions of the border do not have any problems, just the left and right borders. I have determined that I can get the left and right portions of the border up to 20x24, but If I go to 21x24 the compass blanks out. Odd eh? Zip Attached.<br />
<br />
Failing that, is it possible to place the Compass Screen object inside a tab or as a subscreen in a parent window? Or the inverse can the Compass Overlays exist in a tab or a subscreen inside the main Compass window and maintain functionaility?<br />

<br />
I wanted a compass border that was actually larger than the compass itself, such as the ones pictured here:<br />

<br />
When I made the border initially, it looked all wrong.  The sides were stretched out really long, adding a black area inside the border under the compass.  I double checked and found no errors in my xml.  Through experimentation, I found that I could fix the window size by adding blank space around the border, widening the bottom border to the same thickness as the top.<br />
<br />
I think the border layout code has some bug with borders that are thicker than the window they surround ... or something.</div></div><hr />

Thanks so much for responding. Have you looked at my post (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4524&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1) in the pre-beta forum? I have a ton of information and some examples of things I have tried. Tonight I will try out your comments and see if I can get it to work. And yes, I definatly agree that the code for handling borders is bugged.<br />
