<br />
Ok. Enough with the flattery. Id like to invite you to put your skills to work towards another challenge.<br />
<br />
I am part of a 5-man crew creating our own MMORPG. While there are a lot of start-ups like this, we have a GREAT team of C++ coders, networking guys, modellers, storywriters...and so on. <br />
<br />
But of course, one of the best parts of a game is the user interface. Many of you obviously have a great command of this and we'd like you to become part of this development team!<br />
<br />
If this sounds exciting to you at all, please mail me back and we can discuss the game and the project in more detail.<br />
I really look forward to your contacting us and getting involved.<br />
<br />
Take care.<br />
<br />
Warm regards,<br />
