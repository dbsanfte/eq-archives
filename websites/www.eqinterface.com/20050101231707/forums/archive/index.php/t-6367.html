This spellbook (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=409)  and put it in my uifiles folder.  When I got into eq and tried to /loadskin friend true it is giving me an error.  Does anyone have any idea what I did wrong?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Is this the one you mean?  Sorry for being so clueless.  Thanks for trying to help, let me know and I'll get it up here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">adrianne</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thank you so much I realize that I was looking at the wrong txt files and found it.  <br />
<br />
<br />
This is it and it looks huge (http://www.digital-input.net/crap/UIErrors.txt) <br />
<br />
I downloaded many different things to put in the ui, when I put them all in it wouldn't load.  I deleted that folder and tried making a folder and unzipping the file of the spellbook into it, same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, that error log is completely normal and looks exactly the way it should.  The only things in it are the &quot;warning&quot; lines saying that it is doing exactly what it should be doing, which is loading from the default folder any files it can't find in your custom folder.<br />
<br />
You say at this point that there is *only* a custom spellbook in your custom folder?  Did you check to make sure that it isn't in a sub-folder?<br />
<br />
Start with the READ ME (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=44) subforum, specifically the three stickied threads at the top of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">adrianne</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's in the uifolder right next to the default folder.  I will read the link you put up.  Thanks for all of your help, I'll try that and whatever else I can this weekend.  Let you know how it turns out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">adrianne</div><div class="date">02-13-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I unzip it to the folder it is placing it in another folder, it changes screens like it's loaded, but spell book remains the same.  <br />
<br />
I copy the contents of the folder, put everything in my friend folder, and delete the folder it put in when I unzipped it and it gives me the error then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mjolinir</div><div class="date">02-13-2003, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is looking for the files in a folder named &quot;custom4&quot;. Make sure all your UI pieces are in a folder with that name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">adrianne</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally did away with the folders except for the one named friend and default.  That is when I did the what I said in the last post.  Can I clear out my txt file and try again and post what it says?  Will that mess up anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onetwo1212</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The uierrors.txt over writes every time a ui is loaded.  I think what everyone is getting puzzled about is the fact your uierror.txt says EQ is looking for a UI in folder custom4.  Try realoading your ui using the command /load friend 1<br />
<br />
If that does not work, post a new copy of your uierrors.txt here.</div></div><hr />
