<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drakanos</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if it is possible to make a window with slots for clickable items. I do not use the pet window so it would not hurt my feelings to alter that window. I do not have enough knowledge to go in my self and redo a window from scratch. So if anyone thinks they can do it...please lemme know...i am REALLY interested in this type of window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two problems with that.<br />
<br />
One: Can't make new windows unfortunatly. We're forced to hijack other windows to make any &quot;specialized&quot; windows.<br />
<br />
Two: You're looking at 18 possiable Slots for clicky items. 19 if you want to add a blank Gen INV space or not.<br />
That's a bit much to add to a new window.<br />
<br />
Do note, that there is a possiable clicky for any of the 21 slots in your equipment, and some even work in Gen INV.<br />
<br />
Bit much, don't you think? I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to make special ones. A slot here and there, but an over all won't work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pini Uldar</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It should be possible as long as the click items are either in an inventory slot (NOT in a container) or on an equipped slot on your character. <br />
<br />
You could use the pet window for this without a problem. The only problem I'd forsee is that it you would have to individualize it for yourself to choose the slots you have clicky things on. This shouldn't be too hard since you just change the EQType of the InvSlot I think.<br />

try that. Right click save target as..then save it in your custom ui window. If you want some of the items changed, example you want wrist slot instead of bp let me know i will make the changes and repost it for you.</div></div><hr />

Exactly Pini, I converted the pet window for mine, for pet classes changing the  friends window might be better. <br />
<br />
I made one for my use... when I want to change items I just change the EQ Type for the box.<br />
<br />
Do NOT use the pet window. I use the clickables window to drag inventory items to my hotkeys sometimes. When I use dhte pet window and left clicked and held, BOOM crash to desktop.<br />
<br />
I worked around it.<br />
<br />
If you want to check out my UI here is a screenshot:<br />
<br />
http://mail.chartermi.net/~aruman/fullscreen2.jpg <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Copy the default folder that is in uifiles, make the copy in the uifiles directory. Rename it to whatever you wish.<br />
<br />
2. Unzip this file Aruman's UI (http://mail.chartermi.net/~aruman/arumanui2.zip) into that folder, allowing over writing of existing files.<br />
<br />
3. Start Everquest. When you get into the game type /loadskin {foldername}, where {foldername} is the name of the folder you extracted the files from my zip file to.<br />
<br />
You will see the clickables window. It is clearly labelled.<br />
<br />
If you want to make any mods and don;t know how email me at aruman@chartermi.net, I will try to help.</div></div><hr />

then to move my mouse and click an item.  Maybe you all are more comfortable with your mouse then I  am, but I try to use it as little as possible. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but you miss the point of having the clickables window.<br />
<br />
How often have you been able to put something on the hotkey without opening your inventory window?<br />
<br />
Some of the things I have that are right clicks:<br />
<br />
1. Shaman Epic<br />
2. Spiritcallers BP<br />
3. Spiritcallers Greaves<br />
4. 8th Ring<br />
5. Black Fur Boots<br />
6. JBB<br />
7. Black Chain Bridle<br />
<br />
Using some of these is situational and putting all of these on hotkeys would be quite the inconvenience. Quick access to clickables is what I as a Shaman wanted.<br />
<br />
Having to open inventory every time I needed to cure the occasional slowed melee or to switch out to my Fungi gets tiresome.<br />
<br />
Now I can simply drag the clickable to the hotkey if I need to without opening my inventory, or I can just click it in the clickables window. I can also switch my BP to Fungi by opening the left most bag in the clickables to get to the Fungi.<br />
<br />
Pretty nifty eh?<br />
<br />
This UI was made for use by me, a Shaman. I never claimed it would suit everyone's class. :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bled Lifeblood</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know how many hotkeys you use, but you have like 100 spots available and I wouldn't think it would be to tough to stick one or two pages of items on the last section of hotkeys, even if you dont use them often they are there. <br />
<br />
     But the beauty of this new UI is everyone can have it customized the way they like, and whether it's easier or not really has nothing to do with if you like it. so pay no attention to my endless yammerings =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aruman</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Switching to last bank of keys to use a clickable item would be a hassle.<br />
<br />
If everything right in front of me I don't need to do that.</div></div><hr />
