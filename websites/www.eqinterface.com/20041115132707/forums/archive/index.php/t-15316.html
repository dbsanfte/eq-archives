Hi folks!  <br />
<br />
Thanks for your interest in my numpad spell casting window.  This file is a modification of the original one written by Onetwo1212 which can be found at http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=2707.  I do not take credit for his original work, only for modifying it to work with EQ Omens of War.  It is confirmed to be fully functional, including the 9th spell gem slot, by Landor, 65 Archon, Horde of Steel, Terris Thule, whom I am very grateful to for testing it for me, as I do not have the AA ability yet, as the following picture shows.<br />
<br />
http://tinypic.com/a2f4g<br />
<br />
Added:<br />
-9th spell slot, useable upon obtaining the OOW AA &quot;Mnemonic Retention&quot;.<br />
<br />
Changed:<br />
-Location of spell book moved from center to lower right corner.<br />
-Widening of the window to account for new spell book placement.<br />
-Spell gems 5-8 moved back 1 space to corespond with num pad.<br />
-Compatible with OOW.<br />
<br />
To install: <br />
1st backup your original EQUI_SpellCastWnd.xml file, and extract the new one to your custom UI folder.  Then reload your interface in game by using the options window, or the /loadskin [UI name] command, and you should be all set.<br />
<br />
NOTE: For NumPad funcionality it is necessary to map your spells to the NumPad keys on your keyboard.  To do this, go into Options and select the Keyboard tab.  Next select the Spell Casting category.  Then go down the Alternate list on the right side making sure Cast gem 1 coresponds with NPAD 1, and etc. Warning: Make sure to remap any conflicts, such as Center View to HOME, Look Up to PGUP, Look Down to PGDOWN, Zoom In to INSERT, and Zoom Out to DELETE.   You can remap them anywhere you like, as long as they don't cause conflicts with anything else.  The above is merely an example of how I have mine.  <br />

I previousely attached it at this thread, so download it here:<br />

<br />
Myself, I've had the NumPad mapped to my spell gems for several years, now (it mostly derived from me mapping my Auto-Attack key to my 0 key on the NumPad to avoid any mishaps while speaking to NPCs when I was just fresh into the game, near six years ago...used to frustrate me immensely).  Sadly, I wish they would incorporate this into each character's individual .ini file, so that I could use the NumPad for my pure melee character's Combat Abilities, and not have to use Ctrl+NumPad.  Heh.<br />
<br />
Very nice idea for the UI.  Glad to see others try and incorporate (what I find to be) an incredibly useful setting for key mapping.<br />
