Some of these abilities require a hotkey to be dragged and dropped from the AAxp window. Some instruct the player to use the AA via a typed command. <br />
<br />
I really like the idea of the pet window. When it was added it freed up alot of my  hotkey slots.  However, with all these new hotkeys to manipulate my pet, my hotkey banks are getting very crowded once again. I know it's easy enough to have a dedicated hotkey page for pet commands. But, I would really like to add some of the new buttons to my pet window.  <br />
<br />
The trouble is, I have no idea how to get it to work. I think it might be possible for the AAs with a keyboard command (ie /pet hold or /pet feign) if not the AAs that require a drag &amp; drop hotkey to be made from the AA window.<br />
<br />
If anyone could help me with info on how to add a functional button to my pet window I would really appreciate it. Or, if it's not possible, I would like to know that too, so I can stop trying to figure it out. :) I am not trained with XML really, I just taught myself a bit so I could make UI mods for my toons. It has been alot of fun for me since the new UIs were added. But I am feeling the lack in my skills atm. Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />
