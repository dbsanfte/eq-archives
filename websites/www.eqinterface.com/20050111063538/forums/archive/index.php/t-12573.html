<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teneniel</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just recently returned from a long forced vacation to eq to see that the pet window now had a buff section, as an avid fan of pet classes i was happy. Untill i was unable to find a window mod that suited me. So i decided to dive back in to fiddiling with the windows. <br />
I modified the standard pet window to be horizontal and as such needed to shorten the height of it but in game it appears to no be working. In sidlwidl it appears as i want it to . Im farily certain it has something to do with the way i adjusted the buff window itself. Being that i have only limited knowledge of xml all i know is ftrom what ive been able to figure out by 'tinkering ' with the files. Id appreciate if anyone could look this over and see if i did something wrong. Ill ( hopefully ) get the file attached as opposed to posting all the text here. Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />
