<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sensei Grip</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When using this it shows the wrong %<br />
<br />
Say I have 80% left it will show 20%<br />
100% shows 0%<br />
<br />
Yet, if you hover your mouse over the Player Fatigue Guage it will show the correct %. <br />
<br />
Is this a bug or are we missing an EQType label?<br />
<br />
<br />
What im thinking is...<br />
Perhaps there is a Stamina AND a Fatigue value?<br />
We use the &quot;Player Fatigue Guage&quot; (3) with the Player Stamina Percent (21) and it shows us the opposite value.  Is there a &quot;Player Fatigue Percent&quot; number?<br />
<br />
Player_Fatigue Guage = 3<br />
Player_Stamina Guage = ??<br />
Player_Stamina Percent = 21<br />
Player_Fatigue Percent = ??<br />
<br />
So when you have an 80% Fatigue bar<br />
You have used 20% of your Stamina.<br />
<br />
Its prolly just a bug but anyone know WTF im talking about? lol</div></div><hr />

It's kinda annoying, and unfortunately, as far as I know it is the closest you can get to the stamina percentage.</div></div><hr />

I was trying to build logic out of what VI did. Sometimes I'm even wrong in my guesses. ;)</div></div><hr />
