<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whittefang</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i recently downloaded the slayer skin under the evil section of the downloads. Even though my toon isnt eveil i just liked the skin.But after i downloaded it and followed the instructions on the read me text with the zip i logged into eq and not only did the skin not work for me but my default akins were all messed up...so i havent been able to play since. I thought id download another skin and use that but i cant find anything i really like. Is it hard to make your own skin? Do you need some type of special software to do it? And one more thing...how come i see tons of bits and pieces of ui's under the complete ui section? isnt that suppose to be for full ui's and not just spellbooks or certain windows...lol. Anyway if u could help with my prob with slayer or answer any other ui question it would be greatly appreciated...ty</div></div><hr />

When the UI crashed EQ loaded the default code but continued to use the slayer graphics. Hence default looked broken but really isnt. It just doesnt look right.<br />
<br />
If you go into your EQ directory and open copy and paste here your UIerrors.txt log file after trying to load &quot;slayer&quot; then we can point you in the direction of what patches it needs to be functional again.</div></div><hr />

If you want to return to the default, try unclicking the &quot;Use ini&quot; button on the loadskin window and then switching to the default. It sounds like your UI_Charname_Server.ini file is screwy. By unchecking/unselecting the Use ini button it will place all the windows in the default location and configuration, ignoring everything in your char file.<br />
<br />
As far as something getting messed up in the download, I can't say. you may have gotten a bad zip (glitched during download or whatever.)<br />
