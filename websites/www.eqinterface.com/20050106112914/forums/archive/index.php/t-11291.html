<br />
(from EQLive's Dev's Corner (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=59510))<br />
<br />
You've been asking for them and now we're ready to discuss them. We're taking a big departure from what many of you are used to when it comes to combat. With that in mind, here is a brief summary of these exciting enhancements to better help you target your questions to us during the live chat. Don't worry if you miss the chat, we'll post the logs on EverQuestLive.com<br />
<br />
    * Increase the contributions melee classes provide in a group setting<br />
    * Address the current deficit between the pure melee classes and other classes<br />
    * Add more depth and potential for skilled play to melee combat<br />
    * Provide a system that encourages attentiveness and decision-making skills, without focusing heavily on twitch gameplay<br />
<br />
<br />
Take advantage of an opponent's weakness. See an opening, strike home for the kill!<br />
<br />
Monks, Rogues and Warriors will gain the ability to recognize certain weaknesses in an opponent's defense. These &quot;Openings&quot; will be a variety of types and can occur based on several different situations during combat. Be quick though, an opening will not present itself for long. Strike quick with a new combat skill once your character recognizes an opening. These new combat skills are being designed just for this combat system revision. Using and maintaining these skills expends the character's Endurance (a new statistic, calculated from the character's basic stats).<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a combat example:<br />
<br />
A warrior is serving as the tank for his group, standing in front of a goblin. While battling the goblin, the warrior makes an exceptional parry and is presented with an opening. An indicator appears with the &quot;opening icon&quot; and the word &quot;Parry&quot; next to it (this information also appears in the chat window).<br />
<br />
Now is his opportunity to strike back after the exceptional parry! Only certain combat skills can be used to react to a parry opening. Other types of openings will allow the use of other skills. Some skills may be usable in response to more than one type of opening. Also, your position in relation to the target can change the effectiveness of certain skills.<br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior knows that he can use one of three combat skills, each having some merit. One might stun the target, one might increase the hate generated by the warrior for a few rounds, and one might make it easier for everyone to hit the NPC.<br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior elects to try to stun the goblin. He presses the appropriate button and luck smiles upon him as he successfully executes the strike, leaving the goblin standing dumbly for a combat round.<br />
<br />
Increasing Your Endurance and Learning New Skills<br />
<br />
    * Increase Endurance by increasing attributes or by acquiring special items that directly increase your Endurance pool<br />
    * Find tomes or instructions manuals and take them to specific trainers to learn new skills<br />
    * Choose your skills from skill categories (such as Tactical) containing skills focused to a purpose<br />
    * Most openings are available only to a single character, but some are available to all nearby characters<br />
    * Disciplines will be transferred to this new system<br />
    * Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer<br />
    * Disciplines will require an Endurance cost<br />
    * Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines<br />
<br />
There will be other changes as well. Keep your eyes on the Test server and our update messages for more details as we move forward.<br />
<br />
This new system is much more flexible than the existing disciplines. It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings. This system creates the possibility for tremendous enhancement in the future, allowing groups a large number of options when it comes to melee combat.<br />

<br />
Seriously though, I don't know how this will make pure melee desireable.  I cannot see how these new skills will be able to compete with tried and true spells.<br />
<br />
In the example here, the warrior has to wait for the openeing, then use stun...while the paladin can load up a number of stuns and cast them pretty much whenever he wants.<br />
<br />
Special moves that use &quot;Endurance&quot; without the need for an &quot;opening&quot; would be more along the lines of spells.<br />
<br />
Also, I wonder what level these new abilities are gained.  The first discipline is gained at 35?  That is a few levels off from 9 when hybrids gain spells.<br />
<br />
I don't particualry want to have to completely reassess my equipment again.  Monks have had it rough in the equipment department.  I've had to change for kunark, velious, and had to change again after the mitigration nerf.  I'm not wealthy enough to go out and buy a new suit so that I have enough Endurance to use the new skills.<br />
<br />
I'll have to see what happens before making any real decision, but right now I think it is just going to over complicate things.<br />
<br />
On a side note, maybe this is a preview of the combat system in EQII.  If so, I don't mind getting some practice in before release.  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">[Most of this is opinion and observation. I might be wrong, but I doubt it.]<br />
<br />
Endurance, my guess is, will be based on Stamina, Dexterity, Agility, and/or Strength (the basic melee stats) in some form or fashion. The EQ engine is limited, so unless they do some heavy coding (which they're probably doing ANYWAY), these combat skills will be treated like normal skills or possibly even instant-cast spells that draw from a seperate stat pool, or maybe even just a renamed mana pool.  There really is no reason to completely redesign a portion of the engine for this, as the above two solutions work just as well.<br />
<br />
These special skills/spells will have certain conditions attached to them. You can only use XX skill after XX event, and what not.  In order to make these skills worth using, they will have to make them powerful enough to bother with, probably scaling with level. Everyone knows an extra 15 damage during a fight is not going to help you kill a named in (insert planar zone here). Perhaps they'll inflict the mobs with effects, or do raw HP damage.  In either case, it really sounds like they're just giving the melee something else to do other than sit there and press the taunt/backstab/etc button. They're trying to make the pure melee classes more interactive, and if they're SMART, will be giving warriors the best skills of the lot. Monks really don't need to be upgraded, and rogues DEFINITELY don't need to be upgraded, but warriors could definitely use some sprucing up. Their damage tables, and their 'snap aggro' AA are nice, but the class could use something special that is unique to warriors and honestly useful. In raid situations, you'll want a warrior MT if only for their damage table and equipment choices. In exp, though... I'm seeing more and more people want a knight class because of their amazing aggro holding skills. Warriors suck at holding aggro without the proper weapons. Taunt alone is so random, it's almost useless, and it's not a unique skill either. Hell, RANGERS get taunt. Without proper equipment, warriors flat out purely suck, much like rogues. <br />
<br />
Hopefully these new skills will change that equipment dependancy for the low-to-midlevel people, and give the high level/end game folks something else to do on raids as well as improving warriors all at the same time. I have very little faith in SoE, but I still do have a little left. Maybe they can implement this correctly to benefit everyone without pissing too many people off. You can't please everyone all the time, but you can atleast try to please MOST people, right?</div></div><hr />

It might take the yellow bar (the one that fades as you swim jump or fight dual wielding) then again it would make Zinging the tanks more effective in combat.<br />
<br />
I could see it like a DoT that doesn't fade.. for example... you are fighting you get the opening and have a piercing weapon handy... you slip the dagger into the armpit and whammy.. more damage from cutting a major vein or artery... or if you have a blunt you upper cut them and they get blinded from the bleeding in the face and a few broken teeth swallowing blood etc... or a slashing weapon... Ala Rob Roy last fight scene... if you don't know what I'm talking about... rent/buy Rob Roy and watch the last fight scene between the Fop and Rob Roy... god that's a hell of a slash.  It might also allow for better and or more effective &quot;visuals&quot; on crits.... instead of just more damage in 1 shot, it might allow for lingering damage.. I for one am looking forward to this change and am going to PL my SK and Warrior up a few levels to start taking advantage of it.</div></div><hr />
