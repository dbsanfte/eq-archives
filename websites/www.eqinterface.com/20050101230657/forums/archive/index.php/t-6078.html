As you said, the problem is with your Inventory Window.  Using a text editor (Word, WordPerfect, NotePad, etc.) to open the file (EQUI_Inventory.xml) in your custom folder.<br />
<br />
Using the Search/Find feature, look for:<br />
<br />
	&lt;StaticAnimation item= &quot;ClassAnim&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;ClassAnim&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;338&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;22&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;64&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;128&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;Animation&gt;A_ClassAnim01&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
	&lt;/StaticAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
(sizes and location may be different)<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;ClassAnim&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
If either of those aren't in your file, add them.  If the ClassAnimation isn't supposed to show, change the size in the first part to 1,1.<br />
<br />
As to the other part of your question, re the downloads, you'd have to ask Dolby or Kudane, that's well beyond anything I can answer.  I'll point this thread out to them.</div></div><hr />
