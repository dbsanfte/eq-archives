<br />
Beta Version 1.0 - June 2004<br />
<br />
Resolution for 1024 x 768 ONLY<br />
No other resolutions are available...YET.<br />
<br />
All graphics have been re-created by hand to simulate the EverQuest II UI as well as additional ideas implemented to enhance the interface. There are some portions that came from public screenshots and user submissions that were re-textured for clarity. You can visit the EverQuest II website at http://everquest2.station.sony.com/.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Installation:<br />
<br />
    * Do not have EverQuest loaded when installing<br />
    * Be sure you are running EverQuest in 1024 x 768 prior to installation<br />
    * Create a Folder named &quot;eqii&quot; in your EverQuest\uifiles directory<br />
    * Extract ALL files to the &quot;eqii&quot; folder<br />
    * Use the included UI-INI file for your UI-INI Character<br />
<br />
PS - Please make sure you make a fresh install after each Beta!<br />
<br />
PSS - If you move the BuffWindow in-game, you will notice the Bordering will come foward, blocking everything. This is NORMAL. Simply re-load the interface, or zone and everything will go back to normal. You can set the transparency of the window to see through the icons if you wish, but DO NOT hide the window from view (using the window selector). Doing so will also remove the bordering around the interface.</div></div><hr />

Made a few personal changes, spell icons, target ring and some spam window placements. This really is good and clean, I love it. Only problem I see with putting the spam boxes down below the viewport is that when you zone, they fall behind the UI. Simple fix is to click on where the MELEE and SPAM text is and they pop right back out of it. Maybe yall could cut that portion of the bottom UI (black area) and change the viewport to match? Either way its a great look. Almost makes me want to start playing again lol<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Huh... never noticed that...it does go underneath the bordering..<br />
<br />
well that's not gunna work... hmmm.....................lets see.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well... I looked at it again...<br />
<br />
The Chat window is the one XML window that is always behind EVERYTHING. So, if I place the borders in that window instead, everytime you try and move the chatwindow, that border will popup in front, which is totally bad.<br />
<br />
I could code the graphic parts in each window at the bottom to be within the spellbar, hotbuttons, whatever, but then you are forced to have those windows always exactly there, and so many people have different setups, so I do not want to try that route.<br />
<br />
So, in the released version, you will not be able to place a chat window over the bottom graphic unless you click it up everytime you zone. My suggestion is to place the chatwindow above the graphic so its not in the way of it as intended. All the miscellaneous windows will be housed within the black areas, so having the Chat window where it is supposed to be should not really be a big ordeal.<br />
<br />
Now, as for those happy modders, I am sure you can mod the file to remove the bottom graphic and place the spellbar and hotkeys where-ever.<br />
<br />
In the 1280x1024 version, having the chatwindows where they are intended to be should be even better since you have more screen space.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zoriouz</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did just that Drak, I went in and edited the Lower left, lower middle, and lower right graphic parts and the results was as expected. I can now place my windows at the bottom and they dont pop behind the UI because now there is nothing there :) Hope you dont mind me moding this to my liking because I think this set up looks nice for melee. The screen shot is a result after I moded the graphics and reset the viewprot to match so there still looks like a black area there. Keep up the great work!<br />

I don't mind people modding this at all, only thing I ask is no one publish any mods publically until the final is released, this will aid me in keeping any bug reports straight since only official versions will be available. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont mind.. but you may have to edit it again after the release. Make sure you are changing the size of the &lt;Screen&gt; parts, not just the size of the graphic it is holding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zoriouz</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, thanks you guys, this is the best UI I have had a chance to play around with. It has a lot of advantages, specially for Melee classes as it is nice , clean, and easy to mod. Cant wait for the final release, you guys are doing a hella job on this. SOE, hire these guys to make the default UI just like this one! lol seriously...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bilgort</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could you possibly make an alternate version where the border is tied into the chat windows. Just because it IS the only solution and you were saying it was bad because all other items would go behind the border any time you move or resize the chat window(s) but I never mess with my chat windows once they are made so I don't see the issue. You see, look at it this way:<br />
<br />
Option 1 - Tie border in with buff window and have to click on chat windows every time you zone<br />
<br />
Option 2 - Set chat windows how you like and leave em and never have to click on them again.<br />
<br />
I think option 2 is WAY better. Even if I messed with my chat windows every once in a while that is EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE compared to EVERY TIME I ZONE. Having to click on the windows every time I zone is very frustrating. Maybe I zone too much but I find I'm having to do it a hell of alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I failed to mention is when you --&gt; Create New Window<br />
<br />
it will also create a 2nd set of bordering around the UI<br />
<br />
I'd hate to see what the functionality of it of someone was to have 4 or more windows open, not including Tell windows (using pop up feature). All would have an additional borderset. Not good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jethal</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">did alittle work tonight and resized the UI for 1280x1024.. what do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks very good bud :) There will be a 1280 version as well, just have not got to that point yet.</div></div><hr />

That's 1280x1024</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elezibeth</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Update : July 18<br />
<br />
We should have a new build coming soon for everyone's viewing pleasure.<br />
<br />
If you haven't been watching the official thread over on Sha`Kahr (http://www.shakahr.com/live/forums/showthread.php?t=295), you might consider sneaking a peek!  I have posted a screenshot of the more updated look that more matches the 'Finalized' beta UI we are all seeing in new screenshots. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have some interesting news.<br />
<br />
The UI has undergone many revisions with code and graphics as well as style. Thus being said, there will be 2 versions<br />
<br />
Emulated EQII Interface (simulates the live version of EQII with borders)<br />
Emulated EQII Interface - Transparent Version (user defined)<br />
<br />
The Emulated EQII Interface (now on hold) will be undergoing some heavy code and graphics from scratch since the bordering, in my opinion, does not work well at all being coded into the buff window. Instead, I am going to make 2 static bars going across with the use of the /viewport commands. This type of interface has been put on hold until we can gather some new graphics to finalize the emulation. This UI will be for 1024 x 768 and 1280 x 1024 only.<br />
(screenshot not available)<br />
<br />
The Emulated EQII Interface - Transparent Version, is now being sent to the supporters to test as this will be the UI you will see come out first. Mainly because it works better with EverQuest Live and does not take away from any viewspace. This UI can be used in ANY resolution.<br />
