<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harmonie</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or another idea I had...How about adding a slider timer in the title part of the window, so it is visable when the box is minimized.  I wouldnt mind having to manually set the timer, but it would be even better if it would count down 30 min to enter, then 90 min to adventure, then 30 min after your success (or fail) message.  I currently use a timer that is at 1hour 30 min (totally unrelated to the adventure window) and that works, but this would be even better!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tafkamb</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A timer bar would be great as perviously said<br />
what are the chances of a progress result as well for the case of Collections<br />
<br />
I am a complete Noob at all this stuff so if one of u experienced peeps comes up with something it would be great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kdawg6924</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a new thought came to mind, ot only a timer when minimized, but maybe like a progress thing as well (i.e. 48 of 55 or 12 of 28) for the slaughter and collection missions........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harmonie</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure everyone has figured this out by now... but if you resize the window you can see just your time and progress info.  I still want a timer guage in there tho.  I am tired of having to remember to open my timer seperately :)</div></div><hr />
