<br />
I'm experiencing a problem that someome can assist with. I've searched in the forums and found nothing identical to what i'm experiencing. I'm using a TKing UI with a couple modified windows (hotkey and buffs). When today's patch came out, I came here and found the needed UI changes, fixed my player window and then just copied all the other patched files over from the default folder.<br />
<br />
My UIErrors log is going insane....<br />
What I get is MANY lines exactly like this...<br />
[Thu Dec 18 14:16:03 2003] Warning: file UIFiles\isabeau\ not found in directory UIFiles\isabeau\.  Attempting to use file from Default skin.<br />
<br />
The file grows and grows unless I change to default UI or delete it. There are no specific file names mentioned in the error log. Just like 10000 lines like what I pasted above. It's almost like it can't see my UI directory. <br />
<br />
Any assistance is appreciated.<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

Maybe this will help, maybe it's not related, but thought i'd post it just incase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my guess is one of the patched files today has requested a load... but didnt put a file name. will have to look at each of the new XML files before I can tell you for sure.<br />
<br />
I am hoping that Cairenn will pop on and do her magic (she tends to find this quickly).. its probably just needing some arguements added to stop this.<br />
<br />
will try to tell you more when i find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isabeau</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply. Yeah it's really bogglesome. I've loaded the Default UI (cringes) until maybe someone can help give me an idea what to troubleshoot.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I get the same problem with my alt's UI that I run off another PC.<br />
She uses infinium UI with all recent patch edits made of course.<br />
<br />
Same error as I get with Isa, but I also get this..<br />

Not sure what the first line means ...<br />

for the second error, go back and make sure that you added both parts, the definitions and the &lt;Pieces&gt; at the bottom.</div></div><hr />

I attached a copy of the file after I made the edits. Again note, this is another character on another machine with the errors I posted in my previous post. Not Isabeau. It's just that both are having similar problems, even though they use totally different UIs. Still they both have the problem with the massive UIerror log<br />
like this...repeating it over and over...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nilo777</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having the exact same problem described by both Dal and Isabeau.  Texture file and UIerror files both growing to be very large with repeating message.  No idea what it means or how to fix it.  Also, and I doubt this is related, but when i go to my inventory screen and click the skills tab to open up the window with all of my current skill values, it wont open.  This happens with my cleric, but not with my ranger.  Both are using the same UI though.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isabeau</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have any thoughts on how to resolve this problem yet? I still have the problem. I am going to try implementing one new file at a time today and see when exactly the problem starts to happen... unsure what else to do at this point as I am having the problem on two different machines, two different accounts, with two different UIs, with two different characters :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to my knowledge, think it might just be an EQ bug atm.  I'm still getting it too, but have given up trying to fix it.  Just waiting on a fix...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You problem is the same reason of this problem: http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8588<br />
<br />
Even though that spacifically states the spell book tga files, it's the exact same reason.<br />
<br />
The problem is that your UI is not referencing UI graphic files within the Default UI. Stupid, but SOE has hard coded a requirement that you must reference all default UI TAG files. Even if you don't use them.<br />
<br />
My guess is you renamed a few of them or just plain deleted their references from within your EQUI_Animations.xml file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What that is looking for is the NUMBERED BUTTONS..<br />
<br />
the new Melee Skill Window uses WindowPieces06.tga and WindowPieces07.tga <br />
<br />
ALOT of UIs were never updated to include the call for these in the animations file.. this was the error VERT early in the week. we have added the fixes found HERE (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=51636#post51636) from the Aug 26th Patch.<br />
<br />
If you ADD this to your animations file that call out will be fixed.<br />
<br />
we fixed VERT with this.. try it see if it doesnt fix your problem too<br />
<br />
I promise you will find this to be the error</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalman</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That doesnt seem to be my problem, referencing the vert fix.  I examined my animations file and it has those fixes already in place.  Could it be something as simple as this error I found in VERT just today.<br />
<br />
Think I found the problem at least for this particular problem. In the EQUI_Animations.xml I believe this line is referenced wrong<br />
<br />
&lt;TextureInfo item=&quot;solspellbook01.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
and should read<br />
<br />
&lt;TextureInfo item=&quot;spellbook01.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
the reason I think this is the case: if you notice in my error log it does find spellbook04.tga and the previous files it can't find. Spellbook01, 02 and 03 are all preceeded by solspellbook.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps with the other UI's that are having problems also.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the error is a very generic error message. But the relation is that it's looking for a TGA file that's within the default UI but not within yours.<br />
<br />
The solspellbook01.tga is the bug in the current Vert mods. I've already PM'd Sokol and Kudane about it. Simple fix for Vert mobs is to add spellbook01 - 4.tga into your Animations file.<br />
(I think the solspellbook01 was renamed to spellbook01 in the later Vert UIs)<br />
<br />
However, this error will only cause 3 or 4 files of blank warnings. Any more generally means the UI is looking for another graphics file that's not referenced.<br />
<br />
<br />
The best bet is to make sure all TGA files within your default directory are referenced within your custom Animations file. That will remove all blank warnings as listed above.<br />
<br />
And believe your me, the way SOE did this just plain sucks. Instead of being able to make your UI &quot;patch proof&quot; by adding custom graphic files and removing old &quot;unused&quot; files, you now need to have all files referenced. This either adds more to memory (add your custom files and the defaults) or you have to &quot;overwrite&quot; the defaults making your file prone to patch problems.</div></div><hr />
