The ones you list are just saying it couldnt find the file in your custom folder so its going to use the one in the default folder. It Martha Stewarts words &quot;Its a good thing&quot;.<br />

I keep getting these same errors.  I have changed all my ram, uninstalled and reinstalled EQ, updated my drivers, ran scandisk and defrag (just so happened to have these problems on one of my maintenance  days), virus scan and everything else I could think of, but to no sucess.  If anyone has any more ideas, please help me.</div></div><hr />
