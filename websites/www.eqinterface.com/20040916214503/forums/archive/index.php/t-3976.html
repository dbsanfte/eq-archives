<br />
Latest release of my personal UI, posted here for the first time due to popular request.  Its basically an assimilation and tweak of various things since the new UI first started, so I've lost track of what came from where.  The goal is functionality and less clutter, so you won't find quite as much information scattered all over the screen as you would with most custom UI's.  <br />
<br />
General features:  Graphics from t.king and vert, borderless design, /viewport layout, 10 hour digital timer, and eqtoolbox maps.<br />
<br />
The bottom strip of the interface is obscured on my screen due to frequent windowed mode use, so the window positions may not be optimal for everyone.<br />

<br />
First, I'm not familiar with these UIs with the windows connected like this, would it be possible to move the group/player window closer to the hot keys, and shift everything left?<br />
<br />
Second, maybe it would look better if you had the horizontal buff icons with the names.. not sure how to explain that :)<br />
 _<br />
|_| Name of buff here<br />
 _<br />
|_| Name of buff here<br />
 _<br />
|_| Name of buff here<br />
<br />
More information, and when you only have a few buffs, the extra space won't be as strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now this looked like a nice UI.<br />
Gonna try this when i am done with work :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kreugen</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I planned on trying that, I'm just not a big fan of the vertical buffs.   After three years I'm just too used to glancing at that 3x3 row and seeing exactly what buffs I have without having to scan a long collum or read the names.<br />
<br />
Now if someone were to come up with a full sized icon 3x3 block with the buff names, they'd probably be my hero.  I'm sure its possible, I just spend too much time playing to be doing all that fiddling with xml.<br />
<br />
The nature of the UI makes it fairly uncustomizable I'm afraid, at least not without editing the .xml yourself, which kind of defeats the purpose.  Like I said, its pretty much a UI designed for myself, however it proved popular enough that I decided to share it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teannas</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great ui, I kinda configured it for a 1024 x 768 and also added some different mods etc.<br />

I meant Teannas's screenshot (which is in this thread, so people don't have to go looking all over the site). But admittedly it came out wrong =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rastarex</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to have my windows at the bottom of this mod transparent as you apparently have done.  Can you tell me how you did this?? i love this mod, but the SINGLE drawback to me is the masking behind the windows and info.  Any help would be VERY appreciated.<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kreugen</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There isn't any masking, it uses /viewport.  Nothing but blackness behind those windows unless you didn't use the included .ini file properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rastarex</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did use the .ini file.  What i want to know, since i know nothing to less than nothing about xml, is: what do i set/change to be able to see thru the /viewport blackness.  I was referring to teannis' alteration and how it was achieved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuririnsama</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The windows aren't transparent, they're solid; he uses T.King's texture which is naturally black.  If you want to get rid of the 'blackness' behind the windows, just type &quot;/viewport reset&quot; ingame.  You can then change the windows to be however transparent you want by right clicking on the windows and changing the alpha setting crap.<br />
<br />
Great UI btw, I've been using it for the last few weeks and still loving it ;).<br />
