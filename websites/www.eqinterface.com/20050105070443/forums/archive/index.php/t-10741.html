<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GremLegend</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those animated things on the inventory screen, the SK's have a skull and shield, clerics have that bowl, and so on.  What are these files called in the default UI file?    What I did to start modifying my UI, is move the default UI files all over to my own UI folder.  From there I downloaded different stuff I liked and just overwrote the old files.  I'm assuming, to get rid of the animations, I need to delete those files, and put a new one in, as soon as I find one.  But I don't know what those files are called.  Anyone here know?<br />
<br />
My second question is, can anyone recommend a good animation, or point me toward one?  Or tell me what they're usually called or classified under in the downloads section?</div></div><hr />

Also don't copy all of the default folder into your custom folder. Just add the actual files you mod into your custom folder. Everquest will use these then get whats missing from the default folder. Much easier on patch day this way. You wont be wondering whats modded and whats not what do I have to fix and whats ok.</div></div><hr />

This link should take you to his class animation section.<br />
