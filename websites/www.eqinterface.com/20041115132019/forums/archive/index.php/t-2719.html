<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've loved dragons ever since I was a small child. So I decided I would put together a spellbook to reflect my love of them. There is a special surprise in this one. You won't see it in the image here... but if you install it... stare into the dragon's eyes. ;)<br />
<br />
http://br.crashed.net/~ink/files/tt_dragonbook.jpg <br />
<br />
I've uploaded this to the download section (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=356). :)<br />
<br />
I love to hear feedback from people, so please... give me comments, good or bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cabalist</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great Spellbook Thangor ;)<br />
<br />
Had just a small bug. The Spellname of Spellgem 14 was a bit off... <br />
<br />
I changed this:<br />
<br />
	&lt;StaticText item =&quot;SBW_SpellName14&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;SBW_SpellName14&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;Font&gt;1&lt;/Font&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;290&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;321&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
 <br />
<br />
to this:<br />
<br />
<br />
	&lt;StaticText item =&quot;SBW_SpellName14&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;SBW_SpellName14&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;Font&gt;1&lt;/Font&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;265&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;369&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Now everything is fine.<br />
<br />
Edit: Some more things. Spellname6 (from 7th Gem) is a bit too high and long Spellnames are wrapped to two lines and the second line hides half behind the icon under it allready... <br />
<br />
uhm I hope someone understands my english :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrik</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to take the dragon and put it on other spell books?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, it's possible. Though unless the new book in question is exactly the same size as this one, he may not fit quite right.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the feedback! If you look at the image at the begining of this thread, I've also made a slight attempt at fixing his &quot;scrunched nose&quot; though don't know if I quite got it right yet?<br />
<br />
On another note, I checked out T.King's latest spellbook design he had on his website. It seems what I had hoped would happen is happening... We're feeding off eachother to make better and better spellbooks. The pic posted on his site takes some of the nice little features I put in my spellbook and is putting them to good use. I really enjoy a bit of competitiveness as it pushes me to create better and better designs. :) Look for more soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blacklord_sith</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must say this spellbook ROCKS! I just tried it out, and it's the cleanest graphic I've seen for the books. And the little blink the dragon does Kicks ass!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The edit you did was very good for correcting the scrunchiness, but it still seemed rather odd--looking at it for a bit, I decided that the snout was just too high up on the face to be at that angle. It wasn't congruitous. So, being the happy little paintshopper that I am, I hacked it up and made this *extrememly poor* mockup of what I mean, which is attached below.  Dragons need to have that sort of longish, equine snout to look proper, and I hope I've proportioned it well enough for you to get the picture. Just about 15-20pixels lower (I simply cut out the round of the &quot;snout&quot;, from the nostrils to the chin, and moved it down one of its own lengths...well, you get the picture). I also overwrote the beard thingy, because I'm not a fan of it ^.^ but heck, it's your drawing, have a hairy dragon if you like (a soul patch would look better, if you insist on facial hair O.o). I think if you try it out, you'll agree that it looks more dragon-ish and less Yoda-ish than before;). Still, do what you like, I'm just the suggestion dwarf. Good luck, great job!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm seeing what you're getting at now... a more downward look to it. I may just make that adjustment as you're right. It does appear more &quot;dragonish&quot; like that :) Thank's for the help in tweaking this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Revision is the key to quality&quot; :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I didn't explain it correctly... or maybe you just took what I said all wrong. Allow me to try and explain better.<br />
<br />
When I see another artist's work who impresses me, I like to see if I can match his/her skills... better my own work by learning from the things they do and vice versa (should my work be worthy of learning from). With each pass of the artists they continually get better and better as they hone their skills. Not to &quot;Beat&quot; the other artist, but to match them. When I used the word competition, I meant it in the friendliest of terms. Not at all as how you seemed to have taken it. I respect your art and think you have done wonderful work.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this explains it better? Or perhaps not? I know I certainly won't be coming at you guns blazing. I wish you the best of luck and skill in all your future endevors. I also hope there isn't any &quot;bad blood&quot; from you to me... as there is none from me to you. Sorry for any confusion that may have been caused from my lack of explaination. I honestly didn't think you were going to take it how you did.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
    Thangor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good job dissolving what could have been a bit nasty flame war there, Thang. It was obviously just a misunderstanding. I could tell from reading it at the start that you meant what you just explained, but I guess everyone interprets things differently. You're obviously not stealing ideas, neither of you, neither were you implying that it is being done; you're simply saying that by both of you creating spellbooks, both of you will be compelled to make the best ones you can ^.^ And I'm glad you agree with me on the snout issue, I can't wait to see the new version. No smoke, though; smoke is tricky to animate. Like they say, &quot;Keep it simple, stupid.&quot; Now, back to english homework &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
Edit: I see you've already attached the new version already O.o Nice work, it looks great now. Thanks man! *installs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalthanan</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think people are getting way too sensitive about things.<br />
<br />
If you're that paranoid about people stealing even IDEAS, then don't talk about them or post mockups or release anything but locked executables with pop-up license agreements.  Oh and make sure you charge their credit card before they can download.<br />
<br />
I think the majority of people release these mods as a service to the community.  I thoroughly expect people to take them, mod them, and perhaps re-release them.  I ask for some consideration as far as including accreditation, but I know the nature of people.<br />
<br />
There is some amazing work being done here, and I believe most people on this board operate in a good atmosphere.  There are a few people that make exceptional mods that have things moving at a very rapid pace -- and maybe need to slow down and think about their long-term goals and what they're so hyper about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, <br />
<br />
my two cents on this..<br />
<br />
t.king is an amazing artist...  He and I have had long discussions about his work, and what programs, images. and what he uses for inspiration(sp)<br />
<br />
Thangnor is ALSO a great artist.. and, and if he see's something that inspires him in a presketch, or moch-up or hell even another UI. and he uses that to make something total different.. well then it *IS* his creation.. and I am sure he is a fair and just man who would give credit to his inspiration.<br />
<br />
Tadashya has ALSO done some fantastic stuff.. I have seen her stuff in screen shots from my guildmates on Zeb. and I am sure she is flattered that people have used some of her stuff in game. <br />
<br />
but as with the laws of probabilities, it would eventually happen that two people have similair ideas. or even be inspired from the same thing.  I dont think many of us could claim &quot;dragons&quot; as an original idea (I think Tolkien was the first, but don't hold me to that)<br />
<br />
I only came to this thread because I have gotten some PMs asking me too.. I don't want to see anyone upset..But I also dont want to see enuendo's and suggestions that someone might have stolen &quot;ideas&quot; from someone else.. <br />
<br />
If you believe that work here is your work, and it has been copied send me a PM or an email and I will check it out. and let me define &quot;Your Work&quot;.. Work your created from scratch using no other persons artwork or only purchased artwork legally <br />
<br />
If t.king decided to have everyone who has used any of his work pull their stuff from the download section it would damn near empty. <br />
<br />
Sooo please.. lets put this behind us and treat it as a growing experience... this site was design to share designs/ideas/work etc..  It would be very sad to hear that 1-3 of our top designers are not going to share anymore... <br />
<br />
I pray that this is then end of the stress and we can all go back to making the next great thing.<br />

<br />
People are allowed to edit my work any way they want to, and use them as a basis for inspiration, I think that is awesome, I have absolutely no problems at all with it, so everyone get back to appreciating each others work, I certainly appreciate everything I have seen on this board. <br />
<br />
Keep up the great work, I love coming here to see all of this creativity! it is truely inspirational!<br />

I will delete more of the posts after things are settled to keep this thread on topic. This is the released forum not the flame forum (we dont have one).

Next time it would be best to take this to PM's or Email.<br />

Thangor spell book is not a rip/copy/stolen or what ever you wana call it. His idea was/is orignal as the rest of yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trophimus</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the earliest account of a dragon is in the Bible. In the book of Job, chapter 41 God describes Leviathan very much like a fire-breathing dragon. Some Bibles have a footnote that says Leviathan was probably a crocodile, but that is a bunch of bull. I actually did a research paper on dragons and Job 41 has an awesome description. Even if you don't believe the Bible is true, you should check it out if you are interested. Chapter 40 is also pretty cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ReallyLongTypist</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 05:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ancient Chinese culture has accounts of 'dragons' in their mythology before the bible was even a dream... so... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zu and Enlil<br />
The earliest dragon story I know about is a Sumerian myth from about 5000 BC, with a dragon named Zu.  The ancient Sumerian civilization was in an area that we now know as Iraq. Many early dragon myths, including this one, involved gods. This myth tells how Zu stole the Tablets of Law from the god Enlil. Enlil sent the sun-god Ninurta to retrieve the tablets. Ninurta did so, and killed Zu in the process. <br />
<br />
In all my searching, the Sumerian account of a dragon seems to be the first account of dragons in recorded 'history' :)</div></div><hr />

The only thing that I would like to see is to make one with an Ice Blue dragon.  Here is my reasoning for this.  I play a wizard.  The wizard class get a pet later on that is a drake (A form of dragon).  This being the case I love to play my wizard as a cold based wizard so an Ice blue dragon would be the perfect atifact for a cold based wizard to have.</div></div><hr />

I've slapped some alternate colors together for the &quot;Red Dragon&quot; mod... My thoughts on this are that really it should be a different looking dragon. The first dragon I made was a Red Dragon... I image a blue dragon to look much different as well as any other dragon color. But until I have the time or initiative to do a different dragon for each color, I thought these two would tide over some of you (those who like blue and purple anyway). I am not going to post these to the download section because I can't say I'm totally happy with them... but here they are.<br />

Hopefully I'll get that squared away and can continue on with a theme.<br />
<br />
When I do the complete conversion thing... I'm thinking it will most likely not be purple :(... heheh just isn't my favorite color. ;)<br />
<br />
But it might be one of those things that it's not too much work to release multiple color versions or something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Dragonbook mod is of not of the same code as T.Kings. The code is very different. I'm fairly certain that my spellbook should work with that UI without modification. Although this would need to be tested to be sure (all graphic files and animations are handled within' the spellbook itself and shouldn't be effected by any of the vert mod's code). But T.King's spellbook code will not work with my mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raptre</div><div class="date">10-11-2002, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a couple questions about this mod...<br />
<br />
1.  When I use the mod it looks like it's not being viewed with all colors.  I checked my eq settings and I'm running at 1024x768 with 32bit color depth.  It still looks good, but nowhere near what it looks like when I view it through photoshop.  Any ideas?<br />
<br />
2.  I looked through the xml code and noticed references to a mem this page button and a done button, but they dont seem to exist when in game.  Took me a while to figured out how to close the book.  Are they there, or what?<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
I'm thinking it's a problem because I use a version of the vert mod (Orange Crush), but not sure...  I'm going to try it with the default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-11-2002, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those buttons are basicly invisible. I didn't remove the code for them because I thought perhaps at some later time I may want to add some kind of &quot;done&quot; button or &quot;mem&quot; button of some sort.<br />
<br />
As for the colors in EQ... well it's not going to look as good. They are stored as 32bit colors, but I don't think EQ renders them quite right. My theory is that it has something to do with the gamma code they have in there. For some reason EQ boosts the gamma up way high. In my original photoshop file, I first draw the picture as I would like it to look, then I do a transparent black layer at about 20% or so to counteract the gamma when I save the TGA files. That's really my best guess as to why it doesn't look as clean in game as it does if you just view the files in photoshop.<br />
<br />
I've heard there is code to control the gamma for a texture, however I'm not sure what that code is as I have not seen an example of it so far.</div></div><hr />

vert uses only 1 image for the spell book.<br />
<br />
t.king uses the classic 4 image version.. <br />
<br />
the &quot;fix&quot; i refered above was only to restore the callouts *if* they didnt work directly.. <br />

sorry, should have pointed out that it was a &quot;if it doenst work totally&quot; thing.<br />

This mod actually uses 5 images - 4 for the book and one for the eyes blinking.</div></div><hr />

I was used to having the page left and right next to each other, but I just moved that over to middle of book with the sidlwidl program.  Also made it so you just click on the head to close.  It's even color coordinated with my Vert Ocean Spray blue w/blue dragon.  Thanks again for the mod.</div></div><hr />
