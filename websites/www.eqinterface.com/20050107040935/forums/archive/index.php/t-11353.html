<br />
and the problem is probably in your EQUI_Animations file.. it is what controls the loading of new windows..<br />
<br />
if you load the default skin and still can't get the MP3 player. might check the CNTRL-O (keyboard) and make sure that is still has a key assigned to it to make it open.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

The X,Y Cords for the mp3 window are stored in your charatername_UI.INI (or something close to that). I believe there are cordinates for each resolution too.</div></div><hr />
