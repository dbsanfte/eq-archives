Took Kuvasie's TKing Target Window and per mySOP, sliced and diced.  Resized and placed on a fake background.  <br />
<br />
None of this is coded. It is all cut and paste magin in PSP. (In fact I'd be just as happy if Kuvasie decided to take on the challenge even tho I'd learn a lot on this one... but I'll work on it if there is interest.)<br />

Never was one for my hot buttons to be sideways.  :D   The warding balls. They are way cool. Been wishing there was a set for warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvasie</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amazing!  I was just thinking about changing the buttons and stuff to more TKing like objects rather than flat black buttons.  I have actually designed some for myself but they are way too far away from being anywhere near complete.  I can't wait to see what you do with this.<br />
<br />
It definitely is interesting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So...hotbuttons.  Numpad style or regular layout?<br />
<br />
I like the horiz layout myself, so there will be at least one iteration with the 5x2 or maybe 1x10, but for those who like the other, let me know what you want so I can make it for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hummmm .. i like both reg and numpad. Numpad will give you more room for the rest i think. If you do numpad please dont number it like a numpad. I for one am to stupid to remmber where the #1 is at bottom row. I cant wait to see this done.<br />
 :D  :nana:  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm...well.....<br />
<br />
Worked a little with this over the weekend.  The mock up looks nice cuz its a simple cut and paste job, but I am still really learning the finer points of making a graphic LOOK good and the first attempt on my PC (God 640 is an enormously fat rez!) could not have looked more horrible if I had used crayons to redraw those warding balls.<br />
<br />
I'll continue to play with this idea, but have to admit that it may not ever come out simply due to my negligible skill on the graphics side.  I can get the XML no sweat but I refuse to put out a rip off of the master's work (Tking reworked by Kuv) and have it look bad...that would be like walking up to LadyVox and kicking her in the head...you just don't go doing that.</div></div><hr />
