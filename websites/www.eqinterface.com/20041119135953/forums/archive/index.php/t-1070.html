Do you think It'd be possible to list the language in a similar way the maps or tradeskill recipes are listed?<br />
<br />
I have no idea how to do it so I'm depending on help from someone lol. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no set language in EQ. It's all jumbled words.<br />
<br />
'The' = 'Jeu' or 'Ufh' or 'Sye' or any other way. The EQ Client uses an algorithim based on your skill to randomly jumble words up, if you're not 100 in said language.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly, there isn't any way to create a dictionay based on the &quot;languages&quot; of EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I meant is, at this link    -------&gt;  http://www.grey-company.org/Language/    &lt;-------    there's some sort of &quot;unofficial language&quot; there. What I'm talking about is basicly taking a text file and displaying it in eq...Could also be used to maybe put in a guide of some sort if you find one but can't print it out. Like I cold put up a guide to my epic quest there, but instead I'm talking about this specific file.<br />
<br />
bah. too early in the morning. lol mumbling on now. going to sleep..later :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The languages on that page aren't EQ Related, but yes if you wanted to put that in the UI, there's a way.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly, it would require converting it to an image and doing the same thing you do with al images to place it into the UI.<br />
<br />
<br />
fyi - the Origin of the book and it's diction is most likely from some other or a group of fantisy books and folk lords. I'm quite 100% certain it has nothing to do with EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neirret</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is based on Tolkien, and his writings of midle earth...<br />
<br />
The Grey Company simply created this massive archive and transaltion system for use themselves, then later to the public for general enjoyment of Fantasy Eleven Language /shrug<br />
<br />
These are roleplaying aids created by the elves of the Grey Company. They are available for free download and usage by anyone wanting to role-play elves, but, as they represent years of effort by Grey Company elves, they must be kept intact and proper credit given.<br />
<br />
I use then frequently for name and surname of all my elven characters :D</div></div><hr />
