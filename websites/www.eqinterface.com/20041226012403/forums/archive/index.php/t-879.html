<br />
You can change to load your preferred skin in eqclient.ini through<br />
UISkin=(Skin want to load)<br />
<br />
--)Now(--<br />
<br />
Is it possible for someone that has more programming knowledge to make a sort of shortcut or menu. <br />
<br />
When you start up EQ it shows the patcher window unless you bypass on your own.<br />
<br />
If there was a way to tell the game to load a specified file like you can possibly see a menu inside a window like when the patcher loads up.<br />
Lets say you have some EQ style graphics and you look to side and can click on a skin of choice in a menu. In clicking that skin it automatically loads a separate modified .ini file you have already modified to your preference.<br />
<br />
This would help to minimize opening and continuously editing your eqclient.ini and maybe even help for skinners to change video mode quickly to test and etc. etc......</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is possiable to create a program to work in a similar fassion.<br />
<br />
What it will have to do is what you do, but automated.<br />
Everytime it starts up, it can display a menu of skins to choose from, you pick and then it can edit the eqclient.ini and load EQ.<br />
<br />
Other than that, there is no way around &quot;short&quot; cutting it. <br />
<br />
Unfortunatly, I'm not much of a Windoze programmer. So, I'm unable to give any esitations on the work required for it. However, I do know that EQ can be started up w/out the requirement to run the patcher first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The simplest way would be to make a seperate eqclient.ini file for each skin, giving each one the name of that skin (quartz.ini, vert.ini, etc), including one for the default named default.ini THEN make a set of batch files that replace eqclient.ini with one of the other .ini files. Finally, you could make shortcuts to each of these batch files on your desktop or whatever, and run them before running EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep,<br />
<br />
That was the basic way I had thought of.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if someone might be able to come up with a small .exe to help for quick switching and adding of additional eqclient.ini files<br />
<br />
Like I have seen an actual eqclient.ini editor out (EQINI)  :) - It shows elements of the file and changes you can do.</div></div><hr />
