     I'm a total newb to the changing of the UI's but after last nite i'm happy to say i've been able to change my UI's.  Anyways, here's my question.   I've been downloading certain new UI's for the buffs, player info, spell gems, etc. and when i try loading the skin it uploads one but then puts the previous new UI i uploaded back to default.  I tried combining all of the downloads into one folder but that didn't work.  Is there a way to accomplish this?  Or am I stuck using the complete sets if I want to change the entire outlook on the UI?  Thanx in advance for all who post.</div></div><hr />

Install one, go in game, make sure it works.  Then install the next, go in game, make sure that they both work.  If they do, make a backup folder with just them in it.  Now install the third, go in game, make sure they all work.  If they do, update your backup folder.  Now the next one.  Rinse and repeat until you have them all installed and working together.<br />
<br />
When you come to the one that breaks it, go to your main EQ directory, look for the UIError.txt log file and post it here.  Also let us know which mod(s) you are using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaisonIcebear</div><div class="date">02-15-2003, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">also with takeing peaces of full ui's  for some windows it may also requie changes to the anamations .xml for them to work mostly you will get this if the ui's you mixing  have flashy graphic backgrounds or the such.<br />
<br />
will be tuff to do if you know nothing about xml unless the author of the mod your using  peaces of also included a text file wich inclueds the changes he made to the anamations file <br />
<br />
with xml  1 file  could also need 3 other files with it for it to work  easyest full mods for you to mixand match would  be bare bone mods that dose not have any backgrounds  because backgrounds also needs a TextureInfo tag to tell the game how big the image is and a Ui2DAnimation tag to tell the  game where to look on the image for what your will be using  with out these the ui will crash back to the default ui  some authors will inclued these  tags in the window xml it self these will work fine in a mix and match mod  authors that chose to add them to the anamations file where  they are supose to go will not work in a mix and matxh ui with out editing your animations file to inclued them<br />
<br />
behond the above can offer no more help with out what  Cairenn asked for</div></div><hr />
