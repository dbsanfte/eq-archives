<br />
I download an UI, unzip into the \EverQuest\uifiles\uiname, then I take the ui_name_server.ini file and rename it to my character's (for example ui_johndoe_drinal.ini) then I in-game type /loadskin uiname (for example xym). I make sure I have the right resolution. I use 1280x1024 which is the standard size on all the UIs I have tried here, and the windows are still all messed up spread around. Then I decide to take my backup files of my INIs back into the eq folder and load default skin, and now those are all messed up too lol. I am frrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaking out, I wonder what in the heck I could be doing wrong, any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Open the UI_CharName_ServerName.ini file and make sure that this line:<br />
<br />
[Main]<br />
UISkin=XYZ<br />
<br />
is set to whatever your custom folder name is.<br />
<br />
ie for myself, it looks like:<br />
<br />
[Main]<br />
UISkin=Cairenn<br />
<br />
because the name of my custom folder is Cairenn. (original, huh?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pcmciahomie</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used the /loadskin thing because I was in the game while actually setting all this up, downloading new skins etc, I'm always like that hehe. So... it should have loaded the positions anyway though and I don't get it. It used to work earlier, I used UIs just fine a few months ago. I think this happened after a few patches, are there some old files I have to delete that messes up things? I have only installed EQ once in my life and that was about one and a half year ago on the same system, it would really suck to reinstall the whole thing because I pay 1$ per hour online and I have dialup, takes me 1 hour to bring down 20 meg lol so it's kindof crap like that. I would really appreciate any help I could get!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can try going in and deleting the old UI_CharName_ServerNumber.ini files.  If you are loading it in-game, it uses the current in-game window placements.  If you want to use a &quot;supplied&quot; .ini file, you need to exit the game, put into place the new .ini file, then log back in.  Otherwise, the game will overwrite the file with the existing placements.  That make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nepper</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed you typed &quot;/loadskin {insert ui name here}&quot;<br />
To use the ini file, it has to be &quot;/loadskin {insert ui name here} 1&quot;, otherwise, it will simply put all windows in default (not ini) position.<br />
I usually just type &quot;/loadskin&quot;, it brings up the window with all my selections, I pick the one I want, and make sure the &quot;use INI&quot; button is pressed.<br />
I am personally using Xym's newest version, with the lefty patch, and am loving it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pcmciahomie</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for trying to help guys, I've followed your advice but it still isn't working :(<br />
<br />
Is the UI_charname_servername.ini file the -only- file needed to be copied from the UI folder in /uifiles/uiname/ ? I don't understand this at all :(. I have checked the UI name in the .ini and all, the resolutions are correct... everything is correct only it doesn't seem to be loading the window positions. It loads the UI when I start the character, the window positions are still messed up. I notice though the filesize of my UI_charname_servername.ini file change from its original size that id had from the UI archive I extracted, the first  time I log on the char or load a skin. I'm completely puzzled lol. Why won't the dang thing just load windows properly argh!! Any ideas at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ummm ... which directory are you putting the ini file in?  All the other files go in your custom ui folder, beside the default, but the .ini file goes in your main eq directory.<br />
<br />
When you copy it to your main eq directory, is it asking if it is okay for it to over-write the existing .ini file?<br />
<br />
(/edit Have to go out for a couple hours, good luck, I'll check back here when I get home)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you have to move the UI_charname_servername.ini file to your EverQuest directory.  (If that is not described in the Readme.txt file, I will have to change it.)<br />
<br />
If you put the UI in a directory named something other than &quot;xym&quot;, you will have to either edit your ini file or load it in game with the /load command.  The default for /load has been changed, so that &quot;/load xym&quot; is now the same as &quot;/load xym 1&quot;.  If you want windows to move to their default positions, you have to type &quot;/load xym 0&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please note that, due to limitations in the layout system, these default positions are not the correct positions.  You can drag everything into the correct positions with the mouse, except for the tick timer.  Because of the addition of the pet buff icons, that window now requires special manipulation. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pcmciahomie</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes ofcourse, I'm a fairly advanced computer user etc lol. I put the ini in /everquest, yes the main dir, and yes overwrote the old one.<br />
<br />
But Xym are you saying the windows are supposed to be out of order? Because it looked like someone who had smoked a whole bush had set them up. I was thinking it was something wrong with me loading it. Is it supposed to be really messed up? And I mean really really messed up.</div></div><hr />
