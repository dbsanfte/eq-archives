<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrrhonic</div><div class="date">03-05-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using Drakahmix and I can't seem to get it to load up with the windows in the proper place -- they're always just randomly placed around the screen. I've tried loading it with and without the &quot;true&quot; and no dice.<br />
<br />
Also, from when I first got LoY, the LFG window was half on the screen and half off (the top half was cut off). I cannot seem to drag it down so I can see the whole thing. I've tried changing the resolution in case mine was too small but it doesn't make a difference -- no matter what resolution it is, it's always halfway cut off and unable to be moved.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on these?</div></div><hr />
