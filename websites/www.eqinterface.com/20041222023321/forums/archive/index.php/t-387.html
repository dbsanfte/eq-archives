<br />
It seems to foul up my spell gems for some reason.  I've narrowed it down to your alterations of the EQUI_Animations.xml, but I can't find the problem within that file.<br />
<br />
Here's my setup as it stands:<br />
http://www.seaforth.com/images/~alan/interface2.jpg<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if anyone else had the same problem and how did ya fix it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Colphax</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having the same trouble.  Here's my set-up (posting a link, its a big file):<br />
<br />
http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Colphax/fullsize/EQ000009.jpg<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I'm XML illiterate, so I dunno of any solutions...:(<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure Wolfran's on to the root of the problem, though...my interface was pieced together with several different downloads, and I added them one at a time so I could narrow down any bugs.  I only encountered a bug with the last patch, which was Geddine's Target Window.:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfran</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the fixed version of Geddine's big ole target bar.  The fix I used can be found in another thread around here.  I just love cross pollenating threads and making people jump around, don't you :p<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem came from Geddine using a Animation file from his own full UI rather than one that was made specifically for this small change.  Other changes to his specific UI's Animation file caused spell gems to display incorrectly when used with UIs that didn't have the same change...this one contains a generic UI_Animations.xml whose only change is the one needed for the target bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaasper</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this is gonna get ugly. Todays patch gave us a new animations file. I dont know what VI added/changed in this file so I took the default and copied in the A_TargetGaugeXXX stuff from the original file. Now my guages do not work at all (I am using the target gauge for all the bars in my player widow).  <br />
<br />
What I get now is just the 2 end caps with no bars inbetween. If I use the pre-patch animations file it works perfect until I go in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
The problem is :<br />
A) VI added something that is conflicting with these bar styles.<br />
or<br />
B) I need to copy in more stuff from the animation files that the guage definations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I have heard this probelm from a few people.<br />
What I believe happened was I was using the older spell gems (the star like one)  I couldn't stand the humungeous ones VI came out with.  When I made the mods I originally had them with the old gems, but since I didn't think many others would be using it so I did redo it, just must have uploaded the wrong version.<br />
<br />
With the intervention of the 31st Patch I'll be going over and redoing my mods to work with the new animations file.  These I'll have available by Friday night.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah but I still have my buff window and spell gem window which need changes to take into account the new animations file.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deirdre Sadiqa</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anybody get this working yet?<br />
<br />
I've heard it may be impossible to get the mob number designations (IE a_small_mushroom73) back with the new patch, but the extra long target bar with the percentage should still work. I just don't know what I need to do to make it work...XML isn't something I know much about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Colphax</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bleah, the August 15th patch killed my entire UI...and I think one of the reasons was the mods I had done to my EQ UI Animations folder (both Geddine's target window and Wolfran's patch).  Bummer, I really really liked that window...<br />
<br />
Any ETA on an update or a cut-n-paste post?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took out the little lines that had shown in middle of bar and I copy and pasted some stuff from Vert's mod to make the bar show up a little better. I also changed the font to be a slight bit larger and yellow to stand out that can easily be changed to any color you like.<br />
In addition my background is bluish so that will show different on yours.<br />
<br />
http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/PsbTarget2.jpg <br />
<br />
Here is the file with NO EQUI_Animations.xml that has been placed in the EQUI_TargetWindow.xml, the zip also includes the needed target.tga file<br />
<br />
Pure Modified Target Window (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/PsbTarget.zip)<br />
<br />
Just place the two files to your favorite skin directory and load and have fun!<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
If you want the little casting bar included. I can add that also. Just send me a PM :) - The casting bar that Geddine had on his - was sort of odd to me, but ya never know<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
Also, if any conflicts to your current mods happen when download new additions you may need to just take the EQUI_Animations file out of favorite skin folder. This may cause more problems however, but most can be fixed quickly by copy and pasting info from the EQUI_Animations.xml file to the USED file like for this is EQUI_TargetWindow.xml<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deirdre Sadiqa</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Pure, how would I remove the yellow line from your target bar that shows increments of 1% of the target's health? With the exact percentage at the side and the huge size of the bar, I think the yellow line is a bit redundant...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently doing a change to have No yellow fill line and also another file to have the fill line as cast.<br />
<br />
Maybe even a third one that has all three Target - Fill - and Cast above<br />
<br />
:nana: BRB:nana:<br />
==============================================<br />
Okie :)<br />
<br />
I will try to keep this the least confusing as possible :)<br />
<br />
First - The Target window with No yellow fill:<br />
Target No Fill (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TargetNoFill.zip) <br />
<br />
Second - The Target window with Cast showing where fill would have been :)<br />
Target Cast Fill (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TargetCastforFill.zip) <br />
<br />
Third - The Target window WITH yellow fill and Cast showing Above :)<br />
Target w/Fill Cast Over (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TargetFillCastover.zip)<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
UPDATE: I put the zip files up quickly and I noticed w/o the target.tga file like I did the first post here. Sorry :(  The zips DO include the target.tga file now :)<br />
<br />
I made the bar sizable if you do not wish to have this option change this way:<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;Screen item = &quot;TargetWindow&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID/&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;false&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;63&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;240&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;424&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;60&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;Text&gt;Target&lt;/Text&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
		&lt;TooltipReference&gt;Your Current Target&lt;/TooltipReference&gt;<br />
		&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_RoundedNoTitle&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;false&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Closebox&gt;false&lt;/Style_Closebox&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Minimizebox&gt;false&lt;/Style_Minimizebox&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Border&gt;true&lt;/Style_Border&gt;<br />
		&lt;AlignRight&gt;true&lt;/AlignRight&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Sizable&gt;true&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;Target_HP&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;Target_Name&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;Target_At&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;Target_Percent&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;Target_PercentSign&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Screen&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Change to this &lt;Style_Sizable&gt;false&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt; <br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

I REALLY wish we could still see the FULL name of target as before, but seems to have been hard coded out :mad:<br />
<br />
I try to answer or at least do all asked of :D<br />

I'm using your target bar (minus the yellow line.) Being a monk, your casting bar is only marginally of interest to me, and I think I'd prefer it elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deirdre Sadiqa</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One strange thing...the pure target window (no secondary bar) is resizable instead of draggable. That means to get it into position I had to resize it one one side then the other until I had it right. Minor thing, it is in position now, just thought it was strange. There's no reason one would need to resize that window.</div></div><hr />
