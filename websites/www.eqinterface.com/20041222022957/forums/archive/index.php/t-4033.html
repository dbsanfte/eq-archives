Doesn't anyone have anything at all to chit-chat about?  I mean i'll discuss the weather, sigs just about anything that i possibly can right now.  But i do have one question and this goes out to anyone with a picture in the left hand corner of their replys.  How do you get your character look for an i'm guessing sig?  I'm gettin kinda sick of being plain lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
     On the subject of sigs....Would someone be willing to make me one!!! I have no ability when it comes to using photoshop, or id attempt one on my own. Just curious. I play on bertox server<br />
<br />
Vuartak<br />
<br />
edit. I also use Yahoo Messenger user:Vumadar if you are interested in chatting from boredom</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaherashadowwol</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, i know how that goes Nylok i have a daughter myself who is going to turn 1 on Dec. 28th.  EQ just isn't very easy to play one-handed specially when you can't stop clicking.. you've gotten better at boredom (12).  Do you have to do it through PhotoShop and if so i wonder if thats even on my computer</div></div><hr />

I'll just find one of my s/s when i get home to use nothing has changed much probly since the last time I took a s/s.  *shrugs* kinda lost when it comes to stuff like this.. wish i had your skills then i'd be all set, LOL</div></div><hr />

I hope to have my computer up in a few days, and then i'll be able to have an avatar *cheers wildly* Just wanted to let ya know if your still wanting to help, if not i'll figure out a way to get it done. Even though the helpful folks won't direct me to a way of finding out.  Guess i'll have to go take some computer classes to figure out all this stuff :)</div></div><hr />

I just wanted to ask what the questions you have are about the avatar cause I can easily shrink an ss of you if you want me to.  I can make the background white too...but that's about all I can do now cause my resources are a bit limited cause I don't have MY computer. :p</div></div><hr />

So can't get on eq atm to get a good screenshot.  Further more I haven't checked my ss to see if i even have a good one.  And lastly, can't find a floppy disk to download the pic too. I'm SOL!!! lol, hope ya liked that image all took me bout 1/2 hour to figure out what to do, but i got it right the first time!!!!<br />

I just found a pic of a gorilla that looked happy. Went with the post I mentioned above. Basically just trying to pull up another banana war, was really bored.  Personally still kinda shocked i figured out how to even get the picture to show up, although i did mess up on the &quot;quote thing&quot;  Didn't mean for quote to show up, didn't know i just had to type afterwards.  But you learn with practice. OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, went home for lunch comp is up and working, hope to have my ss up tomorrow if i can figure out how to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaherashadowwol</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If and when you get a chance, could you read the post i put under sigs and how i should go about doing so? I'd really like to try to figure out most of this stuff on my own.. but if it has to do with artwork i'm royally %KJ# cause i'm so not an artist</div></div><hr />

Whats the easiest way to get around to doing so? I guess i could go read on Tad's site.  Kinda outa it today!  <br />
