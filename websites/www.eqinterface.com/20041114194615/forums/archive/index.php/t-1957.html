<br />
Hi friends, and thank you for your patience and your support. Here it is, and I hope it will be working as well for you as it is for me...<br />
<br />
I have been quite busy in the meantime and as you may notice on the Screenshot, I have finally finished my Epic! Yes, I didnt think it would be possible but here it is... Thanks to my Guild who helped me all the way and to all my friends in game who made it possible.<br />
<br />
And now on to the Whistling Fists ;-) <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; NEW &lt;&lt;<br />
The UI should now work correctly with all the new patches, and not display any error message while zoning.<br />
<br />
2 new maps have been updated in the Atlas. The maps of Velious and Luclin now include a detailed view of EVERY zone, with locs of all important points. Thanks to mapmaster255 for his extraordinary mapping work, and the quality of his work.<br />
<br />
<br />
DESCRIPTION:<br />
<br />
This is a monk-friendly UI based on the work of Vertebrae and a few other people, then tweaked and re-tweaked to suit my particular taste/needs. Feel free to play with it...<br />

&gt;&gt; NEW &lt;&lt;<br />
This is still the link to the old file... My new one should be called UIGrygan2.zip and be available as soon as they let me upload it, and validate the file.<br />
<br />
<br />
INSTALLATION:<br />
<br />
This UI's specificity is it is custom built to fit in perfectly in 3 resolutions: 1024x768, 1280x1024 and 1600x1200.<br />
I am also providing the UI_YourCharacterName_XX.ini files, so you don't even have to move around windows, choose fonts, place hitmodes, etc.<br />
EVERYTHING is already in perfect position to produce (I hope) the most convenient and readable outlook.<br />
Therefore a bit of preparation is required:<br />
<br />
If necessary:<br />
0.1 launch EQ and switch to the desired resolution<br />
0.2 exit to desktop<br />
<br />
Install:<br />
1. Download the UIGrygan.zip file<br />
2. Create a subdirectory of your Everquest\uifiles named grygan<br />
3. Extract all the file inside UIGrygan.zip to this directory<br />
4. Inside the Everquest\uifiles\grygan directory, find the file UI_Grygan_41_1024.ini (or 1280 or 1600 depending on your desired resolution)<br />
5. Fopy this file to your base Everquest directory<br />
6. Find your own UI_Your CharacterName_XX.ini file, and rename it UI_YourCharacterName_XX.bak (just in case)<br />
7. Rename my UI_Grygan_41_1024.ini into UI_YourCharacterName_XX.ini<br />
8. Open your eqclient.ini file and change the line NewUI=default (or whatever old mod you were using) into NewUI=grygan<br />

But out of curiousity, is it possible to make all numbers of the good stuff big like your HP number? I sit so far from my computer I have trouble seeing the numbers in higher resolutions..Also, i'm not sure why..but when I did the renaming of the .ini file.. and loaded up EQ, the UI positioning didn't work for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grygan</div><div class="date">09-11-2002, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that's strange...<br />
Did you decide to use a different resolution than what you normaly use?<br />
<br />
I suggest you do the following:<br />
1. Launch EQ<br />
2. Choose the desired resolution<br />
3. Type in /loadskin grygan<br />
4. Exit<br />
5. Delete the UI_YourCharacterName_XX.ini<br />
6. Copy the UI_Grygan_41_1024.ini (or 1280 or 1600) from my zip to your base Everquest directory<br />
7. Rename it UI_YourCharacterName_XX.ini<br />
8. Launch EQ<br />
<br />
If it still doesn't work, let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">biella</div><div class="date">09-11-2002, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok I did this exactly, and it did work this time..However there's a couple problems. <br />
<br />
1. The timer doesn't show up. (i'm assuming I need to get the timer from the website) <br />
<br />
2. The buff window doesn't show up? I don't know why that is..before it would show up when the windows weren't working properly,  but now it's the base buff window.</div></div><hr />

In this window or right by it anyway, you have a set of 5 buttons or icons or something just under that window.  In the JPG they also have the numbers 41,35,16,50, and 20 with them.  What are these?</div></div><hr />

Poison / Magic / Disease / Fire / Cold<br />

<br />
To Biella:<br />
<br />
The timer/buffs/atlas windows should all be working properly... Are you sure you have extracted ALL my files (and only them) into a subdirectory called 'grygan' in your EverQuest\uifiles directory?<br />
<br />
Have you tried Alt+P (I think it's P...) to make the Pet/Timer window appear?<br />
<br />
Have you tried Alt+B (I think it's B...) to make the Buffs window appear?<br />
<br />
Have you tried ALt+W to get the window selector in order to open those windows, including the Help/Atlas one?<br />
<br />
Did you update your eqclient.ini to change the line NewUI=default (or whatever old mod you were using) into NewUI=grygan?<br />
<br />
If it still doesn't work, let me know, and send me by email:<br />
a text file of all the files you have in your Everquest\uifiles\grygan directory, and a screenshot, to my email address grygan@berenger.plus.com<br />
I will try to solve your problem.<br />
<br />
Is anybody else experiencing this?</div></div><hr />

Have you tried Alt+P (I think it's P...) to make the Pet/Timer window appear?<br />
I think the default hotkey for the pet window is Alt+F1 (not completely sure, but pretty sure). Unless you've mapped it to some other key, of course.<br />
<br />
Alt+P toggles the Group window, I think (stands for Party?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks friend, if you want, I can try to think of reversing a small modification I made to the orginal Vert mod I used for the player window, and find a way to show up the STR icon and value instead of my weight (which is probably more useful to us monks than to you warriors...). I will try and post that later today.<br />
<br />
To Arista:<br />
<br />
Eheheh, quite possible. Thanks! I allways use the keyboard over the mouse, but these ones I wasn't so sure about, since I allways leave them open. Anyway, it looks like biella solved his problem alone, so...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grygan</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This could be of interest to all you Melee but non-Monks players:<br />
<br />
If you want the same Player Window, but replace the Weight by the STRength for example, you have to open EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml an do a little bit of editing in the &lt;Label item  = &quot;STRNumb&quot;&gt; section.<br />
Simply replace &lt;EQType&gt;24&lt;/EQtype&gt; by &lt;EQType&gt;5&lt;/EQtype&gt; and that should do the trick!<br />
<br />
Now, if you want a nice little STRength icon, just download the attached window_pieces06.tga file and overwrite the one on your grygan folder...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks Great! Thanks for the little tweak :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Rename the EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml in your EverQuest\uifiles\grygan directory into EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml.MNK<br />
2. Take EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml.ROG (or .INT or .WIS) and rename it into EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Well, that was easy ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it's strange, I know the site has some problems yesterday, so maybe you were just unlucky. Did you register? Maybe you need to in order to be able to download mods...<br />
<br />
Please, how do I make it so that you can resize the windows? Its an awesome mod but this is lacking<br />
<br />
The whole point of my UI (which is why I am providing the UI_YourCharacterName_xx.ini files) is to have a ready to use functional interface as soon as you get in, with all the windows already in the right place. If you want to change that and move everything around, then you have to open the xml files and change &lt;Style_Border&gt;false and &lt;Style_Sizable&gt;false to true for all the windows you wnat to move/resize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grygan</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to let you know that thanks to you, my mod is now officially the most popular download in the Mix &amp; Match category, with 264 downloads as of this morning!<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
To celebrate this, I am now working on a new set of maps for the Atlas Window... But that is going to take a while ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kensha</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason I wanted to make the windows move Gryg is cus I am a social player and like having a tell window/melee window and /gu(raid channel) window seperate.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info on how to mod it slightly.<br />
<br />
PS, is it possible to make the atlas in the actions window with tabs? I like to use the help window for the loc help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grygan</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I already have 4 chat windows open in my UI ;)<br />
<br />
2 for melee:<br />
my hits/misses/me being hit/me being missed/skills/disc<br />
spells/deaths/other hits<br />
<br />
2 for chat:<br />
raid channel/ooc/auction/shout<br />
guildchat/say/tell<br />
<br />
So I guess you could probably change the repartition of the filters simply by right clicking on the scroll bar of the chat windows and adjusting the filters directly in EQ, so you can have the guild chat on the left, with the raid channels, for example.<br />
<br />
Is that what you were trying to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kensha</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope , not that<br />
<br />
I am one of those people that like windows in the place they are most comfortable. Also the targetting window was right in the middle of the screen on 1024x768 resolution.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Ive gona and moved em around to the right places.<br />
<br />
One thing I like about your mod the most is the inv screen attached to the hotbutton pane as well as the resists.<br />
<br />
One thing I dont like is the timer window, Ill edit this one and get it out of the way.<br />
<br />
One thing that still bugs the new EQUI is that to reset a timer you have to load a skin again and BAM goes all the hot key banks to numbers.</div></div><hr />

/blush<br />
<br />
Kensha, I am glad you manage to solve your problem, and are now happy with the result.<br />
As for reloading the skin and not recovering properly window posisitons and hotkey labels, a few people have told me that, and I am not sure why it happens. I am not even sure it is a problem of my UI...<br />
What I do is just let it running, and never reload my skin. I look at the timer and a little calculation let me know when I will be able to hit Mend/Discipline again ;)<br />
If you want to remove the timer window, the easiest way is just to delete the files EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml and timer.tga from the EverQuest/uifiles/grygan directory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The timer reload is not a problem of your GUI at ALL!<br />
<br />
Its a fault with the EQUI interface from VI by design. Lets not hold our breath for it to be solved.<br />
<br />
Again! AWESOME mod!</div></div><hr />

There seems to be no auto drop/equip window. I am a rogue and when things get PP'ed the appear on the cursor. I have to open a bag and find a spot to place the items which get kinda annoying. Is there one i am missing, or could you add it back? :)</div></div><hr />

A) You can't move the Bazaar window. You might wanna fix that.<br />
B) I have no idea how to make the atlas window come back once it goes away :P<br />
C) You might wanna consider making the black panels on the sides fadable so that you can have a wider view.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right-Click on the Bazaar window and untick Lock should solve that.<br />
<br />
B) I have no idea how to make the atlas window come back once it goes away :P<br />
<br />
The Atlas is hidden in the Help window. To make it appear, press Alt+W to show the window selector, and click on the &quot;?&quot; icon to toggle the Atlas/Help window on/off.<br />
<br />
C) You might wanna consider making the black panels on the sides fadable so that you can have a wider view.<br />
<br />
They are not black windows, they are in fact outside the viewing area. I am using the viewport function mainly because I don't like to read info/chat on a non-black screen if I can help it. I am afraid changing that would mean changing my UI completely...<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,</div></div><hr />

<br />
After my holidays and another week of tweaking the UI after the 16/10 patch, I was almost ready to post the new version...<br />
<br />
But it looks like there is another patch today, and they changed the EQUI_Animations.xml file, so I will have to investigate this further to make my mod work again...<br />
<br />
Please have a little more patience and bear with me, hopefully in a week or so you will have a brand new UIGrygan 1.1 released.<br />
<br />
And because you have all been very nice, I can promise you a BRAND new Luclin map with all the zones, an incredible amount of detail, and every important loc indicated. All on one page. Believe me, you will like this one...<br />
<br />
I also plan to include 3 different slider-type timers (one General of 1 hour, one for Mend, and one for the Discipline).<br />
<br />
Watch this space, I will keep you posted, and thanks again for your support.</div></div><hr />
