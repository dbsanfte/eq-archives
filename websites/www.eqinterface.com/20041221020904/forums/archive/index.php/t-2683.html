<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the last week or so, I've been having the strangest problems with my custom chat channels. It seems as though any channel I /join (IE, raid channels, bazaar channel, port channel ect.) are lagged, even though my normal chat channels are not affected. I get no chat channel messages for anywhere from 30sec to a minute, and then WHAM all the messages from that time period spam by. This is not only annoying because I miss /assist calls for a good portion of the fight, but also because if anyone addresses me in /channel they think I'm afk w/o telling raid (looks bad) I've convinced group memebers in the past to help out by calling the assist in /g after the main tank calls, and to let me know when I'm gettin yelled at, told to loot, ect in raid channel. I seem to be the only person on E'ci that has this problem, or the only person that's talkin about it. I have tried many different UI setups, and spent a whole tov raid in /default (painful) but still was having the same problems. Anyone have any ideas? or having the same problem? I know chat channels have been messed up on my server, but noone's seem as messed up as mine =(<br />

Thanks much ;)<br />

<br />
With Vert-2.2 up (with recent patches) my /join'ed chat channels just disappear after a bit (5-10min).  If I startup with the default skin they keep working indefinately. Additionally, once they are gone...they are gone.  /list shows nothing, /join does nothing and zoning has only helped once for about 30sec.  Keep in mind that in any case the normal (/shout, /say, /auc, etc.) work fine.<br />
<br />
What makes it weirder is that this is the EXACT same EQ directory contents from my home to my apartment, only difference is the hardware:<br />
<br />
Home: 1.4GHz TBird, 512MB, GF3 (64MB) (Works fine)<br />
Apartment: 2.4GHz P4, 512MB, GF4 (128MB) (Drops channels)<br />
<br />
I hate to lose Vert, but can't do without channels.  I've tried going back to a clean 2.2 and repatching up the line (about 2hrs last night) and nothing seemed to help.<br />
