<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">djteddy</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i know this question has probably been asked a hundred times but im kinda new to this and i thought i could get it to work on my own. Anyways i downloaded seperate files for each thing from eqinterface.com and i figured all i would have to do to get it to work would be to copy the default folder and just add the new files i want in there... that didnt work however... now im stuck.. anyone know how i can customize my own interface with the seperate files i download??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aleyla</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all make an empty file in the uifiles directory. Next all you need to do is unzip all the files from EQInterface into that folder. You do not need to copy the whole default files into the folder!<br />
EQ will use the files in the default folder automatically.<br />
<br />
Now, Since there have been some patches, and I am sure not everyone has fixed their files with what needs to be, so more than likely your files will not work, but I suggest trying out the UI once to make sure. If it does not, open the uierrors.txt file in the EQ directory. At the very bottom it will show you what file is not working ((example: EQUI_Animations.xml ))<br />
Go  here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5314) and here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6012) and open up the file that is not working in Notepad and fix the problem you find.  Carien has easy to follow instructions, but not everyone finds it too easy so...<br />
<br />
If you are not comfortable with doing this yourself or do nto understand anything, go<br />
here (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=30) or here (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=16) and request assistance by telling them what file is not working and what uierrors says and if anyone will do it for you or explain how to do so.</div></div><hr />
