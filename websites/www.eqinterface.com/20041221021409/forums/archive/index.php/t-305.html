<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorthis</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blury</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do the same thing.  As a chanter I can never let go of my mouse because I am always targeting things that no one else it so I must click on them.<br />
<br />
Since i always have my mouse in my hand I hate to let go to hit F1 to F6 to target.  I would rather just click on the group members name or my own to target for a buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arantius</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blury ..  did you have a horrible accident, and you only have one hand?  Or perhaps you need to use both for the mouse?<br />
<br />
Why not use the mouse with your right hand and hit buttons on the keyboard with your left?<br />
<br />
And to the original poster I agree with Gorthis, why?  What advantage does one box have over three boxes that are next to each other?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I guess that's why there's a customizeable UI, isn't there?  For personal preferences.  I personally don't like the look of the 3 boxes stacked on top of one another.  They don't fit together right.  They aren't the same size.  Their borders use up screen real estate.   It's having the related information in the same window.  Just makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
It's one of those, &quot;it irritates me and looks ugly&quot;.<br />
<br />
IMHO of course.<br />
<br />
I actually saw someone do it.  It looked really good, but they put too much stuff in theirs.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, I'm working on this one.  It's going slow because I'm in learning mode.<br />
<br />
Is this the sort of forum where users mock people for their ideas?  The reply to the enchanter was needlessly hostile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">figure out</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds like a really nifty mod. When you get it, post it up somewhere, i'm sure there are tons of people who would find it handy, myself included :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arantius</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well yes I give you that the stupid title bars are bulky.  You might want to take a look at the screenie of the interface I have made.  Everything is slimmed down and the target/player/group windows fit well together.  Though it is theoretically possible to squeeze all that info into one box, it is more work than it is worth to me personally.<br />
Edit: Oh, the target box is a little taller and it is behind the inventory a little in that screenie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blury</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the last place I expected a flame.  Is that really neccesary?<br />
<br />
No my other hand works fine....it is just always on the directional keys becaue i have to constantly move during fights.  Mobs are not always very coopertive on placing themselves where you can easily target them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">derailed</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah.  Us chanters have it rough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolelen</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, here's what I did. Initially I took the spellgem window and shrunk it down to two columns spread out so that they would fill the distance needed for the casting gauge that I added. (And then I turned off the casting window, of course.) I then moved target and group member gauges onto it as well. (Turned off target window and resized group to 0 0.) This means everything is right there for the clicking. <br />
<br />
I didn't see any point to moving my information onto the bar. F1 is easy enough to hit. <br />
<br />
And yes, I'm a chanter. Thats why I did it. As for hitting the other F-keys, I am usually playing in the dark because my wife likes to actually sleep at night. Go figure.<br />
<br />
I'd post picts and the change but I'm at work and don't have access to the files or a screenshot.<br />
