<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Over the year we have been open there are some authors that have written really unique and popular interfaces but later abandoned them due to real life reasons or quitting the game. We (eqinterface) cant update all of these our selfs and I know there are people who are fans of these UI’s that have released fixes in the Mix&amp;Match section. <br />
<br />
What should we do with these abandoned works of art? I need some ideas.<br />
<br />
To get things started in this discussion… should we maybe have a set time, like one - two months, if the author doesn’t update his/her interface the ownership can be transferred over to some one willing to update it maybe voted on in the forums who the new updater will be? This is just one idea… I want to hear yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">veeshan_darroch</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure a set time will do it.  Some of these skins, (like the one I just fixed recently), worked fine for 6-7 months through various SOE updates.<br />
<br />
What I think is very much needed is a new table of SOE Versions (which updates everytime SOE sends a new patch) and a author/admin only feature to let everyone know if the version of their skin works with the latest patch.<br />
<br />
Something like:<br />
<br />
My Skin Version 3.0<br />
   SOE Patch 1/1/03 | SOE Patch 2/1/03 | SOE Patch 3/1/03<br />
   Functional             | Functional            | Broken.  Please check My Skin Version 4.0 at this URL...<br />
<br />
It's pretty difficult now to know if any of the skins (even the ones updated within a few weeks) to work with the latest patch without downloading and testing.<br />
<br />
Then if a month or so goes by without a fix or an acknowledgement by the owner, to send an email to the author asking if someone else can take it over.<br />
<br />
As for a vote, I'm also not sure.  The past month has been a pretty bad experience for me in EQ without my favorite skin.  I'm thinking the first person who has a fix simply submit it making sure that they give credit to the original author.  I think ownership should go between the original owner and the the person asking to take it over.  It would kinda conflict with other websites hosting skins and having different authors.  Can of worms I'd rather not get into. :)<br />
<br />
I'm also curious if there is a reason to having older versions of skins available for download knowing they don't work. There are quite a few 1.0's, 2.0's 3.0's and so on.  Is there a reason why 1.0 is still available?<br />
<br />
My 2 cents.<br />

Our system doesnt know what files are modified or included in the zipfile. We could put up a warning that checks the date and if the interfaces date is past the last patch it will warn the downloader and maybe send an email to the author to check it out. We keep some of the old ones becuase some are easly fixed using the patch forum.<br />
<br />
We could reqruite some people to go through the files and test each one or put up a forum for people to tell us &quot;hey this interface is out dated please delete&quot;<br />

I'm not clear what your saying. The author gives the interface a version number and there should only be 1 version of there latest work in the gallery becuase they can simply update the zipfile with our new update feature. As for the author giving it the version 1.0 or 2.0 has nothing to do with the patches really. So when an author updates his interface correctly through our site 1.0 is over written with 2.0 but mistakes do happen. Maybe we need a forum for you guys to report this stuff to us?</div></div><hr />

<br />
also on a side note, anychance you would link previous versions from the current version.  Sometime authors change them for personal preferences, but other people like the old ones, but are forced to upgrade b/c of campabitily issues.<br />
<br />
Like in the Case of Delta 3.0.....I hate the new one, but I had to reformat my computer ..gratz network bugs of the summer.   And I couldn't find version 2.2 anymore anywhere!! I eventually managed to find it on a cd ..I had put somewhere (which I found on my like 300th cd ..read ) ...and was able to recover.  Then both got broke w/ Ldon and different people patched both 3.0 and 2.2 ..and people downloaded both!! <br />
<br />
People are not open to change...but are often forced...But if they aren't they can always try something new ..and like or hate it w/o worrying about not being able to get a copy of a pre existing version..<br />
<br />
Does this make sense what I'm saying or do I sound like a blabbering maniac?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now its up to the author if they want to support two different versions of their interface. It would be nice to have an archive of all the old ones the author did but thats way over my head in how to set that up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahh, well, what I was thinking is that you have that edit feature for authors to make changes to the file in question.  I thought an added question for authors to go in and say, &quot;File has proven to work with the latest patch without fixes&quot;.  I suppose it would be difficult to mark all files uploads with a default &quot;Unknown to work with today's patch&quot; and have the author go in and update it after testing.<br />
<br />
<br />
We could reqruite some people to go through the files and test each one or put up a forum for people to tell us &quot;hey this interface is out dated please delete&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I don't think recruiting is needed. (though, I'm not familiar with your user base), but if I'm guessing correctly, if asked in general, I think most everyone here would be proactive on marking things workable or non-workable if the feature was easily accessible.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not clear what your saying.

<br />
Yeah, just going through the list.  There is kenna.zip and kenna1.zip.  Only thing different is a background.  So it's not an upgrade, but looking at the file name, you'd think it's a fix.<br />
<br />
Then there is Delta3remix2finalfix.zip and Delta3remix2greyfixed.zip.  It's just a color change, but all those Delta *'s makes you wonder what's new :)<br />
<br />
I'm just being overly picky.  I guess there really isn't a way to make this easier and I'm not even sure if it's a problem.  It could just be me. :)<br />
<br />
Oh, Phatm226.zip in the complete sets/Fantasy doesn't work with LoDN.  The one I uploaded to Mix/Match does work.  Not sure how you want to handle that one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometime ago, I commented on the beauty and artistry that was being abandoned because of patching making a work of art UI unusable.  Too many fine, gorgious UI's have fallen by the wayside for whatever reason.  And while this is sad, it is also very inevitable for an everchanging program, in this case EQ.<br />
<br />
So, what can be done with all this entire body of abandoned work?  Well, we can all see you are going to run into storage problems eventually if not already.  So some of these are going to have to be abandoned.  But I wonder how many can be saved...how many have a realistic chance of ever being repaired?<br />
<br />
Hence I make this humble recommendation.  Save as much of the &quot;original&quot; work you can, those UI's in the Complete Set section, abandoning any work that has been altered by a third party such as ?MytkingUI&quot; or such.<br />
<br />
Second, alot of Original Work appears to be in the 3rd or 24th edition or fix.  Do we need to keep Versions 1 through 23?  Also some works have not been downloaded enough to justify keeping, no matter how beauitul they are.  Maybe draw a line where the amount of interest ie. downloads justifies keeping it for possible repair.<br />
<br />
And lastly, there are some of the original UI's (remember those..the ones we thought were sooooo cool when all this started) that cannot ever realistically be repaired without totally changing the UI to a point where it is unrecognizable.  <br />
<br />
And of course, if it was created by that King fellow, keep it.  =)  He does some pretty decent work and I think its all repairable if not already fixed.<br />
<br />
Now, I do have one idea, I do not know how hard it would be to accomplish.  But maybe create a archive library, where the picture of every UI is kept for future viewing.  This to at least acknowledge all the work done, but maybe provide us with an idea later of how it all started.<br />
<br />
Because when all is said and done, this is where it all started.  EQInterface is the home of the UI.</div></div><hr />

We are on our own server located in a datacenter and its just a phone call / email away to upgrade the HD ;). Currently we use about 5% of our current harddrives. :) I agree all can not be saved and would most likely want to save those in witch are very popular among the community. It just kinda hurts every time I have to delete an old interface and know some one woulda liked it.<br />

<br />
Maybe I misunderstood the statement I quoted above but.... We dont. 98% of the time the author updates his/her interface in the database overwriteing the old version. More information can be found here (http://www.eqinterface.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=FAQ&amp;file=index&amp;myfaq=yes&amp;id_cat=9&amp;categories=Uploading+%2F+Managing+your+Interface%28s%29#14) about this feature we added about 6 months ago. Some times authors accedently add a 2nd version instead of update there orignal version for that we maybe need some sort of reporting system so we can delete the old.<br />
<br />
--<br />
To get back on track. Would a system where people can report broken UI's and then those interfaces are moved to the suggested &quot;adobt a UI&quot; area after it is clear the orignal author is gone. Then some one looking to adopt the ui can have it transfered to them to update be a good way to go?<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
another way would be a CVS type system. That would be way over my head to program and make it user friendly enough for every one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's a CVS system?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not knowing what a CVS System is I would like to say..<br />
<br />
I think the former idea is less of a headache(for You).. <br />
<br />
You sorta already have it (z_Achive section) Just change the name to Adopt a UI..  Then make a forum called Adopt a UI..  Link the forum at the top of the download category..  People can request there what UI's they want adopted or their intention to adopt one of the broken UI's..  <br />
<br />
Also, Authors could post that they are leaving the EQ and/or UI scene.. I'm willing to bet, if the UI is popular, it will get adopted before it breaks.. User friendly enough for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcLite</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok this may be a headache like no other but how about recruiting a couple of people to do some emailing/IMing to find out or confirm that people have abandoned their GUI and it's ok to move it to an &quot;Adopt a GUI&quot; section?<br />
Then once they are confirmed Abandon-ware they could be flagged/moved to an &quot;Adopt a UI&quot; section.<br />
<br />
My problem with people testing the GUIs, is I've seen perfectly functioning GUIs not work on people systems becasue they unzipped it wrong or didn't follow the directions for installation or some other crazy thing.  They'll come back and vote the GUI broken whether the person is updating it or not.<br />
<br />
Also, what if it's abandoned and it still works? I know eventually SOE will get to it and break it.  :p   <br />
<br />
One other thing, some people are rather snotty about their art work.  Some people don't care and to be honest I hate to see someone whos GUI was considered abandoned and adopted by someone else, come back here and give everyone hell over it.<br />
<br />
In vBulletin in the admin section there should be a mass email option.  You may consider that for getting in touch with lost authors.  <br />
<br />
CVS would be a nightmare to make GUI N00b friendly.  Heck, it's not very Non-n00b friendly.<br />
I wouldn't want to be on that project. :p<br />
<br />
Well, that's my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">veeshan_darroch</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'm not too fond of CVS on a windows system.<br />
<br />
How about this.  Not sure if it's possible, but looking around here, it might be.<br />
<br />
Every UI/Skin has a Forum Thread associated to it.  On the specific UI/Skin page, there can be a link to this thread.<br />
<br />
People who download the UI/Skin will post in this thread about possible installation problems, or doesn't work with current SOE patch.  The owner of the Skin would be forced to &quot;subscribe&quot; to this thread<br />
<br />
The owner of the UI/Skin could address any issues, and &quot;admin&quot; that thread (if that's possible with these forums, if not, oh well)<br />
<br />
If an amount of time goes by and the owner of the UI doesn't respond, then the people can click a link telling the admins that the UI might be abandoned.<br />
<br />
If the admins here can't contact the owner via email after a preset amount of days, then ownership of the Skin Page and the thread can be transferred. (not the actual work.  That would still be acknowleged to the original owner)<br />
<br />
I wouldn't think voting for an owner would be a good idea.  I'd say the first person who submits a working version takes ownership.<br />
<br />
A side note, I'm also wondering if current authors would like to be able to create sub-authors.  Kinda like multiple owners of a single skin.  Could the site handle something like that?<br />
