<br />
http://tru7h.org/files/xzzyui.jpg <br />
<br />
Intended for people who want the graphics interfering with the game as little as possible.  Only windows I really edited are the ones you see in the screenshot.  Anything you won't be using while XPing (bazaar, bank, stuff like that) is still at the default.<br />
<br />
I use this UI currently, so it's confirmed working with the latest patch and I always have the zip file fixed within a day of a patch being made.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arba</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the simple UI put I have one question&gt; What is the Green % in Player and Group for?<br />
<br />
 I have also noticed that the mouse icon will stop working when try to click on something. Reload skin and it works again but then U have to redo everything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xzzy</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The green is for pet health percentages.<br />
<br />
I intended to do a melee centric one, but I'm already working on another project so I'll probably stop updating this one.<br />
<br />
As for the mouse, eh, I'm not sure that's a problem my ui would cause. All I do is rearrange screen elements, which shouldn't impact the mouse at all.<br />
<br />
The new 'project' of mine inherits a lot of this current UI.. but I went back and made everything look as much like the old UI as I could, because personally it was and still is my favorite. ;)<br />

Just gotta iron out the few final kinks (like the hotbuttons) and I'll be done.</div></div><hr />

The compass is in the top right corner i made it invis untill you roll<br />
over it. the buffs/charinfo/and group windows are all invis with<br />
0% fade so they're always invis with just the white text showing.<br />
Where my name and hp bar is there's an invis scroll bar that<br />
shows EXP/AAexp. <br />
