As you might have noticed all the download links have disappeared.  This is because the necro skin has a new home.  For those of you looking for LoY updates or for those wishing to try out the skin for the first time check out the new website at The Necromancer's Lair. (http://www.houseofswiftjustice.com/necromancerslair.htm)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is possible to use Abbatoir's inventory as a stand alone mod.  In fact that is what I have done.  Abb did a fantastic job on his whole mod but since I use the viewport feature it didn't really work for me.  If you want to use it stand alone download anyone of the three necro sets from the links in my original post and extract the following files to your ui directory:<br />
<br />
EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
EQUI_Inventory.xml<br />
EQUI_Templates.xml<br />
Wnd_bg_inventory.tga<br />
<br />
The .tga file uses the necro background that I added.  If you want the original &quot;blank&quot; file to work with and add your own graphics simply use the wnd_bg_inventory.tga file from Abbatoir's set.  His set also comes with very good instructions on how to add your own graphic.  <br />
<br />
The two most important things to remember however when adding your own graphic are to make sure that your final wnd_bg_inventory file is sized in increments of 64 for example 256x256 or 512x1024.  If you just cut and paste a graphic onto his inventory background though this is not usually a problem as the size is maintained.  The other important thing to make sure you do is save the file with a transparent alpha channel.  If you do not do this the inventory window will fail to display properly.</div></div><hr />

The timers kind of threw me for a loop the first time I used them too.  The colored bar is going to keep moving until it reaches the time limit for the particular timer bar then it will reset and start moving from left to right again.  The way the user marks time is by moving the slider to the point on the time bar that an event is set to happen and wait for the colored bar to reach that point.  Once it does you move the slider again.  <br />
<br />
For example let's say you have just killed a mob that respawns every 12 minutes and you want to know when it will spawn again.  On your one hour timer move the slider over 6 ticks (3 ticks on a 2 hour timer, 1.5 on the 3 hour)  from where the end of the colored bar is currently at.  When the color bar catches up to the slider 12 minutes will have elapsed and the mob will pop.  If you want to reset the bar before it reaches the end of its cycle you can do so by reloading your skin but this gets to be a bit of a pain in the butt and in hunting situations can be down right dangerous.  <br />
<br />
I hope this explanation helps.  Once you get the hang of it the timers are very useful.  <br />

While that is certainly a valid way to use the timers (whatever works for each individual), that is actually not the way the timers were designed to be used. The method I personally recommend is easier and does not require doing any math addition in your head.<br />
<br />
Instead of making a lot of general timers with 1- or 2-hour durations, make some task-specific timers for the things you want to time. Set the duration of each timer to the duration of the event. When that event happens, you simply move the slider to point to the current position of the bar (no need to calculate or move ahead). It will take the bar exactly the duration of your event to reach the slider again.<br />
<br />
For example, as a necro, you might want to time your current darkness spell, for example Cascading Darkness, which lasts 1 minute and 36 seconds. You would create a timer with a duration of 1 minute and 36 seconds, and name it &quot;Cascading Darkness&quot;. Now, whenever you cast the spell, you simply point the slider to where the bar happens to be at that time. The bar will continue to fill up, starting over when it reaches the end. The spell will wear off exactly when the bar reaches the slider again.<br />
<br />
The task-specific timer is the most typical use of the timer, good for buffs/debuffs, DoTs, abilities, disciplines, etc. However, along with your task-specific timers, you can still include just one general-use timer (like the ones shown in this thread) for timing spawns. Since spawn times vary from area to area, make this general-use timer a round number as Infectar has done. For example, with the duration set to one hour, each major tick mark represents 10 minutes, so you can use that to determine how much time has elapsed. When you want to start timing, you can either move the slider to the current position of the bar (like in task-specific timers) or you can move it ahead as Infectar has suggested. With general-use timers where the duration of the timer does not match the duration of the event, either method will work.<br />
<br />
Again, any approach that you take is great as long as it works for you, whether you use all general-use timers or if you use mostly task-specific timers. Task-specific timers are strictly easier to use, but requires you to know what you are timing beforehand. Also, as a side note, you should never have to reset these slider timers. Since they keep cycling over and over, and the slider pointer can be positioned anywhere, there is no reason to reset them.<br />
<br />
If you want to generate your own personal custom configuration of the timer, visit the timer home page:<br />
http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp<br />
<br />
Using the XML generator, you can specify the name and duration of each timer. The file you generate can simply replace the timer file included with this necro mod.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I REALLY love your UI mods for encros, but the Dark Purple is the same as Reaver Purple DL.  You got a link anywhere that I might get the Dark Purple set?  I like the pics alot better, as well as the group window being a box verti, instead of hori.  Any help would be great thank you!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Infectar</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blahblahblah,<br />
<br />
The color difference between the reaver purple and the dark purple may well not be that obvious due to the quality of the screenshots.  There is, however, a difference.  The reaver color set has more red in it producing a magenta color while the dark purple is closer in hue to plum.  If you download both sets and do a side by side comparison of one of the windows pieces files, say windows_pieces03.tga you will definitely see the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blahblahblah</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry if I didn't make myself more clear ;)<br />
<br />
You have the exact same file posted for both.  Well if the jpg's are any indication, the inv screens are totally different.  In the reaver purp there is a guy on it seeming to cast a spell, in the other purple one, there is a beautiful sunset picture waiting for nightfall I think is the jpg name.  My main concern other than that was the group box, which in the purple one with the picture waiting for nightfall it was a vert box, not a hori box which I prefer.  <br />
<br />
I was just wondering if you knew you had posted same file for both sets (reaver and purple) and if you did have the purple one, could you change it please? I'd love to try it out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Infectar</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blahblah I see what you are saying now.  Every version of the skin comes with the ArchLich inventory window graphic, the guy casting the spell.  The screenshot for the Dark Purple version was taken after I had started using the Waiting for Darkness background in game.  I can see where this could be confusing to those not in the know.  I will get this changed asap to prevent any further confusion.  There are several alternate backgrounds available for the inventory box that you can download here, Waiting for Darkness among them.  Instructions for how to switch from ArchLich to the new background of your choice are included in the readme file in each background zip package. <br />
<br />
As for the group window. It actually is not shown in the screenshot for Dark Purple, it may be the timer bars you are thinking of.  The group bar in the Dark Purple version is horizontal just as it is in the other two versions of the skin.  <br />
<br />
I hope that answers your questions.  If not just post here and I will give it another try :)</div></div><hr />

Hiyas!  I got everything working fine, one question.. What window is that LOC window you got up in the .jpg up top located at?  I'm not sure which it is also do you have anything special in the alt + m window?  I would like to use a map skin i'm fond of which takes over that part, but i only use it for maps that whole window but if it is going to cause a problem or overwrites the loc window (which Ihaven't been able to find) I wont do it.  Thanks for advice<br />

<br />
If you followed the directions in the tutorial you should now have in the UIfiles folder located in your main EQ folder a new folder that you have named something other than Default.  If this new folder is where you extracted the zipped files to then you are all set.  <br />
<br />
Two things to do at this point.  First, go to your eqclient.ini file and under the  [Defaults] heading make sure you have the line newui=true. If that is there, or after you add it, log onto EQ.  Once you are online type in the following command /loadskin &lt;name of folder where you extracted files&gt; 1.  Typing the &quot;1&quot; is necessary to keep your windows from being returned to their default postions.  If you leave it out it is no big deal you will just end up repositioning all your windows and boxes back to the desired locations on screen.  <br />
<br />
If you are getting an error message when trying to load up the skin and EQ is reloading the Default UI each time or it is saying some of your files may not be up compatible go to your main EQ directory and look for a file called UIErrors.txt and post the contents here.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully this gets you up and running.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Infectar</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is one other thing you could try.  In the EQclient.ini file under the [Defaults] section look for the line &quot;uiskin=default&quot; and change &quot;default&quot; to the name of the folder you created.  Whatever name value you place here is the skin that EQ will load upon start up.  If it won't load for you using the traditional /loadskin method perhaps you can force it to load it up this way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Infectar</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vnayan the only other thing that I can suggest is to scrap the whole thing and start over from the beginning.  Delete you folder and all the files in it.  Download the .zip file again and try putting it all together from the ground up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay two things, one is i've noticed I cant close the baz window, did you hide the X box to close it? hehe  I cant find it =(<br />
<br />
ANd second, as of the last patch I cant log in with your UI anymore.. can pick a char, but kicks me outta game when I try to log in with your UI, just letting you know though bud, I wanna use it! :P<br />
<br />
Blahblahblah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Infectar</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;x&quot; for the Bazaar window is indeed gone.  The very talented person who created that window (and it wasn't me) left the titlebar off to streamline it.  Unfortunately the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;o&quot; for closeable/minimizeable boxes is located in the titlebar and disappears with it when it is removed.  If you right click on a blank area of the window you can then select &quot;Close&quot; from the menu and this will get you out of the window.  A bit more work but worth it not to have to look at that nuisance of a titlebar I think.<br />
<br />
The last patch made changes to the Raid window.  If you have this file in your necro ui folder remove it:<br />
<br />
RaidWindow.xml<br />
<br />
It would also be a good idea to remove any windows not directly used by the necro skin.  There are a total of 38 files used by my skin any others can be removed from your folder and EQ will access them from the Default folder when you load up the game.  Doing this will help cut down on errors after patches.  <br />
<br />
If that doesn't solve the problem post the text found in your UIErrors.txt file in your main EQ directory and we will see what the problem is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With that said ... please tell me  you are working on an update for this one.  Every time I zone the game gives me an error about one or more of my .XML files is not compatable.  <br />
<br />
If at all possible can you take a look at this UI and see what you can do?  I have no experience with xml :(</div></div><hr />
