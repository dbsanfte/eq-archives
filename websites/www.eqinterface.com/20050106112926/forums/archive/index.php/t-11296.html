<br />
I have a custom player window that also has target info and group window (I have NO idea where I found it unfortunately).<br />
<br />
I would have liked to add the new target colour background tio it but I have been told that that only works in the target window :(<br />
<br />
I then thought I could shift the entire code to the target window, BUT the red 'attacking' border is hardcoded to the player window :(<br />
<br />
I hate hardcoded options :(<br />
<br />
If anyone has any ideas on any way to get this working that would be great :)<br />
<br />
p.s: tried attaching window but didnt work. It can be found here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your best way to determine if an item is hard-coded to a specific window or object is to see if it has an &quot;EQTYPE.&quot;  Any item not assigned an EQTYPE can't be moved to another window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The easiest way to solve the player-target window problem is to stick everything you want into one or the other, and then use the other only for the element that can't be moved. I just reread that sentence and can't undersand it myself... so I'll give an example.<br />
<br />
You put the target hp bar, all the player info, and all the group info into the Player window. You then resize the target window in the xml to be about 4x4 pixels in size, so that all it contains is the con color box. Then you slide it on top of your player window in-game... and poof! it looks like the con box is in the player window. You can do this the other way as well... put all the info in the target window, and use the player window only as a transperant box... place it on top of your target window... and when you attack something it will look like the border is on the target window. <br />
<br />
The only real trick to this is that it's best not to remove the original elements from a window. Instead, if you don't want to see them, resize the window so they are &quot;outside&quot; of it, or size them to x=0, y=0.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps... If you want to see an example of this type of thing in action, check out the Delta UI. He couldn't put the compass into the group window... so he left a spot in the group window graphic and simply put the compass on top of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you'll need to complain to SOE about the hardcoded stuff..  All of the things in the UI have to interact in some way with the server side code in the game..  This isn't a problem with simple graphic elements, since those are what you are telling it to use on your local machine, but for the gauges and buttons and all the other elements directly related to commands and info coming from the server, the game has to know where they are at in order for them to work properly.. <br />
<br />
They at least allowed some customizable things by giving EQTypes so that the elements could be moved, but more than likely there is some limitation as to how far they can take this .. (either that or they just don't want us moving some things) ..  The flashing red border on the player window isn't even an element listed in the XML for the UI..  It's a server side coded element.  So until they change it it's something you don't even have the ability to try to move..  <br />
<br />
Now the idea of overlapping windows works to a certain extent, but just remember if you click on a window in game it brings it's focus to the top (or front) meaning that it would cover the other window if you clicked on it.  So if you were to put a transparent player window over another window, you probably wouldn't be able to click on the window underneath (unless it doesn't cover the entire window, but then when you click on the lower window it would then cover the other window) ..</div></div><hr />
