<br />
<br />
With me playing a wizard, sight is my key. I need everything slimlined. BUT with the new charmslot comeing out, I can only see one Invetory UI that has this updated. Which I am grateful  for. However... if someone can design this for me (I am XML illiterate) I would be very happy. I am looking for something that has no garble, no nice little swirly marks or fancy whatnots. I want my invetory and that it. The charm slot presents a problem though.<br />
<br />
I love thininv2 however it does not have a charm slot. Is there anyway someone can update that one for me? I know its kinda lame asking for a mod on someone elses art, but I do not want to get tid of the mod, it rocks and suits my purposes well. I was also hopeing to possibly shrink it up a bit... but thats for another day.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

Sight is everything. I am not playing EQ to look at pretty controls, I want to see the game. Besides what is mentioned above about the inventory, I am looking for a UI very close to the stock elements, but smaller... much smaller. <br />
<br />
I am currently using the stock UI, in 1280 x 1024 resolution because I like the UI that small. I prefer to run EQ in 1024 x 768 resolution for performance reasons. Take a look at the size difference, particularly the buff icons and bard icons. I want them that small, as well as the hotkeys, etc. I like the separate elements the stock UI offers; I do not like &quot;console&quot; views. <br />
<br />
Has anyone simply coded a smaller version of the stock UI elements? I am looking for a UI I can run in 1024 x 768, or the next resolution up from that (1100 something), that is a similar size to the 1280 x 1024, proportionately. <br />
<br />
I cannot post a SS of my 1280 x 1024 UI as the file is too large.</div></div><hr />
