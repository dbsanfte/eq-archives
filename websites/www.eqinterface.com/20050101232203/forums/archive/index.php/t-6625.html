<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wbbuch</div><div class="date">02-13-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded Kuvasie's T. King based Pet window and I made sure to get the latest version dated 1-10-03.  It's available here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=864) .<br />
<br />
I was wondering, is there anything that needs to be fixed on this MOD since the latest round of patches?  My UI worked fine until I installed this, then stopped working and switched to default.<br />
<br />
Ironically, I tried downloading the earlier version of the MOD (dated 12-04-02) and it loaded up ok, but still gave an error message every time I zoned.  I forget exactly what the error message was - I forgot to write it down. :( <br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me if this is something that I'm doing wrong, or if the MOD needs to be updated?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

The earlier version, needs the pet sit button. The latest version was intended as an update to the original.  Make sure you say / said yes to replace the files.<br />

If you are getting errors, please post your uierrors.txt. <br />

Thanks,<br />

Ironically, your Older pet window (dated 12-4-02) will load up ok, but I get this error message on screen:<br />

Any help would be great.  I really would like to use your pet window - it looks cool.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelric</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay... in your UIErrors, the telling line is:<br />
<br />
[Thu Feb 13 21:15:50 2003] [Line:5 Source:UIFiles\Addams\EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml] ParseNodeList() SyntaxError<br />
<br />
<br />
As close as I can tell, line 5 is:<br />
<br />
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;us-ascii&quot;?&gt;<br />
&lt;XML ID=&quot;EQInterfaceDefinitionLanguage&quot;&gt;<br />
	&lt;Schema xmlns=&quot;EverQuestData&quot; xmlns:dt=&quot;EverQuestDataTypes&quot; /&gt;<br />
	&lt;!-- Graphics By: t.king --&gt;<br />
	&lt;!—- Code: Kuvasae --&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
If you'll look, in the last line, the 3rd character is longer than the other dashes; in Notepad it appears as a solid block. If you'll change that character to a regular dash, I think your problem will be solved.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: I think I remember Kuvasie saying once she did her coding in Word. I opened it up, it looks absolutely normal! Go figure :p</div></div><hr />

Really strange tho... I notice a lot of folks downloaded this MOD before me, and it's been available for a month now.  I can't be the first person to have this probelm?!?  /boggle</div></div><hr />

No kidding.  That was the problem with the 'original' second version.  I updated the file with the correct file and have redownloaded it myself to ck and it works fine.  Make sure your browser is really downloading a fresh copy.  That seems to have been a problem with a few folks before.<br />
<br />
Thanks Kelric for helping with this.<br />

Yes it would.  Part of my job is technical writing (not by choice mind you) and the key combination of &quot;--&gt;&quot; makes an arrow in Word.  That day I forgot to disable that feature of Word.  But to the best of my knowledge, you reloaded the correct file to the downloads section.<br />
