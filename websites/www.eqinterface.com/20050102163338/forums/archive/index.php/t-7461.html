<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TraleighRoV</div><div class="date">03-10-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok we all played with the armor dye's when LoY came out , but after seeing 150 million bright pink people i decided it was time to reset my armor to original color.<br />
<br />
Now SOE tells us that setting the Dye to 255/255/255 (white) will reset originals, BUT it didnt work. My armor is a full set of Living Shadow armor, its a True black, R5/G5/B5- well the dye color set only lets you do R25/G25/B25 which is a faded black and looks like doody- and setting it to white as SOE recommended only turned my armor to a silvery (SS) kind of color NOT the true black it should be.<br />
<br />
Soooo......, my question is , is there a file/spot anywhere in my EQ files that i can reset the armor dye to its original form? If so what exactly do i need to do? i petitioned the problem and a GM told me &quot; hmm, i have no idea try to contact a developer&quot; ha ha yeah right ! <br />
<br />
Any help would be Greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

At least that's what it's doing for me  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TraleighRoV</div><div class="date">03-10-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i know the rgb value for the armor- the UI color set wont let you dye below r25/g25/b25- and my armor was r5/g5/b5 im trying to reset it to original but the dye window doesnt do it-<br />
<br />
ill try the 255/255/254 trick see if that helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
255/255/255 removes color from the armor so in some cases, it will be a silver color.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For whatever reason, you can make 2 of the RGB values 0, and leave the third one 25 and it won't reset the 0 values.  It will make it a darker black, but it'll be a vaguely redish/greenish/blueish black depending on which RGB value you leave at 25.<br />
<br />
It looked the blackest to me with Red at 0, Green at 0 and Blue at 25.  Red is second best and green doesnt work at all really.</div></div><hr />
