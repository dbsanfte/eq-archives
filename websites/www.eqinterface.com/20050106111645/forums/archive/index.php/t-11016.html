Follow the directions from Aario ( Copy the &quot;TargetIndicator.ini&quot; and the &quot;TargetIndicator.tga&quot; to your AYA UI) This will give you the target Indicator when you select a target. Additional Info.<br />
I copied the NEW Options window file and placed it into my AYA UI. This gave me the new oprions and maintained the same general apperance.<br />
<br />
I have made some changes for personal prefrence to this UI but I find it ROCKS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TravlingMan</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently using the latest versionof the AYA UI. I cannot move, resize or even close (close option is greyed out) any of the chat windows.  Today when I logged in I had my two normal chat windows, however due to the option changes (new tell windows) I now have several more chat windows due to tells I received before I was able to turn the option off! Any help in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated. <br />

Thanks,<br />

Copy these files to your AYA UI. This will allow you to resize the windows. The option to close or min. the window, however will not show. I currently use 6 different chat windows and have them all sized. To use the new patch options window copy the Default Options window to your AYA UI. This will provide the new options and allow you to Turn off the TELL option. Ihave used all this with out any problems to the UI.<br />

Hope it helps..</div></div><hr />

The options windows was working correctly and I can now resize the chat windows. I had two extra windows which I could not close, as you stated, so I minimized them down to small dots on the side. Thanks again for your help.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
if for some reason it did not get patched in, how would i go about getting that file</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TravlingMan</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both files are in the default file of the Ufiles. If not there I would think starting the EQ exe and doing a advanced file search should reinstall the files. Remember you only want to copy them from the default file not move them.<br />
Thanks for the help with the windows problems. All are working correctly and I am able to move, resize and close them. Today when I logged on I got an XML error saying some windows may not work correctly, etc. I redownloaded the new patch and the lastest version plus copied the files mentioned in the previous posts. I am still getting the same error message when I log in. Any idea what happened to cause this error? I did not find anything not working correctly but then I didn't go to the bazaar, bank, etc to test those windows out either. <br />
Again thanks for all your help since I am such a noob with custom UI!<br />

Then I realized the &quot;Options&quot; window had been changed. Rather than go thru a TON of codeing I just copied the Default Options window to my AYA UI. This gave me all the new options.. &quot;Tell, Font&quot; etc. It kept the same general appearance of the UI and no more XML Message in the chat window..</div></div><hr />
