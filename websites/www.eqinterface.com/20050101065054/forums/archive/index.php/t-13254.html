<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sensei_geei</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently using the Vert26e Ocean-Spray UI.  When I do LDoN adventures I've noticed that the blue line is off... where it takes me and where the actually dungeon is, doesn't match up.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but I've recently redownloaded my maps and don't have everything marked.  Can anyone tell me if there is a way to fix this?  Or if I've missed a patch to the UI?<br />

I've been doing /bug like mad the past few days.  Now my druid can't zone with lev on or she gets stuck under the world and sometimes it crashes me.  I also can't use windows mode... I try and it gives me a black screen where EQ is supposed to be and when I try to go back into full screen it crashes.  Couple nights ago I spent 3 hours succoring random people in Guk because  they were stuck in the oddest places and nothing else worked.   I love the new graphics, but the rest of it is trying my patience :)<br />
