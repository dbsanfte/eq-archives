<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">been trying for awhile to get lag reduced in Ssra. i've done everything and finally resorted to using the default UI *gags*...<br />
<br />
is there any way to reduce the lag caused by user-made interfaces?<br />
<br />
I had been using Drakahtking for a long while, and then recently switched to an AO-copy i had made awhile back, still lagged me, so then i tried default, and i had no slowdown on mouse movement, etc...<br />
<br />
What can i do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">exidorgangleri</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I encounter video lag with my custom UI in some zones as well, Fear (severe) and ToV (bad) to name the worst.  What I discovered was reloading the UI after zoning in resolved the video lag.  At first I thought it was specific to the custom and just loaded the default, but as an experiment, I added the customizations piece by piece trying to find the source of the lag until I had the full custom UI again and no lag.  I have not yet tried being in default before zoning into these zones to see if its related to having a custom UI up initially.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Any how, What you've said has made sense, so thanks a lot for your help =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many UI's have resorted to larger than 256x256 tga/png files.  While many video cards can handle these sizes, some do not do it well, in fact in some cases, the simple act of cutting up those larger graphics can have amazing effects on UI/EQ performance.<br />
<br />
Suggestion:<br />
  Check the sizes of the graphics files in your UI.  If any of them exceed 256x256, then look to replacing that portion of your UI with a mod that uses the minimum spec size.<br />
   (If you are using the sonamod funky mana spellbook, you are using a background image that is based on 1024x512 = superlag if your card isn't happy with big graphics.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other thing to check is what your colour depth is set at.  If your computer is set to 16 bit and EQ is set to 32 (or vice versa), then you can have lag problems.</div></div><hr />
