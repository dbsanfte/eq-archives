<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I had finished building my new mod, but when I logged on tonight, I was shocked and horrified at how the game had interpreted the coordinates I used for the size and position for my gauges and my cursor.<br />
<br />
I'll just start with the cursor for now. I opened up EQUI_Animations.xml, and replaced the default cursor info, making it point to the attached file, and using the coordinates, size, and hotpoint info I labeled in the picture.<br />
<br />
[EDIT: forgot to mention that I converted it to a jpg since TGA isn't a valid attachment.] Go figure :\</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, well I made another dumb mistake, mostly because I'm trying to do this when I should be sleeping. I decided to change some things in the TGA file, and I discovered that I listed the wrong coordinates for the upper left corner of the cursor. It should have been 20,90 instead of 20,95.<br />
<br />
I fixed that, but the bars still won't display in the player window like I want them to. It's as if the size information for the gauges in EQUI_Playerwindow.xml is scaled based on something I'm not seeing. Anyone feel like explaining this to me?</div></div><hr />
