<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MysticGem</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any way you could texture the spellbook and inventory windows to look like the rest?</div></div><hr />

Would you want it to be slimline or standard?</div></div><hr />

edit: still messing with it.. better stop before I overdo tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the above spellbook is now released and available in the &quot;spellbooks&quot; section.  I have tweaked the animation for the &quot;done&quot; button (the blue orb in the middle)<br />
<br />
here is the file for that if anyone wants it.  Instead of a fuzzing or hazing it 'rolls' the glimmer on the orb to the opposite side when you mouse over it or click it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MysticGem</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the spell books great!!  But I'm kinda confused about what you said about the inventory window, I don't really want any modifications done to just some texturing, I like the inventory the way it is, I just think it would look so cool with your texture on it.  I'm sorry if I don't explain myself well, I'm lost when it comes to this stuff. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just curious about whether people wanted traditional or slimline (vert style) inventory.  I dont intend to make it wild looking unless someone has a very specific idea in mind.  I really just dont have the time.<br />

<br />
I really don't have a specific idea for it, it was just kinda blah, seeing this wonderful texturing most of the time and then seeing the same dull thing when I looked at my spell book and inventory window.  And since I could do anything about it myself I wondered if you could.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can provide a texture so that it will mesh with the standard UI for those folks who want it.  And I can also provide a backround that will fit abattoirs circular inventory that will look like the rest of this UI.  Give me a bit of time though I am a bit swamped :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Tad<br />
<br />
ps. as for the code.. I am about as good as a box of rocks for coding xml.  Best ask around how to modify quartz to change the hotkeys.</div></div><hr />

Per request.. fire and ice backround for abattoir's circular inventory.  Hope someone has made it standalone because I just check the mod in the downloads section and it DOES NOT work as a drop in for quartz.  BUT.. as promised.. the backround<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">10-13-2002, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my guess is there is something in the Animations file for Abattoir's mod that needs to be moved to the inventory mod to make it standalone.  I wouldnt know where to begin though.<br />

I just wanted to know if for some reason it can't be done would you be willing to do another one.</div></div><hr />

As for a fresh from the beginning inventory... *sighs* I already have too much on my plate right now as it is.  :(<br />

Pretty sure them programmers can make it work though.  :nana:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">10-14-2002, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well adding vert crystal meth's windows_pieces01 - 03 + the dark and light rock  helped a bit to spruce up the unmod'd pieces of quartz.  The inventory was still a no go for abattoir's circular inventory.  I opened the XML boggled a bit at it then closed it again knowing better :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I apologize for this &quot;mini-derailing&quot; but I just came to this forum for the first time in a while and saw MysticGem's post r.e. trying to get in touch with me.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you didn't hear back from me, MysticGem, but I never heard from YOU. hehe<br />
<br />
I never received a PM or email from you so I'm not sure what happened exactly...<br />
<br />
I think what might have happened is that you tried to email me after I'd dropped out of the scene for a while.  I kept my email address for Garryck up for about a month after I discontinued Haven (just to catch any problems that I could try to find time to help out on) but then I deleted that addy.  If you emailed me after the deletion you should have got a message from my server r.e. a bounce.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how much good I'd have done you, though.  I got so tied up with other things that I had to d'c Haven, and then after a very short lull that I produced the INI Copier in it was right back to the grind.  Since then I've even quit EQ altogether (out of utter disgust with VI), so even though I could certainly tweak some code I wouldn't even have a way to test it. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Anyway, I just didn't want you to think that I intentionally ignored you or anything, and I hope someone else was able to help you out. :)</div></div><hr />
