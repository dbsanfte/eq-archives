<br />
warnings really mean nothing since it gives you a warning every time it needs to use a file from the default interface folder. They really need to change the word warning to something else<br />
<br />
If the interface is not working and all you get are warnings it means its not installed correctly. Some reason it cant find the interface files in the location you told it to look. Check the FAQ for more info on common problems.</div></div><hr />

As an experiment I also copied the whole default foulder to my custom folder before I installed all my custon UI files. Now that file should contain abolutly everything right? Yet I still get those errors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenney</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there not errors there Warnings witch are ok in ui's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanolar</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then why are they showing up in an Error log? It can find the fill even though all the files including default are in that folder (no I dont normally have the default files in my custon UI folder. I did it too see if having all the files together would rid the error message.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Irontung</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had that problem also.  Not only is it looking for the blank file, but it continuously writes to the uierrors.txt file.  Depending on your hard disk size or free space this could be an issue.  My file after about an hour of play was over 27 Mb (yes Mb).  <br />
<br />
I still haven't figured out the problem, but it only happens on my laptop which has EQ in the path d:\program files\sony\everquest.<br />
<br />
My other machine where the path is d:\program files\everquest works fine with the same UI.  Weird.</div></div><hr />
