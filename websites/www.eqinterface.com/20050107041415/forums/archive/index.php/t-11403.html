I can see it, but it comes out like http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=59935 . When it supposed to look like http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/p.php?id=2793  . I have not altered the targetring.ini at all, just copy and pasted into the custom ui folder. BTW my card is an ATI ALL-IN-WONDER 9700 SERIES.<br />

If anyone is having the same problems and/or have fixed please post what you did.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moix5th</div><div class="date">11-28-2003, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont see why not, they both are pretty much the same, ATI vs Nvidia, 1 comes out with something new, and not long after the other comes out with the same thing. If SoE does favor Nvidia over ATI, its just wrong, 1/2 the people that play EQ are probably using ATI. I just dont understand why mine looks how it does, i've done everything that i can think of to make it work, all but re-install EQ and i highly doubt that it will fix it, unless some important file/files got corrupted.<br />
If i can see 1/2 of it, why cant i see all of it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look for the following line in each of the con sections (Trivial, Easy, etc.):<br />
<br />
TextureScale=0.2<br />
<br />
Change to:<br />
<br />
TextureScale=1.0<br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaye</div><div class="date">12-01-2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried this fix and it did help get the ring all visible.  The only thing now is, it's tiny.  It's almost like the new setting squeezed the ring into the small visible area from before.  I was wondering if this is the best it will be or whether there is a setting that would expand the size of the ring so that it's larger.  Right now it's so small that it's barely visible, especially on raids.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</div></div><hr />

Actually the cards (nVidia vs ATI) are not very identical at all. I work in the video card industry and the programing in each card are quite different. The pathing used in nVidia is rather straight forward vs. ATI's. ATI using multi pathing techniques to get the images to work by using less workhorse power out of its chips. Hence the reason probably why SOE uses nVidia's chipset formula. Less work on the programmers end to get the results vs. trying to alter the program to get the same results using ATI's pathing.</div></div><hr />
