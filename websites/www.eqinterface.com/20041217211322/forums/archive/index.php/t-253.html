<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chasim</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main is a level 60 monk.  I've been playing for over 2 1/2 years and have always used a gameped and mouse mainly - I basically only use the keyboard for chat.<br />
<br />
With the new UI, the hotkeys for skills (feign death, etc.) turn yellow when the pointer is over them.  They are also yellow when they're not available/refreshing.<br />
<br />
So, the problem is, for example, I feign death, the hotkey turns yellow, but if I leave the mouse pointer over the key is stays yellow so I never know when it has refreshed.  Using the #s on the keyboard is really not an option for me and moving the cursor off the hotkey is a real pain.   With the Rapid FD skill, hitting the key just as it refreshes is often the difference between living and dying.<br />
<br />
A guildmate suggested you could make a text box/tag on the pointer that would say when the hotkey is available - but I have no idea how to do that.  Could anyone tell me how to make that mod or just how to turn off the &quot;highlighting&quot; of the hotkeys?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faeriemage</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you need to do is change the mous flyover to use the same icon as normal, sugested script for it would be<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;ButtonDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
   &lt;Normal&gt;A_SquareBtnNormal&lt;/Normal&gt;<br />
   &lt;Pressed&gt;A_SquareBtnPressed&lt;/Pressed&gt;<br />
   &lt;Flyby&gt;A_SquareBtnNormal&lt;/Flyby&gt;<br />
   &lt;Disabled&gt;A_SquareBtnDisabled&lt;/Disabled&gt;<br />
   &lt;PressedFlyby&gt;A_SquareBtnPressed&lt;/PressedFlyby&gt;<br />
&lt;/ButtonDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
You notice that I changed both flyby items to be the same as their respective normal and pressed counter parts.  this should solve the problems for you.</div></div><hr />

I mean is that part of the hot button file or is there a separate mouse file?<br />
<br />
I've done some editing, I'm just not sure where I need to make the changes you suggested.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
