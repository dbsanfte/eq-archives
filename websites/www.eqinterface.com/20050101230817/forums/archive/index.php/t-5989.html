<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a big question.  The font size can be changed as i will show you.  But in doing so you may be throwing off the window and you may end up having to adjust other things with in the window to make sure things fit in the window.  But if you just want to change the size of say the CHA value you would open the window in question and do a search for CHA.  Once you find it you should see something similar(but proabaly not the same names)as the following<br />
<br />
&lt;Label item =&quot;PW_CHALabel&quot;&gt;<br />
	&lt;ScreenID&gt;CHALabel&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
	&lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt;<br />
<br />
Change the 3 to 4 or maybe 5 for larger.<br />
<br />
You will also need to do a second search for CHA again to get the CHA value as well so that you get bath the text name and number for the CHA.<br />
<br />
You will then need to do this for all the parts you are looking to change the font size of.<br />
<br />
As I said though in doing this you may throw things off with in the window and you may to adjust the placement of things with in the window to get everything to still look right in the window.<br />
<br />
If you would like you can attach the XML file in question and I will take a look at it and see what can be done to make them largerr and make sure that all is still looking good in the window.  I will document everything and give back to you so that you can see what was changed and how things were changed so that you will better understand for the next time you wish to make a change and you will more readily be able to handle things on your own.  My little empowerment thing.</div></div><hr />
