SOE has removed the NDA and that has allowed us and those in beta to discuss the changes that are coming tomorrow. <br />
<br />
If you’re an author and would like to get a head start on making the changes I have posted a rough draft. You can find this information in the patch forum (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15121). Please remember this is compairing the uifiles from the beta and things may change when they patch it to a live server. Once S.O.E. patches the live servers for OoW I’ll make the normal official posts with the changes as soon as possible. I just figured some would want a jump on things so I released the notes I took.<br />
<br />
You can also find the new EQTypes in the Complete EQTypes for Everything (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?p=78131#post78131) thread towards the end of the thread.<br />
<br />
Just a reminder to those of you that use custom interfaces that you need to be patent and allow a couple weeks for the author of your custom interface to fix it. I don’t want to see a million posts saying “OoW broke my interface HELP!!111!!??111” because its going to break many of them. Just be patient please.<br />
<br />
 :cool: <br />
<br />
Good luck to every one tomorrow!</div></div><hr />
