<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that there are a few people that have us in there address book that are still infected with the Klez virus sending virus's to people with the reply field of our email address. <br />
<br />
Please if you have us in your address book scan your system!<br />
<br />
If any one receives an email infected with the klez virus or any variant its not really from us. The person who sent it has us in there address book and the virus uses those addresses to help hide the sender information.<br />
<br />
Please scan your system for viruses with an up-to-date virus scanning program. Not only are you infecting other people that have no protection you are clogging the internet with unnecessary traffic.<br />
<br />
Kudane and myself recieve about 10+ infected emails a day. Unforanatly becuase Klez hides it self with other email addresses its near impossible to track down who it came from. You can only really tell the real mail server.<br />
<br />
If you dont have a virus scanning program you shouldnt be on the internet.<br />

<br />
I came back from NZ to my main system and found out I had Klez or some for of a mass mailer.<br />
<br />
After checking, I had that damn virus for 3 mnths!! Had no clue until I opened up IE and Norton spammed with with &quot;Your outgoing mail contains a virus&quot; message.<br />
<br />
It's true. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twylight</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll jump on this bandwagon also.  Every day I get spammed with this virus also and the only place I can track it to is someone who has me in their addy book from this site as I am getting infected email at both of my addresses.  Please get yourself some virus protection.  Another free online virus scan is below.  It checks both memory and compressed files.  I use it myself from time to time because it's catches things that my Norton doesn't.  *HUGS* <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kungpo</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Personal I wouldnt use Mcafee or Norton ..i have ran across a few viruses that specifcaly searches those programs out and annilates them ..Which virus you ask will do this ...Natas does ...<br />
<br />
 But i have noticed Mcafee and norton do do updates etc ..so they may have protection from this now ..but I am not one to Indorce Products etc but one Truely nice virus Protection and Prevents software i seen Was Ontrack's System Suite 4.0 it has a wide viarity of Utilities and Virus cleaning/prevention Tools included ..They also made a program called Fix Utilities which too was very nice program...<br />
<br />
 Some of the online Free scans i have seen and or used ..i noticed they dont scan to greatly ..What i mean is ..windows (98) anyway has pic files *.pcx etc ..which someof these online scanners doesnt check ...So the Virus will hide out in someof these files...One virus i believe did this was either Worm..or Funlove<br />
<br />
In my honest opinion if your going to do virus scaning...make sure the program your using will Throughly scan all files and file types..So if by chance you do have a virus ..your just re-spreading it and it defeats the whole purpose. In Short ..If ya scan ..Scan right hehe</div></div><hr />

My Windows box, set aside specifically for EQ remains, but is shut down :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye from my understanding ..most viruses are created using these os's becuase they dont effect the same way as windows OS ...I dont even believe i've even heard of a linux or BSD virus hehe.. My dealings with Linux ...it seems alot more secure ..if setup right..<br />
<br />
Anyone ever hear of a Linux virus or a BSD one? <br />
 I fiddle with linux here and there ..just kinda interested in if anyone has heard of any?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well currently to date, there has been no virus that has attacked Linux systems. So, by far, your pretty much on stable ground here. This doesn't go to say that their isn't one being created, but the primary virus victim is the Windows format. Consider yourself quite blessed on this.<br />
