Well, one of them, certainly :p<br />
<br />
As for the pentagram/pentacle, there will be at least one offered in the not too distant future (amongst various other target indicators) if I can ever get the darn UI skin I'm currently working on sorted out ... http://home.austin.rr.com/staci/banghead.gif ... mind you, it would probably help if I could draw a straight line (not even a ruler helps! :p)</div></div><hr />

For those who want to know, the pentegram is actually the &quot;Seal of Solomon&quot; the wise Hebrew king who used it's power to bind the efreet.  When the seal is aligned properly, it is an ancient hebrew symbol of a wise and very holy  king. <br />
<br />
It is when it is inverted, that is supposedly being used for evil, which is true for nearly all christian and hebrew symbology. :)  <br />
&lt;dreail/&gt; <br />
<br />
And yes, I think a pentegram would make a nice target ring, espcially for wizards and magicians.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be a great target indicator. Nice and detailed Gnostic symbol.</div></div><hr />

ARGH! No, no, no, no!<br />
<br />
From the site I linked above:<br />
<br />
Inverted Pentagram<br />
 <br />
The pentagram may be inverted with one point down. The implication is of spirit subservient to matter, of man subservient to his carnal desires. The inverted pentagram has come to be seen by many pagans as representing the dark side and it is abhored as an evil symbol. Fundamental christians, indeed, see any form of pentagram as such. However, these are recent developments and the inverted pentagram is the symbol of Gardnerian second degree initiation, representing the need of the witch to learn to face the darkness within so that it may not later rise up to take control.<br />

<br />
:D<br />
<br />
Personally, I like this one for a Pentagram indicator, and it'll probably be one of the ones I include:<br />

<br />
I have a comparable YinYang too ...<br />

(Edit: btw, I know you guys aren't saying the Pentacle, whether right-side up or upside down, is evil, I'm just mostly having some fun)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You did note that I said supposedly?  *grin*  While it has been some years since comparative religion, even I know that many modern religions simply declared as &quot;evil&quot; all that which was not part of their cannon.  And now I'm having a little fun. :)  <br />
<br />
There's all kind of interesting symbols out there from various religions and philosphies.  Some would make really neat target rings.   Personally, I'd like an eight-pointed star of Chaos.   Dratted shame that I can't even draw stick figures...</div></div><hr />

Very nice work!</div></div><hr />

nah I'm just kidding. I'm deffinitly going to try it out though. Its got a big monk theme to it though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i was just pondering whether or not there would be a way that i could make it a little more translucent. i feel that its a little too bright, so to speak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starshelle</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, as much as I liked it, I eventually stopped using it because the brightness was just too distracting. Still, it's a REALLY neat target ring. :)</div></div><hr />

When something is more than 20 feet away, I like to still be able to tell that I have it selected.<br />
<br />
With this target ring alone, I can turn on spell effects again so that I know which mob I'm on - at a glance!<br />
<br />
Please don't change anything!!<br />
<br />
An update is needed to bring the dark side back though.  GoD now shows the black as transparent. 8/<br />
<br />
EDIT: Updated and ready to go in the dowloads section! Woot! Thanks Ariania!!</div></div><hr />

Looking forward to seeing it. I hope you will make the ring itself a stand alone download as well.</div></div><hr />
