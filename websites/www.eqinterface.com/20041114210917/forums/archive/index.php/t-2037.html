<br />
You did a nice job With this updated ver. But did you fix the /Bazaar problem that was a problem with stoneangels ver 1.0 and 1.1 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lysiander</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I knew I had forgotten something... .<br />
<br />
I just checked and unfortunatly, the answer is no. The Bazaar is not fixed yet. And to be honest, I have no clue how to do it. There is no entry in the UIErrors.txt file when I try it. I also tried with fresh, unmodified files from the default folder and crashed as well.<br />
The Trader Mode works fine, but the Bazaar Search mode doesn't. :( (If ANYONE has an Idea what might cause this, please let me know.)<br />
<br />
So far, the only thing you can do is to load the default skin via (Load default 1) and keep your settings (hence the &quot;1&quot;), do your bazaar stuff and reload the skin with (Load StoneAngel2.0 1). However, it's a workaround and no fix. Sorry :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">09-13-2002, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Curiously i saw you had the help window listed in the Mod.  Is their any changes you made to it or would it not mess anything up if we used our EQATLAS Help window into this UI.  And what would I have to do to get the Angel in the Background removed fromt the chat window it makes it hard to read some of the diffrent colors in my chat window?<br />
<br />
Awsome mod :D <br />
<br />
:nana: :nana: :nana: :D :nana: :nana: :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lysiander</div><div class="date">09-13-2002, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only changes to the help window is the backround template, so it shouldn't be a problem to load other mods there as long as they don't require a modification of the Animations file. (if they do, you have to add the changes to the existing file, overwriting that one would make all grafics disapear and probably give you a bunch or error messages.) :)<br />
<br />
The Angel is theoreticaly removable, but you would have to do one of those:<br />
- remove the visible area of of the picture itself.<br />
- Change the position of the Angel to somewhere out of the screen.<br />
- Remove the animation as a whole.<br />
<br />
Or you just donwload the appened file with a way darker version of the Angel. Should be readable much better then. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lysiander</div><div class="date">09-13-2002, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe well that works too I guess. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackhorse</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How much longer? I would like to try it out.:nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ensure that you have the following lines in your EQUI_Animations.xml file--they should be right at the very and, just before the &quot;compass art&quot; section:<br />
<br />
	&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DividerVertical&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
		&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
			&lt;Texture&gt;window_pieces03.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
			&lt;Location&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;96&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;Size&gt;<br />
				&lt;CX&gt;100&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
				&lt;CY&gt;24&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
			&lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
This is when they made the price, name and trader sections in the bazaar window resizable, and if you don't have this line in the window will crash you when you try to load it. I'm not sure of the nature of *your* problem, but if this is it, I thought it might help:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lysiander</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casanunda, thanks a freakin lot. That was indeed my problem. I guess I just skipped a patch at some point and kept on using an old animations file. However, with that fixed, a major pain in my back is lifted. Again, thanks a lot. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No problem ^.^ i recognised the problem as soon as I saw it; it was the first time I actually delved into the xml file to fix a mod of mone about a month ago. I'm glad you have it fixed now :D I'm a big fan of your mod--although i'm curious why you chose to block up a large part of the screen with those big black things. I'd like it much better if they were more functional--or at least had more things on them. Or perhaps you could make them more wing like? I'm not a UI digital artist, so i don't know:P Very nice mod, and good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lysiander</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, honestly I'd like to fill the black backround some more with more options, however, im running out of those. :)<br />
If you have some ideas what's missing tho, I'd be glad to hear them.<br />
<br />
Basicaly I did the backround Stuff because i was pretty low on room in the first layout and wanted to add some things i had left out in the first version. The Wing Idea isn't bad tho, maybe I'll give it a shot when I have some time. :)</div></div><hr />
