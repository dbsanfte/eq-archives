<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ertaisi</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Included in my mod  .zip are files I haven't touched, there are files that I have modded from others' mods, and there are files that are completely my own. I'm going to try to give credit to the authors of those second sort, but I was stupid and didn't keep very good track, so don't assume it's completely my work just because I don't say it isn't.<br />
<br />
First, a pic of the windows that I modded from others' or are original.<br />

<br />
The loot window is completely mine.<br />
The inventory window is modded from someone else's who I cannot remember or find again.<br />
The hotkey window is modded from someone else's.<br />
The target window is mine.<br />
The group window is mine.<br />
The player info window is modded from Quartz's.<br />
The chat window is modded from Remelio's.<br />
<br />
Now, a pic of how I have my main character's UI layout set up. The area with the /who all results is where I filter my melee too, I just used the /who all as filler to show where the window was. I also have my fade set lower usually, but put it at 100% for the sake of clarity. The buff window, bag window, and confirmation box window (not shown) belong to other people and I have not touched them at all. I quite like them the way they are.<br />

Know when you download this that although it is completely functional, it is still generating errors in the UIErrors.txt file. I just haven't payed much attention to that yet. And finally, the file itself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ertaisi</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose I'm bored enough to talk about some of the features and reasons I made this mod...<br />
<br />
-The loot window. I hate scrolling when I loot my body. I would have rather had the window wider, but it seems that it's hardcoded in regards to horizontal dimensions.<br />
<br />
-The chat window. I like having the cast bar integrated here because it's in the middle of my vision, pretty much. There's a casting gauge window included in my .zip with a 1x1 pixel cast window...I'm told I could have removed a line from the main XML file and the UI wouldn't default to VI's version, maybe that's something I'll look into for a newer version.<br />
<br />
-My hitsmode window. Yes, it's large. Yes, it's annoying. Unfortunately, VI's new version of hitsmode makes it necessary since it no longer logs the whole 'You hit Soandso for 45 damage.' line to the logfile, it logs whatever is appearing on your screen. Because of this, I can't parse my damage with any other hitsmode settings, yet I like seeing my damage onscreen so I can't just shove it off to nowhere like that hidden chat window at the top of my screen. Yeah, there's a chat window there with my misses, others misses, others hits, etc. filtered to it for parsing reasons.<br />
<br />
-My inventory window. It's got the basics and that's it. The class icon is the auto-equip area. Want your AA menu? Hit 'V'. Want your inventory to close? Hit Escape. The Skills button wouldn't be there if there was a shortcut key for it...maybe I would put my weight there since it's not anywhere else. I may end up sticking that under my AAXP gauge in the player info window if it really annoys me not having it.<br />
<br />
-My player window. It pretty much comes down to the fact that I like having my critical stats onscreen because I look at them so friggin' much for some reason. I think I'm obsessive about numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm, I think that's about it. My XML knowledge was virtually non-existant when I started on this UI. My closest experience with it was a Visual Basic intro class 4 years ago. My saving grace was the tools I used, SidlWidl and the godlike Notepad. Thanks to Prachlyn and Oguler for letting me pester them with idiotic questions, and to anyone else who gave me help.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions about mah UI? Ask. Any comments? Share. Any flames? I'll laugh at you.</div></div><hr />

You should post the Corpse Loot window in the Downloads section, since people are looking for a window like that.</div></div><hr />

[Fri Sep 20 09:25:43 2002] Error: Could not find child LootInvWnd in window LootWnd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ertaisi</div><div class="date">09-20-2002, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally, the loot slots in the window were contained within another sub-window that is the scroll bar area. I extracted them from there and deleted the scroll bar. I'll probably put the scroll bar back in, except just hide it so the text file quits whining.</div></div><hr />
