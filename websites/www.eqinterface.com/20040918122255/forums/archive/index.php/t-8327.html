Summary:<br />
<br />
Should work in all resolutions, although 1024x768+ is optimal.<br />
<br />
This is a mix &amp; match collection with custom changes. Visually, this UI looks like just about every other Vert mod out there. The changes made were to make the different pieces fit together more nicely, and also to suit my interface preferences, which are:<br />
<br />
- Most used/viewed screen items on the same side of the screen: reduces mouse and eye travel distance for faster response and keeping important data in the same field of view.<br />
- Clean, aesthetic look.<br />
- Universal, should work for melee as well as casters.<br />
- Patch resistant, as much as possible, anyway.<br />
<br />
Features/Credits/changes:<br />
<br />
Target and Player window “switched”, so Target window flashes when auto attack is on.<br />
<br />
Vert windows, with thanks to Kudane and Sokol’s updates.<br />
<br />
Vert buffs, please correct me if I’m wrong. <br />
<br />
Nodent’s color change group window, shifted squares to the right to bring them towards the center of my screen and field of view.<br />
<br />
The 1,2,3,4 numbers in the group window are for when I glance at my duo-comp laptop, so I see at a glance what to tell my laptop’s voice command software (www.gamevoice.com) which group member to target, heal, haste, etc.<br />
<br />
Armengar’s labled bank mod, just moved the labels around to suit my preferences.<br />
<br />
Thangor’s Dragon spellbook. (click on left eye to close)<br />
<br />
Future Changes:<br />
<br />
Fix the white left edge of the squares in Nodent’s group window.<br />
Change Buff windows, not happy with this one.<br />
Change MP3 Player window.<br />
Realign buttons in Inventory window.<br />
Update Inspect window to match Inventory window’s layout.<br />
Move Pet bar in Player window from being under mana bar to under player bar.<br />
Change background graphic to Group window.<br />
Change gauge colors in Group window.<br />
Remove inventory from Hot Buttons window (maybe).<br />
<br />
My apologies if I left anyone out. None of this work is my own, all I have done is collected them and tweaked them, as I don’t have the knowledge to code any of this from scratch. Huge thanks to the entire community for sharing so much with each other and making it possible for each of us to have an interface we LIKE.<br />
<br />
Thank you, Sony, for having the forsight to make this possible at all. It makes the game much more fun to add your own personal touches and to have things laid out the way you like it. All other MMORPG games should learn from this.<br />
