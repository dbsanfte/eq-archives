<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antics</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, this is about putting in my own backgrounds in my ui windows.  I found a thread on this board pertaining to this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3694&amp;highlight=change+backgrounds), but it's not going well.  I've tried using the directions on this thread, but I can't seem to get it right.  I've tried putting the tags in various places in both the template xml file and the window file I want to change, but I still have the same result.....nothing =P.  I see that this thread is almost a year old, so is there a variation of this that I need to do to get the effect that I want?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcLite</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Antics,  Now I may have misunderstood what you are trying to do and it surely wouldn't be the first time I misuderstood someone.  ;) <br />
<br />
Here is how I change the backgrounds in my custom guis....<br />
<br />
Find wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga and wnd_bg_light_rock.tga.  Replace them with whatever you like. <br />
<br />
For instance.  I'm using a heavily modded Celtic GUI from T.King but I didn't really like the backgrounds in all the windows.  I found a skull background someone made (don't have the link handy sorry) .  I renamed the wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga and wnd_bg_light_rock.tga to something else  (ie. wnd_bg_light_rock-default.tga) and copied the new ones into the folder.<br />
VIOLA!<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.  :D <br />

When you want to change the background, does the file that you want to use have to be in a certain file name format for the game to recognize it?  Like in yours, the name was almost the same with only a little difference from the original.  In mine however, the file name for mine is darkblue_bg.tga.  Is that possible what the problem is?</div></div><hr />

I have to be doing something wrong =P</div></div><hr />
