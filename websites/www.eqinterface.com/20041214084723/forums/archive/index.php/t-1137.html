<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karaab</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the &quot;tick marks&quot; in the health bars and such, but my problem is, everytime I've tried to edit the file to add the 3 &quot;ticks&quot; in the first bubble and add them into the other 4 bubbles.  I tried it yesterday and finally pulled my hair out over it (well ok, I really didn't, but it drove me crazy).  So anyway... that's what I'm looking to do, but trying to figure out what I did wrong too...<br />
<br />
Using Paint Shop Pro 7 - I saved the file in 24 bit Uncompressed TGA in the directory I needed and made the change to the bar to add the tick marks, but it still showed up the 'old way' for whatever reason.  So I converted the original to Bitmap, re-edited the file, converted it to 24 bit Uncompressed TGA, but this time - it had the tick marks, but no colored bar.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something when saving the file or did I just goof it up pretty good?  Either that, or looking for an incarnation of window_pieces01.tga from Vert's UI with 3 tick marks per bubble, not 3 in the first and 1 in the rest :)<br />
<br />
Any assistance is greatly appreciated   :)</div></div><hr />
