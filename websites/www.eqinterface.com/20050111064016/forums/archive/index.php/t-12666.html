<br />
None of the tooltips work.. since the patch.<br />
<br />
What I mean is, Before the patch, when I held my mouse over an item, say a spell, the tooltip would show the name of the spell...<br />
over a spell gem, the spell name.. <br />
The big pain is not being able to hover over buffs to see their name... <br />
<br />
I do get the spell names when I hold down the ALT key, but because i am using a custom spell window,buff window and all, i cant see all the names. <br />
<br />
Now it does nothing. Any idea?<br />
<br />
Not tried it using default skin yet..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually we found that Icemagi's problem was that he was using a 3rd party program to run EQ in window mode.  Once he logged in the correct way...his problem went away! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendan</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, I too have had this problem since last patch.  And I'm not using any 3rd party programs to run EQ.  Went searching through my .ini files looking for something amiss but couldn't find anything. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xyrid</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have a fix for this yet? I have a few PC's I play EQ on. I have tooltips on some but not others. It doesn't matter which account I log into it, any I login on the broken pc are missing tooltips (and they have tooltips on the working pc). Some have GoD and some don't, but they all work fine on the working pc. All use the same ui, and I've tried the default also (and recopied the ui files from the working pc).<br />
<br />
No 3rd party programs either, playing all in fullscreen mode.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  I'd like to have tooltips on them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This appears to be some sort of file corruption in some EQ file. <br />
<br />
Try doing a &quot;Through File Check&quot; from the patcher and see if it finds something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xyrid</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried the complete file check, didn't find anything. Was starting to think it was a video card issue but tooltips show up if I hold down alt so thats not it. <br />
<br />
I finally copied the entire everquest directory over from a working pc and they are working again. No idea what the problem was, I had copied all of the ini files over and that didnt help. It's working now in any case, thanks for the ideas.</div></div><hr />
