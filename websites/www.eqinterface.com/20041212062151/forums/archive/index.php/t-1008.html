<br />
<br />
<br />
the default UI prior to the compass patch did not at any time call upon windows04.tga and if you had a mod that did, you need to get with the mod creator to patch the mod.</div></div><hr />

Guess I start digging to see which is pointing to the wrong spot.</div></div><hr />

Most people dumped their custom textures into window_pieces04.tga instead of giving VI a little breathing room.<br />
<br />
I used seperate texture files myself, because I figured they would probably expand the number of default tga files used after a few additions.  ;)  Definitely something to keep in mind for future skins being made out there!</div></div><hr />
