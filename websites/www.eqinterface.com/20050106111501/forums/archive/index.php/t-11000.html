<br />
I wonder if anyone can help me, I can seem to see my TargetIndicator - you know, the new thing that should be around my targets feet. It doesnt show up in my default skin either, anyone got anyidea as to what is wrong?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking, that maybe something else needs turning on or up for it to work, just dont know what.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any ideas or maybe the same problem?<br />

Theres a thread in the patch forum that kinda explains this written by Aario.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The really weird thing is that i cant see the indicator in Sony's default skin either, what other settings will affect this feature? Like the draw distance or spell particles or something like that<br />

Thank for replying, all off you ... it shows a lot of concern and involvement ;)</div></div><hr />

At this point, I'm out of suggestions for things you can try.  Time for you to head over to SOE's Tech Help (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Technical+Help&amp;number=3&amp;DaysPrune=20&amp;LastLogin=) forums.  Hopefully Roger will have an answer for you.  I've given him a heads-up on this problem in case they haven't heard about it yet.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and sorry I wasn't able to solve it for you (and everyone else having this prob). :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, straight from SOE's Tech Help forum, this (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/048018.html) thread posted by Roger Sewell:<br />
<br />
Question: Why doesn't the Target Indicator Work?<br />
<br />
Answer: TargetIndicator.ini and TargetIndicator.tga were downloaded via the patcher and they are in the EverQuest\uifiles\default folder. If you are running any kind of Custom UI Skin, neither one of those 2 files will get loaded, and you won't see the 3D Target Indicator in game. TargetIndicator.tga is not referenced in EQUI_Animation.xml, which means it is not &quot;really&quot; part of the UI, but part of the game itself (Yes this may be somewhat confusing for someone that doesn't modify UI's regularly). This is typically only a problem because at some point, you've run a Custom UI and one of the 2 files listed below, is reflecting that and causing a problem. <br />
<br />
Here's what's happening: <br />
<br />
There is a line in your EQClient.ini file that reads:<br />
<br />
<br />
quote: <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
UISkin=default (It reads &quot;default&quot; if you aren't running a Custom Skin)<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Whatever this reads, is what is loaded before the &quot;Character Selection&quot; screen when the blue bar is loading EverQuest with the picture of Firiona Vie. <br />
There are some lines in your UI_&lt;CharacterName&gt;_&lt;ServerName&gt;.ini that read:<br />
<br />
<br />
quote: <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
(Main)<br />
UISkin=default (It reads &quot;default&quot; if you aren't running a Custom Skin)<br />
GlobalFadeDelay=500<br />
ContextMenus=1 (1 = TRUE)<br />
UseTellWindows=1 (1 = TRUE)<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Whatever this reads, is what is loaded after the Character Selection Screen, but before you enter the game. Your values (as quoted above) may be different depending on what you have setup in the game. So, basically it works like this. <br />
When you get to the Character Selection Screen, it is reading the UISkin=default from the EQClient.ini file. When you log into the game, you are reading the UISkin=default from the UI_&lt;CharacterName&gt;_&lt;ServerName&gt;.ini file. <br />
<br />
So unless these are set correctly, the 3D Indicator Window will not work. <br />
<br />
Also, I've pointed him (Roger) to this thread directly as being the main thread on our board, in the hopes that it'll help them track down any other reasons that may be preventing it from working for folks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But no...that doesnt work either, still no indicator with both lines reading DEFAULT in both files.<br />
<br />
(not even with DX9.0b, which should be the newest)</div></div><hr />

I haven't tried switching to 32bit mode yet or tweaking the other options in eqclient.ini (mipmapping, tinting, etc.) but I'm going to if nobody else finds a fix before sony does.<br />
Anyone else who still can't get this prob fixed; how are you running the game?<br />
I'm running 800x600 under WinME, no new models, 128mb RAM, Intel 810e video, directx 9.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But... that being said, the &quot;easy&quot; fix for live server is to copy TargetIndicator.INI and TargetIndicator.TGA to the custom UI dir... <br />
<br />
Isnt that posted somewere? Thought I read it here... anyways, I cant get the INI file to actually change anything and im too lazy to keep /camp desktop and login to test it :/</div></div><hr />

I tried this and a few others peeps have posted and none of them works ... i still have no indicator, not even on my default UI.<br />
<br />
And apparently i am not the only one with this problem, other have posted far more advanced ways to get it to work (like deleting all custom files) and still with no luck.<br />
<br />
There is an issue with this indicator and since the servers are brought down today for an &quot;emergency update&quot; i would hope that Sony is looking into it.</div></div><hr />

Haliken, read what I posted from the SOE Tech Help board.  There are on-going problems with this that nothing seems to be fixing.  Roger is aware of this issue (I've pointed him to this thread) and I've no doubt that he has made the rest of the SOE EQ team aware of the problem(s) and that they are all looking in to it.<br />
<br />
Therefore, no, this thread shouldn't be closed, as it has been designated as the main thread on this board to deal with this problem, and this is the one that SOE will come to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having some touble of my own, but its different from most of these above.  I am able to get the target ring around the MOB to appear by copying the 2 needed files into my custom UI folders.  The problem that I'm currently trying to fix is the color that appears in the target window itself...its not showing up on my interface.  If I load the default UI, its there, but my personal UI won't show.<br />
<br />
I logged into the Test server last month when the changes were announced and fixed up the target window con to work with the forry UI.  I even have a picture of it somewhere on one of these threads.  The day before the patch I again logged into the Test server just to double check to make sure everything worked and to fix up another part of my UI.  The target window con was there and working properly.  I signed out and came back a couple hours later, repatched, and signed back into the Test server to find that the target window con wasn't working.  I've double checked code, graphics, alpha channels, etc. and can't find anything that would be messing this up.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is the wrong thread to post in (if it is you can remove this post), but I figured since SOE reps would be coming to this post to check on the targeting problem, I should at least put this information out there.</div></div><hr />

One of my UI's has a custom animation file. I did a search in my custom UI Animations file and Targetwindow file and couldn't find this line there.

Ok, I researched again. It's very odd. I just put in &quot;targetbox&quot; to lessen the search and not one line with that text included in it is in either custom UI. Again, the only place I see that text used at all is in the default TargetWindow files. It would lead me to believe I'm missing a huge portion of code from my custom UI's to get the targetbar coloring function.<br />

My target window wasn't working either (but the target circle does work).<br />
<br />
I copied the two files mentioned on the main news page of this website, but that didn't fix my target window.  I finally got it working by copying over one more file named &quot;EQUI_TargetWindow.xml&quot;<br />
<br />
Not sure if it will help your problem or not.  Its working for me now, although for some reason I now have two target windows.  Something in my custom UI file must have used some other window for its target window.<br />
<br />
Personally I think the color coded target WINDOW is the best item in this patch.  Its so much nicer than having to right click everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I was experimenting more last night and noticed something weird.  On the WinXP system at 1078x768, when I get very close to some mobs, their entire body seems to be very subtly &quot;flashing&quot; is the best way I can describe it.  Textures are set to medium on this sytem, which might explain why it's not noticeable on the 800x600 system.  <br />
<br />
On some mobs, such as the Priest of Discord with a reddish center down the robe outlined in purple, the purple areas of the robe flash and it's very noticeable.<br />
<br />
But you need to be standing immediately next to the mobs to see this.  If you back off even a bit, it stops.<br />
<br />
I'm still thinking it's coding for AMD chips possibly after noticing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mutley</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fixed on one of my two systems.  Read this in the Sony thread and tried it and it works for me on the WinXP system with a ti4600 card.<br />
<br />
Add these 2 lines exactly as is to your eqclient.ini file:<br />
 <br />
UseTNL=1<br />
Show3dTargetIndicator=1<br />
<br />
You may not have either line or they might be set to 0 (off).  Add them if they're missing.<br />
<br />
My file had UseTNL set to 0, once I set it to 1, it worked.<br />
<br />
This fix did not work on my other system with a SiS video chip onboard though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the second box I get a target circle, but it's got a sharp edge, like a tight circle around myself... and when I turn slowly with myself targetted, I get these wierd flashing things around me.<br />
<br />
Sony is saying it's ATI related... could well be AMD related, who knows. I'm gonna shut it off, until someone figures it out. It's pretty... but not THAT pretty. :p<br />

I'd rather know if the neat color changing target window background can be used in other windows... for those of us that have the target name on a window that's NOT the target window ( ie: HotBox )</div></div><hr />

Sony made a big mistake with this, apperently the files only get loaded at startup of EQ, not when doing a loadskin or switching toons on your account. Neither do 2 files get loaded from default when missing in custom ui, like normal missing files do. In fact there are no reference to them in the animation.xml at all.</div></div><hr />

Great idea, but ... the file shows that EQ tries to load the indicator from my custom UI and the files are present, but still no indicator. I will try copying a little back and forth and see if it helps.</div></div><hr />

I've copied the files to my custom UI folder.  My texture.ini shows no errors.  I've ensured that the option is turned ON.  I've added the &quot;tnl&quot; statement to my EQCLIENT.INI.<br />

Still no 3D Target Window.  Bah!  Any ideas, gang?<br />

Thank you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed something that may shed some light on this.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have an ATI 9600. I'm also not able to see the 3d Target Circle. However, while doing a Saryrn raid I found that the circle was indeed working... it was just BEHIND the world...<br />
<br />
<br />
I found this out because on top of the tower you can look out the windows and you have no sky or any object abstructing your view. The circle looked verticle instead of horizontal, and wasn't place under the targetted MOB, but instead it followed the center of my screen like some sort of reticle from any 1st person shooter.<br />
<br />
It changed color depending on target con, so yes I'm sure it was the 3D Target Circle.</div></div><hr />

Are they blaming ATI for this?  I have an ATI 9700 video card and never had the missing circle problem.  I also have an AMD cpu on an nforce2 motherboard using WindowsXP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally have a TNT2 card and so does girlfriend and we still cant see the indicator, but now SOE seems very aware of the problem and on their way to find a fix for it.</div></div><hr />
