   This is my first post and I but I have downloaded and greatly enjoyed several different UI's. I have an Idea for what would be the perfect UI for me. I tried to make it but could not make it work. So here I am begging for truely talented people to make it for me. I need this UI to work for 1028 by 764 (i think thats the numbers but cannot remember and I am kinda stupid when it comes to this stuff) Well.....Here Goes:<br />
Horizontal and thin EVERYTHING. Divided into 2 parts. Spells (with the names not just the gem icons. Bags, Hotkeys, and clickies on the bottom. Then Stats, saves, buffs, songs, compass, and toolbar icon on the top. That leaves room for 2 or 3 chat windows (I use 3) just above or just below the two horizontal bars. Also need a pet window and would prefer it to be on the bottom as well. <br />
<br />
Well thats it. If anyone can make one like this or help me make one please let me know. Many thanks and I greatly appreciate any time and attention to this post and request.</div></div><hr />
