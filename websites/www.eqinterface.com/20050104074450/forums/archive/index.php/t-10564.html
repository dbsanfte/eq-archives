<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neori</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Earlier today I was getting a port from DL to NK from a guildmate, and sometime during loading into NK, my game crashed.  Usually I can just restart EQ with no problems, and I wanted to see if this was another time like that.<br />
<br />
When I got back in, the game was using the default UI instead of my usual one (one of the newest Vert mods, and I've had no problems at all using it).  I told it to reload the UI (leaving the &quot;use INI&quot; setting on, e.g. the &quot;1&quot; switch).  It reloaded but had all the windows back in the default positions.  Also, all my hotkeys and socials were set to default.<br />
<br />
I logged out and looked in my game directory.  I found in addition to my usual &lt;charactername&gt;_&lt;servername&gt;.ini file, I also had one like this: &lt;charactername&gt;_.ini with no server name after the underscore.  The same happened with the UI_&lt;charname&gt;_&lt;servername&gt;.ini file.<br />
<br />
I rebooted to clear whatever problems might have caused EQ to fail, then renamed the strange INI files so EQ wouldn't try to load from them, and went back in.  Everything was back to normal.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what might have caused this?</div></div><hr />

I deleted those files the other day when that happened to me, and I had backup files I put back in. Really hope they are fixing this, its a royal pain.</div></div><hr />
