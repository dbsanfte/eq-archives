<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askyn</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
 Thanks for reading this, I know NOTHING about xml .. <br />
<br />
 I was wonderinging if the following sounds good? Its what im REALLY looking for in a Player window.<br />
<br />
 Text example below:<br />
<br />
Player first name                     curHP / maxHP<br />
-------- Line or Blank line<br />
Player HP bar                           HP%  / PetHP %<br />
Pet HP bar  (combined on same bar as Player HP?)<br />
Mana Bar                                  mana %<br />
Air Bar                                       Air %<br />
-------- Line or Blank line<br />
AC: ac%     WT: weight%     XP: xp%     AAxp: aaxp%<br />
-------- line or Blank line<br />
Button         Button            Button                Button<br />
Pet Attack    Pet Backoff     Pet Guardhere   Pet Guardme<br />
<br />
<br />
To me that would be I think the ideal player bar, as I like to play a Necro &amp; Monk both. I would like to have ONE player window to get use to so that it looks the same when I play either, that way I dont have to retrain what im looking at / for.<br />
<br />
 Finally a question, I see a LOT of the new player windows with STA bars, why? I mean  ... for the most part if im down to zero sta there isnt a LOT i can do, and if im over 100 in sta there isnt much that I would have to worry about any way right?<br />
<br />
 thank you VERY much for considering to help me .. if I can get feed back on the above suggestion I would LOVE it.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm currently looking at creating a profile that will fit a Necro, Bard, Shaman and my primary, Monk.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you mean by the button button button part at the end there, but I see that it might be a bit much just for a Player window. Don't you think?<br />
<br />
As far as the STA bar, if you look around, it's been 86'd on most, if not all, UI mods out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I wanted 4 buttons at the bottom for pet control, one buttone for each of these:<br />
<br />
 Pet Attack<br />
 Pet Back off<br />
 Pet Guard Here<br />
 Pet Guard me / Pet follow me (same thing)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alshain</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not possible to add or remove buttons into a window.  The code to manage the buttons is hard coded into the new EQ Interface.  Removing a button causes UI errors on loading as the code looks for a button and doesn't find it.  Adding a button doesn't do anything as the code to manage the button press isn't there.  It is possible to add the other stuff you have requested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askyn</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK =)<br />
<br />
 buttons would have been iceing on the cake but the rest is what would really make it for me in the long run =)<br />
<br />
 Thanks for the comments =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askyn</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OR .. something i just thought of.<br />
<br />
 Change the PET Window to the above list of stuff.<br />
<br />
 BUT, make all but the requested buttons 1pixel x1pixel?<br />
<br />
 That way, you can have the basic buttons, move them to take up minumal space, and have all the other info still.</div></div><hr />
