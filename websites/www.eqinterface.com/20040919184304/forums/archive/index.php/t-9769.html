We are planning for final release the day after (or the day of) LDoN release.<br />
<br />
Here is the preview of the Look The Preview (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?s=&amp;id=2226)<br />
<br />
You can find the beta file availble for Download HERE (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2226)<br />
<br />
Please test and give feedback... we are looking for any lag issues, and or other graphic glitches..<br />
<br />
there is an OPTIONS Folder that has the  the melee only player window.. to use just copy the XML file you want into the main folder.. overwriting what ever is there.. our TGAs have both graphics in them for ease of changing this<br />
<br />
CCake is in the folder by the same name, this is used to configure the TWO tabs of clickies on the right of hotbuttons.<br />
<br />
BETA AGREEMENT<br />
Please understand that this is a beta release to find bugs and complications. No request for &quot;mods&quot; or other colors to this will be taken at this time.  Also please do not submit any modified version of Solaria to the mix-n-match section. They will not be approved.  You may submit these after the beta is over.

You look as if you could fit 4 more boxes in there - would be great as you could have full access to all of your inventory slots, primary, secondary, range, ammo, and 2 clicky slots :)  <br />
<br />
the reason we didnt add more clickies (we could) was that CCAKE only works with the number of slots that we have now. If we added any, it would no longer work properly. <br />
<br />
though it is an idea worth looking into, maybe we could put some &quot;static&quot; slots there that would never change... (primary, secondary, range, ammo) and then you could put something different in the clickies above it with CCAKE.. <br />
<br />
will have to look and see what we can do.. but to be honest its really important that CCAKE continue to work (it saves sokol and i tons of coding) at least till we find someone who can write another version.<br />
<br />
thanks for the feedback keep it comin!<br />

<br />
However, if some one has .net either C# or VB.net experience, and is a competent BORED programmer, either email me, or PM me I'd like to talk some ideas over with you.<br />
<br />
Any way I think a timer is a good idea, havent ever even looked into them, but I'll play with them some.<br />

we don't have a modified Guild window, you were using the same window in both because its pulled from the default<br />

CORRECT! we said long ago that we were switching that to Pet first and Melee 2nd. it shouldn't switch back and forth, but if it is. we will see if there is anything we can do.<br />

Actualy I think I'll add a melee option in the options folder to keep the info first, I prefer it that way my self. And I play a Pet class as my main... Look for it in the next release to be info first pet second in the options folder for melees/ non-pet users.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Setanta</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been using this UI since you released the Beta. I have to say I do enjoy this UI.<br />
<br />
The features I like:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Clear, easy to use spell book<br />
 Buff slots with names<br />
 Pet control nicely constructed<br />
 CCake is da bizness!! (there are more than enough slots for my liking - can use full inventory if I need to change everything)<br />
 Actions and hotbuttons are comparitively large - easy to get to<br />
 There's no timer - good for me coz I have my own already set up<br />
 <br />
<br />
The features I'd like to see changed (cosmetic issues)<br />
<br />
<br />
 Party pet health *REAL* small - pets and warders tend to die a lot<br />
 Default spell .tga's are the pits<br />
 <br />
<br />
The features I had problems with (showstoppers)<br />
<br />
<br />
 On the char select screen, the DELETE button sits right next to the QUIT button. Easy to misclick and good for a momentary heartattack!<br />
 <br />
<br />
Like I say, great job - this is a fab UI. Can't wait to see the final release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only 6 images looped if you just use a count down, also looking over the timers, there is no way to re-start/stop the timer short of<br />
releading the UI. I may make a vertical timer Mod later, but for the standard Solaria it will not have a timer. As for making the hotbuttosn full size, we shrank the window to 155 width to compliment every other window. And as stated the original Vert 2.5 hotbutton will still work just fine, as will my horizontal hotbutton mod which I still use to this day. :)<br />
<br />
-Sokol<br />
<br />
Now I just started looking over timers, and as I said I may make a mod for one, but right now it wont be a Solaria Default.</div></div><hr />

The problem is, that the TGA's in your hotbutton file are still set to windows_pieces07.tga or 06 .tga I will be updating Vert from 2.5 to 2.6 as soon as LDoN is released, so I know I have all the changes, but for now use this zip. It's the default Vert 2.6 &lt;--&lt;&lt;<br />

My only questions are (and i apologize if they have been addressed already):<br />
<br />
1. Will there be a small icon spell gem set? 4x2?<br />
2. Will there be a few different color schemes like Vert?<br />
3. How do you move the cast time bar? i'm used to it being in my spell gems and when i load the vert 4x2 into solaria i'm still stuck with the cast time bar in the middle top of my screen.<br />
4. Is there to shrink the Inventory/Bags/Bank/Trade/etc down to the size of the Hotkey Inv slots? I use EQW set at 1018x715 to fit on my 1024x768 desktop (LCD so thats as big as it gets for me)... so EQ screen space is at a premium for me and i have problems fitting stuff onto my screen and keeping up visibility. maybe have the windows containing the slots shrunk down too?<br />
<br />
Sorry if my questions are 'gimme gimme', i'm a total user ;) its easy for me to sit here and shoot off requests :p anyways, great job guys... i've tried a few other UIs, but none are as clean and user friendly as yours... not to mention how slick the UIs always look. thx again from a loyal fan, lmk if that stuff is possible/in the works :D<br />

Personally, I wish all UI modders would keep EVERY item slot at 40x40 since those are the dimensions of the item graphic and prevents distortion. But, that's never gonna happen.<br />

<br />
Now now if every one kept everythign default we wouldn't have custom UI's?<br />
<br />
Besides if you want the Vert 2.x Hotbutton window, I've uploaded one that works with Soalria till I update Vert to 2.6 (Which is done justw aiting to see if LDoN has any more surprises :)<br />

Also, the Horizontal HB mod with ALL inv slots on it is still avail at<br />

<br />
<br />
 Positive and negative boxes on the compass (to figure out /loc)<br />
 4 more clicky boxes under the 8, make em Primary/Secondary/Range/Ammo so CCake still works<br />
 Moving Pet Get Lost where Pet Attack is (alone on the side so you don't click it by accident)<br />
 Stretching out the pet health bar all the way to the other side of the window, or adding a % counter (if one exists for pets)<br />
 <br />

Also I don't like the title bars above the chat windows... just a personal thing though.<br />

Been using vert since it came out, and plan on using Solaria. My suggestions-<br />
<br />
<br />
 Positive and negative boxes on the compass (to figure out /loc)<br />
 4 more clicky boxes under the 8, make em Primary/Secondary/Range/Ammo so CCake still works<br />
 Moving Pet Get Lost where Pet Attack is (alone on the side so you don't click it by accident)<br />
 Stretching out the pet health bar all the way to the other side of the window, or adding a % counter (if one exists for pets)<br />
 <br />
<br />
Also I don't like the title bars above the chat windows... just a personal thing though.<br />
<br />
Looking good so far!  <br />
<br />
<br />
1. To increase the visible area of the compass we removed the red/green that was this function, for two reasons.. ONE. with the ingame map, you can now load a layer that is the loc grid, and it will show you in REAL TIME which way your going (maps.eq-toolbox.com for that add on).  TWO. LDoN adds a feature that puts a marker on the compass to show you which way to your dungeon when your in the zone with the entrance.  <br />
<br />
2. if we add boxes there, CCake will not work anymore, its based on # of lines of code, if we add or subtract it will mess it up. We are looking into the best way to use these blank spot, and if we can find a way to get CCake to work AND add slots, we may do that. But, we are also looking at adding some player info there.<br />
<br />
3. We will look at the button move you mentioned, might be able to work on that one.  first we have ever heard of it.<br />
<br />
4. the addition of the small green bar for pet health is more for awareness, and target-ablitly. Its there to make it easy to target the pet, if we returned it  to the &quot;1 pix green line&quot; that it was it would be much harder to use. I promise you get use to watching the pet bar at the smaller size, just takes a little time.<br />
<br />
And lastly, sorry you dont like chat window bars, cant move the window very easily without it.. sooo you may want to turn it off in all of yours.. but as default you will see it to &quot;on&quot;..</div></div><hr />

<br />
My main is a wizard, and I have a familiar up at all times.  However, because the graphic is quite annoying, I issue a /pet get lost as soon as I enter a new zone.  This of course makes the pet window disappear, which wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that the player stats are on the same window.  I like to be able to see, at minimum, my resists at a glance, and because I'm supremely lazy I'd prefer not to have to bring the pet window back up each time I kill the familiar.   Are there any mods that will solve my problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jentraal</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way to get around this is to find a mod that has your stats somewhere other than  the pet window.  There are lots out there and I believe I even saw one with Vert that put the stats on the hotkey window.  <br />

- Open your options window.<br />
- It should be on the &quot;General&quot; tab, if it isn't, click it.<br />
- Find the button &quot;Pet Window Popup&quot; and make sure it ISN'T pressed.<br />

Sorry to be misleading. I mean I also did that. The first thing I did was to download a fresh version and put it into a new folder onto my PC to check it, then I got onto her computer and did the same thing, and what you see is still happening. :( <br />
<br />
She doesn't mind because she's used to Vert anyway, but that fact that something is wrong bugs me (I'm a perfectionist :p )</div></div><hr />

Yes, some how your files are loading from the wrong TGA, you have to get the Beta 2.1 again and reinstall to an empty directory.<br />

I've done that numerous times now with no luck. Ah well she's stuck with Vert and gets to envy my Solaria :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is Solaria uses 512x512 pixel texture files... many older video cards do not correctly use textures over 256x256. They chop out the first 256x256 pixels then cut out slices from the texture as if it were still 512x512 (hence the reason the messed up areas are double the size and way messed up). This is why all default UI tga files are 256x256 in size. To fix this, Solaria's textures would have to be cut up and it'd be a lot of work.<br />

Well I keep Vert up and running any how, so no biggie there.<br />

If it became a wide spread epedemic I'll look into changing it, but for now every thing runs smooth with the 512x512.<br />

<br />
Been using Solaria 2.1 for a few days now, and have just 3 issues with how it looks (everything else is gtg).<br />
<br />
1) The spellbar: Its just ugly. =/ The solid bar holding the spell name has to go. If there was / is a way to just have the spellbar show only the spellgems that would be prefect, I do not need to have a banner showing the name for each spell...I can press Alt if I need to know. =)<br />
<br />
2) The hotbutton bar: Ok, why are these so small? Would prefer the larger size as in the old Vert series. Not a big issue, just curious.<br />
<br />
3) The buffbar: This is ok too, would just prefer the transparent buff titles as in the old Vert series (without having to set the &quot;fade out&quot; option for that window), but can live with the solid bars.<br />
<br />
Other than those, I like the design tweaks within Solaria; player window is nice, indicator bars with small segments look great, group window is cool, pet health for group members is nicely done. Might want to consider designing a new MP3 player to fit with Solaria, the current skin doesn't quite match.</div></div><hr />

#1 there is an options folder with a version of the spell Bar Window with no names. <br />
I did code it to use any vert 2.6 spell bar window though, so pick your flavor. <br />
(I use the 4x2 from the Vert 2.6 series my self)<br />
<br />
#2 People wanted all the windows the same width IE. 155 pixels SO we had to shrink it. However if your not one of those people (I happen not to be aswell) Use any Vert 2.6 Compatible Hotbutton window made by me, and it should work fine.<br />
<br />
#3 Not mutch I can do here, can't please every one, and this is the way people wanted it :)<br />

might i recommend stay with VERT 2.6 then.. seems to be what you like, since 3 three things you listed were 3 of the driving factors for Solaria.<br />

In the meen time you can use the Spell cast window from Vert 2.6, or any 2.6 compatible Mod, I've tried to keep Solaria and Vert 2.6 as compatible as possible.<br />
