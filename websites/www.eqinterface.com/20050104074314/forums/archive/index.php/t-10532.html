<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vicceroy</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of the people that have released patches to the Delta UI have been in a lot smaller resolutions than what I'm playing in, causing the UI to not fit just perfect such as Delta3.0 did. Also, it seems that the 2 that are out that have patched, are different than Delta3.0 in different ways.<br />
<br />
My request: Someone release a 1280x1024 resolution patch to Delta 3.0 without changing anything. <br />
<br />
Wouldn't think it would be too hard, but I have no idea, maybe I'm asking too much. The Delta3.0 UI is already in 1280x1024, so if someone could just patch it to LDoN I'd be in heaven.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot everyone</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been patching my copy of Delta 3.0 right along with each major change to the UI.  <br />
<br />
I use 1280 x 1024 screen resolution. <br />
<br />
Attached are the XML files for the UI, all patched and ready to go. <br />
<br />
Note:  I took out the containter window modification and just use the default as it was generating an error about not being able to find the icon and I was sick of messing with it.  Other than that, this is pure Delta 3.0. <br />

I clicked on the attachment in the string, and DL'd the info, created a folder and placed the files in it.  When I load that UI in the game, it comes up as the default, more or less.  Was I supposed to DL the original Delta3 and put the files in the attachment in that folder?<br />

<br />
This is just patches applied to the 1208 x 1024 version of the XML files.  It does NOT contain the graphics. It does NOT contain any other resolutions. <br />
<br />
And before anyone asks, no, I'm not getting into the business of maintaining Delta. <br />
