There's a new message over at the Developer's Corner (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53654), in which the following was mentioned:Bandwidth Usage and /Serverfilter<br />
<br />
This is one of those that we've been meaning to talk about for a while now, but it always seemed to be pushed back by other, more pressing matters.<br />
<br />
For the past months, /Serverfilter hasn't had any practical use. It simply sends a message off to the server that the server no longer does anything with, which is why some folks with overly-restrictive network equipment are still able to use it as a means to &quot;jump start&quot; what appears to be a dying connection.<br />
<br />
The server-side filters are now controlled by the individual items that live in the Options window, on the Filters page.<br />
<br />
Also in a recent patch, we've significantly reduced the amount of bandwidth that EverQuest needs to use, even in large raid or extremely-crowded-zone situations. Unfortunately, one side effect of these changes is a problem that didn't show up in the small test server community, and is only highly prevalent on the live servers; Periodic movement and health updates are nowhere near as reliable as they should be.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, this issue will be fixed in the patch that is scheduled for Wednesday, Jan 15 at 3am.<br />

Patch Fixes!<br />
<br />
There are a TON of patch fixes  for the thousands of UI's and mods here... luckily, you only have to look two places to find yours!<br />
<br />
First off, check the appropriate Downloads Category (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php) there on the left and look for the mod or UI you need patched. Chances are, there's a new version available, or directions on how to patch the current.<br />
<br />
Second, Search (http://www.eqgui.com/search.php?s=) the Patch Fixes (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=36) forum for a patch provided by the original author, or by a fellow community member.<br />
<br />
If you need further assistance, please contact the author of the mod/UI or post a request in the Help!?!? (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=16) Forum. Make sure you post to the appropriate forum, otherwise your question won't get seen or answered! Please do NOT email or PM the Staff or Moderators - they're swamped, believe me!<br />
<br />
<br />
Other Updates are on the way!</div></div><hr />
