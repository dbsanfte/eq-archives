I am not knowledgeable in creating or writing the info for UI's. So I have taken a mix of other peoples work - who I will definitely give credit to as soon as I break everything down and find out who made what... :)  But I made a wizard UI that I absolutely love and wanted to share with all of you. I basically took pictures I found on the net, and pieces of other peoples UI's and just put them into one. I hope you like it.<br />
<br />
If you have problems viewing it please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
p.s ignore the symbols and spells - i was testing ui's while I was on my cleric</div></div><hr />

If/when you feel it is ready to be released for others to download, drop me a PM letting me know that you've added the files and I'll move it back to the Released forum.<br />

(PS Kelria, to aid you in tracking things down ... the buff window is mine, with modifications by Remelio.)</div></div><hr />
