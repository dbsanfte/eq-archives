<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iluvatar</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There IS indeed a thread about this somewhere, several threads, actually, just do a search for &quot;legal&quot; and &quot;EULA&quot; and you should probably find it.<br />
The consensus on those threads, IIRC, was that maps and locs would be legal.<br />
People are not quite sure, though, about modifying the Help window for tradeskill info and such, although some GM was said to have commented on that as &quot;being tolerated&quot;....<br />
I don't really know what is legal and what isn't, I'm curious, though, how they're supposed to find out if you use such stuff or not since it all happens client-side...</div></div><hr />
