<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BenficaSD</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried reading the FAQ and README files, but I am totally lost when trying to load the UI.<br />
<br />
This is what I have done:<br />
<br />
I downloaded a UI from the site and saved it to a Custom folder right next to the default foloder. From there I extracted the files using windows (I was under the assumption this is the same as unzipping, seems to work the same. Is that my problem?). An XML file is unzipped.<br />
<br />
From there I went to go load in-game. I tried both the /loadskin and the options button. Selected my custom folder and hit load, but nothing happens.<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried downloading the UI a different way onto my desktop. From the file on my desktop again I extracted. I opened the XML file and saved it to a Custom folder next to the default folder. From there I tried loading in-game as explained above. Still nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Obviously I am doing something wrong, but I can't figure out what. I have spent almost 2 hours trying to read and re-read the help portions of the website with no success. Can someone maybe point me in the right direction or let me know what I am doing wrong. It would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

Only in my case 2 of the custom skins load and the other 4 I have tried only return the default skin.  It is truly odd and is all since last patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, for both of you it sounds as if you try to load your custom ui, and when you do, the game pauses for a second or two as if it's trying to load something, but then it comes back with just the plain ordinary ui, correct??  If so, scroll back in your chat buffer and you'll see a message saying that it was unable to load the custom ui, so it's using the default instead.  <br />
<br />
Here's what you both should do:<br />
<br />
[list=1]<br />
 In your main everquest directory, find a file called UIErrors.txt and delete it<br />
 Log into everquest, and try to load your custom ui the way you mentioned above.<br />
 Log out of EQ, and you should have a new UIErrors.txt file.  Post a copy of this file in a new message.<br />
[/list=1] <br />
<br />
Doing this will give those of us on here an idea of what is wrong.  Somebody will most likely be able to help you.</div></div><hr />
