I would recommend making your own WDT_ChatWindow or WDT_TitleThinBorder or something and then you can do whatever you want with the window draw template. For example, you can control all the borders, title bar, scrollbars and such with the window draw template.<br />
<br />
In your case, you'll probably just trim the borders.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

All the way down near the bottom, find the line for StyleBorder and change it from true to false.<br />
<br />
This has the side effect that you can no longer resize the window, since it is the borders that you use for that function and they've been removed.<br />
<br />
Or you could use my mod.  I've made a heavily modified chatwindow that allows you to resize it even though it has no borders, move it by clicking along the top even though it has no titlebar, and other good stuff.  I'll upload it when that becomes possible again.</div></div><hr />
