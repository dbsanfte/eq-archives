From the Dev Corner (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=60476)<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to continue to move EverQuest forward and embrace rapidly changing graphics technology, we are going to require the use of DirectX 9 on the Test server.  DirectX 9 will better use EverQuest's graphic resources, while providing better security and performance for your computers.  You can download DirectX 9 at www.microsoft.com/directx.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all of your continued help in testing EverQuest.<br />

Brenlo the Test Subject<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
According to Baelish from Castersrealm (http://eq.crgaming.com/) Brenlo specified that it will also be required for the new expansion Gates of Discord but, your card has to be only DirectX 9.0 Compliant (able to run 9.0, doesnt have to use all the features).<br />
<br />
But Why skimp on the details when you can get it all..<br />
<br />
I found the GeForce FX 5200 (http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=10343936&amp;loc=220) with 128MB of Ram on Buy.com for $78.14. and free shipping. So if you have been looking to upgrade your video card, click on the name above, and check it out. It's the base model for GeForce's new FX line and and nearly over $50.00 of normal retail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately for me, the GeForce FX 5200 line are not true upgrades.  All it really does is add dx9 compliance.  My GFTi out-performes the GFFX5200.<br />
I think that I will wait to upgrade.  I don't exactly play EQ for the visuals anyway.  Most of my display features are off to save resources.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and Ryoujikaji its too early to say what the move to DX9 does for game play.. initially (day 1) it was bad, but within 48 hours it was almost toally back to normal or improved (in some places). So ask agian right before Discord release... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've looked firsthand at the GeForce FX 5200, and was sorely disappointed. It performed noticeably inferior to a GeForce4 Ti 4400/4600. Both the Ti's returned much better framerates in almost all areas, with the exception that the GF4Ti's do not have the CineFX engine.<br />
<br />
Not bashing the FX5200 card, it's still a great buy from the price, but if you are looking for better performance a GeForce 4 Ti series would be the better balance for bang vs. buck.<br />

<br />
Some people are not able to run DX 9 yet Kenney, some of the older Cards that will run DX8 are not capible of running DX9. <br />
<br />
I posted the FX 5200 to try and help those on a budge who are not able to upgrade often.  It was never designed to be the &quot;uber card.&quot; its just suppose to be an affordable card that will use DX9 nicely.<br />

The difference between 2x, 4x, and 8x is the bandwidth of each bus. There is little to no speed difference though. I am able to say this with confidence since I had to learn it for my A+ certification class at school.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This will possibly be the first pre-emptive strike to take all the Windows 98 users out of game, either forcing them to upgrade their machines (not just their vidcards) or leave the game.  To be honest, not sure how to feel about this even though I am running DX9 on an XP machine.  I still wonder how many EQers may not be able to afford new machines, that are now just barely holding on with a vid/sound chipset.  I hate to see some people left behind simply because they cannot afford a new machine.  <br />
<br />
Buit still, I fully understand what they are trying to do here.  I really just wish they would leave EQ at DX 8 and not force anyone totally out because of equipment deficiencies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People said the same thing 2 years ago when Luclin came out and the moved from DX7 to DX8... EQ saw very few numbers drop out of the game for very long. <br />
<br />
I for one am glad they are going to move to DX9 and be able to lower the strain on the video cards.. (the new gfx engine when fully installed will be less strain on your system according to preview info)<br />
<br />
Sooo have no fear, thier objective is not to force anyone out. just to make us an even prettier/smoother game to play.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hope you are right Kundane.  With Microsoft's off, then on again support for Windows 98 (up until the release of Longhorn at least) I can see in the near future where, like with Windows 95, 98 will be left behind.  And I for one do not want to tlose anymore good friends and players to equipment limitations.  Again I would wish then that EQ be left alone for the few remaining weeks/months and that all the upgrading be made for EQII.  Thats where we are going to need all the graphics help we can get.  ANd if we are in EQ II, will we be coming back to EQ very often?  Maybe a survey question.</div></div><hr />

I currently play on hand me down equipment and don't have ANY resources to upgrade.  I just upgraded  to a pIII 550Mhz CPU and have been running a GForce2 video card for some time now.  This is one of the better PCs any of my friends have.  I guess when you can't afford it, stop playing :(</div></div><hr />

Also XP doesnt like EQ, it just hates it, i had a problem where when ever EQ would patch its self, any file no matter how insignificant and small, i would get a C++ runtime error and EQ would die.</div></div><hr />

Also XP doesnt like EQ, it just hates it, ...  <br />
<br />
You certainly had an unpleasant experience, but I can tell you, I've been running EQ under XP for quite some time, and XP handles things much better than my Win95 box, Win98x box or Windows ME box.  <br />
<br />
In fact, the performance was so markedly different that I upgraded to Windows XP on all my personal computers.  <br />
<br />
DirectX 9 gave me pause.  I worried that my aging hardware wouldn't handle it.   But even on my oldest machine (PIII 500) WindowsXP, EQ, and everything else I've thrown at it work wonderfully.  <br />
<br />
Before this turns into a MS-Bashing thread, check out the web site for your video card.  In MANY cases, if you're working fine under DirectX 8.1, you'll probably be OK with DirectX 9.0.  You might not get all the extra features of DirectX 9, but you should still be able to play EQ.</div></div><hr />

Windows 98 went obsolete this year at the end of January. Also if you want to know if your system will support the new upgrades just get on the test server and try it.</div></div><hr />

I have only ever played EQ on Windows XP machines, and I have never had any problems.<br />
<br />
My old comp, which I replaced a couple months ago, was an AMD Athlon 850 with GeForce 2 video card. I never had any problems even running my UI at 1280x1024 resolution. Of course I had all but a couple new models off, but it ran like a champ.<br />
<br />
My new machine has a GeForce FX 5200 and Win XP and again, not a single issue.</div></div><hr />
