<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaorin</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know where I can get the T-King celtic prior to the latest 1.8 version.  I am sure that the new version took alot of work but it is missing most of the things I liked about the t-king celtic.  Such as the extra little boxes on the hotkey window that was for clickie items to go in and matched you inventory.  Plus it wasn't all broke up and you could place it however you wanted to without trying to piece together a puzzle.  Any help would be nice thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inate</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just exactly what problem are you having with the 1.8 version?<br />
i had a problem with it a little while ago, so i might be able to help you fix it up maybe, you say it's missing little bits, which mine was as well... <br />
i'll try my best to help you but i need to know the problem first, also what directory your installing it into, and anything else you might be installing WITH it at the time that you install it, other than just the 1.8 installer i mean...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madmoxi</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having the same trouble with the new UI, I no longer have the 4 boxes on the right of the Hotkey bank, and all my hotkeys are different styles, and my pet box is just huge, and the right corners or the buff and song windows are missing, along with the right side of them, they are just &quot;open&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also when i install the Druid UI I get a bigger map, which I love, but I lose the target con color, but get a nice pet window.<br />
<br />
It's all very weird, I am working with a brand new built PC so no old files could be on my computer to be interferring with the new UI.<br />
<br />
I am at a loss and don't knwo what to do.<br />

The problem I, and others, were having was do to changes in coding and an outdated version of remmy.exe that installs the T.King custom class icons. It isn't the UI itself, it is actually the changes that are made with the old Remmy.exe .Do a search for remmy.exe and you should find the thread where Remelio posted an updated Remmy pather that fixes up the oddities. <br />
<br />
Celtic 1.8 is no diffrent than the old Celtic's except for the fact it is updated with all the new stuff. Post your UIerror file here to get more help. But if you are using a T.King class icon, try the new remmy.exe and see if that fixes things up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inate</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the way i fixed it first off is just use the basic Celtic 1.8 installer and install it under &quot;uifiles/Celtic&quot; and don't install anything else yet...<br />
if you want to install anything else like class anims, etc, find the new remmy installer file and it will fix everything, in the meantime just install like i said and it should work</div></div><hr />
