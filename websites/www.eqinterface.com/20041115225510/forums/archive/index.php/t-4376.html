<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=22631http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=22638<br />
<br />
Ok, I've created a group window that color codes each group member based on their current status.<br />
<br />
Red = In Another Zone<br />
Purple = Dead<br />
( These two colors are hardcoded, I can't change them )<br />
<br />
But what I need input on is what colors to use for when a player is at:<br />
Full health (100%)<br />
Above 4 Bubbles (80% - 99%) HP<br />
Above 3 Bubbles (60% - 79%) HP<br />
Above 2 Bubbles (40% - 59%) HP<br />
Above 1 Bubble (20% - 39%) HP<br />
Below 1 Bubble (0% - 19%) HP<br />
<br />
I don't want to reuse red since it's for zoned characters, and purple is already for when they're dead.<br />
<br />
I was thinking to use Blue for full health, then fade to darker blues until Black at just before death. Or possibly Black at full health fading to Blue (the group members who have full HP won't stick out as much as people who are Blue which would mean they have less HP).<br />
<br />
Suggestions would be appreciated. Read the following posts for more info on the color scheme.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah, I neglected to explain why I wanted to use black and blue. The text for players (names and percentages) is white and for pets is light green and those colors are most easily readable on darker colors. I wanted to avoid green and yellow because of this, my original plan was to go from green, to yellow and to red when at low health, but the textw as hard to read, and the red was too similar to the color when a personw as zoned. =/ so my current plan is to fade from baclk to blue as HP drops. Hopefully bright blue will scream &quot;HEAL ME&quot; at any clerics who use this mod.<br />

So what does everyone think?<br />
Is the color scheme good?<br />
Would YOU use this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Logansan</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you find that even with the change, you will end up just taking notice of the gauge itself rather then the background colour.<br />
<br />
Now, if you can make the gauge itself change colour base on the % of health then yes I would use it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cragzak</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... I'm diggin the idea... here's my 2 copper:<br />
<br />
BLACK = Full health (100%)<br />
DARK BLUE = Above 4 Bubbles (80% - 99%) HP<br />
BLUE = Above 3 Bubbles (60% - 79%) HP<br />
BLUE/ORANGE (What's that?) = Above 2 Bubbles (40% - 59%) HP<br />
ORANGE = Above 1 Bubble (20% - 39%) HP<br />
RED/ORANGE = Below 1 Bubble (0% - 19%) HP<br />
RED = Dead<br />
<br />
Just because then it fades more into the colors, yet still keeps them dark enough to read the text... but your way is fine also.  I will keep an eye on this one and download/use it when you have it out for sure.<br />
<br />
Also, I kinda like having the INVITE/DISBAND buttons on my window... maybe you can make both versions? :)</div></div><hr />

The problem with that though would be the white text would be hard to read over top the pink background. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyway of placing this color code into a gem instead of a whole area for each person in group.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vixyn</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then use another colour? Such as, for instance... purple? or even that uggy over-glorified colour, yellow? Heheh.<br />
<br />
The gem idea is a neat idea, also :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yay! Input!<br />
Ok, here comes the replies:<br />
<br />
Logansan, I've considered this. I CAN make a version where just the gauge changes colors (and did, for testing purposes) but it's a million times less noticeable than the whole background changing, maybe I'll release a gauge version.<br />
<br />
Cragzak, I'll test that color scheme (haha, blue/orange eh? that is brown =D). I'm glad you're keeping readable text colors in mind, and yes, I'll make a version with invite/disband buttons.<br />
<br />
Vixyn, I've been toying with colors that stick out, pink does make the text a little tough to read, with this post I'm releasing a beta version of this window for you guys to try out, you'll notice the blue gets pretty bright and noticeable, at first I was worried I wouldn't look at the colors, but I found my eyes drawn to my group's enchanters health as he quickly went from black to blue, then purple, poor Beldhyr.<br />
<br />
Pure, although I'm not big on fancy, eye-candy UI stuff, using the gem is a great idea and I can do that, so I'll probably make a version like that.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - So here's the group window, it's like in the screenshot, no invite or disband buttons (sorry Cragzak, when I've finalized the color scheme I'll make several versions to suite different people's tastes), life fades from black to blue, purple = dead, red = zoned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cragzak</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, now that I know you can do the gems thing, here's my new suggestion.<br />
<br />
Have it set up basically just like the T.King window that's posted.  Have the Gem be the color code and each gem should have the F-Key # inside it.  Also, if you can make it so clicking on the gem also targets that person (keeping the clerics in mind).  Oh, and not to mention... the Invite/Disband buttons. ;)<br />
<br />
With the gems being the color coded part, now you don't have to worry about text being unreadable.  So you can go to the more classic color schemes.  Like Green or Blue - Yellow - Orange - Red.<br />
<br />
Now THAT I'd use! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways, try the version I uploaded here before asking for fancy colored gems and gauges. I've only had one person test this (other than myself) and give me input (a 55 druid who was healer for their group, and they said it helped, and towards the end of the battle they began to rely on the coloring more and more as they became comfortable with it).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A request: I have no idea how you're accomplishing this, would you mind giving a short explanation? I'd like to use this same idea in my own mod with different colours and gauges, and I don't want to ask you to do the coding but I can't for the life of me figure it out myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd be happy to explain it.<br />
<br />
The coloring is actually done with gauges, 6 gauges per group member to be prescise.<br />
<br />
I will explain how the coloring works for a single group member, then just realize that the same coding is then done 4 more times, once per other group member.<br />
<br />
All 6 gauges are 20000 pixels wide and use A_WhitePixel for their fill graphic, they don't have background, endcap or linefill grphics, and have a gaugeYoffset of 0 and a labelYoffset of like -50.<br />
<br />
The first gauge (layerwise, it's under the other 5) is colored bright blue (RGB 0, 0, 200) and is at X location 0. When a player is grossly low (less that 20 percent) on HP, or dead this is the gauge that you see.<br />
<br />
The second gauge is colored slightly less bright blue (RGB 0, 0, 160) and is at X location -4000 (one fifth it's total length is off the left side of the group window). When a player has less than 40% and 20% or more HP this is the gauge you see.<br />
<br />
The third gauge is colored blue (RGB 0, 0, 120) and is at X lcoation -8000 (2 fifths it's total length). When a player has less that 60% and 40% or more HP this is the gauge you see.<br />
<br />
The fourth gauge is colored dark blue (RGB 0, 0, 80) and is at X location -12000. HP less than 80% and 60% or greater.<br />
<br />
The fifth gauge is colored very dark blue (RGB 0, 0, 40) and is at X location -16000. HP less than 100% and 80% or greater.<br />
<br />
The sixth gauge has to be placed carefully. It's what you see when a player is at 100% HP or is in another zone. It's colored black (RGB 0, 0, 0) and is at a location that is -20000 PLUS the width of the group window (in the case of my group window I think it's 141 pixels wide excluding borders) so my gauges are at something like -19850 but it might not be exactly that number, best way to test is color it white and adjust it in game 'til it touches the right edge then change coloring to black.<br />
<br />
I hope that makes sense, it does to me, originally the window only had color coding of black if they were in the group, red if in another zone and purple if dead (and this only required one gauge, the one with an X location of 0). But while I was taking a shower I hit my head and saw spots (weird colored) and it made me think of adding color coding based on current HP status cause I hurt myself and colros changed. And I also simultaneously thought of how I'd do it =D<br />
<br />
If you want to contain the color coding in a specific area (like a gem) just use an invisible single page tabbox with no border textures to constrict the area of the 20000 pixel wide gauges and put another textureless tabbox over it with a frame like a circle or something to keep it looking like a gem.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S - I'm super happy with it in it's current form, tomorrow I'll release a version with Invite and Disband Buttons, then I'll start work on one that is a modified t.king graphic group window with the coloring confined to the gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh, looks like Remelio beat me to the punch as far as making a window where there's a little bubble of some sort for color based HP indication.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?goto=newpost&amp;threadid=4424<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if he came up with it on his own, or if he was inspired by what I made. Either way, it's not half bad, I just find his little spheres to be too small to be really noticeable, even though I use 1024x768 (which does n't make things THAT small). The basic premise behind this group window coloring scheme of mine was that the color of brightest blue would draw your attention, you'd check their HP gauge to see health, then percent to see more precise HP amount. A lazy (and not too worried about being precise on timing) cleric could probably heal based on the colors alone.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - Should I (emphasis on I) still procede to make alternate styles of group window like the t.king style gauge and gem group window (I'm still making a version with Invite/Disband Buttons) or should I let Remelio?</div></div><hr />

<br />
ACTUALLY, after looking at Remelio's code, it's NOTHING like mine, so it's probably just an awesome coincidence that we had similar ideas, but implemented them in completely different ways. ;) <br />
<br />
Yeah, so anyways, expect me to release something here in a day or two (I'm tired, went to Best Buy at 3 AM to wait for it to open, got everything I wanted, spent $800 but have $400 in mail in rebates already in the mail).<br />

<br />
I'll have to take a look and see how you did yours sometime.  I would have done it with a 100 width image with one pixel turned on at the lowest % that I wanted that color to show at, and then make a gauge of width (windowsize)*100 with an offset of (windowsize)*(start percent)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uascura</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I might make a suggestion.  I really like this particular mod, and find the way the colors work to draw attention to party members in need of healing to be quite effective so far.  My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the percentage gauge for the player health next to the bar is a bit small, especially when you run at higher resolutions.  My suggestion is this:  Why not drop the pet health percentage (just leave the pet health on the player's bar like usual, most people are rarely healing pets that much anyways unless you are duo-ing with a mage or beastlord, and even then, they have better heals for their pets mana-wise) and increase the player percentage slightly?  I don't mean a huge font or anything, but just equal to their name perhaps?  I am attaching an edited screen snippet showing your mod in action, along with a target window from another set with a larger percentage on it, to give you an idea of about the size I would find more helpful on the player window.<br />
<br />
Thanks for an swesome mod!  I'll be using it regardless.  :)</div></div><hr />
