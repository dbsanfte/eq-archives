I put in the disk and went through all the setup stuff.. all I managed to do was mess things up.. I wanted to erase all of my data but instead I deleted like all the programs but I still have all the files.. its hard to explain what happened.. and also when I start up the computer, it gives me 2 choices on what operating system to start, Microsoft windows 2000 or microsoft windows 2000..<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any kind of clue on what I might be able to do, like how to get rid of one of those operating systems? I only need one operating system on one computer...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You didn't remove the old win2k install before installing the new one.  Now you have two installations that are sharing one Windows directory.<br />
<br />
What you need to do is launch windows setup and format the drive.  This will erase ALL the data on it.  Then install windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">download91</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, now I got another problem that started this morning...<br />
<br />
When I installed windows 2k for the second time, I noticed that there were two directories of Winnt. one in C and one in D.. In hopes of fixing the problem, I deleted the one in D drive.. I know, that was probably a stupid idea... :p  that second windows 2k is still there just doesn't work..and the first one just stopped working all together.. and now I can't even log on.. the first one worked last night though..<br />
<br />
So now I cant even log in to start the installation? Any idea's now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Genghiz Cohen</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you have a start diskette this would be a good time to use it... the installation on your D drive was most likely the latter of the two installations (thus being the &quot;main&quot; one) and since you removed it the OS wont start... <br />
<br />
at this point your only option (from what I can gather, at least) is to wipe your C drive clean and reinstall the lot... which is where the start diskette comes in... or, if your Win2k CD is bootable, head into your bios and set the CD Rom player as the first option in the the boot up sequence... boot up and do a format (make sure you copy whatever files you want to keep to another drive first) then reinstall Win2k...</div></div><hr />

<br />
      NOTE: If you do not agree with the Windows 2000 license agreement, press ESC. Setup quits.<br />
   5. In the list of existing partitions and unpartitioned space, use the arrow keys to select the unpartitioned space selection that you want, and then press C.<br />

  18. Click No, this computer is not on a network, or is on a network without a domain, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
      NOTE: You can add the computer to a domain later by using the Network Identification Wizard from the System Properties dialog box in Windows.<br />
  19. Click Finish when Setup is complete. Windows restarts.<br />
  20. Log on to Windows as Administrator.<br />
