<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-13-2002, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am tweaking my files and such as I type this and will post more information very soon.<br />
<br />
However, I have successfullly combined the four spellbook.tga files to ONE 512x 512 image to make editing MUCH easier.<br />
<br />
In doing this you can save that 512 x 512 image as any name you like and add the needed info in the SAME EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml<br />
The information posted here about placing animation and /or other information in the same file has saved me so many headaches lately :D<br />
<br />
If for some reason all efforts to edit you files fail and you just gotta play quickly :)  just edit out all the old information and copy and paste from default folder and voila your back in business until your nerves calm back down :)<br />
<br />

==============================================<br />
Okie Dokie :)<br />
<br />
Here is the Spellbook it has only TWO files<br />
1) - EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml<br />
2) - psb2.tga [512 x 512 image] (Instead of 4 spellbook.tga files)<br />
Pure Spellbook Mod (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/Pure_SpellBookMod.zip) <br />
<br />
The Done button is click on Blue Gem - Pages are brown edges - and placed spells vertical along with names and changed font to Blue - Also the Mem and Scribe bars are hidden at bottom you will see when used ;)  Nice size also<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
If you want the bluish tint background along w/ all the fixin's like:<br />
1) - Bluish Tint background and slot background works great when fade at 50 or so.<br />
2) - Modified versions of Player - Group - Target<br />
3) - Small Buff Icon window - Horizontal SpellGems - Hot w/ Inv <br />
4) - Sword cursor w/ Skull Icon in place of boring square box on Spellbook :)<br />
<br />
UPDATE: The PURE MOD Works with the 8/14/02 patch and if had problems with Spellbook before or target try it now please:D<br />
Pure Mod (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/psb2.zip) <br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
Note: I put Guild name in Hotbox but that can be changed easily. If cannot find just tell me what needed I'll be glad to send personal for you :)<br />
<br />
The SpellBook and Icons belongs to T. King:<br />
T.King Custom Skins and Icons (http://pub37.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=74.topic)<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
The Following will be downloadable Links for T. King SpellBooks using this Mod 512 x 512 x 16M and using the EQUI_SpellBookWnd as seen in Picture with<br />
Vertical Spells and Blue print. Just look in the .xml to change font color - If need help send me a PM :)<br />
Also, no bluish tint these are kept original just combined images!<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
<br />
Arcane SpellBook (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TK_Arcane.zip) <br />
Beast SpellBook (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TK_Beast.zip) <br />
Draconis SpellBook (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TK_Draconis.zip) <br />
Elven SpellBook (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TK_Elven.zip) <br />
Enchanted SpellBook (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TK_Enchanted.zip) <br />
Jade SpellBook (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TK_Jade.zip) <br />
Majestic SpellBook (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TK_Majestic.zip) <br />
Spirit SpellBook (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TK_Spirit.zip) <br />
Standard SpellBook (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TK_Standard.zip) <br />
Undead SpellBook (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TK_Undead.zip) <br />
==============================================<br />
When saving files just place into the skin directory of choice and it will only overwrite the EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml and also since the graphic name does not interfere w/ originals there should not be a problem for updates :D<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
UPDATED: August 25th<br />
Added Five new SpellBooks from T.King using this mod:<br />
Briar SpellBook w/ Glowing Gem (http://jimmysheryl.com/Goodies/TK_BriarGlowing.zip) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalvorie</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it. You know, I have not used his spell books due to me using the 8 vertical spells on each page mod. I have not had time to twink it but this is what I was going to do. The only thing I would/will change is the Spell icons being on the inside and labels on the outside.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the hard work, it is appreciated !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mainly placed my icons and text as is. Because, after looking through various forums and such I see alot of people wanting to add personal graphics and etc. With placing icons and text like above ^^^^ images can be seen behind text with ease. And if need be, just change color of text to where visable over image slightly :)<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE: This was just to test out my mod of the Spellbook I just picked a Spellbook and went away at coding. I will soon start doing this to the other Spellbooks I see, and placing them on a link to site for download. WITH THE AUTHORS PERMISSION. So, the original ones will be first to post. I may even dab into the OLD spellbook and see what I get. Then from there I will see about other sorts like NO Book at all and wild graphics to take place of books.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I had the same idea as above and combined all my spellbook into one image.  t.Kings Elf book is what I used.  I repositioned the icons (which meant labourusly removing the squares he drew on the background) also removed the next/prev page buttons and turn the edges of the book into the button (which glow when you move over them.)<br />
<br />
http://dm-mt.dynu.com/files/fullui2.jpg <br />
<br />
Note: Sorry but the files I have at the moment are eating up too much of my internet usage, so until I can find somewhere to host them I can't ditribute them. Any ideas here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also the reason for the four files is size. <br />
<br />
With the restriction of the power of 2 rule in file dimensions the smaller the files the less wasted space you end up with.<br />
<br />
The default image (sorry a little bit of guessing here) is about 380 by 280 pixels.  This means an image file needs to be 512x512 in size which is about alot of empty space (over 50%).  So by cutting it down into small chunks you can reduce this empty space by huge amounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh one more thing.  I've haven't downloaded any books which do this, but can you tell me how it is that you get the mem/scribe bars to hide when not in use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok first the easiest - To make any bar only show when used use this in .xml<br />
<br />
&lt;GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
			&lt;!--&lt;Background&gt;A_GaugeBackground&lt;/Background&gt;--&gt;<br />
			&lt;Fill&gt;A_GaugeFill&lt;/Fill&gt;<br />
			&lt;!--&lt;Lines&gt;A_GaugeLines&lt;/Lines&gt;<br />

<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
On the size of the file - Still not sure why this seems to be such a distraught concern considering running a game and this is very minute to any problems that would ever occur during gameplay. If there was graphics or such problems this and the UI are the least of anyones problems. Really should stick with switching back to Eqclient.ini stating NewUI = FALSE<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
Anywho, seeing if I can compare before and after on this mod:<br />
<br />
-=Before=-<br />
Four files = 256 x 256, 256 x 256, 256 x 128, 256 x 128<br />
(Original Spellbook is 410 x 310 - I took all the files and combined to see just now)<br />
<br />
-=After=-<br />
One file = 512 x 512 (T. King Spellbook as used above is 470 x 302) It gives a nice cleaner wide look to place Spells and text and graphics if need be by personal choice :)<br />
<br />
In comparing I would honestly think one file compared to what would take to compile four images together would even be easier on the graphics instead of having to keep a multiple image together.<br />
OR am I just completely not understanding computer access and how instructions are carried out. I still feel one image or file in anything would be better then individual files scattered. I was always under the impression to minimize to the very least when doing coding to better streamline the process.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Basically, just trying to understand the depths of just programming and or code in instances like this. Any full time major programmers or such out there :confused:  to help me somewhat :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The alternate method looks good also.<br />
<br />
Gives slightly more space for Icons. Guess as usual on mods depends on individual taste.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Also, if you or anyone else do not particularly like that outlined box before spell is in slot just let me know or send your windows_pieces01.tga file to me :) be glad to 1) take it out to have nothing -OR- 2) put an image instead or such</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if you noticed, but they avoided using any files at all with a dimension greater than 256 pixels. The reason for this is that there are still people out there who use graphic cards that don't support textures over 256 pixels in size.<br />
<br />
They were just trying to avoid breaking the game for some of their customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruric</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do these mods work after the 8/14/02 patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In using just the Spellbook mod yes it works. I am currently working on zip files for all of T. Kings Spellbooks he has given me consent to do so, or anyone for that matter he seems to be a very nice guy :)<br />
<br />
The Pure Mod I am updating now - When finished it will state UPDATE above link :D<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
Images over 256 pixels not working on all computers. Can this be right?  With the least requirements for game and still cannot run 256 pixels, it just sounds odd to me. How old of a computer would that be - I have a 300 Celeron w/ onboard graphics laying around I need to test this I guess.<br />
<br />
UPDATE on graphics info: Was surfin the net and found out that 256 pixels seem to be limited to the 3Dfx Voodoo 2 &amp; 3 graphic chipset and that time period.<br />
Some Graphic Texture Info. (http://www.vterrain.org/LargeTextures/index.html) <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Some must be killing their computers w/ the Map mod available currently ----- all the images are around 2048 x 2048 x 256 -- The 256 being colors that may help out alot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have added a list of T.King Spellbooks along with each .zip file is a EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml set and ready to just place into your favorite Skin Mod folder.<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
If you have an older computer system near the 3Dfx Voodoo 2 or 3 Chipset they have Textures max at 256 - My mod is 512 x 512. Other then that should have NO problems and edit to your desire. In placing the Spells and Text as I have Vertically in the Middle you can add your favorite image or such :D<br />
<br />
If you want one added and need this done just PM me plz :)<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
For my Pure Mod I did not include the Inventory that shows the pic in the Autoequip if you would like this file w/ a picture of your liking just PM on that also :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, is this a good or bad idea for most. Is it working for you?<br />
<br />
Working great here, but before I post further work I just like to know it is doing good :)<br />
==============================================<br />
Added some new Spellbooks that T. King did :)<br />
<br />
Look above ^^^<br />
<br />
Again, if need help to change font color for Spellbook just let me know ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I fixed a couple of issues with files included in zip - File is now stated in download as psb2.zip :D<br />
<br />
UPDATE: The PURE MOD Works with the Latest patches, and if had problems with Spellbook before or target try it now please:D<br />
