<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nastun</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HERES THE NEW PROBLEM...THE ATTACK FLASHING ANIMATION WAS A BOX THAT SURROUNDED THE WHOLE PW WINDOW. SINCE THIS UI USED THE GLOBE AS A HP METER FADING FROM GREEN INTO A FLASHING RED. I THOUGHT IT WOUDL BE COOL TO MAKE THE GLOBE FLASH RED WHEN ATTACK MODE WAS ON. I ADDED THE CODE TO DO THIS BUT THE FLASHING RED IS IN THE WRONG LOCATION. HOW DO I GET THE RED INTO THE GLOBE? IM NOT THAT GOOD WITH THE ANIMATION STUFF...I KNOW THAT THE 4 GLOBE INSERTS CYCLE IN ORDER BUT THATS ABOUT IT.<br />
<br />
SORRY FOR CAPPS ITS JUST HABIT FOR ME TO TYPE IN THEM<br />
<br />
THANK YOU<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nastun</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried setting the locations to different spots in the .tga correspondind to different circles. The color changes but the location is the same. Do I need to make a new .tga with the whole thing the alpha chanel and the red in the proper location?. I guess because it was in a guage you could use a location tag to place the image where ever you needed. Being an attack indicator this wont work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make a .tga 256x256 transparent, then place the actual red part far enough in from top and left so that it fits perfectly inside your globe as if you were measuring 0 0 from inside the window.  This is how i successfully move my target graphics around.<br />

As you can see, the image doesn't start for several pixels from the top.  This should work for positionining your attack indicator as well.</div></div><hr />
