<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oostil</div><div class="date">02-01-2003, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've just decided to try out one of the interfaces and finally got everything configured like i like and i noticed that i was getting a message in red that says...<br />
<br />
&quot;your XML files are not compatible with current Everquest files, certain windows may not perform correctly.  Use &quot; /loadskin Default 1&quot; to load the Everquest default skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
next i would do the loadskin as directed and i would crash to DT.  also when i would try to zone with anything except the default settings i would crash to DT.<br />
<br />
please help me</div></div><hr />

Not a problem friend, you didn't know, that's why I pointed you to it, so you would. :)<br />
<br />
Okay, all of those errors are due to the 9 Jan 03 Patch.  Check the stickied thread for it in the Patch Fixes forum, it will tell you how to fix those files.  You need the information for the EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml, EQUI_LootWnd.xml, EQUI_SelectorWindow.xml and if you have a custom EQUI_Animations.xml file you will need to make the changes to it as well (even though it isn't listed in your error log).</div></div><hr />
