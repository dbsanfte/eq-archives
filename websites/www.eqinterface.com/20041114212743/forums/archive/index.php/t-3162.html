<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">NOTE: The information in this thread is outdated. Please visit the new thread (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13934) for information on the latest release.<br />
<br />
Version 3.1 of UI Timer (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp) is released! This version features the following enhancements: Full/Compact Versions - Due to popular demand, I've created a &quot;compact&quot; version of the timer. This version is designed for players using low-resolution displays, or for those who want to save screen space. The compact version removes the buttons, and places the timers closer together.<br />
 Additional Timers - You can now choose up to 12 timers (instead of 8).<br />
 Additional Row/Column Configurations - There are now many different ways to arrange your timers (for example: 2x2, 3x4, 5x2, etc.)<br />
 New Windows - Many new windows have been added since v3.0, including the bug window, feedback window, gems window, notes window, and friends window. There are now a total of 12 different windows to choose from.<br />
 Other Options - You can now specify how the timer bars should be animated (fill up or empty out), and the text color for your timers. As with v3.0, you can specify a custom label, duration, and color for each timer.http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/images/timers_faded.jpg http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/images/timers_compact_faded.jpg<br />
Visit the UI Timer site to create your own custom timer configuration:<br />
http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp<br />
<br />
Also, a new section (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/skins.asp) has been added to the timer site. This section contains a listing of user-submitted skins for the timer. Here, players can view and download new &quot;looks&quot; for their timers, to match the rest of their UI better. To start off the new section, Tipop has submitted some very nice graphics for the timer. To create and submit your own timer graphics, follow the instructions on the page. Check this section often for new submissions.<br />
<br />
Finally, I want to say thanks to everyone for their tremendous support. Over 16400 configurations of the timer have been generated over the last 3 weeks, since the release of v3.0. I really appreciate all the positive feedback and valuable suggestions that I've received, without which the timer would not have been possible.<br />
<br />
Edit (10/29/02) - Version 3.2 is now available, and it includes a fix as well as some enhancements. Changes in 3.2: The slider will no longer be able to move past its boundaries. This bug is reproducible in the 3.1 (and earlier) slider timer by moving the slider to either end, then clicking around on the bar. Not a serious problem, but you can download version 3.2 for a fix.<br />
 It is now easier to move the timer window. You can now click and hold on any of the four edges, as well as any space between the timers, to get the move cursor.<br />
 In addition to dragging the slider, there are now two other options for moving the slider. You can click on the bar to either side of the slider to move it in large increments, or you can use the buttons (full version only) to move it in small increments.<br />
 The slider timer's duration can now be specified in one-second increments. Useful for those who want to time special events that don't necessarily happen in ticks, like CH rotations.<br />
 The maximum duration of the slider timer has been increased to 4 hours (actually, 3:59:59). This will allow extra long buffs/abilities to be timed.Edit (12/5/2002) - Version 3.3 has been released to fix a compatibility issue with the 12/5 patch. This issue only affects those using the bug report window for the timer.<br />
<br />
Edit (1/9/2003) - Version 3.4 has been released to fix a compatibility issue with the 1/9 patch. This issue only affects those using the pet info window for the timer.<br />
<br />
Edit (1/20/2003) - Version 3.5 has been released to fix a compatibility issue with the 1/9 patch. This issue only affects those using the bug report window for the timer. The problem doesn't cause an error when initially loading the timer in the bug report window, but can potentially cause a crash later on when using /loadskin or when logging out. Please generate a new XML file using version 3.5 if you are using the bug report window.<br />

Here are the links to my other timer threads. Some of the information in these threads may be outdated, because they are old and many improvements have been made to the timer since then.

I like how you update to feed our needs ^.^ One question: Any chance you could put the analog tick dial clock on the Actions window? As a seperate tab on the actions window? This is the one mod i've been wanting for a long time:P I know you probably can't have the markers on it, but could you please try? Or *someone* try it? I'd be eternally grateful, or at least for a few hours :D good luck, and keep up the great work...or else!:eek:</div></div><hr />

Any chance you could put the analog tick dial clock on the Actions window? As a seperate tab on the actions window?<br />
Actually, a few weeks ago I updated the tick dial marker so that it is button-based (instead of tab-based). What I mean is, instead of clicking on a row of tabs at the top, you can now click on the number directly:<br />
<br />
http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/images/timer_normal.jpg<br />
<br />
So yes, the dial/digital timer can now exist completely in another tab, since it no longer uses tabs. I'll create a combo mod with the dial/digital timer on an additional tab in the Actions window. Thanks for the suggestion!<br />
<br />
Edit: Speaking of the new button-based dial marker, I've been thinking of using a similar mechanism for the bar timer. Instead of the slider, there will be a row of small, close-together buttons, which you can click to mark the bar. I'm planning to call it the &quot;Click Timer&quot;. This will be the next major enhancement to the bar timer.</div></div><hr />

Do I have to /loadskin when I get a mod rod, in order to get it to restart the time?  I thought that was the function of the slider, but I seem to be mistaken.</div></div><hr />

When you use the mod rod, just move the slider so that it points to the current position of the bar (in your 5-minute timer). The bar will keep moving, starting over when it reaches the end. It will take the bar exactly 5 minutes to reach the slider's position again. So when the bar reaches the slider again, you know you can use the mod rod again. You never have to reset the timer, because you can use the slider to mark the time when you want to start timing.</div></div><hr />

If you do the horizontal lineup without the buttons instead of the vertical, the sliders can move out of range of the bar animation and you cannot move them back at all.  I can't really explain how to do it other than to move a slider all the way to the left or right and then click around that area a few times, the slider will inch its way beyond the timer.  Very annoying but doesn't seem to happen if using vertical.</div></div><hr />

(Probably a dumb question :p  )  Can it be placed into another window, say the pet info window of the vert crystal meth 2.2  I'm currently using the friends window timer (just a general 30 minute timer), but when I zone the window goes away.  Not a real big problem, but I was thinking of placing it under the pet's health bar (I don't use the buttons so I was going to remove them).  Is this idea possible?  Thanks for any help.<br />

<br />
Is this still possible as I have searched the site and can't find the option.<br />
<br />
I prefer the dial for some mezzing and the slider for buffs so the ability to have the dial and the pet buttons would rock.<br />
<br />
Alternatively would the Pet Window including this still work with the last patch that modified the pet Window?:nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Marcin - Thanks. I will take a look at that this weekend.<br />
<br />
Forry - The Vert 2.2 mod uses the pet window to display two tabs of information, I believe. While the slider timer cannot be placed in one of those tabs (it currently uses tabs itself, and they cannot be nested), it is possible to place the timer below the tab view (you would have to enlarge the window though).<br />
<br />
Wolja - The mod that combines the dial with the pet buttons is still available for download, just go to &quot;Other Downloads&quot; in the &quot;Customize&quot; section of the site. Note that the combo mods listed there still use version 2.2 of the timer, as I haven't migrated them to version 3.0 yet. Should work with the patch, since the change to the pet window was minor and doesn't affect the timer.</div></div><hr />

If you have a download manager such as Download Accelerator, you may have to press ALT as you click the download button. As an alternative, try downloading the timer skin from the &quot;User-submitted skins&quot; section (link at top of &quot;Customize&quot; section), which uses direct links to the file. I'll also email you the file just in case.</div></div><hr />

One more question given my non XML knowledge.<br />
<br />
I have created a slider timer in the friends window. How do I move it as the border is gone. It comes up immobile in the middle of the screen.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
Wolj:) :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by wolja <br />

First, make sure your window is not locked (via right-click context menu). Then, click and hold on the bottom edge of the window, just below the bottom-most timer. When you click and hold, the move cursor should appear - if it doesn't, click around until it appears. Once you see it, you can then drag the window to wherever you want.<br />
<br />
The left edge (just to the left of the timers) or the right edge (just to the right of the timers) will also work, but the bottom edge works the best. Note that there is no place to click on the top edge that will allow you to move the window, due to a transparent overlapping element there.</div></div><hr />

Does this run post POP? I installed POP then tried to slap in a custom timer and had no luck :(<br />
I have just confirmed that the timer still works after the 10/25 patch. What expansions you've installed shouldn't affect whether or not a UI mod works, as everyone gets the same UI files (just some features aren't enabled based on your expansions). However, since I don't have POP yet, if someone with a timer installed can confirm that, please post here.<br />
<br />
That being said, your problem is most likely due to a mod installation issue. Here are some troubleshooting tips, for common problems that people have:<br />
<br />
1) Make sure you've waited for the full XML file to download, by scrolling down to the bottom and making sure that the last line is &lt;/XML&gt;. If you grab the source before it is fully downloaded, you can end up with a partial file.<br />
<br />
2) Make sure you've created a directory directly under EverQuest\uifiles and that the directory name is one word only (no spaces).<br />
<br />
3) Make sure you have saved the XML file using the correct file name. The name you should use is specified near the top of the XML file. This is the most common error that peple make, and causes the timer to not show up at all. The correct file name always begins with &quot;EQUI_&quot; and corresponds to the window that you generated the XML for.<br />
<br />
4) Make sure your graphics file is also named appropriately. Again, the correct file name for the graphics file is also specified near the top of the XML file.<br />
<br />
Once you log in, and type /loadskin FOLDER 1, what happens? Look in your UIErrors.txt file (in the EverQuest directory) and see if there is a line with &quot;Error&quot; in it (lines with &quot;Warning&quot; are normal and expected). If there is an error, post it here and I'll take a look.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tipop</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bars colors are set in the graphic file.  If you want to twiddle with that, just load it into a paint program and go to town.  (Just be sure to preserve the alpha channel.)  That's how alternate skins are made for the timers, after all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the &quot;look&quot; of the timer is definitely customizable any way you'd like. To modify the timer graphics (colors, textures, etc.), start with the default graphics file, which can be downloaded from the following URL:<br />
<br />
Download default graphics file (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/download.asp?file=skins/default.zip)<br />
<br />
The file looks like this:<br />
http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/images/timer_slider_graphics.jpg<br />
(The image shown here is JPG for browser display only, you should download the TGA version for editing.)<br />
<br />
Once you've downloaded the default file, you can open it up in a graphics program and make modifications to it. As long as the graphical elements stay in the same locations, the timer XML will load up your graphics correctly.<br />
<br />
Modifying the timer graphics is definitely encouraged! If you create a timer skin that you'd like to share (see Tipop's skins for excellent examples), send it to me and I'll post it on the user-submitted skins (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/skins.asp) section of the timer site.</div></div><hr />

This mod is done, and is now available from the &quot;Other Downloads&quot; section of the timer site. The rest of the original default actions window has been preserved as-is; the only change is the addition of a new tab with the dial/digital timer on it.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps setting the current time you first log on and then the clock/timer will count up in hrs:min:sec?<br />

Just a thought.  Would be better than having to keep looking for a clock, watch or cell phone, when I could just look at the screen.<br />

Unfortunately, there is no way to set the time on the digital timer, as that would involve forcing the animation to start from a particular frame. Short of reloading your UI at midnight/noon, or editing your XML file to modify the animation frames/durations before each login session (not really feasible), there isn't a way to get the timer display to match the real-life time.<br />
<br />
It would be a nice feature to have, though. Hopefully Verant will add a new EQType for UI labels, one that shows the real-life time. I know that this has been requested by many others as well.</div></div><hr />

Would it be possible to add a reset button?  I don't really like messing with sliders and trying to match them up to the exact location of the bar.  I'd rather just click and have the bar reset to zero.  When it's full, I'd know the time's up.<br />
Due to the limitations of UI mods, what you are asking is unfortunately not possible. UI mods can only alter the appearance of the UI, not add new functionality. Therefore, the timer is not a program, it is just a collection of animated images.<br />
<br />
Once the EverQuest UI loads up, all animations begin cycling through their frames - there is no way to pause an animation or force it to start from a particular frame at a particular time. Reloading the UI will reset an animation, but it also resets all the animations at the same time (no way to reset one individually), and it can take a while on some systems. This was the main complaint many people had with the digital timer, since reloading the UI was the only way to reset it.<br />
<br />
The bar-style timer was introduced to address this limitation. Because individual animations cannot be reset, and cannot reset without a lengthy reload of the UI, the timer needed to be designed in such a way that allows the player to keep track of time while the animations continue cycling indefinitely. That's why this timer uses a slider, to allow the user to mark the bar instead.</div></div><hr />

The casting bar seems to be able to retime itself in conjuction with the specific spell being cast, going from approximately 0.1 seconds to around 10.0 seconds depending on the particular spell.<br />
<br />
Have you done any research into whether or not you can leverage this functionality to get a bar-style timer that pops up, unfills itself over a set duration, and then goes away once the bar reaches empty?<br />
<br />
I'm not too hopeful, as I have a suspicion that this is hardcoded to work specifically with casting times (with no way to supply our own duration for the casting bar event), but who knows?<br />

If you downloaded a 1-hour digital timer (the default), then yes, that is intended, since 1-hour timers run from 0:00:00 to 0:59:59. To increase the duration on your timer, specify the desired duration in the digital timer generator (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/customize2.asp). You can choose up to 10 hours. Any timer that is 2 hours or more will increase the hour in the first digit.<br />
<br />
As a side note, the digital timer counts up second by second, unlike the dial, which counts up tick by tick (6-second intervals). So it should update every second.</div></div><hr />

Checklist (just to double-check):<br />
1) You have a directory named EverQuest\uifiles\time<br />
2) There are two files in this folder: EQUI_FriendsWnd.xml and Friends_Timer.tga<br />
3) The XML file is not empty, and has &lt;/XML&gt; as the last line<br />
<br />
If the above items all check out, post your saved XML file here as an attachment (or mail it to me at arista@norrath.net) and I'll take a look at it.<br />
<br />
Also, when you type /load time 1, does the chat box show any red error text? If so, look in your EverQuest\UIErrors.txt file and look for any line that says &quot;Error&quot; (and post it here if you find one).</div></div><hr />

It sounds like you have the same problem that a few other people have reported, which prevents their browser from saving the file (they always ended up with 0-size file).<br />
<br />
The solution here is to right-click and use &quot;View Source&quot;, but you need to do it as the first thing after the file is downloaded (if you try to use File &gt; Save As first, or if you clicked on any of the elements, then you'll get the &quot;source not available&quot; error).

Player-made UI mods are very limited in what they are able to do, due to the limitations placed on them (they can only modify appearance, not add any functionality). Therefore there is no way to &quot;hook up&quot; a timer to an in-game event. The timer keeps running, and when you cast mez, you can do one of the following things:<br />
<br />
- If using the bar-style timer, use the slider to mark the current position of the bar. It will take the bar exactly one full duration (length of mez) of the timer for the bar to reach the slider again.<br />
<br />
- If using the dial-style timer, use the tick marker to mark either the current tick or the ending tick. The dial face represents one minute, with each tick representing a 6-second in-game tick.<br />
<br />
- As an alternative, since mez is very short in duration, you can simply &quot;eyeball&quot; the timer and keep a mental note of it. This will work for bar-style, dial-style, and digital-style timers.<br />
<br />
As far as multiple mezzes go: I usually cast each mez in succession, so I use one timer to time the first mez in the series. Then, when the timer lets me know that I need to refresh the first mez, I then proceed to refresh all of them in sequence. Alternatively, you can also create additional timers for these if you so choose.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately that is not possible given the limitations of UI mods, as the slider does not have any connection to the position of the bar. The slider is just a horizontal scroll bar that is overlayed on top of a animated bar graphic. Thus, there isn't any way to &quot;know&quot; the position of the bar, since the timer is not a program. On a somewhat related note however, for v4.0 of the timer, I am putting in a row of buttons that will let you click on the location where you want the marker. This will replace the slider and allow you to mark the bar without dragging, but there will be a loss of granularity. Both methods of marking the bar will remain as options in the XML generator.</div></div><hr />

In any case, the above point doesn't appear to apply here anyway, as it doesn't work for you. Your best bet is to try it using a different machine if you have access to one.

Viken - When I get the chance, I will put your question in the FAQ on the site. Your question - and variations of it - are among the most often asked questions on the timer. Casanunda's quote of &quot;5 times&quot; may have been a bit of exaggeration for this particular thread, but for anyone who has been following the timer threads (linked to the first post) as well as various other threads in the request forum, this issue has certainly come up a lot more than five times in the past (I regularly get email about it as well).<br />
<br />
As far as the answer goes, it certainly would be nice to reset animations any time, and individually, but unfortunately that isn't the case, and most likely won't be possible any time in the near future. It certainly does limit the usability of the timer.<br />
<br />

It is possible to put timers on different tabs in a window, and you'll be able to switch between sets of timers by clicking on the tab. However, there won't be a way to assign keystrokes to switch between tabs, as the ones that you mentioned are specially configured just for the hotkey tabs.</div></div><hr />

For spell durations I usually recommend that people go to the Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net/) database.<br />
<br />
As for making pre-packaged &quot;sets&quot; of timers: since screen space is limited, it's hard to know what people will want timers for, as everyone will want different setups. Some people will only want to time one or two crucial buffs, while others will want to time more. Or people will want additional timers for other things, like abilities/disciplines, DoTs, or spawns. Actually I'm not sure this is what you meant by your suggestion, so sorry if I misunderstood.<br />
<br />
One thing I can do is include a list of buffs/times on the website, on the XML generator page, so people can easily select from the list when customizing their configuration. However, I can't account for the different items/abilities that people may have that alter the duration of certain spells, so the base durations won't work for everyone.</div></div><hr />

I know, I didn't write the mod and am not associated with Ari, but I can answer this one hehe<br />
<br />
Digital countdown is possible, you just reverse the order the digital clock runs in. Just a matter of rearranging stuff in the XML file.<br />
<br />
As for stop/play/pause there is no way to do that at this time due to UI limitations.<br />
<br />
However, if you don't use the player for music, I know there are at least a couple mods here that come with specific length MP3s you can load up into the player to use it as a timer. The big limitation there is you only get one timer.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the grand high Dev Team at SOE will give us some sort of scripting ability to do this, or at least the ability to pause (and stop and start etc) an animation. Let us pray........ to the dancing banana<br />

<br />
Putting multiple markers on each timer bar is a great idea - I'm glad you suggested it! It would allow the user to use the same timer bar for timing multiple instances of the same spell (such as mez, or a buff), multiple spawns, etc., or allow the same general-use timer to be used for different things. I'll have to wait until after the holidays before I'll have time to work on the timer more, but when I get around to it, I'll be sure to add this feature to the next release. Thanks for the suggestion!</div></div><hr />

I just tried downloading and it seems to be working fine. According to the logs, lots of people have been accessing the graphics files without any problems. Do you by any chance have Download Accelerator running? If so, try pressing ALT as you click the download button.<br />

If that's not the case and you are still having problems, let me know which file you want and I can send it to you if you'd like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">narph</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">okokok..... I have an idea =)<br />
<br />
so I like the timers, but I have the worst time loading em up on this stupid pc(have to use a diff one on the network and then transfer files over :/) and I like to use them as spawn timers almost as much as anything else, so I had a real strong incentive to think on how it might be possible to make an adjustable timer.<br />
<br />
Here are my thoughts, I only have a mediocre understanding of the limitations on this, so I'm going to include the stuff that after thinking it thru some more I think won't work, and the last is what I'm pretty sure could work.<br />
<br />
First I was thinking that since you can click on the slider and make it move the programming has to at least be capable of recognizing a click, so I was thinking well then maybe you could make a digital timer that was actually like 3 timers, one wide, and 2 narrow under it, and when you click, the bottom left would become a duplicate image of the main and when you click again the bottom right would, and when you click a 3rd time the three are the same again..... but the fact that we can't reset a digital timer seems to imply that that and the stuff I thought about after that just wouldn't work.<br />
<br />
Then I was thinking that if you made it so that there were 2 hands on the round clock and you could drag them independantly, then say you had a 30 min clock, and you dragged the first hand at kill, and drag the second hand 12 min later at spawn then you would know the spawn time, and could just alternate dragging hands.  I'm pretty sure that would work.<br />
<br />
Then I was thinking well it'd be a lot easier to do that if you had 2 sliders on the slide clock(which I'm also pretty sure would work.... and work especially well if you had 1 long clock that spanned the whole width of the top)<br />
<br />
And then I had my best idea yet..... I'm assuming that the slider thing works because it's a slider type object is something that already exists in EQ programming..... so I'm thinking to myself what if the slider were instead made to be like a really narrow box.... (ie how a chat window is a box) then you could have 2 sliders where moving one of them was like adjusting the side of the box, and the 2 are connected(by the nonvisible &quot;inside&quot; of the box) then that way once you had the length of time set....... YOU COULD GRAB THE MIDDLE OF IT =) and it'd be like a preset width timer...... man I sooooo think this would work, and I think it'd be soooo sweet cuz then once yer 12 min width is set you just grab the middle, and move it so the left edge is at the point the timer is at......<br />
<br />
questionable aspects:<br />
<br />
it'd probably be next to impossible to make it wrap once the timer did, but if you just had like a 3 hr or even 10 hr or whatever timer, that would alleviate that to a certain extent at least.<br />
<br />
(assuming the idea COULD work)<br />
would it be possible to put multiple pairs of differing colors in? that way we could just have a single long timer at the top with varying presets.<br />
<br />
Anway, I'd like to here your thoughts, and if this doesn't work, I'll be damned if I'm gonna give up now that it's in my head =)<br />

<br />
I'm trying to create a set of customized slider timers.<br />
<br />
Every time I generate the XML, regardless of what type oif window I choose to replace with the timers, the XML that is generated uses the _Timer.tga for the graphic, and undefinedWindow.xml for the file name.<br />
<br />
I've tried manually changing these to the correct graphic and window name, but the timer will not display.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
---<br />
Update:  After perusing the XML carefully, I see that not only is the graphic and Window Name info wrong, but the timer elements are missing!<br />
<br />
I'm using IE 6.1 currently. I also tried Netscape 7.0, and the ASP gives me all the names I need, but doesn't display the XML file at all.<br />
<br />
All this leads me to believe that the problem is related to ASP or the browser. Any help appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jayzen- hundreds of times people have asked for this, and the answer remains the same. The ONLY way to restart a timer is to reload the mod you are using. There is no way to apply 'start/stop' functionality to this, or any other timer in EQ. The timer is designed so that you can move the slider to mark a point on the bar (when you cast the buff/mez/spawn dies/ect.) and when the timer rolls back around to that point you know that the duration of the event you are timing is up. Of course, since you can now play EQ in a window, I would bet there is some kinda desktop clock/stopwatch add-on for windows that would give you the functionality you are looking for. Or you could try the old egg timer/stopwatch method some people used before we could customize interfaces. IMO, tho, the timer still retains a huge ammount of usefullness even if I can't restart it.<br />
<br />
Sanchok- sounds like EQ can't find the graphic. I would double check the graphic file you downloaded to make sure it wasn't bad, or you missed a letter in the renaming process.<br />

<br />
Real-life responsibilities have kept me from responding here in a while, but I'll be back here more often once I have more free time (in around two weeks or so). In the meantime, I have fixed the timer XML generator so that it works with the 1/9 patch. If you are currently using the pet window for the timer, just generate a new XML file (do not download the pre-generated downloads, use the web tool to dynamically generate a new file), and it should work with the patch.<br />
<br />
wolja - Generating a new XML file should fix your problem, as mentioned above.<br />
<br />
lunakin - Great post. :) Very clear and to-the-point.<br />
<br />
jayzan777 - See lunakin's post, as it explains the limitations placed on UI mods. A few other posts in this thread also address this topic (for example this one (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=19006#post19006)).<br />
<br />
Sanchok - lunakin's suggestion is right on target and should fix your problem.<br />
<br />
divineeyes - Glad you got it worked out.<br />
<br />
Greybear - I'm not sure what your problem is but it appears to be browser-related. Not sure if this will help, but try using another computer to get the XML if you have access to one.<br />
<br />
rdlilley and narph - Your enhancement suggestions have been noted, and I'll see what I can do when I get back to working on the timer.<br />
<br />
Sorry I've been gone so long, but I promise I'll be back in a couple of weeks. :) I also have some timer updates and enhancements in the works.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xaluen, I recommend using the old timer with the circle.  I put it in my pet window.  You don't need the tab stops that turn numbers green, they're not really necessary.<br />
<br />
Whenever you mez something glance at the timer and see what it's pointing at.  30 seconds is 5 ticks, so if the timer was at 2 when you mezzed, you'll have to remez at 7, then remez again at 2.<br />
<br />
When I have several mobs mezzed I just remember the numbers in my head.   I keep silently repeating to myself, for instance, '2,3,5' ... I can tell at a glance if I have time to cast another spell before the timer gets to 7 and I have to re-mez the first two.  After casting the two  mezzes I'm repeating to myself '5,7,8'... I'll probably take time to cast a tash on the last mob, and then mez it... so then I'm thinking '7,8,0' while I sit to meditate for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
You could use the slider version with several 30-second timers, but I find it's just a hassle to click-and-drag the little sliders when I'm busy.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Quick checklist (for bug window):<br />
<br />
1) You've generated the XML file and saved it as EQUI_BugReportWnd.xml<br />
<br />
2) You've downloaded the zip file containing the graphics file, unzipped it, and placed BugReport_Timer.tga in the same folder (this file shouldn't have to be renamed as it already has the correct name in the zip archive)<br />
<br />
3) Know whether or not you have &quot;Hide extensions for known file types&quot; enabled in your Windows Explorer options, when verifying your filenames. Many people have sent me their files, and I found that they accidentally renamed it to BugReport_Timer.tga.tga, for example.<br />
<br />
If you have done the above and it still doesn't work, zip up your two files (XML and TGA) and send it to me via email (arista@norrath.net). I'll take a look and will let you know what needs to be done to fix it.</div></div><hr />

Yes, what you are asking is possible, but unfortunately I don't currently have the time to mod it for you. To help get you started, you can take a look at the &quot;Timer with Actions Tabs&quot; mod (found in the &quot;Other Downloads&quot; section of my site), which shows how to place the timer in a tab.</div></div><hr />

First of all... great work on this timer. I would love to grab several different versions of it for all my characters, but I am having an issue with the XML Generator. When I ask it to Generate the XML file, I get the following page:<br />
<br />
--- Begin quoted error message ---<br />
The XML page cannot be displayed <br />
Cannot view XML input using XSL style sheet. Please correct the error and then click the Refresh button, or try again later. <br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Only one top level element is allowed in an XML document. Error processing resource 'http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/xml.asp'. Line 86, Position 2 <br />
<br />
&lt;XML ID=&quot;EQInterfaceDefinitionLanguage&quot;&gt;<br />
-^<br />
<br />
--- End quoted error message ---<br />
<br />
If I go to View Source it tells me that the source file is unavailable for viewing. <br />
<br />
I am sure that this is an issue with my browser and/or possibly that Sony uses non-standard XML for EQ. Is it possible to generate the XML code to a standard text document that I could rename? Maybe then my browser could deal with it.  Or possibly to include an executable that could be used to generate the files offline?<br />

I will be updating the site soon to generate the XML to a file on the server, then zip up the XML along with graphics file in a single zip archive file that the user can download. As mentioned above, these changes won't take place until some time next week, as I will be too busy with RL responsibilities until then. In the meantime, you might try using the browser on another computer.<br />

Actually, the slider timer has not used tabs since version 3.2. So if you have a version earlier than that, generate the XML using the latest version and it won't use tabs at all. The button version of the timer (version 4.0) is still on the way, but the current slider timer no longer uses tabs.</div></div><hr />

I can answer this one.  No.  In order for a graphics file to be usable by EQ, its dimensions have  to be a power of two.  2x2, 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, etc. or any combination thereof.  Sizes like 100x200 or 500x1024 won't work.</div></div><hr />

Each slider timer uses a &quot;screen&quot; element to provide the housing for the horizontal scroll bar (the slider). I haven't done any testing as to whether or not tab pages can hold &quot;screen&quot; elements, but when I get the chance I will try it out.<br />

It might look like wasted space, but the blank area to the right of each bar is intentional, and very necessary. It is there so that I can form each and every frame of the bar animation - from an empty bar, to a full bar, and every frame in between.<br />
<br />
For example, for a full bar, the animation frame uses the horizontal area between 0 to 120 (the filled-in part). For an empty bar, the frame uses the area between 120 to 240 (the blank part). For a half-full bar, the frame uses the area between 60 to 180 (half filled). (Through testing, I found that animations consisting of differently-sized frames don't work too well, so each frame needs to be the same size. Hence the extra blank space.)</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, what you're asking isn't possible due to the inability to control animations in the UI. See this previous post (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=19006#post19006) for more details.<br />

Are you referring to the &quot;split-slider&quot; problem, where the slider triangle appears to be split in two?<br />
<br />
I logged into EQ today for the first time in a while (was too busy with RL to play), and saw this problem. I was kind of freaked out, as I don't know how long it's been there. If you're telling me that it was caused by the 2/6 patch, then I'm a bit more relieved. I'm looking into it now and hope to have a patch up soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, if you put the timer within about 10 pixels of the top of your screen and toggle it on and off, it will move about 20 pixels to the left each time. I use the Target window for mine, so it's &lt;Alt&gt;-T ... I just hit it a bunch of times and watch the thing slide across my screen... <br />
<br />
But if I move it down about 30 pixels, it stays put.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />

I have updated the XML generator with a workaround that addresses the &quot;split-slider&quot; issue, so generating a new XML file will fix the problem. For the window moving problem, please see Sony's thread (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/037377.html) for more details.<br />
<br />
The workaround for the slider visual bug is temporary for now, depending on whether or not the next patch restores the original behavior for scroll bars. If it does, I'll revert the timer to the original version.<br />
<br />
Also, a quick note to those of you who have sent me email over the last couple of weeks, but haven't received a response yet: Sorry about the delay, but due to being swamped with RL work, I haven't had the chance to go through my email in a while. I'll definitely respond as soon as I find the time. In the meantime, if you have a question regarding installation, troubleshooting, etc., please post here as there are a lot of knowledgable folks around who have gone through the installation.</div></div><hr />

I'm grabbing your patch for now, but I'm not uploading the fix for my skin to EQGui until there's a final patch ( or not ) for this. Probably after the next patch we'll know if they're re-fixing gauges or leaving them broken.<br />

How would one go about modifying it to be a bit shorter?<br />
<br />
The timer bar is currently 120 pixels wide. So there are 120 frames in the animation - each frame's duration is the total duration divided by 120 (down to millisecond granularity). Extra care is taken to ensure all frames add up to exactly the full timer duration even when rounding needs to occur. In addition, the maximum duration per frame is limited to 10 seconds, so any frame that needs to have a longer duration must be broken down into multiple frames (for example, to create a 25-second frame, you must make two 10-second frames and one 5-second frame using the same image).<br />
<br />
To make the timer smaller in size, you would have to have fewer frames (as the timer already uses one frame per pixel), and adjust the duration accordingly for each frame. In addition, there are other changes needed to adjust the size/position of the other elements (slider, etc.). It is probably too tedious of a task to perform by hand, especially modifying the animation frames in the XML file. In a future release of the web-based XML generator, I will consider adding options to change the size of the timer.<br />

The short answer is: no, what you are asking for is not possible due to the limitations of player-made UI mods. For more information, look for my next post (later today), which will explain in more detail.</div></div><hr />

To save myself some time, I've decided to write up a detailed post on what isn't possible in the timer mod and why, so I can answer all of these questions with a single post.<br />
<br />
The information in this post is not new; these questions have been answered and discussed previously in this forum. This post is just a consolidation of those topics, which can be found in the following places:<br />
- Several posts in this timer thread<br />
- Several posts in my other three timer threads (linked to the first post of this thread under &quot;Old Forum Threads&quot;)<br />
- The timer FAQ on my website<br />
- Various posts in other threads here at EQGUI (mostly in the request forum and developer discussions area)<br />
<br />
Impossible enhancements<br />
<br />
Here is a list of requests I frequently receive. If you have a question along the lines of the ones listed here, please read this entire post carefully, as it will explain why your request is not possible.<br />
<br />
Can you add a reset button that restarts the timer?<br />
Can you add pause/resume buttons for the timer?<br />
Can you add a button that moves the slider automatically to the position of the bar?<br />
Can you start the timer automatically when I cast my spell or use my ability?<br />
Can the timer resume from where it left off between sessions?<br />
Can the timer show system time, or Norrath time?<br />
Can you add new commands (like /timer start) that let me control the timer with macro hotkeys?<br />
Can you add functions/variables I can access with my own UI mod?<br />
Can the timer be set up to automatically execute in-game commands at specified intervals?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the answer to all of these questions is no. These enhancements are impossible due to the limitations of UI mods.<br />
<br />
Player-made UI mods<br />
<br />
First, I'll start with some general information on UI mods for those who are unfamiliar with the capabilities and limitations of UI mods.<br />
<br />
Player-made UI mods can only alter the appearance of the UI, they cannot add any new functionality. So, you can change the size, color, position, etc. of various elements in the UI, and you can add things like text labels and images (including animations - more on this later) to be displayed, as well as standard UI controls. However, you cannot add any actual functionality, such as new commands, or new buttons that execute commands. Anything that has functionality in the UI is hard-coded in the EverQuest client (i.e., only Sony can add new functionality).<br />
<br />
Another important related point is that UI mods are not &quot;programs&quot;. There are no function calls, no variables, no way to execute any commands or detect when particular events occur. UI mods consist of only two simple parts: XML data files, which contain information loaded by the EverQuest UI engine, and graphics files, which contain images used by the mod. The XML data files must contain only those nodes allowed by Sony's pre-defined schema, and they specify the various attributes of the UI's appearance only (see previous paragraph).<br />
<br />
Animations<br />
<br />
An animation is basically an image composed of multiple frames, which are displayed in sequence. Each frame consists of a fixed duration and an image that is displayed for the extent of that duration. An animation always starts with the first frame, and continues through its list of frames. After the last frame has been displayed, a repeating-type animation will start over from the first frame.<br />
<br />
As soon as the EverQuest UI loads up (when you log in or whenever you type /loadskin), all animations in the UI begin displaying each of their frames in sequence. There is no way to pause an animation or force it to start from a particular frame at a particular time. Reloading the UI via /loadskin will reset all animations, causing them to start over from the first frame. This, however, freezes the display temporarily and takes too long on some systems, and does not allow animations to reset independently of each other.<br />
<br />
UI Timer<br />
<br />
Based on the above information, one can see that my timer mod is not a program at all - it is nothing more than a collection of animations. Depending on which type of timer you choose, each animation is either a bar, dial, or numerical digit. These animations cannot be controlled and have no connection to in-game events.<br />
<br />
Due to the limitations and lack of ability to control animations, the slider and tick marker were introduced for the bar and dial timers, respectively (these markers must be manually set, as they have no awareness of or connection to the animations). These give the user the ability to manually &quot;mark&quot; the animation, allowing you to begin timing at any point during the animation's cycle. With these, the timers can be used without mentally keeping track of when timing started or resorting to reloading the UI.<br />
<br />
I hope this post has been helpful for those who have been wondering about possible enhancements or why the timer is designed this way. If you have any additional questions please feel free to let me know.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, due to my extremely busy schedule I won't have time to fulfill custom requests that are (1) based on personal taste and will vary from user to user, and (2) easy for users to do themselves. You have two options here:<br />
<br />
Option A:<br />
Your easiest option is to choose a different color for your timer. The XML generator provides 5 colors to choose from for this very reason. If you don't like the green bar, just choose a different color.<br />
<br />
Option B:<br />
You can edit the graphics file to get the exact color you want. I know you mentioned you tried this already, but the process is very straightforward and should work if you do the following: (1) Open the TGA in a paint program that supports TGA files (2) Choose the exact shade of green that you want, and fill in the bar with that color (3) Save the file and load up the UI. If you experience any trouble, you should be able to get any help you need in the &quot;Graphics help/discussion&quot; forum.</div></div><hr />

If the timer uses the compass window, then it is possible to have the compass in there at the same time. This can be done by generating the timer(s) you want, then replacing the &quot;dummy&quot; (zero-size) compass XML elements with the default elements (from the default XML file). Some location tweaking will also be required to position things where you want them.<br />
<br />
However, this type of &quot;combo&quot; mod will not be made available through the XML generator, due to it being a special case for the compass window. A pre-generated configuration will not work either, as it is impossible to anticipate how many timers and what durations people want. I will soon add more windows to choose from for the timer (for example, the /loadskin window), so hopefully one of them will work better for you.<br />

Actually, I played EQ for a few hours yesterday and my timer was working fine (I had it in the pet info window). I'm guessing that the group window timer might be broken, as that was listed as one of the changed files, but all other timer windows should be working fine with the LoY patch.<br />

<br />
First off my modded window is 125 wide and you would think that the 120 wide bar would fit but it wont all show unless i change my mod to 135 wide.  So I ended up compressing the bar by 10 pixles.<br />

I removed 10 frames, I added the difference of time to all the other frames.<br />
<br />
I made the guage 10 pixles less and the bar 10 pixles less<br />

Now the problem i have is that when the guage starts to cycle it starts with a small chunk of the bar already visibly filled. My guess is that its about 10 pixles wide.<br />
<br />
I tried changing the width of the bar in the animation from 120 to 110 and this did not fix the problem.<br />

What I think Musc is asking about is making it so that he can just move his mouse pointer over to the current position of the timer bar and click and have that little upwards pointing arrows move to where he just clicked.

What most people normally do is create a set of timers that they want to use on a regular basis, or multiple sets of timers for various types of situations (e.g., raid timer set, xp grind timer set; you can have each set loaded in a different window for quick access).<br />
<br />
For example, let's say that you have some buffs that you regularly cast. For each buff that you want to time, add a timer to your timer configuration with that buff's duration (duration info available from Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net/), then scale the duration based on your focus items and AA abilities). To create a general-use timer (for spawns, etc.) make a timer with a round-number duration (for example in a 30-minute timer, each tick mark represents 1 minute). Here is a timer configuration that a druid might use:<br />
http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/images/timers_compact_faded.jpg<br />
<br />
When you want to begin timing, just move the slider to point to the current position of that timer's bar. That's all you need to do - when the bar reaches the slider's position again, you'll know that one full duration of the timer has elapsed. For instance, when you cast a buff, move the slider to point to the current position of that buff's timer bar. The bar keeps moving, and as it approaches the slider's position again, you'll know it's time to refresh the buff.<br />

Raynsmajic - I think the above explanation also answers part of your question as well. Each timer has a pre-defined duration, which you specify when you generate your timer configuration. To give a name to your timer (like &quot;Mend&quot;), just edit the timer name field in the XML generator. The name you enter will show up as a text label on your timer.<br />
<br />
As for moving the slider, you can currently either click on the buttons to move it in small increments, or click on the bar itself on either side of the slider, to move it in larger increments. In version 4.0 of the timer I'll be adding more options for the marker which will allow easier positioning of the marker.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I have received a number of requests for variable sizing. I'll definitely add some sizing options to the XML generator in a future version of the timer. (When I'll have this done will depend on my RL work schedule, but it'll probably be sometime around the late-April to early-May time frame.)</div></div><hr />

Ok, I downloaded this, and the whole thing is completely clear except for the text saying Mend and 6:00.  Can someone please tell me how to fix it?<br />
This happens when the UI cannot find the graphics file. The most common causes are (see if any of these apply): You forgot to download the graphics file when you generated the XML, or you downloaded the graphics file for the wrong window. If this is the case, just go back to the timer generator and click &quot;Download Graphics File&quot;. Important: Make sure you have the correct window selected in the drop-down list when you click the button, since each window uses a differently-named file.<br />
<br />
 You didn't unzip the file after you downloaded it. In the past, some players didn't realize that the graphics file was contained in a zip file, and simply put the zip file as-is in the folder instead of extracting the TGA file. Some even renamed it to the appropriate name (specified in the XML file), but since the file itself is still zipped it isn't a valid image file. To fix, just unzip and place the TGA in the folder.<br />
<br />
 You renamed the file incorrectly because the &quot;Hide extensions for known file types&quot; option is checked in Windows Explorer. This results in files ending in .TGA.TGA because one of the extensions is hidden. Important: You typically never need to rename your TGA file, because the zip file already contains the correctly-named file. The only exception to this is if you are using one of the custom skins from the skins page.Hope this helps you troubleshoot your installation.</div></div><hr />

I just generated a set of timers using the settings you specified, and it worked just fine for me (see screenshot).<br />

<br />
Chances are, you didn't wait for the entire XML file to finish downloading before saving it to disk. This causes an incomplete XML file to be saved, which results in an error when you try to load it. To see if that's what happened, scroll to the bottom of the file you saved; if the last line is not &quot;&lt;/XML&gt;&quot;, then it means you saved it before it was done downloading.<br />
<br />
To fix this, just generate the file again, but wait and make sure the full file is finished downloading before you save it, by scrolling down to the bottom and making sure the last line is &quot;&lt;/XML&gt;&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I've noticed the screenshots in this forum and on your site of the compact timer (and, in fact the default one, too) with what appears to be a transparent background.  I just today downloaded your compact timer (it works great, by the way), but I have a somewhat disappointing milky gray background.

I'm using it in the bug window if that makes a difference.  Am I missing something, or are my gamma settings in game that much different from everyone elses?<br />

I just today downloaded your compact timer (it works great, by the way), but I have a somewhat disappointing milky gray background.  Changing the fade in game also fades away the gauges, and selecting a texture for the background blots out the whole window.<br />
The screenshots you're referring to were taken after the window's fade settings were adjusted in-game. As you've mentioned already, doing this does also fade the gauge along with the rest of the window.<br />
<br />
I usually choose a fade setting of 75, which is a good balance between fading the background some and not fading the gauge too much. I usually also set both the normal and faded settings to the same value so it always looks the same (personal preference).<br />
<br />
After reading this post, I played around with the graphics file a bit and changed the background to be partially transparent. This allows the window fade setting to remain at 100 so that the gauge appears solid. Here is a comparison of the various options:<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=41967<br />
<br />
Default - 100 Default graphics, with fade setting at 100. This keeps both the gauge and background solid.<br />
Default - 75 (my favorite option) Default graphics, with fade setting at 75. This fades the whole window a bit but keeps the gauge visible.<br />
Default - 50 Default graphics, with fade setting at 50. This makes the background clear but the gauge can be too faded in some cases.<br />
Transparent Alternate graphics, with fade setting at 100. This one has a background which is already transparent. With the fade setting at 100, the gauge stays solid.<br />
<br />
Even though the transparent graphics looks like a reasonable choice, I found that in dark areas, it makes the background look a bit washed out, whereas the in-game fade always looks good in all areas. No matter how I adjusted the graphics, the in-game fade (with default graphics) always looks better against a dark surface. I'll probably play around with the graphics some more, but I'll attach it here anyway (next post), in case anyone wants to use it.</div></div><hr />

To use it, unzip it into the timer mod directory and rename the file to match the name of the graphics file you currently have. As I mentioned in the previous post, this alternate graphics file makes the background look washed out in some areas. I still personally prefer using the default graphics at 75 fade.</div></div><hr />

So far, I've had no problems using my timers with the Vert mod. Please indicate which window you are using, and post any &quot;Error&quot; lines from your UIErrors.txt. In general, when mixing two mods together, errors might possibly be caused by overwriting a file which defines elements referenced by other files.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, that's odd; what browser are you using? When that button is clicked, the browser should display a dialog prompting you to download a .zip file. It's possible your browser doesn't handle this as expected.<br />
<br />
If you have access to Internet Explorer (5.5 or 6.0), give it a try using that browser, since I know it works for sure with IE. If you are still experiencing trouble, please give more details and hopefully I can help.</div></div><hr />

Ellyana - I'll put that on the enhancement list for an upcoming version, thanks for suggesting it.<br />
<br />
Daerk - It looks like you might have downloaded the file correctly, but somehow Netscape is saving it as GemsGame_Timer.zip.asp (the extra extension wouldn't show up if you have &quot;Hide file extensions for known file types&quot; enabled). Try one of the following:<br />
<br />
1) Disable &quot;Hide file extensions for known file types&quot; to see the full file name (open My Computer, then in the menu, select: Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; View). If there is indeed an extra .asp extension, remove it so that the file has a .zip extension.<br />
2) If that isn't the case, open a WinZip window, then drag and drop the file into it to see if it opens (if it is a valid archive it will open).<br />
3) If somehow the file is not a valid archive, try downloading the file using Internet Explorer, which works better with the site than Netscape.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

No, you should not modify the UI_Animations.xml file at all. The TGA name is already specified in the timer XML file, that's why you get the duplicate elements if you specify it yourself. All you need to do is place the timer XML and TGA files into your folder - you don't need to manually modify any files.<br />

The timer is not a program, so it cannot detect or respond to in-game events such as casting a spell. Please see my Impossible Enhancements (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=36262#post36262) post for a more detailed explanation.</div></div><hr />

One other question - request  <br />
I know you can have multiple slide timers in a window  can you have multiple digital timers like this.<br />

While it's possible to put multiple digital timers in your UI, there would be very little reason to do so, because you can't reset them independently of each other. Reloading the UI resets all of them at the same time, so you can't time different things with them. If you want to time multiple things, multiple slider timers are your best bet.</div></div><hr />

Would it be possible to build a timer into the adventure window, where you minimize and only see the timer and when maximazed you see the regular window?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you want to begin timing, simply move the slider to the current position of the bar. The bar will continue moving and reach the slider's position again when one full duration of the timer has elapsed.<br />
<br />
So, when you first enter the adventure, move the slider to point to the bar's current position for the 1:30:00 timer. Your time to complete the adventure will expire when the bar reaches the slider's position again. Then, when your group succeeds/fails the adventure, move the slider on the 0:30:00 timer to point to that bar's current position. The dungeon will shut down when that bar reaches the slider's position again.</div></div><hr />

Actually, none of the files in the &quot;Other Downloads&quot; section are dynamically generated, because they are special manually-created mods of the timer (so the files were pre-generated from an older version of the timer). If you look closely, you'll see a note stating that the downloads in that section not been updated yet for the 10/9 patch (I should probably make the text larger, or in a different color; thanks for bringing it up).<br />
<br />
The &quot;Other Downloads&quot; section is pretty much obsolete now, but I've kept it around for the time being in case people want to download the old files. I'm planning to phase it out since most people use the dynamically generated timers anyway, because they are customizable to each person's needs. For an up-to-date timer that is compatible with the latest patch, please customize and generate a timer at one of the following sections:<br />
<br />
Slider Timer (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/customize.asp)<br />
Dial/Digital Timer (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/customize2.asp)<br />
<br />
I will see about removing the old section and/or updating the old mods this weekend, if time permits.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The obsolete &quot;Other Downloads&quot; section has now been removed from the website. Please use one of the other sections (linked above) to generate custom timers.</div></div><hr />

Soleanla - as Amitan points out in one of the posts above, there is a note on the timer page indicating a workaround for this (close and re-open the gems window). Unfortunately, this behavior is a &quot;feature&quot; of the gems window that only Sony can modify. As long you close the gems window (via ESC or context menu) one time after the first time the gems window is opened, you can re-open it afterward and still move around as usual.<br />

Amitan - yes, this can be done. The file would need to be manually modified to include all the &lt;Pieces&gt; from both your custom music window and the timer. Once the XML elements for all the pieces are included, you'll need to tweak the &lt;Location&gt; of each piece to arrange them as desired within the window (which would most likely need to be made larger to accomodate everything).<br />

rouge - it sounds like you've created timers with zero duration (the text on each timer is a static label indicating the duration of the timer). For the timer bar to appear, you must specify a non-zero duration for each timer. The duration you choose should be the length of the event you want to time. The bar runs in a continuously looping animation; when you want to begin timing, you simply move the slider to point to the bar's current position. The bar will keep moving and reach the slider's position again when exactly one full duration of the timer has elapsed. Here are some usage examples from the FAQ (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/faq.asp):<br />
Let's say that you want to time an ability like mend, which is available every 6 minutes. So you would create a timer with a 6-minute duration. Whenever you use mend, move the slider to the current position of the bar. It will take the bar exactly 6 minutes to reach the slider again. Or if you want to time a buff like Spirit of Wolf, which lasts 36 minutes, you would make a 36-minute timer. Whenever you cast Spirit of Wolf, move the slider to the current position of the bar. As the bar approaches the slider again, you'll know when the buff is about to wear off.</div></div><hr />

This .zip file should contain 3 files, which should be unzipped into your UI folder. If you are running into some problems, here are some things you can try:<br />
<br />
1) If you used a browser other than Internet Explorer, try downloading the file using Internet Explorer (5.5 or 6.0).<br />
<br />
2) Try downloading the file from a different computer if you have access to one.<br />
<br />
3) Open the .zip file in WinZip to make sure it is a valid archive, and that there are 3 files in there.<br />
<br />
4) If all else fails, and you are still getting invalid files, send me the .zip file that you downloaded and I'll take a look.<br />

Is it impossible or very difficult to code a stopwatch type timer?<br />
<br />
Something with start and stop buttons?  I ask because with the timer I am using, when I want to restart it at 0, I have to reload the entire UI, some people that may take a little while (depending on machine) in my case, after the reload, I am already about 15 seconds (or so) in the timer.  There is also no way to stop the timer once I am done timeing something.<br />
<br />
I normally time stuff like how long does it take to get from point A to point B, or timing something new and waiting for it to pop.  Having a stop watch style with start and stop buttons would be great!<br />
<br />
I also use it to determine how much XP I am getting per minute/hour.<br />

Unfortunately, due to the limitations of UI mods, this isn't possible to do. Player-made UI mods can pretty much only alter the appearance of the UI. New functionality can only be added by Sony. For a more detailed explanation, please read my post on this subject: Impossible Enhancements (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=36262#post36262). Hopefully that post will answer most of your questions.<br />

Instead of reloading the UI, I would recommend that you use the sliders found on the bar timers. The sliders were added so you never need to reload the UI. Even though slider timers are the easiest to use for fixed-duration events (such as buffs/debuffs and abilities) where the duration of the timer matches the duration of the event exactly, they can also be used to time variable-duration events by creating timers with round-number durations (like 30 minutes or 60 minutes). For example, with a 30-minute timer, each small notch represents one minute, and each large notch represents 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />

I do have a question for arista...<br />
<br />
You said you couldnt do start stop....<br />
<br />
Can you make it to where the sliders move instead of the bar...or where the bar is movable.  Basically like that you could manually reset by just moving the line.<br />
<br />
Like if I had a timer of 1:30  there could be an extra 1:30 on each side of it, and it was only a portion of the entire bar colored.<br />
<br />
Maybe that makes some sense to you.  Most likely I think you'll say not possible.  Anyways, this is truly one of the greatest most useful tools for eq I have ever seen.  I've addicted several guildies to it already p.</div></div><hr />
