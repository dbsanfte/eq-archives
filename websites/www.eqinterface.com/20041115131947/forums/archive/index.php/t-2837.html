&quot;First off, many thanks to Remelio and Geddine for their great buff window mods and inspiration for this mod.<br />
<br />
I was driven to create this mod because I couldn't decide between Geddine or Remelio's buff mods. I liked the simple red and blue colors Remelio created, and in the big buff version, the whole spell name fit in two lines. I also liked the smaller font of Geddine's mod, but more importantly, the numbering of each buff.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Clean look  :D</div></div><hr />
