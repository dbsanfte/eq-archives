<br />
The pic for this download shows a Delta 3+ image?<br />
<br />
Delta 4 has Spell gems on a vertical on the Left side.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please confirm that this download is Delta 4 with the correct spell gem location or another version?<br />
<br />
Would like to know if something exists before i get home from work.</div></div><hr />

1. When I target something, I like to see the target color in the target box.<br />

<br />
Err, I should have said, I like to see the con color in the target box, which<br />
is a regular feature of the default UI. I would take that over anything with the size of the spellbook icon, honestly.<br />
<br />
I should make that a major quibble. The spellbook icon size is secondary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">atomhead</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted some comments on the actual release but will repeat here.<br />
<br />
The spellbook icon is a bit hard to click on, if it's not too much trouble to increase the size I would appreciate it :) Also the background on the spell names in buff box is a white box semi-see though, rather than the small halo.. it stands out a bit too much, not sure if it's possible to fix or if I just installed it wrong. Last issue was all the boxes were faded after i loaded skin, had to return to 100pct for all of them.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the update though :)</div></div><hr />

To the guy who wanted the target window color, let me see how I can do that as an option. Since there really is not a 'target window' so to speak, I'd have to be creative with how i did it. If you wouldn't mind maybe taking the screen shot and drawing on it in paint or something to show me how you'd like to see it and PM it to me, that'd be great. There really isn't a background area for it like there is in the default.</div></div><hr />

There was a fix for this in Delta 3, located here:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?t=8812&amp;page=20&amp;pp=15<br />
<br />
Basically, there were little borders around the targeted health area that turned con color of the mob.<br />
<br />
Tiarra Kai did manage to fix this for Delta 3 users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rattfink</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would like to request an updated version of Delta4 with the vertical spell list.<br />
<br />
I like having the name of the spell next to the icon, helps when 2boxing so I cast the wrong spell by getting the spell gems mixed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aalwein</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things aren't working for me.  the spell gem icons are smooshed left a little on each gem so the 9th gem is half on and half off the actual space for it. additionally the buff bars are totally fubared - they are squished almost triple into the space while the actual icons stay normal size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shoyarite</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd also like to request for the vertical spell bar, and on the left hand side if you could please  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Webslinger</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I just downloaded the files Tiarra Kai made for Delta 3.0,<br />
and they still work for your UI. I am so happy!!!<br />
<br />
Now if someone could just fix the augmentation window, this would<br />
be the ideal UI for me!<br />
<br />
The horizontal spell bar rules!</div></div><hr />
