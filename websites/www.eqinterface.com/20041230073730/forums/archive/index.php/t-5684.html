Grot, <br />

been playing since right after Kunark, and even with remaking a couple, I still have 2 Empty Slots,<br />
<br />
56 bard<br />
32 Mage<br />
24 Rogue<br />
22 Druid<br />
10 Shammy<br />
14 mage --- MULE<br />
<br />
I am not critisizing... just thinking if you actualy have 8 character all over lvl 40, (picked a decent number) maybe a second account is the way to go..<br />

I agree,  8 players is not enough considering the size of Everquest now, and considering how many years the game has been around.  If Verant has any interest in keeping customers, they will increase it... its to their benefit.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you can just play on another server, but most people don't want to do that if they have friends on the server their on now.<br />
<br />
There is no way I would ever buy a 2nd account though.  It would be a total waste of money... as it would require buying all the expansions again.</div></div><hr />

But I don't plan on playing a froggie much, and after I play around with one for a bit I'll prolly delete him.  I love my druid too much to really spend time on another toon. :)</div></div><hr />

I think Frogloks should be like Euridites.  Just look at Guk .  There's tons of evil frogloks there.  Granted they are considered undead I think, but a sk or necro isn't far from there anyhow.<br />
<br />
And I would love to make a froglok SK if Sony would make it possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">froglok walk/run IS jumping..<br />
<br />
and give it time.. Eurdites were not always both, they started for a year as good only..<br />
<br />
<br />
they added in Painell in Feb 2001 nearly 2 years after EQ went live..<br />
<br />
sooo if frogs are popular, maybe you will see an addition down the road..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a feeling that, at least initially, they will be very popular.  I'm not sure how long that popularity will hold however, but for a short while at least whatever city it is the Frogloks start at will be extremely crowded.  That's how it was with Paineel too, though now Paineel is seemingly deserted.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everquest got 8 characters, except people on FV server only have 1 !! On top of that you can have a set of 8 chracters on each server, excpet again FV.<br />
<br />
Star Wars Galaxies will only be supporting 1 character, so the initial choice will be even harder. <br />
<br />
There are lots of other games out there, that doesn't support as many as EQ, so I actually think we are spoiled.<br />

<br />
not only will SWG only support 1 character per server... its a max of 10 characters total over ALL servers.. <br />
<br />
or at least that was the last thing I read on the SWG site.. of course I missed the announcement for a release date of March 15.. sooo what the hell do  I know ROFL!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arkusrex</div><div class="date">01-24-2003, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there should be a number of slots equal to the number of classes.Im working on getting all of those played to at least 30.I deleted 150 levels on the Tribunal before I invaded Kane Bayle(leaving 297 levels of characters to twiddle their collective thumbs).I reprised my Necro main there to make a &quot;beachead&quot; there so I could use the other slots to get the remaining classes to 30(thats the minimum,dosen't mean I wont keep rolling along if I'm having fun).Problem with the froggy is I've done all those classes already.I think they should have let them be bards their stats maybe a bit better suited to that and rogue more then anything else.Rogue is a class I've yet to play(well past 12 anyway).That would help me out with my class goal.Failing that however I may tinker with the race as a cleric or wizard since it's been a few years since I've played those and the other choices are ongoing projects.So to sum up:P...More slots and more class choices for the Frenc...I mean Frogloks:)</div></div><hr />

I wish they would double the toon slots like they did the bank slots. <br />
<br />
I have 8 toons, and all are 30-56... I been playing since the game was released with a few months here and there off.</div></div><hr />
