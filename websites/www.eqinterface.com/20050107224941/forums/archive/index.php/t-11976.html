<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hotspot</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My problem is I downloaded a new ui from here. I loaded it with my rogue and it works just great. however i went to use the same one with my cleric, but it uses stamina for a guage instead of mana. <br />
<br />
I went to my old original eq ui to find out the stuff i needed to change as well as found out the syntax codes for mana instead of stamina. I then took the new ui player window, went to the source and changed the stamina guage to a mana guage. Ok i changed everything properly that should be, just swapping out the stamina lines with mana lines, but when I go to load this new skin for my cleric the player window box goes back to just 3 bars as if it were the original eq bar.<br />
<br />
The ui should have hp, %, mana %, atk, all stats, and so on, not just a small box with hp,mana,sta bars. <br />
<br />
any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

If you look at the custom player window you downloaded, you will find the mana bar there, just made invisible (likely sized to 0,0 - possibly commented out).  Change the mana bar to the dimensions and location of the stamina bar, and 0,0 the stamina bar out.</div></div><hr />
