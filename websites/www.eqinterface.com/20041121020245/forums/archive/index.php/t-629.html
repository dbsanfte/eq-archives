<br />
I'm designing a baseline UI for my guildmates and I. Not a custom one, but a baseline that can keep to a guild theme and be modified to suit each individual. For those who want. I changed the title window in the inventory to our guildname for example.<br />
The first image is 80% of normal size. The second is 100%. Bear that in mind.<br />
<br />
What I've done is combine 4 windows into 1:<br />
<br />
Hotbuttons,<br />
PlayerWindow,<br />
GroupWindow,<br />
And my old modified pet window (I had originally changed it to a melee-swap window, but I changed it back to default).<br />
<br />
Put all 4 of those into the hotbox window. Which frees up the pet window, group window and player window for other uses if I want.<br />
This is what it looks like:<br />

<br />
<br />
After that, I changed the group window (cos I dont need it anymore). I decided I'd make a long window that was 1 icon high to contain all my inventory slots for fast item-clicking.<br />
So I came up with this:<br />
<br />
http://www.dinuvian.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/images/clickwindow.jpg<br />
<br />
The box is 1 icon high as you can see, and it sits on top of my chat boxes (you can see them above). The best thing about it, is that because it used to be the group window, I can toggle it on/off with ALT-P.<br />
<br />
Final changes I made (which arent shown) were changing the cursor to the sword in the windows1.tga, and moving the buffwindow further right to take up less room.<br />
<br />
That's it so far. I thought I'd share with you all :)</div></div><hr />

I read that post, and many others on this site.  I still don't get it, I got my image put into the window_peices01.tga file, and and made what I added appear in white on the alpha channel.  But it is doing absolutly nothing for me, my cursor still looks like default.  I've spend many hours over the last few days trying to get this, would greatly appreciate any help I can get, and speak as simple as possible please &gt;&lt;.  Case it matters, I did my work in Photo Shop. :confused:</div></div><hr />
