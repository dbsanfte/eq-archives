Thanks to a tip by Renah of The Nameless and Torowan of Morell Thule, I headed over to Jagged Pine to the part marked on the EQ Atlas map as a blocked tunnel. It's blocked no more. It is a new zone called Nedaria's Landing, which must have been added with the last patch. From what I can tell, the zone is much like Jagged Pine in makeup, but a somewhat lower level - maybe lower 30's. <br />
<br />
The zone is mostly forest, with a huge cliff cutting across the middle and some cool looking waterfalls. There is a wayfarer camp in the NE corner of the zone, but no merchants or adventures. However, Morden Rasp is there. When hailed, they talk about constructing a new ship. <br />
<br />
I am not sure if this is a new LDoN zone still under construction, or just a regular new zone that didn't get announced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I visited the new zone last night... evidently there isn't many people who know of this zone as my partner and I were the only ones in the zone for nearly an hour and a half, wandering and taking in the sights. Though I wondered as well if the zone was still under construction as during that time we were taking on dark blues and our experience did not go up once. But the graphics are absolutely wonderful. The waterfalls are non-lag intensive (unlike the waterfall were the Brell gnolls are in Jaggedpines) and the bears have received a visual and action upgrade. It was pretty cool to see them. Not to mention the ocean as well. Most impressive.<br />
<br />
The only thing though, if this is indeed a zone for lower levels (20-35) the trip there can be quite hazardous to say the least. Just trying to swim across the river to get to the new zone is an adventure indeed as the potomeids decided that I was a most favorable target. I hope they tone this down for when the zone is fully completed and the experience is available. Otherwise the trip alone there could kill you if your not aware. Journey well and travel safe wayward adventurers.</div></div><hr />
