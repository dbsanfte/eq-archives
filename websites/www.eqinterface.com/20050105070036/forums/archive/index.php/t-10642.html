<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellyana</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel that the addition of the &quot;buff&quot; window for pets was a waste of dev time and resources. Why add more frivolous code to clog up the works?  you could already see what buffs your pets had by using the /report health  command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kinda like it actually, helpful for me now not to clog up a hotbutton key as well as always keeping an eye on the buffs closer =) Just a matter of taste I guess :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onetwo1212</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I for one think this was a good idea.  My main is a necro, so I am always keeping an eye on his buffs, mainly his haste buff.  The coding was already there for the most part with the exceptions of the new EQ types and the pet window changes.  There is no big change in packet info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellyana</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">with the /pet report health  command you got a list of all buffs in text format(easy to read and one button to push). With this Icon you have to hold your pointer over each icon to see what it is...<br />
Im not saying its a bad feature..just thatthe time and effort could have been used to fix or create something a little more useful.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I love the  &quot;FIND&quot; thingy.. I wish it worked in all zones  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elyias</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Beastlord I personally love it.  Frees up a hotkey, Can tell what buffs my warder has at a glance.  And I know right away when a buff drops.  As a melee/pet class I have missed the spell_01 fades message more then once since I am paying more attn to mobs on screen then text.  Hell I always buff my pet in the same exact order so it becomes very obvious which one is gone and I know right away which one I need to rebuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellyana</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree it is a matter of personal choice ;) I personaly combine pet commands so I can get a report of health and buffs with out haveing to hit a serperate key.<br />
<br />
<br />
(1)<br />
/pet attack<br />
/pet report health<br />
<br />
(2)<br />
/pet report health<br />
/pet follow me<br />
<br />
I can however see your point. Its the same thing with the castspell and Buff/SDBuff some people rely only on the icons others cant live without the text(like me)   :)<br />
<br />
<br />
...did i mention i love the new &quot;FIND&quot; thingy  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could just as easily argue that the entire pet window is a waste, there's nothing in it that you can't recreate with hotkeys or commands.  <br />
<br />
It's one of those things some people will love, and some won't care for, you can always make the buffs not show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree with Ellyana.<br />
<br />
If they wanted to add buff icons on pet they should atleast make a window like buff window/shortdurationwindow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100% agree... And put the button to toggle that window on/off on the pet window..<br />
<br />
It's an awesome addition.. But, The way they did it is a nightmare!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Sidenote: We should probably check these things out on test.. Complain before it goes in..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My mag loves the new pet buff window. :) I dont think it was a waste if there time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenney</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pet buff window is a great idea but it should of been a diff window like the bard window ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It fits perfectly in with my UI after a few adjustments.  It's not esential information, but its not hurting anything either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As an enchanter I *LOVE* the pet buff window. <br />
<br />
Animations don't respond to the /pet report health command, now I can monitor the buffs on my animation visually, just like managing my own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont get me wrong i think its a great idea but just as of yet i havent seen a pet window that fits into into my UI, (soes style)<br />
Maybe soon there will be buffs around the window, on side or top but as of now i not a realy good fan of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't seen it yet, but I would have to agree that it is a good addition cause there are many times that I haven't seen one of my warders critical buffs (its nuke for example) has dissappeared in the massive text roll by.<br />
<br />
But of course this now means that I have to rearrange my windows layout cause I am sure its not the same size as it originally was... But I could be wrong, as like I said, I haven't been online since the patch to witness it. So who knows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seeiel</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They think more of aesthetics and shortcuts than making it easier on programming for custom UI's. :(</div></div><hr />
