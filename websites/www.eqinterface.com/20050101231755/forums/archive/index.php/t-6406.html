<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hackerflux</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/cry I just want to use the skin I have always been using, and not be forced to use one that is any less nifty. I have read all the fixes and made attempts to fix the problems, but it still doesn't work, and I know to many of you it seems simple, but I just can't figure it out, so if anyone would like to download the skin I use and fix it, I would be extremely grateful, and maybe could help you in game of you are on mith marr, with something, I dunno. I am so bummed at this point, lol, silly eh?<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is a link to my website, you can go to the link on the left that says &quot;skins&quot; http://eq.dam3d.com<br />
<br />
or you can just download it directly here http://eq.dam3d.com/skins/Zan_Current.zip<br />
<br />
Thankyou in advance :)<br />
<br />
PS, I thought someone might ask, so I am attaching my uierror.txt log, if you download and try and use the skin im sure you will get the same anyway.</div></div><hr />

Those are your problems, right there.  You need to find that information in the original mod and make sure that they are still there in the current version of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hackerflux</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I appriciate the swift reply, but I dont understand what you mean, I am a newb. I have no idea what you are saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hackerflux</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not speak the language you are speaking there, I do not know how to find that code, or even if that is what I am supposed to do. Though I am computer literate, just not a programmer. I know a little html, that is it.<br />
<br />
So if someone could explain to me (like I am 5 years old) exactly what to do, I would greatly appriciate it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hackerflux</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So as you can see, it is some version od vert, with some slight modifications, to make it just a bit more neato. I really like this version, the windows and everything are exactly how I would make them myself if I knew how. HEPL! /beg<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hackerflux</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, I got one response, and that response did not help. I do not understand what I need to do. If someone could please just explain it to me, in simple terms, (i.e. : open this file in notepad, edit this line,) exactly, telling me clearly what I can do to fix the issue, I wold appriciate it, im a newbie, please be gentle, and clear.</div></div><hr />

Are there any benifits from being a Mithaniel Marr Wizard?  Or would you suggest going Agnostic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hackerflux</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thankyou thankyou thankyou! This is exactly what I needed! Though I still don't understand technically what had to be changed, you just fixed it, and that's awesome. I can't thankyou enough. I love my skin, and I most likely will never use a different one if possible. I am elated!<br />
<br />
kitsinu ROCKS!!!<br />
egg-cellent job friend!<br />
<br />
As far as wizards and dieties go, I have not yet experienced any benifit from following mith marr, but nothing negative either. That soon may change with the legacy of ykesha, the frogs follow mith marr, I guess I am ally lol.<br />
<br />
You are always safe with agnostic though. (kinda).<br />
<br />
/cheers!</div></div><hr />

This is a link to the skin I like to use, other wizards in my guild use it as well, and would love to see this custom package fixed. If I could just get someone to explain (in 5 year old language) to me how to fix it myself, I would, lol. Thanks for any help in advance.<br />
