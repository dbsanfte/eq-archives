This however is a finished timer mod:<br />

One minor problem with Arista's and other timer mods (that are an endlessly looping animation) is that every time the event starts it doesn't remember.  You have to manipulate a slider or select a control to mark your place.  As a mouseophobic I use the keyboard for everything possible and tend to not bother updating the slider or dial timers as I use them.<br />
<br />
Instead of manipulating controls in the window, this mod uses the mp3 player's built-in guage and position/duration and most importantly the ability to stop/start it via /mp3 commands.<br />
<br />
The upshot is: the timer guage begins at 0 and increments when you do the cast via hotkey.  It should work for /doability and stuff too but it was made mostly for the spell embracing darkness.<br />
<br />
Enjoy and feel free to improve upon it or the idea.  Thanks to Hoshisabi on necro.eqclasses for mentioning the mp3 commands!  Had no idea they existed my sound has been turned off for years.<br />

<br />
Can you have more than one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you would only be able to have 1 timer going at a time.<br />
<br />
You could either just watch the duration, or you have various 'songs' in your playlist that correspond with the length you wish the timer to be and make the hotkey start that song.</div></div><hr />
