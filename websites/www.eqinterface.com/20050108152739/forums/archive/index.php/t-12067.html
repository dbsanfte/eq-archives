<br />
I recently downloaded a new UI file for everquest.  This UI caused many problems and honestly I cannot remember which one I downloaded.  I have wiped the entire everquest directory and re installed everquest again. I did this because I would log into game just fine but once I moved or clicked on something the client either froze up for good or I got the client crash error. This only happens on my main character.  Obviously I cannot post the uierror file because everything was wiped.  This problem also never came up till I added a custom UI.  If there is anyone out there who can tell me how to fix this I would really appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

You aren't alone on that!  Well, they do know about it, so hopefully they'll change it back ... *crosses fingers*</div></div><hr />

I'm suprised if I can go through a night (3-4hr playtime) without crashing at least once if not 4 times!! :mad: <br />
<br />
Whatever they have done, they better fix it pretty darn quick :|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">testosterone1</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So no one knows how to fix this problem? I had a gm move me to a different zone and eq runs fine. However when I go back to potranquility I crash again(this is where it started). Im not sure why one zone would do this to me. I have deleted everything that had to do with that zone and all of eq and re installed.<br />
<br />
There has to be someone out there who can help fix this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coaldain</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 12:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I had the same problem. What I had to do is go into the EQ files, then select your char (UICoaldain33). Text window will pop up. Scroll until you find what UI your char is running. After you have found that, type : Default, then save, and run the patcher. This worked for me, hope it works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmcnabb</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did they fix this yet?  this is not a problem we can fix on our end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MikeStah</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny thing is this, my friend has a lot of crashes (especially while zoning) but it never happens to me. We're on the same network using the same cable connection and it takes him 5 minutes to zone sometimes. It only takes about 30 seconds for me. We reinstalled EQ last night and same problems still exist.<br />
<br />
So is this a client or a server problem?<br />
<br />
I checked his DBG.TXT on one zone crash it referenced the 12/18 patch. By the way, our systems are practically identical.<br />
