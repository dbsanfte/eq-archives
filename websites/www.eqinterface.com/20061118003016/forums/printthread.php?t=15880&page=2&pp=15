		<div>atm i dont have problem seeing xp dif in zones per mob at any level ( usen httk with all my toons on bristlebane atm) toons from 35-68 atm.but i see what your saying you would see more of the blue line per kill so could note better xp easyer ( as in if its actualy 1% per kill or 1.5% per kill).down side is it would make that xp bar seem to take forever to fill since its bigger.<br />
<br />
atm gagues are if i rember right 1/3rd taller than normal gauges ( so as to make room for the % number in box in middle).might later on make an alt version of that window for down load but atm i gota figure out how to adjust the shortduration buff window an get the lable eq types for the SIX extra slots soe added.<br />
<br />
i havent been able to log in yet to see how the new six lables afect httk as far as loading (i took note  before that any window that normaly shows in eq screen thats not up to current eq xml an not dispaly would cause the ui not to be loaded) im hoppen this isnt the case atm with httk. if it is a fast fix till i get the new window made would be to delet in that file that has you httk the short duration window xml an only that xml.<br />
<br />
i have no clue atm why 6 more temp buff slots were added /shrug best bards i know can twist 4 songs at any one time regularly never 5 or 6 an aa buff pets like one clerics get only seen one up at any given time.<br />
<br />
sorry for any problems not haven a new version up atm might cause yall.atm not seen a post with the eq types yet.gona go try again to log in .<br />
<br />
** edit** just loged in you will get an error message due to the short duration buff window missing 6 added slots but it will work none the less. soon as i get my hands on the eq types for thoes labels of the new 6 new short duration buffs ill make new code an post an update.<br />
<br />
but it will work now ui will load an work.other than not seeing the extra 6 short duration buffs ( i havent ever seen but 5 up at one time my self ever)/shrug maybe some buffs that should have been in short duration window wil be placed their .<br />
<br />
sorry again for any problems this may cause .</div>

		<div>If I could ask Mr. King to help me on this one.  Can I get the heath bar changed so its all red with % sign. Meaning take the odd colors it turns away. It confuses me for some reason. And for the mercent window, can I get it where the Buy/Sell/Close buttons are all under the spot where the item is shown. Other then that it needs to be updated for the patchs, get the message that the UI is not (cant think of the word) uptodate. Thanks if you can help.</div>

		<div>dmcahill2567 just delet toon when ya 1st log in the ui isnt loaded when you 1st log into eq so delet button from default ui is their.Character select was made this way because i have know a few people to delet by acident their favorite toons by acident (either was super tired or super tipsy).kind make ya do little effort to delet a toon instead of acidently haveing your main deleted an have to wait weeks for soe customer service to undo the the acidental deletion .<br />
<br />
 Dracon_Battle il make an alt group window without the color changes some time next day or two .the merchant window buttons are spaced out so as to not acidently buy something you didnt want.the buy an sale can be stacked like default but done can not it would have to be in dif location.<br />
<br />
 as fare as the error that because of the short duration buff window . i havent updated it ti include the extra 6 slots soe has inclueded BECAUSE they havent posted a eq type for the labels for the buffs that would go their as of this post .im geting real tempted to make the extra slots an bar longer just to lost the error .<br />
<br />
 i like the labels because its handy if you do know the bar songs an dont see a song that you need for group playing you can ask for it ( i have a 51 bard an i use the labels for group stuff to make sure at a glance im playing right songs). if theirs no post by soe this week ill make a update over weekend for that window.</div>

With DoN, we had to add the above line in the IW_Charview area. It previously existed at the end of the file with the rest of the &lt;pieces&gt;...&lt;/pieces&gt; information. I *think* if it exists in both places it somehow screws up the UI and defaults to the warrior icon.</div>
