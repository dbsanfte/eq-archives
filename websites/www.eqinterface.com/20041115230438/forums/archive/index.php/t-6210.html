<br />
For those of us that simply can't wait for Nibbuhlz to get back on the TD horse, I've gone ahead and heavily modded his beautiful work of art, Techno Donuts.<br />
<br />
I basically gave it a running color scheme, LCD green.<br />
<br />
**NEW**The player stats have been sent back to their own window, based on the pet window. I'm still tinkering (hah), with a plan to either put them in the friends window, or maybe even on their own action tab.<br />
<br />
Editted the animated inventory, since I remember certain people complaining about the infamous &quot;nub&quot;.<br />
<br />
**NEW**The spellbook has been changed to one that resembles a gear, with a spell slot on each spoke. It may be a little too gnomish for some, so if you don't like it just delete the customized spellbook xml file in the donut directory.<br />
<br />
Still planning on the new pet window. It will be based on the face of a clockwork, but since custom gauges and buttons are still a bit over my head, I'd appreciate the help of anyone willing to take the time to educate me about how to do these things.<br />
<br />
**NEW**Also included in this version is DariathVaz's &quot;Spiffy Target Window&quot; If I had a better photo editor I would've changed it to be green energy inside the tube, but I'm not nearly that talented when it comes to The Gimp.<br />
<br />
**NEW** Here's the screen shot - http://members.fortunecity.com/nevergone/newshot.jpg<br />
<br />
I finally got it to a state where it will just be referred to as version 1. So I uploaded it to the download section on this website, it's currently awaiting approval, so keep checking back!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shrug, (s)he posted that it was still in Beta which is why (s)he didn't want to upload it yet, but has since removed that post (it was between the two of mine above).  Hasn't uploaded it at all that I've seen, so no idea what the status is with it.  Just responding to let you know that it isn't being held up on our end.</div></div><hr />
