* Green to Red health bars - easy tracking of life for yourself, your party, and your target.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahnyiel</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I downloaded the Black UI (&quot;new&quot; release) a couple days ago... And it refuses to work.<br />
<br />
I've installed literally dozens of UI's, and the only thing I can think of is that the included &quot;UI_yourname_servername&quot; file is incorrect, and/or one of the xml files are bad.<br />
<br />
I have a slow system, so I was only able to minimally test separate xml files. each one appears to work correctly on their own, but when I try to load the whole package, it uses the &quot;Black&quot; tga files, but otherwise uses ALL default xml files.<br />
<br />
I don't have the experience to tear apart each little tidbit and pick up what minute thing might be wrong, but I noticed, off the bat, in the UI_name_server file, the UISkin= was set to default, not the directory for black, and it had a ton of autojoin channels in it. These 2 things alone had me curious if the issue isn't maybe that the wrong ui_name_server wasn't included...<br />
<br />
Please get back to me on this soon... I've been wanting to use this ui, as even at 1024x768, I get fair lag (I have an older system) so I need a sleek, simple, but complete interface to cut down on video stress while giving me all the casting, melee, and pet info I need.<br />
<br />
I've tried other &quot;sleek&quot; ones, but they are either too busy, or (in the case of vertminimal2) has inferior components that are important to me (i.e.; vertmin's pet window missing most of the important info, such as health, buffs, etc).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

Only thing that I really am wanting for it, is a horizontal combat abilities window.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried it again today...same results...I just grabbed the first half-dozen or so xml files and they worked, but throw the whole thing in and ALL default xmls are used... Not even the ones tested good will load with the whole package in there...almost like one of the mod xmls tells it to go back to the default folder for source files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded the zip file and took a look inside.  I did NOT install the mod. <br />
<br />
It looks like the author has included a fair number of .XML files that aren't needed.  If you really want to get this to work, you'll have to move things in a piece at a time.  I strongly strongly strongly doubt that there are actual mods done to files like;  SIDL.xml EQUI_FacePick.xml EQUI_EditLabelWnd.xml<br />
<br />
And, the zip file seems remarkable short on graphics.  Perhaps this is a case of uploading the wrong stuff?</div></div><hr />

You know... I was thinking the same thing...that when this update of his older Black UI was done, the wrong directory was included, or something... Yet there's over 1500 tallied dl's of this ui without a single remark I can find in the forums of problems/solutions regarding this... I was hoping that, instead of a &quot;hey, this skin is great!&quot; response, I would have found other similar stories and/or responses on how to make it work right... I found neither.<br />
<br />
And Carienn, I appreciate you trying to look into it. In the meantime, I'm using vertminimal2 and Fang's Pet window (since, to be honest, the vertminimal2 pet window xml bites for pet classes, as it shows only 3 buttons, no buffs, no pet health, etc etc. lol But, just tossing in the tga and xml from Fang's pet window, it makes a gorgeous and quite compatible window. Once I'm done mixing and matching, maybe I'll include a d/l of the complete modifications I've made for those with limited system resources that want a full-featured ui that's sleek and simple at the same time.</div></div><hr />
