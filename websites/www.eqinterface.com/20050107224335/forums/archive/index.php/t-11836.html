<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragunbull_SolRo</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if by chance someone with da skills can make up a Warrior UI that has all the new patches in it. Also with the circular target. Combat Windows that are locked next to the hotkey box. As a warrior I have only found ok UI's that tend to get in my way with my vision. We need to see all that's going on and it's hard when ya have chat boxes all over. Also by chance make up in the UI 3 other boxes that are transparent locked against the sides that have, My Hits, Everyone Else's Hits, and NPC hits that are transparent and not moving the mouse over it ends up darkening it. A good timer as well for mob spawn times maybe zone selectable like VT, VP, ToV, etc. Just an idea, my UI is shot to hell now after all these patches on Sol Ro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also setting viewport lets you adjust the screen inside the ui elements so nothing is overlapping and you can still see everything and none of the ui interferes.<br />
<br />
/viewport x y height width<br />
<br />
x= horizontal start point<br />
y = vertical start point<br />
height=size from top-bottom<br />
width=size from left-right<br />
<br />
/viewport 0 0 800 600 would set the screen at the upper left corner with a height of 800 pixels and a width of 600 pixels.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you're looking at your screen, you see the whole screen fill up to the very edges of your monitor. /viewport is a command inside the game lets you move and adjust the  screen you see.  This gives it the affect of having a blank border around your screen so that you can put your UI elements in the &quot;borders&quot; so you can still see the whole screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragunbull_SolRo</div><div class="date">12-26-2003, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh okies i gotcha now, then no, it's no background on it or borders. The screen and boxers are on ths sides as close as i can get em. But changing the reson won't matter to me if it needs to be, just want a UI that will last me a while and be benifical to the rest of the warriors out there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mogur</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've often thought of using this but what happens when you set the screen to something other than a 4:3 ratio? Something has to be cut off right? I realize there is no definition for &quot;full width&quot; or &quot;hight&quot; as far as in game view goes, as you can always pull the camera back to get more of the scene in, but you still get a 4:3 picture. What happens if you set the viewport to say 800 x 500? How would the view compare to a normal 800 x 600 view?</div></div><hr />
