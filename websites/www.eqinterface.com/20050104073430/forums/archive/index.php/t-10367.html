Well in installed it and nearly everything worked perfectly.  I am having trouble with one thing. I cannot seem to get the Main Window to move.  The one that is alt-M...  I have tried to drag it every way i can think to but it wont seem to move... i just want to move it to the lower right hand corner where it belongs :-\...   I'm very sorry if this is a stupid post but i've been pissed at that window for about 20 min now and i want to get it in the right place :-\... thank you for your time :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually with Quartz you cant move the windows. Some are designed to be permenently &quot;stuck&quot; where they are.<br />
<br />
What you can do is go into the XML for the Action window and change:<br />
&lt;Style_Border&gt;false&lt;/Style_Border&gt;<br />
<br />
to:<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Border&gt;true&lt;/Style_Border&gt;<br />
<br />
That will put a border on it and give you somethign to click on.<br />
<br />
Then once in place change it back to false for the better fitting look.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another solution that does not invole re-coding...you can switch to the default UI then move the Window then switch back to the quartz....I have done this myself with a few windows.</div></div><hr />

All of the other windows were easily moved by simply clicking on a random empty place on them and dragging them though... just that one was odd. thats why i had the problems :-) thank you very much once again :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is because they do not have borders.</div></div><hr />
