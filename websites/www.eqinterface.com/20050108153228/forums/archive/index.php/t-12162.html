<br />
The ingame cartography system works for 'SOME' zones but not all the ones I have downloaded. <br />
For instance I have all the maps in the maps directory. i downloaded the complete set from EQAtlas. <br />
<br />
Nexus... Works fine.<br />
<br />
PoK... Doesnt work at all. (the button cant even be pressed and backspace does nothing - its like before you install LoY)<br />
<br />
Lots of zones work, Lots dont.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this problem or know how to solve it?<br />
<br />
Thx in advance<br />
<br />
Kutter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your account registered for LoY? All maps work only if LoY is registered, else it only works in newbie zones and cities. At the time SOE made that change, PoP wasn't out so I would guess they wouldn't have opened it wide open for everybody not registered for LoY.<br />
<br />
Remember, the map system was a purchased feature from LoY. Same goes for the 16 slot banks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kutter</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Q, thx for your post and I think you may have a point. However, some strange things happened to me, I shall explain.<br />
<br />
I've been away from the game for about a year. when I got back I was well behind all my friends etc, so decided to upgrade online to LoY and PoP for now. <br />
<br />
PoP downloaded by clicking the PoP window (off the server screen) and it said to restart the EQ patcher to download the files.<br />
<br />
LoY was weird and different, it took me to the SoE Website and a registration page to 'buy' the software. I went through the motions there but couldn't complete it (the account is in my brothers name and he wasn't here with his credit card to complete it)<br />
<br />
BUT...<br />
<br />
When I went back to the patcher there was a 45 minute download, and it all looked LoY connected. When I went into game (logged out in the Nexus last night) I had a new map on Backspace, so I figured that LoY had indeed downloaded the same way (as I didnt have them before yestarday)<br />
<br />
So my questions would be...<br />
<br />
1. How come I can now access the map system in the newbie and city zones. Whereas I couldn't before. <br />
<br />
2. I must have downloaded SOMETHING (took 45 minutes)<br />
<br />
3. Could i have downloaded the 'free' version of LoY (if such a thing exsists) because obviously I have no way of registering, I have no Number???<br />
<br />
Weird huh?<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated, <br />
<br />
Thx <br />

<br />
it is right. There is some kind of &quot;free&quot; version of LoY.<br />
With LoY had been introduced a map system of nearly all zones.<br />
If you do not registered LoY itself you can use this map system only in Newbie Zones and Starter Cities. This is a feature to make it for new players easier to navigate. The skill Sense Heading had been set to 200, too.<br />
Else you can use the map in nearly every zone (nearly, because in Plane of Hate it does not work and maybe somewhere else too).<br />
So you have downloaded LoY completely but can only use the &quot;free&quot; map system as mentioned above.<br />
The rest will work once you registered it.<br />
<br />
Cu and stay safe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thx for all your help in this guys. One question however still hovers though.<br />
<br />
How do I now register it ?<br />
<br />
There is only a type in for a number from the CD on the loggin screen and no 'register expansions' of any kind that I can find?<br />
<br />
Kutter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimeTraveller</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
if you get a key to type in, you need to log in.<br />
On the page with all servers listed should be a possibility to register your new expansion.<br />
Something like &quot;owned expansions&quot; or so. Press this button and you should be able to enter your new key.<br />
I do not excatcly know how it works, because i bought LoY, LDoN and now GoD per preorder. :D <br />
But it should be easy to find out once you logged in.<br />
<br />
Cu,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kutter</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe I realsise that Time, but like I said. I downloaded it. I 'dont' have a number to type in... :P<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimeTraveller</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can download every update. ;)<br />
But you have to purchase it, too.<br />
Look at the Sony Store-Homepage (https://store.station.sony.com) to buy it online.<br />
Login with your station name and password from EverQuest.<br />
There look on the left side for Everquest and then for Digital Download.<br />
Now you are able to purchase every update per download and your account should automatically have the update funtional, because you bought it online with your station name.<br />
(Your account gets the key automatically entered)<br />
BTW: You will need a credit card for this!!<br />
<br />
Hope, this helps.<br />
<br />
Cu,</div></div><hr />

But you account does need to be registered for it. As mentioned above, you can do it online.</div></div><hr />

I bought EQ Evolution (all expansions, 'cept LDoN and GoD), and I can't use the register expasion trick as I only have one key/code (whatever it's called), and it's already registered :( <br />
<br />

If you can't, your account is bugged it's upto SOE to fix. If you can, then you might have a problem. First see if you can zone over.<br />

<br />
If you bought the DIGTAL DOWNLOAD of LoY, from the login screen on the game, it doesnt need a CD-Key, it auto-flagged your account on SOE's website when you paid for it. <br />
<br />
there is no free version of LOY, they did enable the maps in newbie cities about a month after LOY went live, but there is no free version..<br />
<br />
Try what guice suggested, if you can zone into Gulf of Gunthak then you ARE LOY enabled.<br />
