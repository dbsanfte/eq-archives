While my strong suspicion is that the answer may well lie in the Patch Fixes posts, I am such a n00b that I don't understand where to look.<br />
<br />
After reverting to the default UI for a few days, this morning, I decided to try again, as I really want a Player window that has some features not included in the standard Sony UI.  I made a new folder in \Everquest\UIfiles, then downloaded theworks3.zip to my desktop from the Player windows on this site.  I unziped theworks3 into my new folder, then logged into the game, and loaded the skin.  (I did read the FAQ, and my eqclient.ini file is correct, as well as my UI_CharacterName_ServerNumber.ini file.<br />
<br />
This is the text I'm getting in my UIErrors file:<br />

If you can help me, I am sorry to say that I really need basic instructions on what I can do to repair.  And, thanks in advance :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">04-04-2003, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are no errors. Your error log tells me it cant find any interface files in the Player folder under UIFiles. So your not installing it correctly.<br />
<br />
Make sure you dont have a sub folder in  the Player folder.<br />
<br />
example:<br />
UIFiles\Player\  *.xml files - correct<br />
UIFiles\Player\anotherfolder\  *.xml files - wrong<br />
See the FAQ for a nice picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vydas</div><div class="date">04-04-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oddly, it is using the player window, so it is finding it.  There are no subfolders within Player, just \Everquest\UIfiles\Player\EQUI_PlayerWindow.XML<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response, too :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">04-04-2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You say it is finding and using the file as it should be?  If so, ignore the UIError.txt log file, it is merely reporting the information it should be reporting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dshoemn</div><div class="date">04-04-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What the UI is doing is its looking in your custom folder of all of the xml files needed to build a UI. When it does not find them in that directory it will load the default xml file instead. <br />
<br />
These are not errors they are more info messeges telling you it can't find the specific UI file it wants so its going to load the default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vydas</div><div class="date">04-04-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, thank you so much.  My original reason for asking was that in addition to the UIErrors file, I was getting an ever-expanding texture error file, as well.  That texture file grew so large that it filled my hard disk.  That is no longer happening, since switching to this new one.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for everyone's help :).</div></div><hr />
