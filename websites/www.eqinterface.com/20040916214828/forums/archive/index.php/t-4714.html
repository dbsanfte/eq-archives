<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DePimp</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice mod's jsut 2 thing's i think would make them stand out more is <br />
 1) on the spell book have some kind of old world text of some sort writen in the back ground ( make text red )<br />
<br />
 2) the skull gauge is cool although i have seen that skull used alot .. possiblity to change  it so instead of spinning  have it fill's up with blood <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
just me 2cp but i like them both</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was considering that, but it takes ALOT of coding to do a vertical guage. I may still do one though, just because it's been requested, but to be forewarned, it may cause some very bad lag while casting, considering that it's animated PLUS the code(basically about 50-100 spearate guages all working at once) PLUS all the particle effects... and if you are in a group situation, you have everyone else casting at that time as well.<br />
<br />
But, I will do one with skull draining 'blood' and post it on the beta boards for you guys to try.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback and copliments!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulaa</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to make the skull moveable?. Currently it seems to be in a fixed position on the screen and it would be nice to be able to move it to where I want it to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thing about the casting bars is that you have to have a spell that's long enough that you can cast it and be able to move your bar wherever you want in that time. If you click just outside of the skull, where a corner would be if it had a border, you can grab it there. <br />
<br />
I'm working on a full rendered Necro UI where the skelly is holding the casting bar, but his hand is empty until you cast... the problem I'm having is the casting bar's location... and if you move the piece, the casting bar will stay and stuff will be misaligned. Simple problem to overcome in a full UI, but not if the casting bar is separate, such as this piece.<br />
<br />
If you are proficient enough with XML, you could just open the mod file and change the background to &quot;true&quot; and move the bar wherever you want, then change the background back to &quot;false&quot; when you get it where ya want. ALSO, I'm not sure about this, but sinc ethe cast bar and the breath bar are linked, you may be able to go swimming and move it where you want, but I'm not absolutely sure if it wil affect the casting bar's location... may just move the breath window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulaa</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive tried to &quot;Grab&quot; and pull to a new spot but I am probably grabbing the center not the edges.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of the full necro UI. To be honest I use your pet window, the &quot;SK skull&quot; cast bar (The rendering rocks!), your &quot;Skull&quot; Cast timer, the &quot;SK&quot; spell book from Thomas king. <br />
<br />
I tried your &quot;Necro&quot; cast bar, but went back to the SK one for its clarity and look. If you could &quot;Mod&quot; the SK one to incorporate the &quot;casting&quot; skull I think that would be awesome.<br />
<br />
Im trying to get one of those Inventory windows with the Pic in the &quot;Auto equip&quot; section to work. But for some reason every single one I have tried has crashed on me.<br />
<br />
These are all suggestions and I hugely appreciate the effort and work you have put in so far. Im a network tech not a coder, I copuldnt code if my life depended on it :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am REALLY looking forward to the complete necro UI you are working on.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the hard work in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulaa</div><div class="date">01-19-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its quite difficult but you can basically move the skull from the top center.<br />
<br />
What I do is cast something really long (Usually pet buff from pants) and when the skull comes up grab it at the top at the point where it is spinning (IE the axis of spin)<br />
<br />
It will take a second to get it and probably a few tries but it works<br />
<br />
Earthscum, is it possible to make the skull and drain color red?</div></div><hr />
