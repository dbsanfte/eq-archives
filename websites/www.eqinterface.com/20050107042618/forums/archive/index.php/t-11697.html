Static Electricty. <br />
<br />
Make sure you touch something metal especially if you live in an area that gets really dry in the winter. One shock from the finger tip could take out your motherboard. I've seen it happen to many people back in my bestbuy service tech days.<br />
<br />
Make sure the card is seated all the way into the AGP slot. Some cheaper cases make it kind of hard to do this.<br />
<br />
You may also want to install any of the software that came with your old video card.<br />
<br />
Thats all I can think of at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would holding onto the side of the computer case work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phionamcree</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hubby is a systems administrator and we always use a staic electricity wrist strap when we do anything inside our computers.  But, if you don't have one of those, you can hold onto the side of case (metal parts).  Not as safe, but safer than nothing.  Also, always a good idea to not be standing on carpet (or have your computer sit directly on the carpet).  Carpet can kick up a lot of static electricity that can run straight through your socks, and out your finger tips.<br />
<br />
Static electricity can fry your computer and its components even when you don't feel a shock of any sort.  Never, never handle the components extensively.  Try to always grasp them by the edges, touching as little of the component as possible and avoid handling the gold strip (part that actually slides into the AGP slot).<br />
<br />
I've seen brand new components fry from simple handling and I've seen entire systems fry (quite literally...sounded like fried eggs cooking) from pushing the power button and picking up static electricity from the capret at the same time.</div></div><hr />

grounding to metal case = GOOD<br />
<br />
you do fine... once you get it installed. skip the software that came with it, go to guru3d.com (http://download.guru3d.com/detonator/) and get the most recent Detenator Driver (ForceWare is new name also) 53.03 is the newest certified driver, so start with that one.  you will find it runs much smoother.. (drivers on CD prolly several months old..)</div></div><hr />

I was moments away from installing the new card when I realized that I didn't know where to put it in.. I expect that it will be where the old card is.. but.. I don't know where that is either.. any clues on what it looks like?</div></div><hr />

its a brown slot... the dead give away is: it has your monitor plugged into it RIGHT NOW :D (hehehe) Just remember where you monitor is plugged into when you un-plug it (put a piece of tape on it).. when you open the side of your case, follow that object inside. <br />
<br />
if you have any trouble with this part.. I highly recommend waiting and let a technician do it for you.</div></div><hr />
