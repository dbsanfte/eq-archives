<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmb0702</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been having trouble seeing my hands in front of my face since I have installed my new Apollo 3D Thrill SIS 315 card. I posted up on te EQ forums and was told to down load updated drivers and such from SIS. I went to their site and didn't see any mention of new drivers but I downloaded them anyways. Then was told to download some updated mini something or other and that didn't work either. If anyone could help me it would be appreciated. I will supply whatever is needed so that you could take a look at my competer settings.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />
