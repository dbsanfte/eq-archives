<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sokol</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I have several color motifs for my various characters, Green, Dblue, Pastel Blue, Red, Purple etc...<br />
<br />
Now the problem is, not all the windows are colored like they used to be, the background for say the chat window is colored, as is the empty spell slots on the cast window, but nothing else is like it used to be. I've re-colorized the images again, but this did not help. Can any one explain this? Ty</div></div><hr />

<br />
UISkin=default<br />
<br />
and change it to the folder that has the images you want to use.. for me I have a folder called &quot;bard&quot; that has all my colors and mods in it.. sooo i changed it to:<br />
<br />
UISkin=bard<br />
<br />
the scan will still repair the default directory if you put any files there.. BUT it loads the images from the &quot;bard&quot; directory and works fine (see screenshot in beta forum)<br />
<br />
also do a /bug report on it.. maybe we can get it fixed in next patch.<br />
