<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure Kudane can enlighten you more but from what we heard people at SOE is that the EQ2 Interface will be even more customizable. Also I understand it’s going to be more of a standard XML syntax.<br />
<br />
The only pictures I've seen of the interface are at www.eqii.com in their gallery. When Kudane took his tour I'm sure he got to see more but I dont think hes allowed to talk about it.<br />
<br />
I know Kudane is working on getting some information he can release when we launch eq2interface.com in the near future.</div></div><hr />
