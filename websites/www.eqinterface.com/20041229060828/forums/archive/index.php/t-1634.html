<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramsus</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently I have been able to exchange emails with Roy Eltham,a senior programmer<br />
for the Everquest Live team and one of the original folks who helped develop the new <br />
UI. I asked the most common questions I have heard on the different message boards<br />
relating to the new UI.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are the questions, followed immediatly by the answer.<br />
<br />
1) Will you folks be releasing a 'schema' that a standard XML editor (for<br />
instance, xml spy) would be able to use to actually display the files the<br />
way they would be displayed in the game? We currently have a working version<br />
of a 'viewer' but there are still issues with it, mostly due to<br />
unseen/unknown rules not available to us as a user.<br />
<br />
&gt;1) Unfortunately, the way our stuff works it would be difficult (probably<br />
&gt;impossible to get it right) to make a schema that a standard xml editor<br />
&gt;could use. To be honest, we currently just use standard text editors<br />
&gt;internally, and a special version of the client that lets us run offline and<br />
&gt;windowed. So the game itself is our viewer.<br />
<br />
*Note: There are a couple different tools out there now which do exactly this. <br />
*Check out www.sidlwidl.com!<br />
=============================================================================<br />
2) Can we get a list of which windows have hard coded requirements that<br />
certain elements must be present in. For instance, we can't just rewrite any<br />
window because in some cases it fails due to missing element types.<br />
<br />
&gt;2) The list would be pretty much every window. Currently, we are in the<br />
&gt;process of making the code deal with missing elements without crashing. In<br />
&gt;most cases it will just run and whatever function the missing piece had will<br />
&gt;just not work on that window, but in some cases (primarily whole windows or<br />
&gt;tab pages being missing) it will revert to the default UI files. We realize<br />
&gt;that it would have been more ideal to make everything completely flexible as<br />
&gt;to what window it goes in and so forth, but that would have required a great<br />
&gt;deal more work (and the new UI was already a great deal of work) and time<br />
&gt;(we probably would still be working on it and not have it live yet).<br />
=============================================================================<br />
3) Will we have the ability to create our own windows? Currently, we are<br />
modifying windows that have other functionality. Obviously this is not<br />
optimal for the developers or for VI. It looks like the most of the code is<br />
there, what seems to be missing is the ability to actually call the window.<br />
<br />
&gt;3) We would like to eventually work something out for this to be possible,<br />
&gt;but it will be somewhat limited since the &quot;new&quot; windows will only be able to<br />
&gt;have elements on them that we have coded to work on any window (guages,<br />
&gt;labels, animations, and some inventory slots).<br />
=============================================================================<br />
4) We see that the STMLBOX tag is present and some folks have totally<br />
rewrote the help window. This is not our preferred method, we don't want to<br />
alter the content you are providing in the help window. If we could create a<br />
new window, or alter an unused window, to be an STML window and actually<br />
designate a &lt;src&gt; for the stml file, alot of these issues would disappear.<br />
<br />
&gt;4) I will look into the idea of the STMLBOX tag having a default source file<br />
&gt;to go in it. Keep in mind that you can only access files from the local hard<br />
&gt;drive.<br />
<br />
=============================================================================<br />
5) Could we get an exact definition as to what kind of UI mods would be<br />
against the EULA now. We assume if it doesn't interact with the datastream<br />
or alter the actual client's code, it would be allowed.<br />
<br />
&gt;5) UI mods should not be able to violate the EULA. However, if through some<br />
&gt;bug in our system you should find a way to alter the code of the game such<br />
&gt;that it allows you to exploit or cheat then it will be considered a<br />
&gt;violation. However, while I can't say this will never happen, I can say that<br />
&gt;is it very unlikely because we have set thing up in such a way that it<br />
&gt;should not be possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks Roy!</div></div><hr />

Does that mean the map mod is legal?</div></div><hr />

Sounds like if we wanted to place the entire text from Heinlein's &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; into the help section so we could read while playing, we are permitted to do so.<br />
<br />
Since this is good news and my first post.  I will try the nana dance.  :nana:<br />

Micer da wanna be slicer</div></div><hr />
