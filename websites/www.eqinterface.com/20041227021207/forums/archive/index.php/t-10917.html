<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of you know that I live in the Los Angeles area, well I am about 30-40 miles from the closest fire (and that is a good ways). But the smoke and debris that was/is being kicked up is causing thier share of problems.<br />
<br />
While my heart and thoughts go out to those left homeless from these fires, and those who have losted loved ones. I thought I would show off some quick snap shots I took in downtown LA (about 60 miles from closest fire) and show you how bad it was at 2pm on Weds.<br />
<br />
From Sat to Weds it was perminate twighlight all day. <br />
<br />
HERE (http://www.eqinterface.com/kudane/fire/) is a page I made to show the images quickly.<br />
<br />
please feel free to discuss this issue further or the pictures here (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10918) if you want.<br />
<br />
On a positive note, SOE employees were allowed back in the office, and it looks as if the weather will be giving a hand in the next few days.<br />
