<br />
SidlWidl can run this but EQ cant.<br />
<br />
Here's a screenshot of the SidlWidl output...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brimztone</div><div class="date">09-16-2002, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and the XML code that goes with it.<br />
<br />
EQ crashes to the desktop when it tries to load this skin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">09-17-2002, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno at all , but for me one of the possible problem is EQ may not be able to do tab window for Hotkey Window... just try to remove this part and see if it works .... I didn't looked at the xml , but the pic didn't show me anything EQ couldn't do, other than maybe what I just said</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">09-17-2002, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Be sure to look at UIErrors.txt.<br />
<br />
That will tell you why it's crashing to desktop.<br />
<br />
Oh, and also, SidlWidl has no way of knowing what's Hardcoded and what's not. I can bet that many things that works in SidlWidl won't work in EQ, just cause of hard coded values.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brimztone</div><div class="date">09-17-2002, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the UIErrors.txt doesnt show any errors, the DBG.txt file shows a fatal error though. I know its that skin because when I put my other one back, it works fine. Perhaps you just cant put the hot buttons on tabs.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sum1ntheus</div><div class="date">09-17-2002, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I downloaded the file tried some modifications to it and got zip nada nothing but bumped back to desktop when I loaded it.<br />
<br />
So the only thing I could think is that possibly the hotkays can't be tabbed. But I am not giving up that easy.<br />
<br />
someone else may come up with a sulotion first since i am leaving to go out of town though.<br />
<br />
Have fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brimztone</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just used the Pet window, since I dont use it normally, and made that a tabbed window with the backpacks on one and the inventory on the other.<br />
<br />
Since I didnt need anything but the bare minimum in the inventory window now, I cut it down to almost nothing.<br />
<br />
Skills Button, Destroy Button, Auto Equip box and Money boxes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main thing that will cause a desktop kick is when a ScreenID has been re-used.  In looking at your code I saw several possible examples of this.<br />
<br />
  &lt;!-- IS_WAIST		20 --&gt;<br />
  &lt;InvSlot item=&quot;Inv_Slot20&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;ScreenID&gt;InvSlot20&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
<br />
  &lt;!-- IS_AMMO		21 --&gt;<br />
  &lt;InvSlot item=&quot;Inv_Slot21&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;ScreenID&gt;Inv_Slot21&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
<br />
The ammo slot should be fine, but the Waist slot seems to be missing an underscore Inv_Slot20.  The InvSlot20 will conflict with code in the &quot;default&quot; inventory window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried that prog out and don't like it...<br />
<br />
I was looking for a compiler so I could try to get my spell gems into my book for faster swapping since I thought I wasn't getting something right in the xml code... Everything worked right and looked right in the prog, but when I ran EQ everything that I modified was WAY off (lower) that what it was in SW, and it still didn't work...<br />
<br />
Hopefully they get that prog working soon... it's actually nice if it would work more like EQ does, but oh well.... hard to program something like that, I'm sure...</div></div><hr />
