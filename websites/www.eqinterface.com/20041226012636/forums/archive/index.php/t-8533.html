The third version of this UI offers increased functionality, a more uniform appearance and more alternative windows. Some of the graphics have been modified to accentuate the original Vert UI's 'rubberized' look. And everything lines up just a little bit better than it did before.<br />
<br />
- Target window contains the HoTT code and a sweet looking consider indicator.<br />
- Pet window has the six most-used buttons.<br />
- Inventory window has XP, AAXP, GLXP, and RLXP gauges and percentages.<br />
- Buff windows and spell book show the beneficial/detrimental color-coded border.<br />
- Book and note windows rewritten for consistent appearance.<br />
<br />
Optional windows:<br />
<br />
- Melee inventory window (removes Mana number).<br />
- Extended info player window, with gauges/percents/numbers for HP, Mana, Endurance, and XP/AAXP percents.<br />
- Horizontal and square Combat Ability windows in both 4 and 8 slot configurations.<br />
- A true selector window (using it will replace the stats/resists bar).<br />
- Variations on all player and target windows without attack/con indicators.<br />
- Target window without HoTT gauge.<br />
- Vertical spell cast window.<br />
- Resized old-style book window.<br />
<br />
<br />
Credit for the original files and inspiration go to Vertebrae, Sokol and Kudane, for their work on the Vert and Solaria UIs. The horizontal buff windows are credited to Cairenn, with some changes; spell gems and icons are from &quot;Cyrssis WarCraft3 Spell Icons (GoD Compliant)&quot;; and the target ring is by Raxthorne.<br />

Great Ui! Just checking though if you might have an update to make use of bank sharing also is there a possibility to customize the armor slots you added on top of the invent slots? I Switch from 1hs to 2hs alot and it would help if a Secondary slot was there vs cloak, and i also have arm clikkies. <br />

It seems as if the window is there, but it's not in a visible part of the screen.  It's somehow been positioned off the edge of the screen.  (i.e, the window is somewhere between the bottom of the monitor and your floor).  I've had this happen to me before, so it is possible.  I'm not too familiar with this ui, but I assume it comes with a preconfigured ui_charname_server.ini file.  If so, what I would do is delete the current one from your Everquest directory, and replace it with a new one.  Depending on the ui, it may be in the custom ui folder, in which case it will need to be copied into the Everequest folder and renamed.  Worse case, the author will have to provide you with a new copy of the ini file in question.</div></div><hr />

First off... love the UI.<br />

The AttackIndicator.tga file seems to be missing from the updated zip. I looked into the xml, and the code for it is in the EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml file (the melee one). I pulled a tga from an old version of vertminimal2 I had, it has the exact same dimensions, but it's not working.<br />

Only request I have is for the pet window to show buffs.  Is there anyway you could get a pet window mod with buffs?  <br />
<br />
Having just got pet affinity aa ability being able to actually see the icons would be a tremendous help instead of /pet report.  Any help at all in this would be awesome.  Thanks.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darl</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'd like to come up with a fully functional pet window sometime soon.  In the meantime, you can delete the EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml file from the vertminimal2 folder and force EQ to show the default pet window.  It won't be a perfect fit, but it'll look decent and you'll be able to see the buffs.<br />
<br />
This is a quick solution to many UI problems, actually.  If you're having trouble with one window in particular, just delete it from your custom UI folder until the author posts a fix.  For example, I saw someone had posted that they were switching between their custom UI and the default UI in order to use the new container-augmentation function, when really all they needed to do was delete the container window from the custom UI.<br />

-Mana and Endurance numbers appear on the player windows and on the inventory.  The alternate melee inventory does not display mana.<br />

I'm not sure if there's an easy fix for this or not, though.  I'll have to do some searching.  I don't own LDoN or GoD; I quit playing before they were released, so I can't test many of the newer functions.  I'm mostly relying on those of you who use the UI to bring problems like this to my attention.  It's not an optimal arrangement, but it's what we've got.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darl</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK.  I think I've solved the long-standing Vert LDoN compass problem.  The problem was that the Vert compass begins farther to the right of the window edge than the default compass.  Before LDoN this wasn't a problem, as the N-S-E-W strip was just shifted to account for this discrepancy and everything appeared to line up correctly.  But (and this is speculation) the LDoN line is based on the default compass' position in the default window.  Basically, the problem arose because the LDoN line was in the right place but the Vert compass' position in the window was out of whack.<br />
<br />
So, I've merged the Vert and Solaria compasses to utilize the best of both worlds (IMO).  The new compass has the red and green location lights of the Vert compass, but is the size of the default/Solaria compass.  I've increased the size of the N-S-E-W letters for easier reading, and I also sync'd it up with True North, so it should be dead-on accurate.<br />
<br />
Now all I need is for someone to test it out in LDoN...<br />

I've also changed the animations file to make the blue/red spell borders look better, if you look at the right edge of the border, it's kinda choppy, so I've smoothed it out.<br />
<br />
If someone knows if/how I can change the text color inside a STMLbox, please post.  The book window uses an Editbox while the note window uses an STMLbox, and the STMLbox text seems to ignore the textcolors.<br />

I really like how everything is there but most of the clutter is gone. I run 2 960x720 windows side by side and this UI is almost perfect.<br />

Keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I've updated vertminimal3 again.  This should be the last one for awhile, I think... I think I've incorporated everything I wanted to.  (Famous last words, perhaps, but I'm really pretty happy with it at the moment.)<br />
<br />
Once again, the files are here: http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3623 <br />
<br />
This file includes all the patches previously posted in this thread, plus a few other treats.  It's an all-around better UI than the previous versions, so I'd suggest that you upgrade to this one now if you've been reluctant to do so.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for using my stuff, and please keep posting feedback and suggestions.  Many of the best ideas in the UI come from these boards.<br />

Unfortunately, I must once again ask you to do the testing, as OoW becomes the third expansion to be released since I quit playing EQ.<br />

If the new buff icons and labels do not match up (and they most likely won't), please get a screenshot and post in this thread, PM or email me at o_baty@yahoo.com.<br />

I've put the correct (with any manner of luck at all, they'll be correct) files back up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaer</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do i change my items in hotbutton box?  Like I do not want a cloak and ring up there, I would rather have shield and legs in those 2 spots..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darl</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, to change a right click slot you need to change two lines in the EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml file.  The sections that we're concerned with are called &quot;NewSlotX&quot; in my UI, where X is a number between 1 and 4.  Different UIs will have different naming schemes.<br />
<br />
Here's what we're looking at:<br />
<br />
	<br />
        &lt;InvSlot item=&quot;Newslot3&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;Newslot3&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;88&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;54&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;32&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;32&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;Background&gt;A_MiniInvBack&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
		&lt;EQType&gt;8&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
        &lt;/InvSlot&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The first line we need to change is the 'Background' line.  This tells EQ what image to display behind your piece of equipment.  The EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml file contains the names of all the possible background images in the first quarter or so of the file.  As we're replacing the cloak clicky with a shield/secondary, we'll change the line<br />
<br />
        &lt;Background&gt;A_MiniInvBack&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
<br />
to<br />
        &lt;Background&gt;A_MiniInvSecondary&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
<br />
The other line we need to change is the 'EQType' line.  This tells EQ what piece of equipment to display.  There is an excellent list of all of the EQTypes at http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=8276. The EQType for the shield/secondary inventory slot is 14.  So we change<br />
<br />
        &lt;EQType&gt;8&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
to<br />
        &lt;EQType&gt;14&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
<br />
That's all there is to it.<br />
<br />
To change the ring slot to legs, we make similar changes to the 'Newslot4' item.  The legs background is called A_MiniInvLegs and the EQType is 18.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've attached a file with these changes already made.<br />

<br />
Can you explain to me what the red and green squares on the compass are for, and how i am supposed to use them. They obviously are to perform a function, but i cant figure out what that function is. Please explain.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darl</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure.  The colored boxes indicate which location numbers are changing and in which direction.  The first box is your north/south number, the second box is your east/west number.   Green means that the number is increasing, red means that it is decreasing, and black means that there is no change.<br />
<br />
So let's say that you are currently at 1000, 0, 0 and your destination is at 2000, 1000, 0.  You want both the numbers to increase, so you want them to both be green.  Rotate until both boxes are green and you'll be facing NW, which is the direction of your destination.<br />
<br />
But the real reason I continue to include this feature is that it looks pretty cool.  I never used the function much, to be honest.<br />
