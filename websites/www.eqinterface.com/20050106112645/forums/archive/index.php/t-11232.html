Remelio was re-doing the remmy.exe that comes with it, due to the new &quot;formating&quot; that SOE inadvertantely put in the EQUI_Animations.xml file on the last patch.<br />
<br />
If you have the latest download, go to Remmy's site or email him as instructed in the exe program.  He'd be the one to tell you what the problem is.</div></div><hr />

*Blink*  Huh?<br />
<br />
There is a known issue with them due to the last patch by SOE in which the formating of the EQUI_Animations.xml file got messed up.  However, as I said, it's a known issue, and Remmy has already released one update that takes care of it for most folks, and is working on another update that should take care of everyone else.  As for not getting to their sites ... I get to them both just fine.</div></div><hr />
