I will post a patch in a couple hours, maybe sooner if I can finish some of my work and take a break for about 10 min. Thanks for the post :)</div></div><hr />

It worked for me so let me know if you come across any other problems or have any suggestions. Sorry for the problem I should have caught that one. :(</div></div><hr />

With the way I have my windows laid out, I've had to modify it so that the squares are on the right, and the player bars/names are to the left of them. If you want to see the changes I did, click here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1971)<br />
<br />
(I originally acknowledged Nodent for the color change mod... if that was a mistake I'll have to go correct that!)<br />
<br />
Is there a way to modify the squares so that sliver of white to the left isn't there? I've tried to do so myself but haven't been able to figure it out. (I know how to modify .xml files, but wouldn't be able to code them for the life of me.)<br />
<br />
This is so far my favorite mod. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madmardeggan</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The version you are using is nodents. Neither he nor I made this mod from the ground up. I used his version to create mine. But I removed my health and stuff from the group window and some of the other parts he added. I am working on removing that sliver of white but have been unsuccessfull so far. I might know what is causing it now though and will be releasing a new beta version soon that will hopefully address that problem. If I manage to fix it then I will let you know what causes it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weawen</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">can you also do a target bar that changes color? I love the mods where the bars change colors :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madmardeggan</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not a bad idea, I will work on that one. Not sure how long it will take for me to get a working beta out but I will try to do that soon.</div></div><hr />
