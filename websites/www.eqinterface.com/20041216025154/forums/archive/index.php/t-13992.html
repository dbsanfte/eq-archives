<br />
Edit 5/28/04: Updated the Bazaar Search Window to include the &quot;Hide Traders&quot; button and extend pull-down menus.<br />
<br />
All files are updated for the GoD Expansion and patches as of 5-25-2004.<br />
<br />
This UI is designed for someone running EQ at a 1280x1024 resolution. The layout was inspired<br />
by an old UI that Grimthorn created when PoP was first released. I've made a few changed to the<br />
appearance from v1.0. Buffs are now in a vertical list on the right of the screen, and the player<br />
and group windows have changed a little as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Credits:<br />
<br />
Grimthorn - for the layout inspiration from one of his older UI's and graphics from<br />
Grimthorn UI7.<br />
Ultrax - for the Bazaar Search Window<br />
T.King/Remelio/Kuvasie - for the Undead Inventory v2.0 window and the Class Animations v2.1<br />
Raxthorne - for the Map window, Buff window, and Short Duration Buff windows.<br />
Faldaen - for the Target Indicator (Whirlwind v3.0)<br />
Ghesta and Cyrssi - for the WarCraft 3 Spellgems and Gem Icons (combinination of the two)<br />
Drakah - for the Character Select window<br />
<br />
If I missed anyone, I apologize. Please let me know and I'll add it to the list.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also included is a folder called Alternate Windows. In there I have the following windows for those<br />
that want to use them. Just copy the file to the CamarUI folder, delete the original file there,<br />
and rename it taking the -hybrid, -Melee, -Border, or -NoBorder out of the name:<br />
<br />
EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd-Hybrid - a smaller Combat Abilities window only 4 buttons high for use by<br />
Hybrid Melees.<br />
EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd-Melee - a Combat Abilities window 8 buttons high the size of the Spells window<br />
for Pure Melees.<br />
EQUI_TargetWindow-Border - a Target window with a dark background and a gold border.<br />
EQUI_TargetWindow-NoBorder - a Target window with no border or background. Same as pictures in the<br />
screenshots on EQInterface.com.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Camar</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've received a couple of emails lately from people having troubles with the loot window lately.  After a bit of work, I believe the problem is being caused by the UI_character_server.ini file.  <br />
<br />
I'm attaching a copy of mine.  Just download the file, unzip, rename UI_Camar_druzzil.ini with your character name and server, and copy/paste that file into your main EverQuest folder.  If this doesn't fix the issue, please post here and I'll see if I can find a better solution!  =)</div></div><hr />
