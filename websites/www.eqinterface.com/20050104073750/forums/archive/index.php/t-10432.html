<br />
Please?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The program you are thinking of is CCake, do a search on that word and you'll find it.<br />
<br />
An alternative is to just manually change them yourself.  There's a good thread on how to here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4060).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JGC84</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CCake is great for those of us useing VERT hotkeys.. but me no likey VERT hotkeys... i still sit down and right a more general VB scribt that will (idealy) will work for any hotkeys window... what i'm thinking.. you input a file, and it parses through the text and finds all the EQTYPES that are equivelnt to an item slot or a bag slot, then it lists the ones you currently have showing, and you can swap them between the current type they are and what you want them to change to, it wouldnt be as pretty as the CCake Program, but it *should* work w/ any hotkeys, the only part that would be confusing is if you have 2 of the same type of EQTYPE in the hotkeys, like 2 neck slots or somthing (if your using a multiable page hotkey window i could see this coming up) but it would list them all linearly as its written out in the code, so you could make a guess at which is which, and hey if you dont like how it came out, you can always go back and change it!<br />

it can be my newest weekend project... up there with JGCUIV2 /sigh</div></div><hr />
