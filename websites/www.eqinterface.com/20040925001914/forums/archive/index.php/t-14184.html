<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qinadwen</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like for SoE to alter the friends window, to add the possibility of notes to each of your friends - like in guildmanager.<br />
<br />
I have some in my friends-list, that I only put there because they said I could call on them if I ever needed this or that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xylan Trueheart</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually what I would like to have in addition of making notes is to alphabetize the list. With close to a 100 on the list its gets frustrating to search the list for the name you want to send a tell to. Yes I know I could simply type /tell &lt;name&gt; but some names have odd spellings and the only way to get it right is to look at the list. Yes I know there is a /note feature but it doesn't have the click and tell ability. Perhaps SOE can combine the 2, since not many players know of the /note feature.<br />

<br />
The friends and ignore lists aren't really any longer than the list of people in your guild.  So storing notes with those lists shouldn't take any more space than it does in the guild list.</div></div><hr />

The guild notes take up room on the server because it is shared information..  <br />
<br />
The F notes and I Notes would only go on your computer...  Just like your F list itself..  they aren't server wide information</div></div><hr />
