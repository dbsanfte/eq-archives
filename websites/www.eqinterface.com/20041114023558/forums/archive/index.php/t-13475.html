<br />
The birth of EQ2UI followed shortly this evening.<br />
<br />
This is a very basic concept showing only one or two elements but if there is a positive response perhaps I'll continue with it a bit more...<br />
<br />
Without further delay...<br />

Thanks Drakah, would hate to think I'd be competing against you, that just isn't a prospect I'd like. ;)  You're just (more than) a little out of my league! ;)</div></div><hr />

I've seen your work Liz, and it's obvious you have xml skill and graphic skills (xml being something I don't have).

Actually, XML is the one thing I lack. :P  The XML for ACUI was done by Enok. :)<br />

Working on the updated version of this right now, it's designed around 1024x768 since 800x600 wasn't enough.  Will try to post something tonight. ;)</div></div><hr />

Curious.  How did you manage to move the scroll bar to the left side of the chat window?  <br />
<br />
I think these pics are just graphics for now.  Not actualy in game shots.  Like templates to be used when they start the coding.<br />
<br />
I think that the scrollbars are going to have to be moved to the right side unless someone comes up with something amazing.  Which might be possbile, I have seen some amazing coding here.</div></div><hr />

whats wrong with animations files?  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Animation files always seem to break a UI with every patch the SOE does.  It just means more work to keep the UI up to date.  Generally, UIs without the animation file don't break (unless new windows are added and such, but even then they are still functional)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slowly but surely, it is coming together. I want to make sure everything works perfectly before moving on to another area.<br />
<br />
As you can see, the Static Bordering is complete, with the Player and part of the Group window completed as well as a touch on miscellanous areas.<br />
<br />
Here is what the interface looks like in-game at the moment in its &quot;baby&quot; stage.<br />
<br />
This is a 1024 x 768 version, and after it has been released, the 1280 x 1024 will be created that will house more &quot;goodies&quot;.<br />

P.S. - What're you putting in the animations file? Aside from cursor or buff background changes, I thought everything else could be coded in an extra xml (added through EQUI.xml) or on a per window basis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main change in the animations file was the window default bordering having it use a custom tga file to repeat larger width borders that has more graphical detail than just a 6 pixel repeat by default. This way, the unskinned windows will have the EQ2 border as well. The other little change was the round button that scrolls your window, being a little larger, staying as a circle when you scroll. Still have yet to do a cursor though, dunno if that will be an end result option yet.<br />
<br />
Should not be hard for even the most novice to keep the animations file updated as I have commented the Start and End of the edits made, and moved it all to the top of the Animations file.</div></div><hr />

BTW, for those who like to edit the graphic files, it should not be too hard to edit the background bording parts to inlay your own graphic strip where the black area is. (add in your own guild graphic, favorite image, etc.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, makes sense. This was probably the largest thing holding me back when I helped with ACUI and was initially looking at this UI's graphics because I refuse to edit EQUI_Animations.xml.<br />
<br />
If you decide not to have a custom cursor or buff backgrounds, consider moving the graphics for the borders to custom definitions in EQUI_Templates.xml and just have the default templates use the custom animations from there. It'll waste a little memory (RAM) but EQUI_Templates.xml is updated a little less often than EQUI_Animations.xml and will probably (gambling a little bit here) let you go longer without having to update the UI.<br />

<br />
The only other way is to make a new template, which I have always done, and skin the ones I am editing, but then you have that handful of people saying &quot;How can I skin my Bazaar window like the Target Window?&quot; .. I do not feel like going threw that mess... this way everything will be skinned automatically in every window.</div></div><hr />

Most of the main windows won't need that border anyway, just the chatwindow mainly... so I am going to keep the coding flow as I have always did, Without the Animations file.

<br />
I think we're not on the same page here.<br />
<br />
- All the windows use a &lt;DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
- All &lt;DrawTemplate&gt;'s are in EQUI_Templates.xml<br />
- All &lt;DrawTemplate&gt;'s  use graphics defined in EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
- Simply add custom &lt;TextureInfo&gt;'s and &lt;Ui2DAnimation&gt;'s to EQUI_Templates.xml and then have the default &lt;DrawTemplate&gt;'s use the custom &lt;Ui2DAnimation&gt;'s<br />
- This will make all default windows use your custom &lt;Ui2DAnimation&gt;'s because they use the modified &lt;DrawTemplate&gt;'s and this way you avoid having to change EQUI_Animations.xml but get the same effect<br />
<br />
The only &lt;Ui2DAnimation&gt;'s that I can think of that are special in EQUI_Animations.xml that are used directly by the game and not used through a &lt;DrawTemplate&gt; or loaded by a screen piece by name are:<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DefaultCursor&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_CursorResizeEW&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_CursorResizeNESW&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_CursorResizeNS&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_CursorResizeNWSE&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_CursorDrag&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;BuffIcons&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_SpellIcons&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;BlueIconBackground&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;RedIconBackground&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_SpellGems&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DragItem&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DividerLeft&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DividerMiddle&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DividerRight&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DividerVertical&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
And I'm not even 100% sure about the ones past the 6 cursor &lt;Ui2DAnimation&gt;'s, but anything not listed there is used by name in the XML and so can be bypassed elsewhere in some way or another.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you decided to scrap modified templates being applied to the default windows, this is a moot point.<br />

2. you make me feel like i should come back to EQ... this UI make me want to play ! (damn EQ break ! never worked for me)<br />
<br />
I've been playing for 5 years. Every 9 months I take a 3 month break, usually around Christmas/New Years. I only have 1 char; total play time 340 days, 5 hours, and 13 minutes. Modding the UI has been the reason I've gotten back into the game after a 3 month break twice, so if this UI has you interested so much, come back and play. What's the worst that could happen? ^_^<br />

LOL.  I took a break once, but I still followed up on reading patch information and updates at CastersRealm.  Can you really consider yourself on a break if you are still keeping informed on the game?  Granted you aren't playing, but still....<br />

<br />
Its ok though... I now have it coded not to use any &quot;touchy&quot; files... so when there is a Patch, this UI will have a 1% to break :)<br />
<br />
Good idea though, I'll keep that idea on the back burner</div></div><hr />

Every so often I take a small break from EQ, normally this is when I get my UI ideas and start working hard on a design which pushes me back into the game to try and figure out how it'll work. ;)</div></div><hr />

Hey there. :)<br />

A great deal of the items you see in these shots are created by hand in Photoshop and not using elements from the actual games themselves, add that to the need to create totally new windows and that is the creative process. :)<br />

Though it would be great to work for Sony, I'm afraid there is no reason why they should pay for the design we are doing here. :)  The original concept behind the EQ2UI interface stems from the real EQ2 Interface that is owned by SOE. :)<br />

In this world you are garanteed that if anything you say can be taken two ways and one is worse than the other it will be taken for the worse. I guess people just expect the worst. Personally I always expect that people are good natured and I use the traditional &quot;until proven guilty&quot; approach. I find it serves me well.<br />

I am in no way saying anyone did anything wrong in mis-interpreting either though. No matter how hard we all try there will be miscommunications on forums because humans just need to see the facial expressions and tones that go along with messages and message boards can provide us neither.
