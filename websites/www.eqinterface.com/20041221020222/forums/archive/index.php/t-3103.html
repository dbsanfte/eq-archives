<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Armengar</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I discovered this purely by accident and I have no idea if it's been posted before because I'm not really sure what sort of search terms to use.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was running throught Nekktulos Forest at night and I was having trouble reading some of my font color choices. Instead of changing the colors I though I would try turning off the background image and setting a brighter tint color in the chat window. I had the alpha set to 50% and when I used an off-white tint color my view through the chat window was like I had Ultravision cast on me.<br />
<br />
I decided to take this one step further and created an empty chat window with NO channels assigned to it. I right clicked on the frame to bring up the menu for that window, went to Window &gt; Background &gt; Image (as I recall) to turn off the texture overlay, went to Window &gt; Background &gt; Tint Color to bring up the color picker window. I chose a bright color close to white, resized the window to fill the center of my screen and there it was ... <br />
<br />
:nana: Night Vision Window :nana:<br />
<br />
I now have a thin chat window across the top of my screen and whenever I need to see in the dark I grab the bottom of it and pull it down. If anyone is interested or just curious I'll post a screenshot with more specific instructions later.</div></div><hr />

I personally would love to see a pic of this with instructions on how to do it.  Would really help out a lot for my night blind Human Pally or at least serve as an alternative to my having to find someone to cast a spell on me so I can see past my nose.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've suspected that someone would discover this eventually.  I don't like to discuss these ..um.. workarounds... until someone else spills the beans.<br />
<br />
This &quot;bug&quot; has been out there since before the new UI but wasn't really able to be easily turned to a player advantage.  Spell effect particles cause the same affect and more than once is the time in the old world that I would start casting and cancel just to be able to see the surroundings.<br />
<br />
The chat window with it spawning ability is ideal for manipulating the brightness of the viewing area with the exception of not being able to click thru it when its &quot;on&quot;.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I can't think of any easy way for Verant to &quot;fix&quot; this display bug either.  Good, bad or otherwise this one will be around for awhile.</div></div><hr />

I took a screenshot while playing lastnight and I'll post it this afternoon when I get home from work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this isn't the best comparison screenshot - but you can see the distinct difference in the clarity of the image especially on the darker elements such as the floor.  <br />
Even characters that have ultravision (dark-elves) will notice a significant improvement in distance of visibility in the following situtations: darkness, matching textures (sky, wall, tree), weather (snow, rain).<br />
This is recommended for use during all travel.</div></div><hr />
