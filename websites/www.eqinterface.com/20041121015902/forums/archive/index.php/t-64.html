<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kryscha</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been doing a bit of playing with the spell bar, and I thought I had successfully removed the spellbook icon from the bar.  However, when I ran the skin, EQ crashed me back to desktop.  It didn't give me an XML error which I was getting to start with, so I'm assuming that I coded it correctly.<br />
<br />
Anyone know of a way to remove it properly, or does EQ require that the spellbook icon be on the bar (or somewhere on your interface) to hook into it?<br />

You could try resizing it down to 1 pixel and/or making it unclickable.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if either of these things would work though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Be sure you remove the &lt;Pieces&gt; for the spellbook icon at the bottom of the .xml file... that should fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another solution I forgot to mention is that you can resize the window so that the spellbook icon doesn't display.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaprotu</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Veirna: That solution unfortunatly does not work.   EQ expects to find the buttons there as someone else said.<br />
<br />
My work around has been 2 fold:<br />
Change the X, Y, CX, and CY (position and size settings) all to 0.  This doesn't cause any errors.<br />
<br />
Replace all graphic calls with A_WhitePixel.  I do this because the graphic isn't shown but I don't trust EQ not to load it anyways.  It might not be necessary but I dunno, A_WhitePixel is quite a bit smaller than any other button image.</div></div><hr />

Have you guys made a change to the Spell Gems that he could download?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saprano</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've emailed this to the site a few times, but it hasn't been posted yet...this is a vertical spell icon bar with no spell book....enjoy =)<br />
<br />
I attached a .txt copy of the file to this post...not sure exactly how it works since this is my first day using this board, but hopefully that works for you =).  Just remember to either change the format back to .xml or just copy and paste everything inside into your current cast spell window xml.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khallin</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran into this error when I first tried to remove the Invite/Disband buttons from the group box.  It crashes, even if you remove all reference to those, so the game is expecting them to be defined &amp; called.<br />
<br />
The only way I know to really get rid of it, as was said, is to reduce the CX &amp; CY to 0.  And to think of it, I've changed the window size so that it's not even showing (moved bottom edge above where the buttons were set).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the same thing.  There are several different default UI items that will crash you to desktop if you remove them.  The Group Invite button, the Inventory Auto Equip Area, etc.  You cannot remove them, and you cannot remove the &lt;Pieces&gt; for them either.  What you can do is change their size to 0 x 0 to make them invisible.<br />
<br />
Apparently the code specifically references some of the UI items, and is extremely ungraceful in what it does when they are missing.  On the whole I've been very unimpressed with how much &quot;customization&quot; they gave us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grippa</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">UI mod newbie here.<br />
<br />
I started playing with my UI yesterday and foud that I can remove the spell book icon from the spell bar. I get an error logged in the errors file but see no adverse effects in game. So it looks like this problem has been fixed, at least in part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following line is your friend.<br />
<br />
&lt;ButtonDrawTemplate /&gt;<br />
<br />
Change the size of the button to 0, 0 and replace the ButtonDrawTemplate stuff with the line above and you will still have the button in the window to keep EQ happy, but it will load no graphics for it.<br />
 <br />
You can also use it to make functional buttons that are invisible.<br />
<br />
Another neet trick is to use it to make an invisible generic button that is sized nearly the same size as the window. Have it load as the first &lt;Piece&gt; and it will keep that annoying right click menue from popping up when you misclick, but everthing on the window will still be functional.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobynnMerrilin</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also have a non-spellbook icon gem window.  Small gems, small, innocuous button at the bottom with no icon and no text so you can still use the favorites.<br />
<br />
Check out my skins to see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scubby</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, now with the latest patch giving us the AWESOME feature of memed spell sets by right clicking on the SPELL BOOK ICON, it would seem like that little icon has a WHOLE NEW ROLE!<br />
<br />
So, now all of those mods that eliminated the spell book icon are rendered useless overnight! LOL, dam SOE. Really tho, kudos to them for adding a GREAT FEATURE.<br />
<br />
Anyway, get to work all you spell book moders and put that spell book icon back!</div></div><hr />
