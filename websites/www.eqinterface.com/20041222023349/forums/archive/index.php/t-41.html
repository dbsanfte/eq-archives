Becuase of the varying size the container size cannot be changed it is hard-coded so no matter how many elements you remove you'll just end up with whitespace.  The done and combine buttons are bounded to the base of the window to move them around you increase the distance they are bound by.  The reason for the binding is that the window varies in size, this way no matter how big the window they'll always appear in the same spot.  <br />

Can't remember the exact name of the settings but if your still having trouble let me know and I'll go have a look.</div></div><hr />
