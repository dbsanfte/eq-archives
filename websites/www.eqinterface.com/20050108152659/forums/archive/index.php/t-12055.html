<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ascot</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before I even start I'll say I know next to nothing about XML or creating the UI files. That being said, I have an old UI that I contiuned to use even though it was out of date and was not being updated. Some of you may rember the &quot;Kiraini-Ranger&quot; UI from some time ago. Recently I downloaded a new one &quot;Tablets Wood-Green v.1.6&quot; found here :<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2062<br />
<br />
Now I wanted to bring the pet window from Kiraini-Ranger over to this one, however every time I try my client crashes.<br />
<br />
Methods so far taken include creating a new folder with all of &quot;Wood-Green&quot; and the pet window from &quot;Kiriani-Ranger&quot; as well as trying to override the pet window in the orginal files I unziped from, niether has worked.<br />
<br />
If there is any infromation you can give me, I would be most appreciative.</div></div><hr />
