I have no grapics experience nor XML coding exp. So I figured I would post a screen shot and see if anyone would roll with the idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Margrave</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does that mean you might throw one together Drakah? I have been a fan of your UI work, your WoW UI is amazing. Yeah the parchment background is a must for the look and feel of the first screenshot, I think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Margrave</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I would love to have just the default UI with those boarders and that paper background. With no custom animation file needed, the UI would much safer in the face of patches. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, I totally cringed at having to use an animations file for the Warcraft one, which will be the only UI that will have one for - unless I find another method.</div></div><hr />

It looks fantastic.  Only problem is i didnt get picked for the beta test for LOE :-(  Contact me if i can help ya out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Margrave</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I don't think you have to be in the LOE beta, there is a demo out there that can be downloaded, it is kind of big but I DL'ed it and tried it out, looked and felt alot like warcraft, but that's a good thing. =) I got the demo from ign I think if I remember correct. This is great that there is a bunch of people interested in this concept. I am very excited to see Drakah interested! =) Can't wait to see what might come of this!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">narrwin</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like that indeed, now if someone could take that and tint it green and then modify some of the menus and windows to be Ranger class friendly (light on the graphics) then we would be set. As of this time there are no compact Ranger friendly UI's out yet and i would like to see it. I have some good idea's but not a lick of experience in SIDL so if your interested in making something like i described and need the feedback send me a message or email me at Jediguy1977@aol.com</div></div><hr />

Make you deal, if you can splice out some of the visuals fro mthe game into SS (jpg or tga format) I will work on doing coding for it. I think it is a very interesting design, and I am going to work on doing some mod work on it. I like the pic and seeing as of late that is the only form of exposure to LOE that I have I am going to use the SS itself to mod a mock up of in the near future.</div></div><hr />
