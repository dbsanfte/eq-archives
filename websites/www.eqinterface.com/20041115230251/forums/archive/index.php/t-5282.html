<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been working on making some more animated windows.  Not by putting animations into windows but by animating the borders, right in the WDT.  I've used the help window to test my creation.<br />
<br />
First I doubled the size of the title bar so there's more room to work with.  Besides changing the graphics for the three parts of the title bar itself, that also means changing the border at the top left, left top, top right and right top so things line up.<br />
<br />
Then I changed the minimize button to a dancing character and the close button to a spinning skull.  The pictures don't do it justice, they really move!  You'll have to excuse the lack of transparency on the graphics, this is just pre-beta.<br />
<br />
Finally I added a pop-up surprise on the right side.  It looks like a normal window most of the time (top picture), but every few minutes a little surprise animation pops out.  Sorry folks, you get the edited version.  Changing the width of the right side means changing the right bottom, bottom right, right top and top right borders as well, to make things line up.<br />
<br />
The ability to use animations for every part of a window instead of just static graphics was one of the first things touted for the new interface, but nobody seems to take advantage of it.<br />
<br />
Anyone else working on this sort of thing?  Have any good ideas for other animations you'd like to see?  Done right, this sort of animation could really make windows come alive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onetwo1212</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting idea.  I like the look, now that is eye candy I can live with. It would be nice to add some of this to other mods ie the jpg and instructions for inserting the code into our windows.  Would this have to be done to each window one by one?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These changes are to the actual window type, not the contents of any one window.  If I were to go into EQUI_Animations and change the default window type (WDT_Def) to this, all windows would look like this.  Without any changes to their individual xml files.<br />
<br />
I didn't want to change everything just for tests though.  Here I've just put my WDT in the HelpWindow file so it only affects the help window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Horaxe</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice idea, lots of possibilities. The spinning skull be nice for any Necro or SK, or someone's who's pretty morbid.<br />
<br />
Look forward to seeing what the finished product looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qassack</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please do some more with this !  Or maybe someone else can? My .xml abilities are nil, but these additions would be great. You could have class based windows, or even guild based ones. <br />
<br />
Spinning skull for necro/sk, or maybe moving epic-style pics. <br />
<br />
Hmm, if you have the pop out picture on the right, does this work by a set time limit? This could be a very interesting way to add a timer. Have a big ugly mob pop out for instance when your mez timer was due to wear off etc. Something to grab your attention. <br />
<br />
Somebody please experiment with this idea !!</div></div><hr />
