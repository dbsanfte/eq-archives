 What app do you use to view the .xml files that the interface uses?<br />
I can edit the &quot;text&quot; of the files but would like to be able to edit the &quot;image&quot; of the xml directly like FrontPage handles html files.<br />
What allows this if anything?<br />
Thanks,<br />
Feeb</div></div><hr />

<br />
for graphics I use the G.I.M.P. (Gnu Image Manipulation Program) wich is a open-source alternative to Photoshop, was designed for Unices, but has been  ported to windows as well.<br />
<br />
...and yes, I am usually running a form of Unix (Linux), only have windows on one computer (out of my 4 desktops, 1 laptop, and 24-server combo) just so I can play EQ easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I understand it, the only way to see the output of these xml and image files is through EQ. The xml and image files we're manipulating is only part of the information needed to be able to conjure up the results. Some of the key information is hard-coded into EQ. Thus without EQ, we can't see our changes take effect, let alone be able to manipulate it as Front Page does with html.<br />
<br />
Maybe as things progess, someone will be able to create what you're looking for but for now it isn't possible.<br />
<br />
Hope that made some sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's very possible to make an offline viewer that would allow WYSIWYG editting of the XML, but it's gonna take the right person to make the time it would take to make that and not get paid for it.<br />

It will allow for people to preview new UI adjustments without taking up bandwidth or spots in the login queue, saving them money...sort of :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find its easier to just use a screen shot to position things, mainly because you can see the exact location in x,y coords</div></div><hr />
