But, I also know this is a great looking, well planned and organized website that is going to be very popular for a very long time.  Further recognition need to be given the administrator and staff for just keeping up with all patches and telling us what will and will not work.  Thank you for you effort and dedication.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pavelov</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If this site is so well designed and planned, why is it EVERY time I visit it, I must &quot;wait 1-5 minutes and click refresh&quot;? I really hope Casters Realm or Allahkazam's picks up Skin mods and such.<br />
<br />
 These guys don't seem to know what's going on, and I'll admit, I don't know how to set up a site like this. But, I DO know that when you want someone to visit your web site, you want your content 100% available and your visitors able to actually visit the site without worry about your memory upgrades.<br />
<br />
 Plus, I remember when they &quot;set up the new front-end&quot; and lambasted a guy for making a suggestion. They are real cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah Casters Realm or  Allahkazam's never went through any growing pains. There servers always worked flawlessly from the start. Heck even EQVault had bad cpu / bandwidth problems when they opened. I remember every time there was a patch on EQ eqvault was down for the count.<br />
<br />
We will have the bugs worked out soon :)<br />
<br />
Currently we are doubleing our processor speed and getting 4x more ram. Hope to have the upgrades in by monday.<br />
<br />
I admit that I have never ran a dedicated server before but I think I'm learning pritty darn fast. Its only been a week since we have been on our dedicated server give us a fricken chance would ya?<br />
<br />
I just feel why do I need to sell my slef or my site to you? We dont charge, we dont have advertisements. All money is coming from out of my own pocket.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you have to understand things are a good deal more frustrateing for us though.<br />
<br />
guess were doing pritty darn good since we have only gotten two letters like this. One via email and one posted in this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cronos</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't worry to much about the malcontents, the site is great looking, kept up to date and has about every skin imaginable and will only get better. Considering there are few other UI sites available it is the best and will only get better. And if they can do better, then perhaps they should foot some of the costs in operating it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chadoz</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my two cents worth here. I am darned glad that this site is here. So what if I have to wait for a few minutes to get in, oh well. I know they are working on it!! All in all I know when this site does get up and running smoothly there will be no other like it. It is like one in a million to have such clean and easy design not only to look at but actually functional also.<br />
<br />
From personal experience I know how hard it is to run a dedicated server I wouldn’t want to put that kind of stress on anyone.<br />
<br />
Well all I have to say is Thank god they are here and are willing to work to GIVE us the opportunity to enjoy a site like this.<br />
<br />
My thanks go out to you all that help make this site possible. And one of my favorites.</div></div><hr />

Site is great! Takes a while to adjust to the loads of new visitors, but once you guys do, the site will be at the top in this area.</div></div><hr />

I host a messageboard myself, and it went through an explosive growth intially too, though nowhere near the numbers y'all have here. <br />
<br />
Knowing the system you're using and doing a little math I realise the bandwidth consumption per month and the dedicated processor time are staggering. <br />
<br />
My deepest sympathies for whoever pays the bill for this.<br />
<br />
Great work guys, keep it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ignore the troll, keep up the good work!<br />
There will always be 'tards trying to stir up trouble, best to just ignore em - they loose interest after a while and usually never return.<br />
<br />
This has been covered in two threads now, IE:<br />

Just lock or delete new ones, with a brief explanation why,  as they pop up is my advice</div></div><hr />
