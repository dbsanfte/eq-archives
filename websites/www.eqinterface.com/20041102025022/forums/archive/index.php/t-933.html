<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-13-2002, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I've totally overhauled the interface, keeping only 1 of my mods - the spellbook (it's too cool, IMO).  everything else I snagged from eqinterface.com or eqgui.com (eqinterface's forums) and mish-mashed it together.  I like this one a LOT. (reload the page to make sure you got the current picture)<br />

<br />
The round windows are part of a new mod being developed called &quot;Techno Donuts&quot; and are still a little buggy.  the animal skin/spellbook is mine, the buff window is from eqinterface.com.  the spell icons are being developed, and almost completed (many are still duplicated versions, the guy is making unique ones instead). The maps are actually my &quot;Actions&quot; window, and were released by eqtoolbox.not.net - so far, I've found a map that isn't included (Umbral Plains) but it has most likely every other one in the game.  And yes, the guy in the middle of my inventory rotates.  (I usually don't have the inventory, spellbook, and maps up on the screen lol)<br />
<br />
I have modified the interface a bit, by making the hotkey buttons round, to match the rest of the interface, and have redesigned the spell gem window to be a simple round window with the gems around the edges of the window.  The gems go in 2 columns, from top to bottom.  1-4 on the left, and 5-8 on the right.  The spell book icon is in the center, and the spell casting bar appears just under the window when you are casting something (not actually connected to the window)<br />
<br />
------<br />
To make my hitsmode &quot;window&quot;:<br />
<br />
<br />
First I make a large &quot;background&quot; chat box<br />
<br />
then I have 4 seperate windows listed there.  1 for my hits, 1 for me getting hit, 1 for others hits.  I also have 1 on top that is all the &quot;garbage&quot; messages I didn't want cluttering up my main chat.  I have the me and my boxes at font size 3, the others at font size 1, and the &quot;garbage&quot; at 2.  I then position them on the background chat window, and make all the windows except the background have their background alphas set to 0, thus making them permanently invisible, leaving only the text.  Thus, I am showing 1 nice, neat window there instead of 4 bulky, cluttered ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
(note - the background window *must* be the first window made out of the set, or else when you zone, log, etc it WILL appear on top of the others, and effectively hide them)<br />

I'm hoping that the guy who is working on that gets more of the windows that way, cause they are cool.  The spell icons themselves come from http://pub37.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=74.topic.  the spell buff box design comes from eqinterface.com (&quot;Geddine's Buff Window&quot; or something like that).  and the maps are from eqtoolbox.not.net.<br />
<br />
I'm still making some minor adjustments to the layout, mainly trying to get my chat and hitsmodes windows fixed where they are &quot;pleasing&quot; to my sense of asthetics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest problem with a zipfile is the sheer size of it.  currently 5MB in size.  The internet hosting site I use won't permit a file THAT big on their site, so I'm looking for other methods.  I will include my UI_name_31.ini file, for quick, and easy integration, but be warned - I work in 1280x1024 resolution, and have several transparent chat windows on my display (for hitsmodes and things) that are...... difficult to adjust.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again, I can only take credit for the spellbook in this mod, everything else is credited to other people.<br />
<br />
Also: to replace the spellbook with a different one, just find the spellbook mod you want, apply this mod, then apply the replacement spellbook on top of this one, which will replace the EQUI_SpellbookWnd.xml (or whatever it is called), and spellbook01.tga - spellbook04.tga files, and presto, no animal skin.  The techno donuts has a interesting spellbook included with the mod originally, and replacing that one back in will give the full look and feel as was intended by the designer of the mod (I found that it was difficult to read the spell names on that spellbook).<br />
<br />
The mod has also been fixed to work with the August 14th patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
As the parts that make up this mod are in a &quot;state of flux&quot;, IE changing constantly, I will most likely be adding in the changes and improving this all the time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">right click on window, and select &quot;*Lock&quot; to unlock the window positions.  I don't like to accidentally move my windows around.  Be warned - moving the chat windows is a bit tricky, I have hitsmode windows all over the smaller visible window.  Plus, with the lack of a title bar, you have to move the chat windows by &quot;resizing them into position&quot; (minor flaw in the UI, IMHO).  And removing a chat window from my display requires loading in the default UI, and then closing the chat window you want.<br />
<br />
Also, type ALT-W for the window selector.  I like it hidden, but it is there, sitting on top of the main chat.<br />
<br />
If you wanna start from scratch on the chat windows, I would recommend not using my UI_Oguler_31.ini, and rather just starting fresh &amp; new.  putting the windows into their respective corners (and sides) isn't all that hard.</div></div><hr />

I simply had the problem moving that damn backround box which is always there and is not fading... :) - I'll delete the ui.ini and start all over - thanks again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, I made them at 75% or 80% for the alpha settings for the backgrounds on my two visible chat windows, that way it doesn't fade in and out (which drives me nuts) on me, but still can be seen through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qalen</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like faded windows since I am caster and don't give much about hitsmode....<br />
but well, I started all over again but I still can't move chatwindows - I can change their size, np, but I can't drag them anywhere else - you usualy drag at their name bar but there is no name bar - how did you turn that off or how do I get it back to drag them, please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">use the ability to resize the chat windows to move them, it's a flaw in the ui that won't let you move them without a title bar.<br />
<br />
There's a flag in the chat window's XML file that lets you turn on or off the title, minimize and close buttons.</div></div><hr />

Also the subsiquent graphics files.  the Inventory is not my design, was developed for the Techno Donuts mod, listed under Beta.<br />
<br />
When I get the other windows I want modded done, to match the rest of this design, then I will break out the individual components, and have them available accordingly.  please don't make any requests for specific high-quality graphics from me, I did not design any except for my spellbook (and I've redone elements in the techno donuts for the spell gems, plus added in new buttons/windows to match the UI)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zzorn</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So if I just wanted to get your Inventory copy inventory XML and animation XML? Last time I copied in a foreign Animations.xml the UI stopped working and kept reverting to default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No.  Obviously, I wasn't descriptive enough.  Copy this:<br />
<br />
1. complete Inventory XML file<br />
2. complete Invetory graphics files<br />
3. parts of the Animation XML file that are needed to do the inventory<br />
<br />
maybe also:<br />
4. parts of the Templates XML file that are needed to do the inventory<br />
<br />
<br />
You do not copy the entire Animations XML file, you have to copy only the parts that are required for the inventory.  What are those parts? I don't know off hand - because I didn't make that inventory mod.  I am adapting the Techno Donuts mod posted here: http://forums.eqinterface.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=746<br />
<br />
Nibbuhlz developed the round windows, I have enhanced/modified a few things, added in some other content, and reformatted it for 1280x1024.  Reading previous statements I made within this very thread would reveal all of that in it's entirety.  Also that Nibbuhlz is working on a Techno Donuts version 2.0 Which is better.  It is very easy to pull out the inventory part of the mod, if you know &amp; can read where the XML entrys are in the correct files to make the move.  If not, it is probably not a good idea to try.<br />
<br />
Why haven't I made it easier to pull this out?  Because it is not my mod originally, and I'm to busy tweaking it how I want it, by adding in other windows that fit the designs, to be concerned over trivialities like how to break out a part of the coding anyway.</div></div><hr />
