<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detton</div><div class="date">03-25-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the release of Vert 2.5 I've gotten everythign back like I had it before, with the exception of my t.king compass and spellbook. I'm assuming for the compass I just have to wait for t.king to release an updated .tga file. But I'm at a loss as to how to get my spellbook back. The file on the Vert list no longer works for me. Any ideas how to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
For the compass, Change the name of Window_peice04.tga (t.kings) to the name Compass.tga and put in same folder with 2.5a and it should work correctly..BUT I have not tested this method yet.. sooo if it doesnt  post back and I will tell you how to fix it.</div></div><hr />

with 2.5a we changed the compass call out to &quot;compass.tga&quot; instead of &quot;pieceo4.tga&quot; <br />
<br />
keep the XML file but do the rename and it should find it..<br />
<br />
if not , let me know... because if you replace peice04 with Tkings you will be missing the charmslot graphics for Vert..</div></div><hr />

Right again. I had forgotten that I did a paste-up of TKing's compass to the Vert window pieceso4...Sorry:(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detton</div><div class="date">04-01-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I renamed the Remmelio/t.king file to compass.tga and deleted EQUI_CompassWnd.xml from my vert2.5 folder, and that fixed my compass.<br />
<br />
Kudane:<br />
I took the EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml you posted, spellbook01.tga through spellbook04.tga from Sokol-Tking-SpellBookv1a.zip (found on the Vert featured page) and tkspellbook01.tga through tkspellbook05.tga from the spellbook I want from the Tking/Remmelio site (Crimson). What I got was the older, smaller default Tking spellbook, with the lower left part of the image not lined up properly. Using the fix file from the Vert featured page, I previously had the new larger Tking book. The way it looks now, with the mis-alligned image, is how my old spellbook looked in Vert 2.1 or 2.3 before I got that fix file. Attached a shot of it.</div></div><hr />
