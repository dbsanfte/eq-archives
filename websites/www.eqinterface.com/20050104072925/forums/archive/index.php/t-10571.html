<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chesley</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, Ive been messing around with my UI since just about Day 1 learning how to manipulate the interface but Im still no expert. <br />
<br />
Today I decided to take things a bit further, complicated for me but probably simple to everyone else. Im trying to rework my Hotbutton box to include aspects of other windows.<br />
<br />
Designing the new window I tried to add aspects of Selectorwnd and the Class Animation from Inventory. Very simply put I stuck the Selectorwnd files into the Hotbuttonwnd and removed the Selectorwnd file from the EQUI. This sort of works, I get zero UIError reports on this but the buttons will not pull up the windows when pressed. Is this just not compatible at all?<br />
<br />
Secondly is the Class animation moveable from the Inventorywnd? It shows up in the new Hotbuttonwnd but does not select the proper animation. Also I had to delete the Classanimation field in the Inventorywnd which does get me a Error message saying it can not be found but irregardless shows up exactly where I want it to be. <br />
<br />
Are these combinations possible? Am I just missing something completely stupid when trying to combine these aspects? <br />
<br />
Personally, Im stumped. If anyone has the time help is always appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Only items with an EQType work in other windows.  I tried the same thing with money slots...</div></div><hr />
