<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asele</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I came up with a great mental picture just now.  Perfect UI imagery for me to use.  Unfortunately my artistic abilities extend about as far as a fish can walk.  Here's a brief description of what i had in mind.  I have pretty detailed images in my head.  On top of that I need someone to create the UI for me.  Both the artist and skinner will receive full credit for their part as I will receive credit for the concept.  I will pay both party members for services rendered, and the UI will be free to anyone who wants it.<br />
<br />
The theme is along the lines of archaic, dragons, and sorcery.<br />
<br />
*Compass - Archaic font, custom borders/needle.<br />
*Effects - Same border and font as above in the small font next to the icon format.<br />
*Group Window - Same font/border.  %'s over all health bars.<br />
*Hotkeys - Here comes the fun part...I'd like to combine the spell bar, 8 inventory slots, and the inventory stats all into one.  Naturally, same font/etc.<br />
*Inventory - Background images for all of the slots....i.e. a pic of a face of some sort in the face slot etc.  They do not have to remain in current order.  In fact I'd encourage change.  Would also like to see imagery for the saves, hp, ac, atk stuff.  Maybe an icon for each one.  if this is/isn't possible let me know.<br />
*Spell Book - Most important one.  I play a wizzie and I'd really like to see the spellbook revamped.  I want it to look like an ancient text with lots of sybolism in between spell slots.  I'd like a slightly transparent dragon in the background of the book as well.  Extremely custom spellbook here.  Lots of work for the artist.<br />
*Spell Gems - Also highly customized.  2nd most important to the spellbook itself.<br />
*Player info - something that fits into the rest of the theme.  Have specific lines i want/don't want in it.<br />
*Target info- same as player info, doesn't have to be fancy, just same font/border.<br />
<br />
I believe 100% in rewarding someone for their hard work.  That is why I am offering cash.  I will post pics of the project as it moves along.  I would also like permission to use the LocWizard in this UI.  All contributers will receive credit for their work in a credits tab/window/something.  The completed product will then be freely given to anyone and everyone who would like a copy of it.  I'm not doing this to make money in any way.  I just want something I lack the knowledge to do myself.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in helping me out with this conquest show me a sample of something you've already done.  We can negotiate a price prior to beginning of work, and I will pay 50% up front and 50% upon completion.  All parties involved will be given a means of contacting me online 24 hours a day and will probably meet online more than once to collaborate on things.  At which point more specific details will be given about all the stuff and I will send a copy of the font I want to use.<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">would this be a zero programming effort on the part of the artist?  I program slightly better than a fish can walk, but not much.  (translation : if you tell me how big it needs to be and what you want it to look like I can make whatever you like - but dont ask me to open an xml editor  or I will have to go into nervous twitching = ie. see my spider gems)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am completely devoid of any artistic talent however I'm fully capable of applying art to the UI and am plenty good at XML (I can actually program, C++ and Delphi, and I do not believe XML is programming nor is HTML) but regardless, I can do what you need as far as XML is concerned. I just finished my personal UI which you can see a pic of in this thread:<br />
http://eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2507 <br />
<br />
I will require that you allow me to work for free, but I am obsessed with EQ's new UI being customizable and am dedicated to getting the most out of it, so I don't think you'll have to worry about me not getting anything done.<br />
<br />
So, to sum it up, I can do all the XML you want but will have to be provided with the artwork =/<br />
<br />
Enokhaon Starfyre<br />
Mage<br />
Innoruuk Server<br />
<br />
P.S. - Rundown of what I think is possible with the ideas you posted:<br />
Compass - Easy (just need the artwork)<br />
Effects - Not sure if the UI font is changeable, I'll check, other than that, easy<br />
Group Window - Easy<br />
Hotkeys - I don't believe you can combine the spell cast window and the hotkey window however they can be designed so that they fit together graphically and appear to be one window (the spell cast window has XML code specific to it, as do all windows)<br />
Inventory - Piece of Cake, yes icons for each resist is possible<br />
Spellbook - Shouldn't be too tough, graphics will be though<br />
Spell Gems - Art isn't my thing... and that's all this would require<br />
Player Info - Easy<br />
Target Info - Easy<br />
<br />
So, only possible catches:<br />
Not sure if font is changeable<br />
Spell Casr window and Hotkey window will probably have tor emain seperate windows, but will fit togetehr graphically</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asele</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx all for the interest.<br />
<br />
KneightSkye - Looking forward to hearing from you and your buddy.<br />
Tadashya - Artwork would be 99% independant of coding.  Only required connection i see would be need to know required image sizes for the UI.  Any other connection to XML Coder shy of collaborations we will have in order to accomplish this will be optional.<br />
Haliken - I think it is possible.  Although it may be that the below posted link is actually a very smooth way of creating the illusion you describe.  Either one works great as long as there is room for me to leave the help file or another file open for the LocWiz.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=301<br />
<br />
This is where my hotkey idea was spawned.  Love the concept, want my own art =P<br />
<br />
Averad - I will post screenshots of the UI as individual components are created.  I won't post the actual UI until it is 100% finished.  Once it is ready, I will upload it.  One thing I want is to be 100% sure that the artist and coder receive credit somewhere in the UI for their work.   Possible ways of doing this so that it cannot be undone will be discussed between the artist, coder, and myself.  I'm trying to avoid having it all over the pics however.<br />
<br />
**On a side note.  I won't force anyone to take payment from me, but this is a lot of time and effort in the making.  I will find some way to repay your efforts, even if it is not monitarily.  I believe 100% in Karma and in rewarding one's efforts.<br />
<br />
If anyone wishes to contact me in game about this feel free to do so.  My char name/server are all to your left.  If I'm not in game I'm probably asleep or at work.  In either case it's then best to reach me here.<br />

Well I am happy to work with other people's ideas.  I found I havent the slightest idea on how to begin making a personal GUI.  I dont click anything.  I alt-hotkey everything and shift-alt my banks.  My ideal UI would have a target bar, mana bar, an exp bar and 6 chat windows!<br />

To be completely honest, the XML will probably take one day (maybe 6 hours, possibly less, XML is easy and fast) to get the basic stuff done then maybe a week of fine tuning with the graphics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asele</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok the spellbook dragon.  You'll have to excuse my inability to describe this briefly.  Try to imagine this scene and hit the pause button.  That's the image i'm looking for.<br />
<br />
Imagine a dragon flying through the sky towards a village.  You are standing in front of the village facing the dragon head on.  When the dragon gets just in front of you it spreads it's wings out fully.  Face toward the ground staring right at you.  Feet just above your head.  It exhales a narrow but forceful pillar of flame from it's mouth.  As the flame hits the ground it creates an upside-down mushroom cloud look of flame.  Kind of as if the flame was bouncing off of a shield creating a wider flame that curves upward and outward from the point of impact.  Now pause the image with the flame &quot;bounce&quot; creating a wall about as tall as your average human.  I want that image full frontal of the dragon.  The wingspan would cover most of the spellbook, the height of the narrow bodied dragon would cover the top 2/3 of the book.  The flame would cover just over the bottom 1/3 of the book.  No human actually in the image please.  This image would actually appear as an overlay in the book, with no background other than the custom look of the book's pages themselves.  The dragon would be a black dragon, with bone protruding from the joints in the wings.  The spine from the back of the head to the back of the dragon would have extruding bone.  The color of it woul dbe dark blue at the base, fading to pure white at the tips.  Kind of a razor effect.  The only visible extrusions would be from it's lowered head pointing at the ground.  The eyes would be red with cloudy white pupils.  The scales on the under side of the dragon would be red, and the tip of the tail would not be visible due to flames in front of it.  The claws at the wingtips would be spread angrily.  I want the dragon to seem evil and vengeful.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions about this image feel free to let me know.  I'm up till about midnight PST and back up again at 7am PST.<br />
<br />
I'd also love opinions and suggestions on this.  Fantasy and realism are welcomed.<br />
<br />
**Edit** I forgot to mention that the body of the dragon would flare down with the sudden stop of the upper body as it positions to exhale the angry flames.  So the underside, not the backside for the most part would be the visible are.  I'll do a VERY rough MS paint sketch to better articulate this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asele</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well this is my ROUGH sketch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aw now that's cute ;)<br />
<br />
I will see what I can come up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my sketch of your sketch.  I wonderered at first if this would be too large now I realize you want the fire/wings/head etc to be the spellbook.  (Essentially raise the claws to the level of the eyes/ears to hint at the top of the spellbook - snout to the center of the page.) <br />
<br />
But that in itself presents its own problem.  In the spellbook I did for my &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; the fire is too brilliant to show text, so I ended up muting it out.  I like design but I like usability too.<br />
<br />
Each placard of text would have to have its own frame within the fire and you may lose some detail.  Not sure if I can color this to my satisfaction but I will play around with it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asele</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, never thought of doing the dragon holding the book.  That's a great idea too.  I was actually thinking of having the wingtips be at the upper left and right corners of the open pages, and have it be inside the spellbook, like your new image that you want a coder for in the help forum.<br />
<br />
Enok....is the sketch Tad posted doable for the spellbook from a coding aspect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asele</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also...Can the spell slots be put at the outer extremities...i.e. the left page spells are half sized and all lined up vertically along the left andge, and the opposite for the right side?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">both are doable Asele ( not by me , but by someone :p )<br />
You can put any backgroud you want as spellbook and put your gems anywhere you want on this background. You can even have dragon wings as pages , eyes as pageup / down , and pillar of flame as &quot;done&quot; button if you want ( well, I 'think' that is possible :p never touched XML , but read here a lot and I think I understand the limitations ) . But Tadashia got a good idea for the book, no need to change it. <br />
<br />
Good luck on your UI<br />
<br />
<br />
btw , i loved your ROUGH sketck ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">inked this in a bit.. messing around mostly still because I am not commited to anything specific yet.  the dragon may still become the spellbook (as long as I dont have to code it ;) )<br />
<br />
http://webpages.charter.net/robnjuli/EQGUI/dragon_inked.jpg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, sorry about being a little behind at posting, I was helping a friend do a quest in EQ and it tooka  while, anyways, I also did some more work on my UI and you might want to see the screenshot, the new pic is at the bottom:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?goto=newpost&amp;threadid=2507<br />
<br />
So, if the dragon is HOLDING the book, that's REALLY easy, it's just a book background, also, Tadashya, don't worry too much about color schemes and such, if I need to make text readable I'll add little frames behind the text to make it readable.<br />
<br />
If the dragon is an overlay on the book it still wouldn't be hard, it'd just be more work making sure everything's readable.<br />
<br />
Uhm, the icons can be configured however you want, and we can have fancy page turn buttons and close button, in my UI mod the top center srt triangle thing highlights when the mouse is over it (stolen from Remelio's early spellbook then improved, but eh).<br />
<br />
Default spellbook icons are lined up like so:<br />
._________.<br />
|O O | O O|<br />
|O O | O O|<br />
|O O | O O|<br />
|O O | O O|<br />
'¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯'<br />
You want them to be like so:<br />
._________.<br />
|8 . .|. . 8|<br />
|8 . .|. . 8|<br />
|8 . .|. . 8|<br />
|8 . .|. . 8|<br />
'¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯'<br />
correct?<br />
I hope those little ascii pics make as much sense to you as they do to me =)<br />
<br />
Basically I'm very flexible, just decide how you want it, and I'll do it. The sketch (Ahhh, a daddy-long-legs just crawled past me, scared me...) is doable from a coding perspective =)<br />

I still can't get over how good the ranger one looks, can't wait to see more. Also, for future ones, if you include a graphic you want for the animation that'd be helpful, I generally just trace the center top and use photoshop's diffuse filter, heh.<br />

I like the dragon holding the book better.  By doing this we can also use the default spell slot placement.  You really shouldn't have mentioned animations.  You got my creative wheels turning.  If I'm getting too crazy let me know and I'll stop.  What if the dragon turned the pages?  Just a thought.  How hard would that be?  Also go tto thinking about your ideas for the buttons.  Maybe have each hand be a page turn button?  As for a close button, I'm just not sure what to do here yet.  Would also like the page to have the default background color for the pages, but maybe have some darker brown lines on the pages, to give it an ancient look/feel.  Maybe a crakced/torn appearance to the pages.  Make ot have a brittle appearance.  How does that sound?  Book border/corners are up in the air still.<br />
<br />
I'm REALLY excited about this.<br />
<br />
What is a good time of day to reach you all in game and what char on what server should I try to contact?  I'd like to discuss some things in a non public forum.<br />

I can make a sub category and we can have this conversation there.  Unfortunately EZboard seems to be flopping and twitching heavily right now, so it would have to be after they are done having their technical difficulties.  I am on Emarr and usually play my druid Tadanya... but not often and usually only for specific raids or to do guild baking.  I am semi-retired until PoP comes out, if that.  email is also on my site plus I have just about every IM known cept yahoo :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">10-03-2002, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been thinking of a couple ways to make a complete book page turn animation (I believe I've come up with an idea, so having the dragon turn pages may be a possibility, I'll do some testing and let you know (it may have to be a single or maybe two frame animation =/ not great but better than any other UI). If I can't come up with full page animations (the one's Tadashya is referring to is the button's highlighting, I don't think Tadashya was expecting that) we'll at least have pretty buttons, heh.<br />

To reach me in game I'm on Innoruuk server playing as either Haliken or Enokhaon (probably Enokhaon) and I'm on quite often, especially after 9 pacific.<br />
