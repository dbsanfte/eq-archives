<br />
Guess we'll have to wait some more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atheenath Dawns</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im sorry, they both have been uploaded, we just have to wait for them to be made available for downloading now.<br />
<br />
Not much I can do about it unfortunately, so I am afraid that you will have to wait a few more till they are reviewed and appear on the Downloads / Misc section.<br />
<br />
Glad you liked them though :)<br />

** EDIT ** They are now up for grabs on the download/misc section :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issey</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know why, but when I have either of your right click mods in use, every time I zone a red message appears. Something like: a xm something file is incompatible and some windows may not work correctly.<br />
I figured out it was due only to both versions of your mod by putting every mod I was using (mix and match components) in a separate folder, loading one folder, zoning, etc. <br />
All the other mods work fine in the same folder. My error log is empty. I can open the window just fine but since the only r click I own is a helm, testing it is problematic, lol.<br />
<br />
My question is  - can I change what each of the boxes is? Ie, could I change one slot to be the head slot?<br />
<br />
Thanks and hope this was the right place to post this. I did mulitple searches but couldn't find this odd error message already posted.</div></div><hr />
