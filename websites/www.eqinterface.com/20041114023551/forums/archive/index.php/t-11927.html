<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystrae</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My version of Tekyn's Delta3 UI.  With some changes of course.  I've been tinkering around with my UI, mod'ing files and downloading other people's mods ever since SOE let people skin their own UI's.  Delta3 was one that really caught my eye.  I was a die hard vert fan, til i saw delta3.  It was just as functional as vert, but a bit more stylized to my tastes.<br />
<br />
-Noticable Changes-<br />
The thing that really bugged me about the Delta3 layout was that the groupwindow and hotbox was on the outside edge of the UI, so I moved them.  I'm one of those people that like to keep all the info in one area rather than spread all around.  <br />
<br />
Problem with this was now the Targetbar had really ugly square edges where they used to merge into the hotbox window and group window.  I photohacked the tga's to make them look better.<br />
<br />
I also made the playerwindow into a thin flashing red bar to indicate when you were actually trying to swing at something above the target window.<br />
<br />
Finally, I really hated how the Default Combat Ability Window looked soo I made one to match the stylized layout of the UI, buttons and all.<br />
<br />
-Problems-<br />
Little problems I've run across was little graphical artifacts thats displayed along the edges of the Custom UI TGA's when rendered in EQ.  Otherwise the TGA files look perfect viewed from Photoshop 6 and ACDSee.<br />

[Wed Dec 31 01:04:04 2003] Error: Could not find child A_TargetBoxStaticAnim in window TargetWindow<br />
<br />
[Wed Dec 31 01:04:04 2003] Error: Could not find child A_AttackIndicatorAnim in window PlayerWindow<br />
<br />
Which I've been kinda lazy to fix.<br />
<br />
Also this UI is pretty much ment for people that run at 1600 wide resolution.  The Combat Window+Target Bar Window will look cramped in anything lower.<br />
<br />
I'll post my version up on the site if there is enough interest in it.  Tho this UI originally started as just a personal project soo I've kept very poor tracking of who's code I've cut and pasted in here and there (some mods are pretty obvious who they belong to /points at the target ring *nice job :)*).  I also have no clue which files I haven't touched to leave out of a zip to save space.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you guys think or have any suggestions.</div></div><hr />
