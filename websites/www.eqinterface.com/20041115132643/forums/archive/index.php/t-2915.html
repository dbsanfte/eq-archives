<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nogagbuk</div><div class="date">10-14-2002, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any one suggest a good EQ based tutorial for UI making?  Ive got a concept (see below) im wanting to do, but all my attempts so far, have ended in errors loading the skin. <br />
<br />
So, I keep fumbling around with it... no success yet, but I keep trying.<br />

Its meant to be a seem-less warrior only interface like some of the other caster/hybrid types ive seen, my original concept was to make it all in just 1 or 2 windows, but I dont see that as possible, so just making the windows so they match up end to end is my new goal.<br />
<br />
IF any one who knows how to do this better then me (99.9% of you reading this im guessing) please feel free to take the ball and run with it....<br />

Do this one window at a time, so if the UI crashes you know what caused it. And remember, certain functions are hard-coded to certain windows- for instance, the Autoequip can't be moved out of the inventory.</div></div><hr />
