<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elpiper</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted this under &quot;Player Window&quot; but apparently no one reads that.  :)<br />
<br />
Here is the player window I was using and which was exactly as I liked it.<br />
<br />
However, I notice that since today's patch the AAXP percentage is wrong, and instead matches the Mana percentage number (I saw it go up to 100% after casting a spell, and it should be around 9%).<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me what I should fix?  Or fix it for me?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elpiper</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Update:  Today I noticed that my casting bar gets repeated in the above window on top of the AAXP par whenever I cast a spell.<br />
<br />
I am quite certain this was not the case a few days ago, yet I did not change this file for another and the patch did not touch the playerwindow.  Very strange.<br />
<br />
Since no one seems to know what did this, I guess I'll have to install a new player window mod - the reason I like this one is that I have an inventory screen with all the stats removed, but the weight is also missing, which is why I liked having it in my player window.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for any help you can provide  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edan Humblefut</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 2 labels that display the percentage of mana and AAXP are:<br />
<br />
Player_ManaPercentage<br />
Player_AAXPPercentage<br />
<br />
These both have EQTYPE 20 which is the Label EQTYPE for Mana Percent.<br />
<br />
Try changing the EQTYPE for Player_AAXPPercentage to 27.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkSidhe</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Edan. Had the same problem with the skin I'm using. Edit the EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml and search for &lt;Label item =&quot;Player_AAXPPercentage&quot;&gt; then scroll down to the EQType and change it to 27.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elpiper</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woot thanks guys!  That did the trick.<br />
<br />
Also, I hadn't noticed but my casting bar gets repeated under the AAXP bar.  That's cool, tho I like having it seperate near my spell icons.  But since it can apparently be repeated without causing any problems, I won't mess with it.</div></div><hr />
