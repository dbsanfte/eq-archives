This is a mod I created for my own personal use. All references to this mod were obtained here on EQGUI. The following acknowledgment for those who inspired me in creating this mod are:<br />

Tom King = Graphics<br />

Please comment on any changes or modifications you think it needs. Feel free to alter, change, and modify the mod to your specifications. Please give credit to those I have mentioned and or anybody I may not be aware of that helped create this mod.<br />

This is my first mod, so with that in mind: <br />
Please let me know any items I may have omitted or seem redundant. The mod theme is evil but not overly satanic per say. Ease of use is my main goal with graphics being secondary, that’s why most clickable commands are located on the right &quot;I am right handed&quot;. I need the .xml part of it to work without a hitch &quot;My weakness&quot;, before I work on the graphics.<br />

<br />
<br />
Yes. The current pet bar your looking at was a horizontal graphic when I decided to change it to a pet bar. I think the original intent by Tom King was a spell bar. I haven’t seen anyone here with that graphic used yet. I had to steal it right from  Tom's web site (http://pub10.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=288.topic) and convert it to my needs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malevolent</div><div class="date">02-01-2003, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kasca<br />
<br />
Normally when a UI makes you crash to desk top it’s because of another mod involved using the same names &quot;my experience&quot;. If this isn’t the case, re-download the file and install it with the default folder name I have provided, just for my own piece of mind. The current mod is the one I have been using for the past 2 days or so with no bugs. The inventory window and some window pieces have been altered from the original picture as I am currently working on improving the graphics.<br />
<br />
If you still get crashes. Please post your UIErrors.txt file so we can find out what’s making it crash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glad it works for you Kasca. I am constantly working on new inventory windows, both in size and usability. I am currently using a flat screen that doesn’t give me the ability for higher resolutions but will fix that shortly in the near future. I haven’t added the spell book button yet to the  hotbutton window. I have been using the /book command to test it. The next update will have the spell book button and the options window with overall different graphics versions &quot;light or dark&quot;.</div></div><hr />

All I can Say Malevolent is WOWWWWWW!!!!!!!  That new inventory is amazing.  I would love to have that one when you are done.  I have been looking around for a good Inv. that would fit in with my Necro and I really like that one.  This new one is the first one I have seen that I feel really fits in with the Necro.  Not to mention the fact that it is one of the best looking ones I have seen yet.</div></div><hr />

I hate to say i did change the pet window. DIdnt like it so i put the spec one in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keilia</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really love this UI. I changed the pet window to the spec one, just went better for my necro, changed the spellbook to the skull one, again because I have a necro, and, spell bar to a necro one from this site. For my SK, I left it completely as is. What I have noticed so far, is on the target window, when a mob is low health, the bubble goes completely red again, so if you arent paying attention to the % number, it seems as if the mob gained health. Could be a bad thing with CH mobs, etc. Just a little note. Its an awesome UI.....Incredible work!<br />

Unfortunately I am an SK and the pet window is or was a low priority. There will be an update with a new pet window &quot;Horizontal&quot; with new graphics/button style.<br />
<br />
As for the target health orb, I have noticed the problem and I am looking into a solution ASAP. Thank you for pointing it out Kelia.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that most of the buttons, health bars, and graphics were implemented in haste without proper alignment. This was just a quick way for me to insure the xml files work correctly and without any problems for any user wishing to use this. The final version will have cleaner graphics icons and buttons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
*Pic. note*, I changed the buttons to only highlight the red background when your curser goes over leaving the plain white transparent background &quot;was too bright for my taste&quot;. Thinking of reducing the pet health globe, &quot;it’s about 5 times bigger than the target globe =P&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
*Changes*<br />
Overall Graphic theme.<br />
Inventory window graphics cleaned up.<br />
Removed pet health bar from the player window.<br />
Horizontal spell bar with casting gauge.<br />
Casting gauge doubles as the book button.<br />
Target window fixed as per &quot;Keilia&quot;. (I hope)<br />
New Pet window with two options &quot;Horizontal and Vertical&quot;.<br />

I noticed the white &quot;flecks&quot; and thought I got rid of them. They must be in-between layers and didn't pay close enough attention. Fixing it as I type this. Changing the font color of the player name and HP in the group window . *The white transparent background in the group window seems too white to me*.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind this is the light version, The dark version will have a dark background and may be more suitable for your needs.<br />
<br />
I will look into changes for users who desire the option of the hotbuttons location.</div></div><hr />

my window selector is same and im missing chat window..to the right<br />

Click on your main window and choose new window. Now you have two windows :) Make sure you use the filter options on that window to select what you want to view in each window.<br />

So far I have demands from all my guild members, friends and people who have seen the skins I use and wish to have one made for there class description.

I didn’t add a &quot;UI__yourchacartername_servernumber.INI&quot; for the simple fact that I am working on several UI's that have different configurations and different windows. I will load up that UI and give you that file ASAP.<br />

You had mentioned that you were working on a new Inventory window and you had a pic of it up before. Did you ever get that new inventory completed?<br />
<br />
I have several inventories standing by for the patch on the 24th and have already added the charm slot on the window_pieces section. I haven’t posted any updates for this reason. Yes Chronwaas, the inventory you are asking for, will be an option :)<br />
<br />
As for the target, you are more than welcome to use it as a seperate piece in your UI setup. Just add/make to the folder of your choice under uifiles these two files.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure what maybe causing your problem. I went ahead and updated the target files you requested with the current ones I’m testing. It’s a bit cleaner graphic wise and the target percent has changed a bit. Hope that works for you. I have so many UI's I’m working on that I may have gotten some mixed up.<br />
<br />
Here is a pic of the current UI I am working on with the target files you requested.</div></div><hr />

Almost done with the Druid. Mage comes next =P</div></div><hr />

The only thing that I would suggest is moving, or removing the green pet health over my hp's bar.  I think it makes it hard to see current hps.  Or maybe make the whole bar a little bigger.  As a Necro my hp's are constantly going up and down, so I have to pay close attention to my hps.  Other then that I think it's a really damn good skin, and it's nice to see people design skins outside the box.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malevolent</div><div class="date">03-01-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skin has been updated for LoY......should be gtg.<br />
<br />
Made some changes to the UI, both graphic and xml. <br />
<br />
Changes;<br />
<br />
SpellBar.<br />
Window selector.<br />
Compass.<br />
Hotbuttons.<br />
Spell buff bar.<br />
Song bar.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the lack of updates. With the ever increasing demand on class UI's, I have been a busy camper. Druid, Paly, and warrior UI are now complete and LoY ready. Mage is my next one in the works. Thank you for all the feedback! It has been a great help.<br />
<br />
PS. Make sure you use the enclosed UI_Name_Server#.ini  or you will be playing with windows for a while. I have included a picture for reference.<br />

<br />
Changed the Health bar to a larger graphic, replaced the players &quot;your name&quot; with a numbered HP count. Added Remelio's percent graphic to grab your attention with low mana and health bars.<br />
<br />
Think that should work :)</div></div><hr />

Keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />

The spell casting gems and meter. Do you have permission by T.King to use this in your UI? As far as I know, it is for T.King suporters only right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The current SK UI has been approved by Tom King. Please feel free to contact myself or Tom King if you have further questions or require more information about this UI and the artwork used to create it. <br />
<br />
Thank you for asking :)<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that this is a beta UI and was created for testing the xml code not the graphics. You will notice that graphics have changed over the course of time on this project to accommodate placement of items that EQGUI members and other testers have pointed out.</div></div><hr />

Was playing last night with the new ui last night.<br />
<br />
I have a few requests ...<br />
 1) The blue color on the stat window needs to be a brighter color<br />
      its hard to see.<br />
 2) I like'd to Move some off my stuff up out of the way. Can the  <br />
    pet box be turned upside down? This way it could be put at <br />
     the top.<br />
  3) The hot buttons and inventory. Can they be made larger?   <br />
      During fight i swap weapons and there hard to do.<br />
  4) The box for the selector. Can it be made smaller. Maybe made<br />
      to fit in the corner with the lag meder?<br />
<br />
I really like this!! :nana:</div></div><hr />

Can it be made smaller. My shammie has been using it. Sit nicely around his target bar but it a little tall. <br />
<br />
Also i know a few makers are making there stuff moveable from one spot. That would be nice for the pet bar to. I get that pop up a lot whin swinging around.<br />

I've been awaiting an updated version of this for what seems like forever.  If I wasn't such an XML noob I would update it myself.  But with Malevolent MIA for the past 4 months or so, maybe someone else could undertake the task of making it up to date.  (PRETTY PRETTY PLEASSSEEEEE :p)</div></div><hr />
