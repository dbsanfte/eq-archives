<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">is there a way to set the z-index of screen items, so that i can overlap items as i please?<br />
<br />
Focusing the windows is all nice and all, but i have an invisible background in my chatbox, and a visible one attached to my target window, so i can just move the chatbox over the target's background picture, but when i first load EQ, it hides my chatbox so i have to hit enter 2x to focus it above the background =X<br />
<br />
did that make any sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, yes, unfortunatly there is no way to set that, staticly.  It's set everytime you click on a window.<br />
<br />
It's like runing Windows with a bunch of little windows open. The one you click on will be top, no matter how much you try to change it. It's not a Unix system you know. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
i am going to end up learning everything i can about XML so i can do some extensive coding on setting my indices...<br />
<br />
i am a layer freak and i get cranky when they dont work :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol<br />
<br />
Go right ahead .. Though you should know XML is nothing more than a Data Modeling Language. What to do with that data is up to the Client. ;)<br />
<br />
And what Tags it supports is all up to the client as well. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i figured that. i knew it was pretty much a self-written language... and i was wondering if there was any way to add a &quot;padding&quot; attribute to items...<br />
<br />
but im guessing im not allowed to do that, but its up to verant to do so, right ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dregor</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hopefully they'll change/add alot of things. layering would be nice. being able to change all the windows would be another nice change.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pini Uldar</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would assume that would mean decoupling of behavior to the window they default to being in using EQTypes so that we can move functional buttons around for example.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't expect a lot of changes from here on out. What they've given us is fairly featured. But I do expect that we'll get EQTypes for buttons at some point and I'd expect bugs like Tooltips falling under other windows will be fixed.<br />
<br />
Maybe an Always On Top feature will be added for windows or something, but I don't think they'll give us fine-grained control over window layering. That's a lot of work.<br />

Please, someone tell me there is a way to get rid of the stupid tooltips!  I can't stand it when they cover important information, especially in /Bazaar or /Trader windows.<br />

I know it'll still load like this because I've done it to several of them.  The only thing I don't know for sure is if you still get a little blue square where the tooltip would be (never thought to look after I made the edit... lol) - but even the little blue square is better than some silly meaningless text.  :)<br />

Anything that can be changed dynamically by the UIengine during game execution (tooltip contents, borders on spell icons, color of character attribute and statistics text, tooltips on inventory, spell gems, buff icons, etc.) can't be controlled by the XML loadfiles at this time.  You can hide some things (sometimes by setting its size to 0,0), but you can't necessarily control certain aspects forced by a change in character state.</div></div><hr />
