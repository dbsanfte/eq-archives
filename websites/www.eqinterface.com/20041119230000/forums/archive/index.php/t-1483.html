I've seen ones where you can put a screenshot of your char there, but I mean as in the OLD OLD GUI when you went into the inventory mod and saw your char standing there in the upper right hand corner...I'd just thought it would be cool to see if anyone could do it ;)</div></div><hr />

Why not?<br />
In theory, you'd need the picture in a legal format (read something about the .tga formats somewhere else, forgot where...:( ), load the texture in the animations file (or maybe even the EQUI_Inventory.xml would be ok), give the animation a screen_ID and place it somewhere in your Inventory window.<br />
Dunno the exact mechanics atm, but i can check when I'm back home....</div></div><hr />

Nah, won't be possible unless we get a EQ_Type for an Animation that puts in the camera view realtime....<br />
afaik we only got the EQ_types for labels, gauges and Inventory slots....</div></div><hr />
