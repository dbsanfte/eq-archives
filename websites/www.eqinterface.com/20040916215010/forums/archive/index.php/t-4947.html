<br />
I really enjoy several of the items you implement in your UI. However what I would like to do is use a couple of the features from your UIs. The problem I have is when I DL the UI from you and then try to remove the pieces I want it does not work. Could you help me out with how to do that?<br />
<br />
Specifically I am interested in your Ball Gauge Player window from 3 and 4 versions. When I place the PW xml file into my UI folder the balls do not show up. How would I be able to do this?<br />
<br />
Xabrian.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. Wish I knew how to do xml editing myself. Would like to create my own UIs  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was curious why Kanon didn't leave the mana and hp ball gauges on each side of the target bar.  They looked REALLY nice there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aedily</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could you possibly make the epic pointers stand alone so that others can use them in their own mods? I love them, they really look great. :D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:nana: :Eat them anytime!<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, forgot to ask, could you include an optional background texture other than the one you have.  It's hard to see chat sometimes.  Just a solid color that matches would do great.<br />
<br />
Still love the mod:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meiamour</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this and have been waiting for you to link it so we could downlaod. I used it tonight. It is great just have one question. Is there anyway you can make it so we can adjust the fade/color level of the chat boxes? <br />
<br />
When in a light room it is very hard to read stuff unless you go in completely change the colors of your chat. Just want it to get darker when I have my pointer on the box is all. And fade out when the pointer isn't on it. I have both set at 100%.<br />
<br />
Thats it for me :)<br />
<br />
You do great work and I do appreciate it :) Love the UI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something that might help Meiamour (well does for me anyway) is viewport your screen so that the bottom text boxes don't cover up your viewable area.   Then just set the background color to be black and it's a lot easier to see the colors that way.<br />
<br />
Just an idea, hope that it works for you! :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wildtiger</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">great ui downloaded it and works fine but could you make the statr numbers and lettering on mp3player and pet a little bigger so they can be seen?<br />

<br />
I dont think bigger is going to help - I think - and this is just about the only fault i have with the entire skin - the text needs to be a different color - something with more contrast. Also, nice as the cursive fonts are, simple block letters are easier on the eyes and easier to read</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, started using this tonight, definantly awesome!<br />
<br />
Just a few things... <br />
<br />
1.  I like Xab, would like to have the ball gauges back, how do we add these instead?  Or could you put the two gauges on either side of the target window like you posted in the origional picture?  <br />
<br />
2.Also, the invetory/pet window looks really off with the experience bars on the left and the pet buttons on the right.  Is there anyway to maybe center the pet buttons and then put the experience bars below it?  Okay, that might be dumb idea, but was a though :)<br />
<br />
3.  Is there anyway to get the regular arrow pointer back?<br />
<br />
All that I can think of for the moment, I'm sure that I'll pester you some more later :)<br />
<br />
Thanks Kanon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moix5th</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok loaded ui with ini on bard works perfect. Love it!  Then i say i like it so much to use with my druid go to load it works fine, try to load ini get booted EVERY time. <br />
<br />
Plz Help!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanon</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HI :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for all replys. I think i need time heh.<br />
<br />
moix :<br />
umm... i need more information :(<br />
<br />
deth :<br />
<br />
1 : I can put ball gauges, but I'm remaking target window now.<br />
I'll add a tick timer in target window, so i need more space..<br />
<br />
2 : OK. I'll :)  How about this file?<br />
<br />
3 : if you can edit a xml file, Yes you can use default pointer.<br />
Pointer Setting is now in EQ_AYA.xml. Open it and copy and paste<br />
from default Animation XML's Cursor Setting.<br />
<br />
Yelara and Wildtiger<br />
<br />
Yeah, i think so :( I'll remake it too.<br />
<br />
Aedily<br />
<br />
Yes. very easy. but i want to make 600 first....<br />
<br />
xabrian<br />
<br />
copy old AYAplayer.tga. it is ball gauge animation file.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------- Pet window with Pet Button</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moix5th</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL after trial and error i HAVE done it!!! I am the master! :D  Thanks for thinking bout it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take all the time you need... this skin kicks ass and is definantly worth waiting for :D <br />
<br />
Two more quick things...<br />
<br />
1.  I tried replacing the old ayaplayer tga file with the new on to get the ball gauges back but it didn't work.  I then attempted to edit the player window like you had me do with version 5 to get them back but I saw no references to atknote or acnote.  Am I doing something wrong?<br />
<br />
2.  Could you make the old buff window and the old spell window the same width saw they look even when stacking them on top of each other?  <br />
<br />
Thanks again for the hard work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you change the color of the targeted name so we can see it better? Maybe to black or a charcoal grey color? Was just wondering.<br />
<br />
You do great work :) and I appreciate all your efforts so that we can have such an uber UI<br />

1  now ayaplayer.tga has ball gauge and another gauge, graphics.<br />
<br />

<br />
moix<br />
<br />
Great :D<br />
<br />
masticore99<br />
<br />
Epic Pointers are Animation Pointer. so you can open TGA and<br />
check :)<br />
<br />
Meiamour<br />
<br />
OK, I'll check the color.<br />
<br />
Riksar<br />
<br />
Pointers Setting in EQ_AYA.xml. if you can edit a xml, check it :)<br />
if not, i'll make pointers, but 600 first.. sorry, plz wait.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">12-22-2002, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I was trying to say...<br />
<br />
Since I use the old version of the spell casting window, I dont' have a ball gauge for my mana in your newest version.  That, and I also like to have a stamina reference, thus the reason that I like the your ball gauge from version 4.  The one that had hp and mana gauge, and then stamina in the back.  And if you had a pet up, it had a little green one in front.  Is there anyway to add that....<br />
<br />
If you can't, that's cool, but I have a problem with the current hp gauge.  The numbers where you have ac/atk, xp, aa, etc... doesn't show the blue bubbles around the numbers for some stupid reason.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to release a version of your target window with the two ball gauges on each side of the window?  That would solve all my problems :)<br />
<br />
BTW, I love the darker version, much easier to see everything.  And thanks again for all your hard work... and listen to my rambline :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doro</div><div class="date">12-22-2002, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love your UI,but how do you get the friends window to pop up?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">12-22-2002, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Kanon, don't worry about the ball gauges.  I'm gonna' use your new spell window instead.  Could you give a quick run through on how to change the right clickable area inside your target window again?  And when is the new version gonna' be put up for download?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On what I think is your target window (the one that has the flashing border when autoattacking), I can't get the blue bubbles and labels to show up around the numbers that represent hp percentage, mana percentage, etc...

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanon</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi :)<br />
<br />

<br />
Friend Window is Alt + F.<br />
<br />
Deth<br />
<br />
It means, Dark Blue Bar?<br />
<br />
There is in a AYAplayer.tga. if you can edit tga files, Copy and<br />
Paste it.<br />
<br />
and.<br />
<br />
rightclick Area.<br />
<br />
ex How to change Chest to Hand.<br />
<br />
1) Open Target window xml. and search chest.<br />
2) Chest &lt;EQtype&gt; is 17.<br />
3) Open Inventry xml. and Search Hands.<br />
4) Hand &lt;EQtype&gt; is 12.<br />
5) Open Target window xml and change &lt;EQtype&gt; 17 to 12.<br />
6) Chest Area is now Hand Area :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">12-28-2002, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, when I downloaded from your link at the top of the page (ie. AYA600D), I couldn't get the ui to load.  See below for my error log, I hope tha tit helps.<br />
<br />
The only way I could get this to work was to download the older version that you have on page one.   The I downloaded 6d and unzipped in the same folder overwritting the older files.<br />
<br />
I got it working, except I see no option to turn on the multi ball gauge player window.... am I missing something or have you not upload that part yet?<br />
<br />
Also, when I use the old buff window, the graphics are really messed up.  It shows a red and blue box behind each buff that takes up about the half the area to the right of the buff icon.  Rather then it being clear like it was before?<br />
<br />
My only conclusion that I can come up with is you haven't upload your newest version that you pictures... or you have and forgot to post a link :)  And that I wasn't supposed to download both version of beta and try to combine them.  Am I close? :)<br />

I'll check them, thanks for Information :D Plz dont use Small Buffwindow now. sorry.<br />
<br />
and New DL Link is here.<br />

New Spellwindow's Blue Ball is.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">12-29-2002, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick question Kanon...  is there a way to switch around the stamina and mana ball gauge in the player window?  and if so could you point in the direction of how to do it :)<br />
<br />
Second... do you have any ideas about what you plan on doing when the temporary buff window goes live?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I'm sure that I'm driving you crazy... well I hope I'm not :)  But I just had an idea, up to you whether you'd want to implement it or not.  <br />
<br />
The idea really only refers to pet classes or those that can charm, but in the player window you have an empty box where there isn't any information.  I was just thinking that would be a great spot to put your pets health, for quick reference.  Oh well, was just an idea.  BTW, I LOVE this UI.  Thank you SO much for making it.<br />
<br />
Also, is there anyway to change the duration of the timer... or did you just have it to count tics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanon</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HI<br />
<br />
Deth<br />
<br />
Buff window<br />
umm.. sorry no ETA now. I'm checking the code.<br />
<br />
Timer<br />
Yes, I can change the duration. but Tick Timer is very Useful i think. and I'm Cleric, I need 1sec Counter for CCH ;)<br />
<br />
Pet Health<br />
ah. I'm making it. :D<br />
<br />
and..<br />
<br />
Happy New Year from Japan :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok first I would like to say what a great job you've done with this UI. I love it. <br />
<br />
That said, I have a couple of things I'd like to ask:<br />
<br />
First: The balls are really cool looking and all, but I'd be willing to sacrifice them to get percents on my mana bar somewhere. There are 2 mana bars between the ball and the player bar but neither gives me the percent. As a shaman that is buffing constantly I really miss that percent. I know I have XXXX mana and if I have XX percent left it gives me a hard number to work with so I know that I can cast X number of heals/buffs/etc. That percent indicator is what sets the new UI apart from the old screens. Any way to get it back in the UI somewhere? <br />
<br />
Second: The text font and color is very very hard to read. I have no clue what my resists are anymore, nor my stats. The only thing thats clear is my HP AC and ATK. But I need to know who my target is, what my resists are and what my other stats are. The cursive font is lovely but I cant read it without some careful study and when I'm trying to buff a raid I don't have the time to carefully study anything. Nor do I have the time to scrutinize the compass to tell what direction I'm headed in when Klandikar is chasing me :P<br />
<br />
I'm quite comfortable editing XML files myself, so if you can point me in the right direction I'm more than willing to make the afjustments myself. Just tell me what and where :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the great job :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you using the newest version?  The color issues were addressed and in the player window with the ball gauge, there is a mana percentage.  It's the top right rectangle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought I was... I downloaded and loaded the Dark version...<br />
<br />
I'll have to redownload it and see if  it's any different</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... I see the mana percent and HP percent<br />
<br />
And the color with the dark version is better but the font is still hard on my eyes. Still cant read the compass without really squinting at it and the labels on the pet window are almost impossible for these tired old eyes to read. <br />
<br />
It's nit picky stuff, I know. And in no way reflects on the excellant work Kanon has done here. If I knew exactly where to edit the XML I'd just change the fonts and some of the colors and it would be perfect for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really can't see the compass either... but the rest is okay with me.</div></div><hr />

but i still have a question could you take the 2 row buff window from the first dark version and stick a spell book button on it for me? i like that better then the horazontal 1 row one thx :)</div></div><hr />

It has to do with the UI_character_servername file when it is put in the everquest folder.  I wanted to know if there was anything that can be done to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moix5th</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As to the poster above. I have the same problem with my 2nd acct everytime i have to update. Its rather weird how i fix it tho, but none the less its simple and works.  Make a new &quot;UI_charname_server.ini&quot; open up the one thats in the zip, copy all of it and paste it into the new ini you made.<br />
I hope this works, i have no reason as to why or how it does but it does for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1)    Make the hp/ma/ac/at/xp/aa/sta BRIGHT -- BRIGHT colors, (maby green)  the white is hard to see -- ALSO make the percentages of these stats another BRIGHT color to see (maby Yellow)<br />
<br />
2)    Put Mana percentage somewhere in the target bar, also BIG and bright.. like the hp number.<br />
<br />
3)  I like the blue labeled chat windows you had in AYA500 Waaay better than the boring gray ones</div></div><hr />
