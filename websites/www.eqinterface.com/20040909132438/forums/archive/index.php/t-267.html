My wife and I both really liked your spellbook and would like to be able to use it. Is there a way to use just the spellbook without changing the rest of the UI? I tried swapping your EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml file in place of the existing file, but got an error and the game reverted to the &quot;default&quot; folder. I should add that I have already downloaded and successfully installed a player info window that I really like, which is one of the reasons I don't want to install your entire UI.<br />
<br />
I appreciate any help you can give me :D <br />

Very nice work, I like the Spell Gem config and the pet window. If you could have a seperate window for your pet buffs, that would be interesting.</div></div><hr />

This is all you need from the Animations File.  I would cut and paste it in after &lt;!--Guage Parts&gt; in the new default animations file they released today.  I did get it to work.  Looks good.<br />

<br />
I just stumbled across one phenomenon:<br />
I was trying to bring the player window to the right side of the target/group window to have things together. This window seems to make &quot;jumps&quot; on my computer. I set the LocationX value to 166, and the windows shows up with a large gap to the group window. I set the LocationX value to 165, and it shows up exactly over the group window.<br />
<br />
I'd really appreciate any hints on that! :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akshue</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, I get that too... that's why it isn't perfectly aligned.  <br />
<br />
No idea why, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yashem</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know if I should be glad that I'm not the only one having this problem. :mad: <br />
Looks like I will have to manually arrange the windows until a solution exist, uh?<br />
<br />
I wondered if the existence of any other window - even though not visible at the moment - may influence the behaviour? I was just too lazy to browse through all the XML-files. :) On the other hand: The player window actually DOES show up behind the group/target window so this couldn't be the reason, could it?</div></div><hr />

I have Akshue's spellbook working on my current UI set up!! Thanks to Akshue for the best spell book I've seen yet and special thanks to Zephaus for the info on how to modify the current animation file. <br />

DL the zip and tried to use just the PET window (love having the data there), but when tried to play, all my other windows (player, buff, etc) were reset to defaults and the pet window came up as default also.... <br />

What do I need to do to be able to keep my other current mods and still use this nice pet window change? *smile*</div></div><hr />

Got 95% of my UI refixedup after the 8/15 patch, but the very very nice player window bit from this UI doesn't work anymore and causes the default UI to load instead. <br />

Would greatly appreciate any suggestions on how to fix it... would also like to know how to get the &quot;breath&quot; bar to share the little casting bar in the player window!<br />
