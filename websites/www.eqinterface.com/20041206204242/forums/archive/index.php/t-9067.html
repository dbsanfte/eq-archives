<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LeonneofInny</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, let me THANK YOU for providing this site.  If I was employed outside of the home (IE, had some income) I would donate.  But unfortunately, the $ is against me at this time.<br />
<br />
I'm noticing that browsing the downloads section requires too many clicks.  I don't know about advanced web programming in PHP, but I have a suggestion if you can make it work.<br />
<br />
For those people that have DSL or cable (or some other broadband), there should be an option to view by &quot;image&quot;.  Make a page where thumbnails of the images are available, or even a slideshow.  This way the browser can actually browse by image.  It's not very helpful if I'm looking for a neat shadow knight UI to see just a list of filenames.  Qbox1.3.plain.zip doesn't hold much interest for me.<br />
<br />
If you are unable to browse by image, please at least make the default back to open the image in a new window (and put the name of the file near the &quot;go back&quot; link.  Too many times I've lost track of where I'm viewing and opened the same image 3 or 4 times.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

We have been looking into ways that make browsing our file database easier.</div></div><hr />

Would this increase bandwidth much?</div></div><hr />
