<br />
and this time, I want to involve the comunity alot more than I did with Lunix_SM.<br />
<br />
so here is the first of probably many polls<br />
<br />
:Extended poll question:<br />
Lunix_SM has been optimized to run on a system with a Nvidia based card..  Lunix_II is still in question so my question to the comunity is..  which type of card would you rather see Lunix_II optimized for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcLite</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't vote because I'm having a hard time seeing how a GUI can be optimized for a specific vid card.  It's only XML and some TGA/PNG files that make up the GUI.  How can those be *optimized* for a specific video card?<br />
<br />
That is unless you are hacking some of the APIs for DirectX to make your GUI go faster which would be some serious coding, well beyond anything GUI oriented.<br />
Or Hacking the video card drivers in some arcane way, which could play hell with peoples drivers.<br />
Or you've found some hidden commands in XML that allow the  DirectX renderer for EQ to talk specifically to a special code within the Vid card driver.<br />
<br />
Now I've been programming for a while (C/C++, PHP, HTML, Perl) and maybe I missed something but I just can't seem to figure your statements out.<br />
<br />
So how are you doing these optimizations?<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just unimaginative or just plain wrong.<br />
Wouldn't be the first time for either.  ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure he is talking about a UI, and I have to agree with ArcLite...how do you optimize a UI for a certain video card?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">to answer dolbys question..  there is a flavor of Linux called Lunix that I helped develop long ago..  it had a special version of DirectX 7a built into it...  but with microsoft not wanting to give away their DirectX source codes at a reasonable price.  we haven't been able to update the OS in a long time..  EQ is currently unplayable on it even with winex.<br />
<br />
&lt;video card optimization&gt;<br />
<br />
you optomize for certin video cards by figuring out sizes of the graphics, in this case Nvidia works best on a ratio of square even numbers (256x256) where as what I can tell about ATI is you can use non-square even numbers and have it run faster (256x128).<br />
<br />
also you can finetune the XML code to run faster on what card as apposed to another..  what I've found in Nvidias case is that having the heavier code ( stuff that renders large on the screen ) as the first bit of code in the window makes that paticular window render faster ( by about 200ms ), ATI appears to work the same way.. 3dlabs wildcat 3 wants the lighter code first.<br />
<br />
the optimization is just minor tweaks in reality...  I guess I could just be too picky when it comes to making the UI error free and light as a feather. :D</div></div><hr />
