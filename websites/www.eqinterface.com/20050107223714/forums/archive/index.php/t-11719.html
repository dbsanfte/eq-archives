I've just installed AYA on my system, and it's in the correct directry and everything. <br />
I don't have 2 EverQuest directerys, I tried loading it form options, it crashed, and now every time I log in it crashs. I know how to change it back to default, but I wanna know how to make it work. <br />
I've used the tip of removing the MP3 thing in the INI file, still does'nt work. <br />
Here's my log.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's nothing in that UIError.txt log file that I can see to explain why you are crashing.<br />
<br />
Try setting eqclient.ini and UI_CharName_ServerName.ini file UI settings to &quot;default&quot; which will at least allow you to get into game.  Once in game, try re-loading the UI.  Then log out and post your latest UIError.txt log file.</div></div><hr />
