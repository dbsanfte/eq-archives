I have been trying to reduce the windows to free has much space has possible and make some components that would be good to use at resolution of 1024x768 or below.<br />
<br />
I am pretty good at programming XML but I am not so good with paint programs, so I have some Vert 1.1 tga files include with my UI. <br />
<br />
I have include some variation  of some windows in the extra section.<br />
<br />
** See my last reply on this thread for the zip **</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">herbapou</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Update the 800x600 UI file<br />
<br />
Here is the new SS:  ** Make sure you hit the refresh button if you came to look at it earlier or you will see the old one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xirin</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks very nice! You got some of the things to work that I've been trying to as well, so I've been reading your code. Except I don't quite understand, what's the unlinking thing for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">herbapou</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats what allows the empty gauge to be visible on empty group members lines or mana on char that dont have mana. I wanted to show the empty gauge all the time (for the look).<br />
<br />
For example, lets say your ungroup.  Normaly, you would see the F* and 0% labels but not the HP gauges because EQ automaticly hides them when they are not used. So I made other gauges but not link to any eqtype.  I didnt draw the fill partern on those so it looks like an empty gauge.  And since its unlink, it shows all the time. <br />
<br />
The catch is you have to &quot;call&quot; them before the actual link gauge in the screen definition (bottom of the xml) so they are drawn &quot;before&quot; the real gauge. When there is no group member on a line, only the empty gauge is drawn and when there is a group member, the real link gauge is drawn &quot;over&quot; the empty one, replacing it.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The biggest positive feedback I have so far is about the center target/grp/player windows that allow quick and easy monitoring of important data and the 12 customazible containers inv slots that allow fast and easy switch between resist gear and weapons.  <br />
<br />
Also, you may not notice it, but the /view 0 0 1024 600 was used (in 1024x768) so you dont have to make the bottom of screens windows transparent.  Since casters need more screen space, they can try /view 112 0 800 600 (in 1024x768).  It will make room on both sides to put windows while allowing you to not loose anything on the play screen.  The drawback is you see in a smaller window.  You will notice that most of my windows are design to fit exactly on the sides of the screen when using that view.<br />
<br />
Be sure to explore the extra folder, you may find some interesting windows (not shown in the SS). I have an interesting inventory window in there for use with the /view 112 0 800 600<br />
<br />
Every windows at the bottom of the screen are used by all characters.  I will always try to put info that is common to all in that section. So it easyly free up screen space when your not a caster for example...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xirin</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, I see! Very cool! I didn't notice that. Now that you mention it, I'll have to do that too, since otherwise my cast bar looks a bit stupid.<br />
<br />
Sorry that I didn't compliment the center windows :) That's mainly cause that's how I have mine setup. Now I should be able to update some (a lot) of my stuff to utilize your ideas. <br />
Here's what I have so far (sorry no up-to-date) screenshot:<br />
1. Target window is moved into player window so you can see the blinking red border better<br />
2. Little green skinny bar for your pet's hp under your hp<br />
3. Little yellow skinny bar for stamina under mana<br />
4. Just numbers for XP and AAXP<br />
5. Most importantly cast bar built into player window, cause my main is a bard. Actually if not for that, I'd probably rather go with your entire interface :P<br />
6. It's all kinda cramped together as tight as it can be, since I run a smaller viewport, and my monitor is only 15&quot; :(<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, thanks for your response, and for some great work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xirin</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here's what I'm gonna try to do if you won't object: rearrange your gauges and such to put all of them into player window to get rid of the group and target windows whatsoever. Problem will be that the size will be off :(<br />
<br />
If that does work, I'll try to make the hot button bar with the bags on the right with the same height, as well as gem bar (I have one with the spellnames too). I'll post things if they work, or whine a lot if they don't :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xirin</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, here it is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">herbapou</div><div class="date">09-13-2002, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did a few changes to my UI also :)  I am modify the zip in the first post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xirin</div><div class="date">09-13-2002, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my code was too big to be attached :(<br />
You can find it at www.geocities.com/xirinia/Xirinia.zip</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulbringer</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone explain to me exactly how the /view command used and what it does?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xirin</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The full command is /viewport. It defines which area on the screen is usable for EQ, and which is black.<br />
So, say my screen resolution is 1024x768. If I do <br />
/viewport 0 0 1024 560<br />
it will allow EQ to use the top 560 pixels of the screen (0 0 is left top corner, 1024 560 is bottom right), and the bottom 208 pixels will be black. I use something like that to put  chat boxes on the bottom</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulbringer</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Xirin for explaining that to me :)  Was always curious what everyone was talking about with they mentioned Viewport.  Also I want to say that I love your spellbar.  Is there any way to be able to use it by itself?  <br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xirin</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure! Attaching the spellbar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Richi</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hi, <br />
<br />
i love ur skin UIHerba :)<br />
<br />
but i need to make the Action-Windo, Player-Windo, Target-Window, Group-Window larger?<br />
<br />
I tried to increase the size of the items, but this makes only the window larger, and not the contents like HP-Bar and so on.<br />
<br />
As i changed also the contents, nothing happened..<br />
Can u explain me how i can do that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xirin</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently gauges do not stretch. If you want to make them bigger, you'd need to resize the graphics, and references to them in EQUI_Animations.xml.<br />
And yes, it's a royal pain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Richi</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thnx Xirin i will try it :)<br />
<br />
@herbapou<br />
u put the new Zip in the first post?<br />
Cause ur new Screenshot shows a Playerwindow with ur Resists<br />
and in the download zip there are the old files or u put the changes in the Extra-File?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">herbapou</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have post the new zip in the first post yes.  But it seems, just like the screenshots, this may cause &quot;cache&quot; problems and you may endup downloading the wrong zip. Try to hit the F5 key before download.<br />
<br />
I will post the new zip in a reply later today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zzorn</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im curious, in that first screenshot some people's names look like they are different colors. I saw a light orange, a reddish orange, is there any way to modify the colors above people's names when they are anon/regular etc.? The variation I'm seeing in your screenshot looks very different from my /role or PK flagged people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Richi</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cause he plays on Vallon Zek (PvP Server).<br />
