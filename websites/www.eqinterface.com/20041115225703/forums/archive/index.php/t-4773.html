   I have decided to release a copy of Garryck's INI Copier.  I take NO CREDIT for this, and all credit to Garryck for making such a great utility.  Basically, all you have to do is copy the INI that came with the mod you want to use into the C:/Program Files/EverQuest directory and then load up the program.  Then copy the file from the left side to the UI.Character.Server file that you want to use.  Click copy and there will be a backup in your EverQuest folder in case it doesn't work right and you want to go back to what you had.  Have Fun and happy modding!<br />
<br />
To be fair Garryck had the file removed from the download section when he left everquest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It makes a backup copy of your UI_Playername_##.ini file when it copies the mod's ini file to your character's ini.  A very good idea to do that always, and this makes sure you don't forget and lose your window layout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">platphoenix</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Am I the only one that still renames my old file UI_MyName_Server.bk# (the # being the backup # I made, never more than 9 in existence) and just copies the new INI file into the directory?<br />
<br />
I understand the intent behind a utility, and it's appreciated, but come on... it's called right-click, hit Rename, change the extension. Christ allmighty...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">some people like simplicity, and the less often they have to repeat the process, the better. <br />
<br />
I use the INI copier.  Why?  it's a lot faster than right-clicking and renaming several files since they all use the same UI.  Now, if I'm only using a particular UI for a particular character, then it's just as easy to rightclick and rename.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanys.Neoconker</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Kiriani.  I uploaded this program because I, like many of the people who use this site, like to use the same mod for many characters.  I use Drakah for my Beastlord, Druid, and Monk.  I enjoy the way he set up his mods.  If I ever find a mod that I like more, I will probably use it for all my characters for a while, and it is easier to just click one line, click on all the others, which can be up to 10 at a time...I play on different servers.  I have characters on test, my main server, and 2 friends' servers.  It's just easier to me, because I like to use the simple, but effective, utilities that make life easier for the simple minded.  Don't want to flame you but you started flippin out :D :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blabberpuss</div><div class="date">02-16-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have it DLed, and when I run it, it is unable to locate any of my inis, there is nothing inthe windows to select.  Is there a way to allow it to browse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanys.Neoconker</div><div class="date">02-16-2003, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, the first time I got it to work, but after doing it again, I dunno.  I can't get it to work anymore.  So if someone else has a copy of the original download (I don't think mine was an original before posting), then maybe they could post it.  That may help you.  But you will somehow have to change it.  I so far haven't been able to find out how to browse folders.</div></div><hr />
