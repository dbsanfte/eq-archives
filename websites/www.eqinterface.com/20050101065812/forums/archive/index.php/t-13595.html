<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggun</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just read the README.txt and at the bottum it has the instructions to put your toons pic in the inventory. That is not a part of the code. It is just editing the background pic for enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you.</div></div><hr />

I cant do this cant get it to work so I do have Photoshop but I dont now how to make it work..  <br />
<br />
<br />
You will have to take a screenshot of your character in the pose that you want to work with. (Hint: Try to do it in a zone that gives you a LIGHT colored backdrop)<br />
<br />
Next you will have to use Paintshop to remove the background and basicaly cut out your character. (Hint: Try the eraser or the Magic Wand tool to select the background and delete it.)<br />
<br />
Once you have your toon, select it and &quot;Copy&quot; it from the Edit menu.<br />
<br />
Now open the Background you want, and Paste your toon into it. Now move the toon till you have it right were you want it and then resave the background and your done. (HINT: once you have done all that work to cut out your toon, Please save it by itself some were on you computer for future uses.)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps ya, Let me know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HeBahamut</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya man i just cut a big rectangle around my char and painted the back ground black. i put the whole bloody pic, background and all, on my UI. keep in mind i painted the back ground BEHIND my char black so it kinda blended in. i didnt go thro all the cutting my char out cause im lazy. but a black rectangle behind your char isnt bad looking. and be sure to save over it like dag said cause i tried saving it as a png file and it didnt work. if it asks you to save as png say no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HeBahamut</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, i know youve heard this 5000 times. but my mana bar isnt working. i went and toom my caster.xml and made it my plain char.xml in my main folder but it wont work. there any more details i need to know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggun</div><div class="date">05-01-2004, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">all you have to do to get the mana bar is run the config.bat and go threw the menu. If you have any trouble running the Config.bat, please see the first paragraph in the README.txt file<br />
