<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asuran</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been using Cairenn`s tking/remelio UI for some time.  My problem is that the upper part of the UI, specifically the bar with the mp3 player and the exp counter simply dissapears, that part of the screen turns black.<br />
<br />
First I thought it may be a problem related with LDoN release and I may download a new version of the UI.  I did and intalled it, all seemed to work fine, the upper bar appeared, but it disspeared again after I casted a spell for the first time.<br />
<br />
Tried also Drakah`s UI, the one that in Readme text says dont need a UI INI file.  I may be missing something in the installation process because i simple cant get it running.  I create a new folder for it at uifiles folder named tking, unzip his file there, check that there is no other folder inside tking folder, and try to run EQ, but noting happens.  I cant understand how it works without a UI INI file, and maybe thats the reason of my problem.<br />

Thanks for advice.</div></div><hr />

This is due to a bug introduced in the last patch.  For now, all you can do is just keep re-opening the window (alt+K).  I know that it has been fixed on Test, so hopefully it'll also be fixed on Live servers with the next patch.</div></div><hr />
