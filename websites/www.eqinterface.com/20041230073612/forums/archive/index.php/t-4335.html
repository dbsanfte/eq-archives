Also, adding Abilities to the bottom of that.  Weight would be nice to have on the Player Info screen as well as HP # and % and Gauge, No Mana bar of course, STA Gauge (no %), Exp and AAXP gauge and %.  Horizontal Buff Bar I'll get back to ya</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiky</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make something similar to my request in this thread, http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5020<br />
<br />
If you could make a smaller viewport, with three resizable windows, and a percent figure for experience that's all I'd ask.  Just make it pretty, and let your artistic ability soar.  Maybe throw in some rogue like pictures.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scabx</div><div class="date">12-29-2002, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">K, being a monker, i'd liek to see my group's hp%, my hp%, my exp% (including AA%), my Sta %, and my target with hp% all in one small box on the right which connects into the chat then have the chat connected with the hot button box, i think the regular buttons (Sit, follow, camp, ect.) should be right under the target/char info/group info and connected to the chat liek inbetween them connecting them. Also a nic esmooth grey metal look like Razor has would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenwulf</div><div class="date">01-05-2003, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well as a pure melee, all I can say is... just make it look good! it seems like all the really good looking mods out there are for spellbooks, cast bars or whatnot. Would love to see a pure melee ui with some eye candy :) course it should be simple, afford easy weapon swaping, place for melee spam, let up keep our view on the action, and did I say look good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xzoltar</div><div class="date">01-05-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me its easy when I play my warrior or Paladin here the only windows I have : <br />
<br />
- Player info window ( hp , mana , sta , xp , aaxp )<br />
- Group window ( all the group + their pet )<br />
- Chat windows<br />
- Buff Windows ( horitzontal at te top )<br />
- Target windows<br />
<br />
I remove from my view all others windows and only use shortcut<br />
<br />
I dont use equipement, hot button , action or pet windows</div></div><hr />
