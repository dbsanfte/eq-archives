If you download this fix, why not take a second to leave a post to keep this thread near the top?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This does not work for people who have animation file mods.  As far as I can see this does not need to be done at all.  The file that is in this zip file is just the alarm window file.  If you don't put this file in your mod dir you are actually better off because VI will be making changes to this file soon and you would be broken again when that patch went in.  I recommend that you not do this fix.  The other fixes that have been outlined in many of the other threads on this forum are better suite dto correcting the problems that people are having.  This does nothing more than copy a file into your mod dir that was just downloaded to your default dir from VI.  That being the case the file will be used from the default location if it is not there and since it will be changing from VI soon anyway it would be pointless to have it in your Mod Dir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This isn't the original alarm window file, it's a modified one that doesn't use the new entries added to the animations file. Odd that it doesn't fix the abattoir mod, I've tested it with Vert, Sars 3.0 and some of t.king/Remelio's stuff and had it work. Also, this fix was designed specifically for people who DO have animation's file mods.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It did not work with my mod.  I reverted back to my pre patch skin and tested this with it and it did not help.  I am not sure why yet.  Sorry about the previous post.  Was having a bad day at the time.  The changes you have in the file do look as though they will help with a number of the problems.  Not sure why it is not working with some of the skins though.  the ones that it does not seem to be working with though seem to be some of the complete set mods.  I will continue to look into the changes with your and with my mod and see what the deal is.</div></div><hr />
