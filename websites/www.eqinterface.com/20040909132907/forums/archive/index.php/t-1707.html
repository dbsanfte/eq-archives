<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lysiander</div><div class="date">09-01-2002, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was looking around for a User Interface that would not only serve my needs as a player but also give EQ back the RPG touch a bit. With the NewUI and many skins for it EQ has become more and more Hightech, which is something I don't exactly like. (No Offense to those skins tho, most of them rock, they just aren't my style.)<br />
So I started playing around a bit and this is the result. I'll let the pictures speak.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basic Interface and Inventory Window.<br />
<br />

<br />
Spellbook and Track Window.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: The Skin is now in the download area, so i removed the link. :)<br />
<br />
Have fun. :)</div></div><hr />

Cor, it's functional, beautiful, *and*...nekkid!!! <br />
<br />
I may just use this...<br />
<br />
Great job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This deserves the dancing banana! Oopaa! :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keliur</div><div class="date">09-02-2002, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This UI is really great, but I was wondering if you could change it around just a bit for melees :)<br />
Put hp / ac / atk &amp; hp stam bubles in the right top corner in the buble that has group members in it, and put the group member between the little columns ( columns that are holding up the chat screen ) just a bit under the buble. And maybe flip around the buff box to the left top corner. <br />
Thats a great UI tho, one of the few that I saw &amp; really liked :) <br />
:nana: :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lysiander</div><div class="date">09-02-2002, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flipping the Buff bar around is a matter of minutes. No big deal there. <br />
<br />
Moving the Meele stats however would be a bit more complicated. I was allready running out of windows to use (That's why the Window selector is included and not as originaly planned invisible.) It's doable, but would take a deal of time I currently don't have. :(<br />
<br />
Moving the Group bars isn't much of a problem, just that it's a pain in the a** to position them properly, because either you change the EQ type to have a visible bar or are grouped while coding. Both doesn't really give sufficent results as soon as it comes to fine positioning and the pet bars.<br />
<br />
I'll see what I can do as soon as I have some time for it tho. :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and maybe I should mention that the group pet bars might be a bit off. Those are a pain... .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also is there a way to include the button that toggles the hot keys ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
but stopped using this cause the image size for the background is to small and i dont wanna bother making it bigger myself. Welcome to America=pay someone to do it or get it free by not doing anything. I'm back to the old....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lysiander</div><div class="date">09-03-2002, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a temporary fix for the chatwindow. Just unzip the files and copy them into the StoneAngel folder (overwrite the old files). <br />
<br />
-The Backround has been enlarged to get rid of the spaces between the angels in higher resolutions.<br />
<br />
- ChatWindow is now preconfigured to be sizable and movable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Download area is the DL area of this site. Just click on home up in the left and you should see the download area on the left side of your browser. It's under complete sets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lagdalen Tarcho</div><div class="date">09-06-2002, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple wonderful friends of mine have been trying to get your skin to work on my comp so far to no avail :( I am quite computer illiterate so their help so far has been invaluable ;) . <br />
<br />
So far I've downloaded the one from the downloads section and then the 2 fixes that were on here but all I get when I try and load is up is like shadows. None of the background textures show up, so none of the angels. just the hotkeys floating in a circle pattern etc and they're all over the screen :( <br />
<br />
Is there a download I'm missing? Or are you fixing it to work yet and I just need to wait? I dont normally like angels but this one really caught my fancy and I would love to use it for all my chars.<br />
<br />
Any help at all would be great, thank you :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lysiander</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@agdalen hm, that sounds strange.... .<br />
<br />
The only reason I could think of is that you are playing with a colordepth of less then 32bit. (I think I savedthe grafik files in that deepth.)<br />
<br />
Besides that, I have no idea. Send me a copy of your UIerrors.txt file located in your generall EQ directory.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have altered the grafik files in some way it might have screwed up the alpha channels.<br />
<br />
Anything else I could think of would require that the files have been altered in some way...<br />
<br />
Besides.. you might want to try higher resolutions to get it to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lysiander</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just reread your post. I guess you are playing in 640x480 resolution? If so, that would be the problem. The Skin is optimized for 1280x960. It might work on 1024x768 but I doubt It would work below because of the size of the pictures and the windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comos</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">question <br />
<br />
<br />
  whats the blue bar for ? is it supose to be the breath bar  ?<br />
its in the same window as the cast bar.  also isnt there anyway to get rid of the  labels on the chat windows and still be sizeable ??<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lagdalen Tarcho</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi again :) <br />
<br />
I have my reso set relatively high but I thought that might be the problem so I went through each one individually and tried reloading the skin each time and still nothing *sigh* <br />
<br />
I'm not too sure how to send you the error files but will do my best and ask my friends to help me again. (yeah I know if it weren't for the little picture button thingy I'd never get into eq :p <br />
<br />
Will keep trying and see what happens and will send the files soon as I can or work on that color thing you mentioned.<br />
<br />
cross fingers for me ;)<br />

<br />
The bar you mentioned is indeed the breath bar. I haven't managed to make it invisble when not used yet. (I haven't tried much either tho... ). For the chat windows, yes it is possible to get rid of the labels. Just read the readme.txt, all described in there. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lagdalen Tarcho</div><div class="date">09-10-2002, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">got it working :D <br />
<br />
you were right about it being the color that I had wrong, was at 16 (they tell me) *shrug* But it's workin now and love it! Thnx for the help with troubleshooting :) <br />

It did not matter what zone I was in, all readings are simply 90degrees outofwhack. Anyone else seen this problem? This UI is the only one I have loaded that has a compass problem for me.</div></div><hr />

I wanna keep my T King spellbook and icons and prefer not to use the buff window and the spellbar as well .... So how on earth could I just grab the sections I want instead of the whole kit?

This actually got this bluemeanieinky kinda choked up.  Definitely A1 first-class job here.<br />

Now how can my shaodw knight hands corrupt it.   *evil grin*<br />

Excellent job!</div></div><hr />

Any chance though, of updating the tracking window to include tracksort for us Rangers out there?  It's not a huge deal I like the UI enough that I just use the /tracksort commands with it, but having it back in the window would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">etelani</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">where do i download it ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slag Pot</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can download it at<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?op=showfiles&amp;catid=22<br />
<br />
But I haven't been able to get it working since Tuesday's patch :(<br />
<br />
I also noticed that the stoneangel files don't include raidwindow or raidoptionswindow, so when I did a /raidw it crashed me to desktop.  I tried copying those two mxl files from the default and adding the includes into stoneangel's equi.xml but that didn't work either.  This was of course before the patch.</div></div><hr />
