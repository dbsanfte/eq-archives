<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahnyiel</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the best UI I've seen in a while (sleek and simple...low system resources on my part) for my own personal uses, and I'm having a HUGE problem with installing it. btw, Yes, I've installed literally dozens of UI's and not once had a problem...until now...<br />
<br />
Unzipped the files into a directory called &quot;black&quot;.<br />
Copied the &quot;UI_NAME_SERVER&quot; file to the main EQ directory.<br />
Renamed it properly for use with my character.<br />
<br />
Booted EQ up, and...<br />
<br />
It uses the new gem icons, and new background.<br />
BUT! It keeps using, otherwise, all the default xml files instead of the xml files from the &quot;black&quot; directory.<br />
Opened up the UI_... file, found it listing &quot;default&quot; under Main for the UI file, so changed it to &quot;black&quot;.<br />
Rebooted...Loading, Please wait.<br />
Yep...<br />
<br />
SAME exact results.<br />
<br />
Can ANYONE tell me how to get it to use the proper xml files? I've wasted 3 flipping hours I can't afford to lose trying to get this to work. I only get 5 hours at most a day to play, now most of that time is gone...<br />

I spent the rest of my night downloading and installing another ui until I can get help with this, but instead of just playing and hoping for an answer, I spent the rest of my time trying to post just a few pieces at a time until I found what was causing the problem and it refused to load even one piece/xml... I'm still stuck up the river without the skin best suited for my needs, having to rely on a &quot;powder blue&quot; girlie one to get the functionality and simplicity I need until I can get this one to work...</div></div><hr />
