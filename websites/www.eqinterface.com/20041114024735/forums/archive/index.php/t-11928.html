Because of the difficulty of the arrangement of each window, UI_PlayerName_Server.ini file is also included in the Zip file. Put the UI_PlayerName_Server.ini file at the EQ installed directory and change the name of UI file properly.<br />

The Last Update was applied. (2003.12.26)<br />

<br />
It only works with 1280 x 1024<br />
<br />
* For pure melee classes. Change and use the following.<br />
- pureMelee_EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml<br />
- UI_Melee_Server.ini<br />
<br />
* For hybrid classes Change and use the following.<br />
- Hybrid_EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml<br />
- UI_Hybrid_Server.ini<br />

I hope this Skins to make your EQ life a bit Easier.<br />

<br />

to<br />
<br />
[CombatAbilityWnd]<br />
Show=1<br />
<br />
then I could move it around.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if we could get an adventure window other then the default. It's way too big. Same with the Raid window. Would also be nice to have a clickie effect window and F2-F6 next to each group member.<br />
<br />
Awesome UI! I love it. Used quite a few from here and this is by far the best. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">neonrain</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">* Changed and fixed (2004. 02. 02)<br />
- Some tga files<br />
- CombatAbility Window<br />
- Compass Window <br />
- Action Window <br />
(It harmonizes with other window, But there was some trouble. so I changed the position of 1st tab page with that of 4th tab page. But.. you can meet some trouble yet, as you play EQ. But It isn't fatal. lol )<br />
- HotButton Window<br />
<br />
* Reomved (Download what you like)<br />
- spell icons (Someone like default or Warcrfat3 icon)<br />
- MusicPlayer Window <br />
- TargetIndicator<br />
- BigBank Window <br />
- Merchant Window<br />
<br />
In Fact, I do NOT have Pure Melee charator. I have just caster class and hybrid class(like Cleric, Bard). so, I could only test with  caster and hybrid class. then can NOT say that I tested UI perfactly.</div></div><hr />

I love it - except for one thing.  I can't switch to the T.King Spellbook without losing your buff bar numbers that go down the right side.  Fix this and I'm a happy camper! :)  <br />
<br />
<br />
It is possible to do for yourself. You can fix it easily<br />
<br />
Step 1. Open EQUI_BuffWindow.xml in Notepad<br />
<br />
Step 2. Go to line 3<br />
<br />
Step 3. Immediately after line 3, Add this section<br />
<br />
  &lt;TextureInfo item=&quot;spellbook_bg.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;512&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;512&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
  &lt;/TextureInfo&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 4. Finally It look like this<br />
<br />
  .....<br />
  &lt;Schema xmlns=&quot;EverQuestData&quot; xmlns:dt=&quot;EverQuestDataTypes&quot; /&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- Add section Start --&gt;<br />
  &lt;TextureInfo item=&quot;spellbook_bg.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;512&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;512&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
  &lt;/TextureInfo&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- End --&gt;<br />
  &lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;buff_bg01&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
    &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
      &lt;Texture&gt;spellbook_bg.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
   .....<br />
<br />
<br />
step 5. Save file and Play EQ<br />
<br />
** Do NOT delete spellbook_bg.tga in Delta3_Spaghetti UI **<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I will use it.<br />
<br />
I have looked at the files but I didn't see spell icon files ? Did you use default icons ?<br />
<br />
How could we use W3 spells icons with this UI please.<br />
<br />
Thx ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well. I am using T.King Sell Icons (http://eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1851) like screensshot. But, someone likes Default or Warcfraft 3 Icons. So I removed it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 1. Download your chosen spell icons<br />
<br />
Step 2. Extract the Zip file<br />
<br />
Step 3. Copy *.tga files into Spaghetti UI folder. do NOT include folder, Just copy the files<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Change the file name like this<br />
<br />
PureMelee_EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml --&gt; EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml<br />
<br />
That's all.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you play as Hybrid character, Change *Hybrid_EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml*<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well. You know.. File of same name can not be together in a foler. So, you need to copy the UI folder for Hybrid.<br />
<br />
In other words, Copy Delta_spaghetti folder to other name in 'uifiles' (include all files in Delta_spaghetti UI folder)<br />
<br />
ex) C:\.....\Everquest\uifiles\Delta_spaghetti_for_Hybrid<br />
<br />
and Rename Hybrid_EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml (in the folder for Hybrid) to EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml (If there is same name file, you will have to overwrite the file)<br />
<br />
then, Load the UI for Hybrid in EQ. Natually, If you play as Melee, You will have to load the UI for Melee)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx.</div></div><hr />

The point is how to change the CombatAbilityWnd.xml<br />
<br />
If you play as Hybrid, You must change the name of * Hybrid_EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml * to EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml.<br />
If you play as Pure Melee, You must change the name of * PureMelee_EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml * to EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml.<br />
<br />
If you play as Hybrid and pure Melee, Read this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=65567#post65567) pls<br />

hmmm.. really don know that. <br />

My mod do NOT include 'Bank Window'. I think that you downloaded the other bank mod and used it.<br />
<br />
Try remove the EQUI_BigBankWindow.xml<br />

Next one, is there a way to put HoTT window built into the UI like the Delta3m2 has? very useful )) since this UI has 2 casting windows, the casting slot next to the target window can be the HoTT spot like in the Delta3m2 UI. If the Hott change can be done, this would be the perfect UI for me. I wouldnt have to pop up the HoTT window to use to, it being intergrated into the target window in the casting slot would be great )<br />
<br />
I included a SS of what im talking about. The circled gauge is a casting window, there is 2 casting windows in this UI, 1 thats big and in yellow which is good and the other is the circled part here. If you can make this the Hott (health of Targets Target) spot, that would rule ))<br />
<br />
<br />
The second SS is the example of what I mean, the circled slot is the HoTT spot, tho the window itself is upsidedown in the spagettii remix haveing the HoTT in the casting slot is what im saying.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
You ain't the only one.  In what the EQ player community almost universally agree was a bad idea, SoE decided to implement removal of augmentations by changing the default configuration of all containers in the UI.  End result is that every UI mod that has a custom UI needs to be reconfigured to work with augmentation removal.  What you did.. temporarily changing back to the defaul ui... is the workaround a lot of people have been using.<br />
<br />
Five things you can do hear.  First, live with using the workaround for now.  Second, wait and see if somebody &quot;fixes&quot; the custom ui you're using for this problem.  Third, use a custom ui where this has already been fixed.  Fourth, try and fix it yourself.  Fifth express your opinions about this to SoE in a constructive manner.</div></div><hr />

You stopped playing the game yet still keep this UI up to date - thank you! I have used soooo many different UI's before finding this one and it really wouldn't be the same game without it.<br />
<br />
My question is will you be doing a patch to allow the extra buff slot, and spell slot, together with incorporating the 'advanced' functions for setting in game options?<br />
<br />
I don't blame you if you decide enough is enough, just hope someone with more brains than me picks up the ball. They have put a fix in for delta 3 or 4 can't remember which, but really consider that interface much inferior - even though that's the one I started using heh ;). <br />
<br />
Anyway, if you are doing a fix thank you again, and if not thank you for all yopur previous excellent work - that thanks to all those that have originated then developed this interface.<br />
<br />
Thoughts... hmm I think if I just log in a non ply char on a default interface I could set the new advanced options that would apply across all my chars - or am I wrong? That would solve that one perhaps.<br />

The only way to fix this is to just copy and paste the container file that the default has to your Delta 3.0 Spaghetti Remix files.  When u do this it will tell u if u want to do this just click yes.  That will fix the Aug container.  But the other part I dont have that problem about xml files are not compatible.

I have 2 minor requests if you can advise me... something I should probably know how to do but am too dumb ;/.<br />

1) With the new buff slots the 'song' slots overlap - it's minor but if I could shift the song slots a little would be useful, tried clicking all around em without luck - prob missing something.<br />

2) Compass - blue line on blue background ;) Didin't really matter for ldon's as soon got them marked.
