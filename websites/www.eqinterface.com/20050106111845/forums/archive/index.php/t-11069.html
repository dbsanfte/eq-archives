<br />
I am using the Infiniti ui. And I've made the alterations as said in the patch forum. It works fine and all that, but the consider mark in the target window is a little missplaced. I want it to be like it is in this pic, with the red con frame, the red fill up within the red frame.<br />
But, I would like to have the red consider fram fit within the Blue Target window frame, completely filled out to all the corners, but still within the blue frame.<br />
<br />
Does that make any sense? LOL<br />
<br />
I've tried fiddling with it myself, but EQ crashed on me, so I wont dig into the that again.<br />
<br />
If someone could tell me what XY numbers to change, and what I must change them to. I would appreciate that very very much.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's sizable, it just means you have to make a .tga with the right size frame and specify the dimensions in your UI.  Not sure how it worked on test.</div></div><hr />

I was playing with this today but didn't think of that...<br />
<br />
The color box that shows the actual con-color of the mob respects the size and location of the TGA file? Not the values you specify in the StaticAnimation XML?<br />
<br />
So if I make a TGA with a wide, empty border and mask it right, then specify the right dimensions for the TGA in my XML ... the con-color will appear in the right place?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went back to the file, and started to fiddle and change the numbers back and forth. Then I logged on EQ in between to check what I did. And I must tell ya, that is NOT fun with a not so fast computer. LOL<br />
<br />
Pretty good for someone that doesnt know crap about programming. Or one could say, I got lucky. ;)<br />
<br />
Now I just need to figure out how to fit the con frames within the blue original frames of the target window. :/<br />
<br />
But I did find the numbers, atleast to change the size of the con window color for infiniti ui  .<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what it looks like now.<br />

This is file, if you want it. Copy it into your custom made ui folder, and let it write over the old one.</div></div><hr />
