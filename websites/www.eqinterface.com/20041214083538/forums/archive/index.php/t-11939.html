<br />
Before you ask.. I dont plan on making a larger resolution available.. I tried and it just doesnt look right any bigger.<br />
<br />
Was just feeling alittle nastalgic this week and wondered if the original UI could be made modern and functional again.. and here it is.. not quite done, but it's getting there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
heheh, I noticed that last night.. it will be fixed for the release</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vixyn</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is great - I downloaded the version you have here. But how about so melee loving?<br />
<br />
Sadly, selector window in your melee folder? Um. It doesn't fix the gaping hole left in there by the spellgem bar :*(<br />
<br />
Might I suggest using the combat abilities tab to replace the spell gem bar? Think it would be simple to place the buttons for the abilities where you have the gems for the spells, as they both have 8?<br />
<br />
Don't know where this would leave the hybrids using the disc window, unless your caster version had a smallish combat box?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CwestHawk</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jethal, this is probably the best looking &quot;Original EQ&quot; interfaces I've seen yet.  I've always been partial to Talyn's &quot;Old School&quot; interfaces, but those weren't made for 800x600 resolution... and since I play EQ at that resolution in EQW so that I have access to the rest of my desktop, this interface is a godsend!<br />
<br />
Just some humble requests, if I may...<br />
<br />
<br />
 Nowhere in the interface is information like character level or deity given.  Perhaps the gembar/selector window or the inventory window can be rescripted to include those two items.<br />
 I'm personally partial towards having a smaller container window.  I corrected the &quot;level/deity&quot; issue above by including a third-party inventory window that I like, which didn't break your interface.  But, if I include a container window other than yours... even the default container window... the interface breaks every time (i.e. I get an XML error trying to load the interface and EQ crashes to the desktop).  Is there any chance of there being a smaller container window?<br />
 <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

How did you hide the input bar on the upper right chat box?</div></div><hr />

That took me a bit to figure out, too.  He has the bottom chat box overlapping the top one so that the input bar is covered up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deathbane27</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 11:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nuts.  I was hoping there was a way to have my secondary chat windows set up in such a way that I wouldn't be able to click on them.  (Tried putting hitsmode in a corner but the invisible borders sometimes interfered with my trying to target things.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaltruk</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the look!! But I gotta ask.. How the heck do you have a disturbed elysian remains in target window while your in Misty Thicket?? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jigsaw</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using this.. the version you have posted so far is working great for me.<br />
<br />
Are you still working on it?  Do you have updates?  It works fine now, but I'm just curious.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, and while I do love the old look and it runs great, one thing I do really like about most new UIs is that you can see the names of the buffs you have.  I may fiddle around with it to see if I can squeeze a buff window down into that corner if you aren't working on this anymore...</div></div><hr />
