<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQKobara</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you copied UI_bwarey_73 into your &quot;Primary EQ folder&quot; (not just leaving it in the UI folder), and are using a number instead of the server name, that is the problem right there.  Make sure you have copied the file into your MAIN EQ FOLDER, and not just left it in the custom UI folder. That UI file HAS to be in the main EQ folder to do you any good.<br />
<br />
Try replacing the &quot;73&quot; in the file name with &quot;Bristlebane&quot; and then verify that the UI Folder name you have the ultimate monk UI within matches the name listed in the UI_bwarey_bristlebane. Open THAT file using Notepad or another text editor program and find LOADSKIN= (foldername) where (foldername) HAS to match the name of the folder you placed the Monk UI files inside.<br />
<br />
If you did not use the same Folder name as the author of that UI file, that is the problem... edit the line to match YOUR  folder's name and save it. Then reenter EQ and it should work. <br />
<br />
Also, you do not say if you tried to load the UI in-game after the default UI loaded itself by using the OPTIONS window selection or typing /loadskin (UI name) in your chat window.<br />
<br />
If none of those mistakes are causing your problem then need to have more information about what is happening for anyone to help, I think... UIError file contents, etc.</div></div><hr />
