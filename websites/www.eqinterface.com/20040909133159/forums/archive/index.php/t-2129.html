<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolaniel</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have made a mod using the base UI created by Vert. I used his version 1.1. <br />
<br />
Grab it from my wesite:<br />
http://users.adelphia.net/~locklear/id20.htm<br />
<br />
Or from the Complete Set sections here:<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=226<br />
<br />
A few things I changed are: <br />
Made some of the fonts bigger, because I play in 1600X1200<br />
Moved the current HP's and Max HP's around and made them more visible.<br />
Made the Stamina bar smaller<br />
Included the weight in the hotbutton box<br />
Got one of those kewl directional compasses that tell you what your loc will do<br />
<br />
Included in the zip file is a file with the 1600X1200 window presets, and a .jpg of my UI so you can see how I have things set up.<br />
<br />
This is a work in progress along with my website. I will be making updates as I can. Hopefully some of you will enjoy this UI as much as I have. Check it out, let me know what you think and see if there is anything you would change. Thanks</div></div><hr />

I am not totally sure what your prblem with the UI is.  I know that sometimes when I am loading different versions, trying to get the UI sett up correctly I will lag real bad.  It seems as if my screen pauses for 3 seconds, skips, and then pauses for 3 seconds again.  I am not entirely sure what is causing this, but I do know that if I camp out an come back it will go away and I can resume normal play.  Try this, if it works great, if not I will look into it.  Thanks for the interest in my mod, and look for more updates soon.</div></div><hr />
