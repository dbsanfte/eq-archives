<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuco3</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would it be possible to make a buff window which had 15 timers (most likely overlayed by text (IE: Visions of Grandeur), and next to the VoG icon, for example of VoG)  Which would count down the time till the buff (or debuff/dot) runs out?<br />
<br />
I think the hardest problem would be to assign timers to different buffs.</div></div><hr />

and for many reasons ( having 15 timers starting alone / chosing its duration alone /being totally independant ). <br />
but maybe someone will find a trick to do part of that ( after all , someone made a &quot;timer jauge&quot; of 6 mins , that can be clicked on to set a duration, and i wouldn't have thought it was possible with current UI )</div></div><hr />

If the VI developers integrate the ability to view the buff timer, then a mod could be done for that, but can not be done at this piont in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tannin</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">all you really need to be able to hack this in (i think, it would depend on animations resetting, like the class animation does whenever you open your inventory window) via the same animation-style timers that have been done, would be do get access to the name of the buff and/or buff text and be able to lookup based on it.<br />
<br />
this was my most recent fesability query, would love to see how much of a given buff was left, but unless they give us access to change the spell name label/animation, or the table for buff-&gt;icon, i've come to the conclusion that it can't be hacked in with our current  access.<br />
<br />
edit: ok, i lied, the inventory window class animation doesn't reset when closed, i just timed it badly.  that would be the other barrier :)</div></div><hr />
