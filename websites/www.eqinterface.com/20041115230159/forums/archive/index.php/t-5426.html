I had to make room for a test i'm working on... The skins will be available here on EQInterface.</div></div><hr />

I love your's and Statix's Quartz the only thing I dont like is that when playing my non-casters where the gems are is just a blank space. Can you guys add in a little textured square I could put in that place so it is not gaping and ugly?  <br />
<br />
My skin is based on Statix's quartz. I cannot modify his skin myself as he holds the copyrights. Also, as mentionned in the readme, the skin is oriented towards the caster player. That's why i don't cover the non casters.<br />
<br />
I'm flattered that so many people like my version of Statix's skin but i can't maintain more versions than i already to, lack of time forces me this route.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the inconvenience.<br />
<br />
I do beleive that Statix has included in Quartz a version for Non-casters... might want to check that with him.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I just wanted to know if it was possible to just put in a 40x40 pixel texture tile to cover up the gaping hole when I am playing my warrior. You could do it how he dose it - add a folder called mods and just have another file to copy in past into the main folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alyson</div><div class="date">01-24-2003, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If Statix adds this to his skin, it will make it to mine be assured. I just don't want to change his base skin as i want to stay as close as possible to his base skin as possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naoa</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
downloaded your skin and like it very much, just one small problem everyting i open the loc helper it disconnects me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alyson</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very odd indeed. I have never experienced this... i suspect that a file may be missing or maybe your EQ folder is corrupted. Those would be the only 2 reasons i can think of what could do that... might want to reinstall Everquest especially if you haven't done so recently.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that if you reinstall you MUST uninstall AND delete the everquest folder completely before reinstalling. This insures a fresh start.</div></div><hr />
