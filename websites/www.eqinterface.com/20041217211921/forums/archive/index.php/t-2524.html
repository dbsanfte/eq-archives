<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrik</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I ever see are Orge bsts, 1 iksar, and 2 vah'shir (me included). So i was wondering, whats so good about the Orge Bst?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starshelle</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really? I would say Vah Shir Beastlords were the most common of Beastlords. What server do you play on? As for what's so &quot;good&quot; about them...Ogres have good starting stats for a melee class and they can't be stun in front which I'm sure is nice, but what mainly comes down to is people will play what they want to play because they like how a certain race looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrik</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, i don't really see a lot of Bst in the game, I was Talking about in the forums.<br />
<br />
Btw: Bristle Bane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starshelle</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, you weren't too clear about that, and it does say you play on Bristlebane under your name! hehe I forgot to look there. Of course some people do play on multiple servers. Ogular is a ogre beastlord who has done some great work with mods and is probably why ogres beastlords seem to stand out on this board. But seriously, how do you know how many people who post here play beastlords? Not everyone that posts tells what classes they play and many people play multiple classes. Oh and don't forget the lurkers. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been building mods - and yes, I play an Ogre Beastlord, since I post the works here..... you would more than likely see them.  However - if ya looked closely as the thread currently under the Beta section, you would see what I've been working on - Versions for every beastlord.  Whatdya know - I'm thinkin about you others as well :)<br />
<br />
Just give me some patience, it's a slow process building the grapyhics as I've redesigned the method  I accomplish them with.  Interesting how I post something simmilar to every question people have made about why there is only an Ogre version available.  They also never reply, and then I see someone else ask the same question.  Over and over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lasagna</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im getting tired of this question myself, and Im not even the one who must respond to it.... I feel for ya, have a nana! :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I myself play a beastlord, though mine is Barbarian only because I love wolves... but on the Nameless server the most beastlords that I see are Vah Shir... in fact a few weeks ago someone stopped me at the spires in NK and asked what class am I. Which I told them I was a beastlord... Evidently this must of surprised this person (who was a 40th level druid) as thier response was &quot;Really? I've never seen a barbarian Beastlord before. The most I've seen was Vah Shir.&quot; Well guess that chalks one up for the books on this one... <br />

Most of the beastlords on my server are vah shir.  I wouldn't choose a vah shir because of that fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrik</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I did see your in-progress UIs when I started this thread. And I have to say...THEY LOOK AWESOME! Can't wait til there all done. Oh, and didn't start this thread to complain about not having a Ui of my own. I just wanted to know.</div></div><hr />
