<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's is a shot of my attempt at modding my UI. I needed something that gave me access to all the pertainent info right on my screen without having to open other windows. But of major importance was the necessity to have as much available clear space as possible. (I hate having to move something just to follow a mob when I'm medding.)<br />
<br />
Some of the things I put in this UI were at the request of a paladin friend of mine who wanted certain things available for melee purposes.<br />
<br />
One of the things you'll notice is that I do not have a 'Target' window. As things stand currently, VI didn't give us a means of adding new windows, and I had a need for a clean window for things like maps and trade skills and such. I took the gauge off the Target window, put it on my 'Actions' window under both the 'Combat' and the 'Skills' tabs, so you almost always have your target visible. This left me with a totally empty window that I could do with whatever I chose.<br />
<br />
I left my map/trade skill window off the screenshot cuz I didn't want to step on anyone's toes or pinch any nerves. Besides, I didn't make the maps for it, and didn't want to steal anyone's credit. I did, however, incorporate full color maps from some of the popular EQ map sights into my UI.<br />
<br />
Another thing you'll notice right away is the cool Spell icons, as well as the nifty spell book. Thanks go to T. King for his incredible talents and taste in graphic detail. I really like his work.<br />

I just wanted to post the suggestions i made to see what other people thought of them. Not being an artist i dont really have a good eye for this stuff but I think it might help. I only see 2 very minor things that I don't like about it. <br />
<br />
1. I love having the percent numbers right next to the health bar and int the group window. That though is very minor and not a big deal.<br />
<br />
2. The other is that the Group window seem out of place. I don't really know where to but it but maybe you could mold it in under the EXP area. Or some where else. Like I said im not an artist and i dont know what would look best.<br />
<br />
<br />
These are just some suggestions but i think any one that looks at this UI would agree that it is some of the best. It is very practical and leaves alot of room for the player to customize text boxes and things like that. A very huge thumbs up to this skin. :nana: <br />

<br />
1. Move the buffs to where the spell gems are now (and remove the spell gems completely)<br />
<br />
2. Also get rid of the Mana bar.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know I'm not really good with xml but I would really love this UI if the above changes could be made :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, since I seem to have stirred a bit of interest with these mods, I'm going to be making a few 'alterations' to try and meet some of your requests. Give me a day or so, and I'll post a screenshot here. <br />
<br />
As for those who have sent me private messages, I have recieved them and will provide you with a copy once I atleast add the group window to the Player info window.<br />
<br />
In a way I kinda like the idea of putting the group gauges on the player window... it frees up another window for me to use elsewhere. By putting the target gauge on the Action window, I gained an extra blank window there, now with the group window... I might be able to actually do some interesting things finally.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magistar</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the Mod, love it.  I do have 2 Questions:<br />
<br />
1. Can the rem_buffs.zip or rem_bigbuffs.zip mods be used also?  They essentially add names to the buffs window.<br />
<br />
2.  I am in lust with the inventory window from Techno donuts.  Can I use it as well as your Mod, I only want their Inventory window. Here is link to their thread: http://forums.eqinterface.com//showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=746</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, those mods shouldn't be a problem at all. Infact, I believe they replace the existing Buff window files, so in effect that mod would replace my buff window with it's own code, so it should work fine. <br />
<br />
My buff window is really just a mod which uses smaller icons to save space. Everything else is pretty much the same.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
   As for the changes I'm making to this UI mod...<br />
<br />
I should have something posted here by the end of the day today. At the very least I'll have a new screenshot and a link or 2 for downloading the mod files.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, many of you have been asking for various changes to be made to my [work in progress] UI mods... Some of you, like me, are after a non-obtrusive UI which doesn't block so much of the screen. And others just want the goods displayed as best as possible. That's all well and good, and I've been working on a change to my 'Player' window as seen here...<br />
<br />
http://www.ftchouston.com/EQfiles/new1024ss.jpg <br />
<br />
Here's the rub... as you can see from that screenshot, the addition of the Group health gauges has begun to block more of the view. Now, for those of you who just want a nice place to show your group members, I am willing to finish this mod for you. But for those who are concerned about block the screen.... take a look at this screenshot carefully and decide if this is what you want.<br />
<br />
Basically, I'm asking for your input here because I can't decide for myself whether or not I'm liking the way this is turning out.<br />

I run in 1280x1024 on a 21&quot; screen so I feel the small amount of space it takes up is worth it. <br />

I'd probably want the normal one, and I'd remove the Main window (since I don't play with it on the config windos up).<br />
<br />
I really like your compass.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to put a drop area, like what's normally in the inventory window, next to the 8 inventory slots? It'd be beneficial when switching stuff out, etc.. it's not a biggie if it's not possible.<br />
<br />
I still like your compass.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to put numbers to the right of, and below the spell gems, to identify which is which when using Alt-# to cast with?<br />
<br />
I do like your mod though, it's a very cool idea.</div></div><hr />

another idea is, that i show the MANA status as a NUMBER (just like the EXP status). possible u can make a button out of it (effekt on  button: reports MANA in Grp Chat).<br />

<br />
Why are all the health bars horizontal??  Yes it makes it easy to see and it is what we are use to.  However, to accomplish your goal of unobstructed view.  Why not change the health bars to be vertical and place them 2x3 or 3x2 on the right and/or left side?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying its a good idea, I'm not even suggesting that I would like it.  It's just something that I have not seen and I don't know if its out there or not yet.  If it is then disregard this post.<br />

<br />
Suggestions to make the whole thing take up less space - <br />
remove player level/class/diety. remove stamina bar (I'm a caster personally so I don't care one whit about stam, but not everyone feels that way)...  put xp/aaxpin place of level/class/diety, shift group info up.  <br />
<br />
Personally I would still like to see the target directly below the group window along with the casting bar.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, could also put the group info underneath the player info. just extend that area down a bit...  that would block less of the center screen area.  I'd still get rid of level/class/diety though - I know that information without having to see it. :)<br />
<br />
Aesthetically speaking, I like the double curve you have going with the hp/mana/stam and the xp/aaxp areas.<br />
<br />
target/cast could also be placed underneath the player info section, whether or not you move the group area.<br />
<br />
I like to have group/target/cast all close together, but that's because (as a cleric)  I spend the vast majority of my time healing.</div></div><hr />

As a tank I dont care &quot;one whit&quot; about mana, but I'd rather not lose my stamina bar  ;-)  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok guys, sorry I didn't get something new posted yesterday. What with the move and all, seems there was a bit of a bog down and for some reason my password wouldn't work. And it took a great deal of time to get it reset. However, here are the alterations I've made, plus a screenshot and even links to the files.<br />
<br />
I've made 2 different Player info windows, one with the group info and one without. I would like to comment briefly on some of your suggestions if I may...<br />
<br />
For starters, the level/class/deity info: I want to keep it there, because for some reason I feel that it belongs. Don't ask me why, I just think it would be lacking if I took it off.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the stamina bar: I too am a caster, in fact I am a wizard. And I don't know about the rest of the wizards out there, but sometimes I find myself having to turn tail and run. And sometimes I am running a great distance, or Spirit of Wolf ran out at a bad time and my only means of evading my attacker is... the space bar. THat's right, I jump, as much and as often as I can to get away from whatever it is that wants to tear me a new one. And jumping gets me a step or two ahead. Thing is, when my stamina or 'fatigue' level drops too far, I can't jump anymore, and not only that, but I begin to slow down. So, I like having that little yellow bar there so I know when I need to stop jumping to let my fatigue level go back up again.<br />
<br />
As for the casting and target windows: Where in the heck would I put them? See, the size of the gauges or bars is kinda a hard thing to work around. I tried making them smaller but they became hard to read, and the pixels began bleeding together. And with the size requirements of EQ interface windows (being a power of 2), well, I wanted to keep my image files within a certain size limit... 256x256. The edges of my Player window have already hit that size, and to add anymore, I'd have to make my file bigger... double the current size even. Now, that doesn't mean the actual window would be double the size, just the file. But that does mean slightly longer downloads, slightly more work, and I guess I'm just being lazy in that aspect.<br />
<br />
I put the target window on the Actions window because it made it close to the attack/melee buttons, as well as the skills and abilities. For melee classes, if you move your mouse down to click on bash or taunt or kick, you have the target's health gauge right there above your mouse pointer. I know, many of you use Hotkeys for this so it really doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
As for the casting gauge, here's what I did. I cast a spell that took a few seconds to cast (I'm a wizard, I have many of those), the quickly grabbed my casting gauge and moved it right over beneath my spells window. That way when I cast a spell, I glance up to where my spell gems are, and see my casting gauge. A thought I had is to attach the casting gauge to the spell gem window like I did the exp and AA bars.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm running out of steam here, so I'll address some of the changes I DID make, and get to posting the pics and where to get it.<br />
<br />
1: Added group health gauges to the Player Window. There are 2 different version available, one with and one without.<br />
<br />
2: Added percents to both versions for Mana and HP. These percents are color coded so it should be obvious which is which. (Oh, and as for making a button that reports mana to the group... until VI gives us a way to create our own button functions, not bloody likely).<br />
<br />
3: Adjusted the old group window so that everything fits on a horizontal plane, instead of vertically as it used to be. (I forgot to add F-key labels to each gauge so look for that in a couple of days, sorry)<br />
<br />
4: Added the 'target' gauge to the 'Main' tab of the actions window. I originally had it only on the abilities and combat tabs, but it wasn't showing your target after you zoned because the 'main' tab defaults to being on top.<br />
<br />
5: Adjusted the compass colors a bit so that they stand out a bit better (lightened the blues and reds a bit). Also added off-axis labels (SE, SW, NE, NW)<br />
<br />
6: Added spell number labels to each of the spell gems in the spell casting window. Some people found it hard to remember that the evens went across the top and the odds down the side, so I added numbers to remind them. I also added a slightly different Spellbook button. The old red and gold thing was a bit ghastly so I took a snap of my spell book, shrunk it down considerably, and put it in there in an open and closed view.<br />
<br />
I guess that's really about it. I've been reading over some of your suggestions and requests, and will likely be making some more alterations/special modifications in the near future. I am not opposed to making custom adjustments to my UI to meet individual needs, so keep sending me your comments. And Morniel... I'm working on that Hotkey window. I've just been trying to get some game time in lately. I finally hit 51 on my main character last night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: The spellbook icon - did you download both the graphic for the book and the XML for the spell casting window? They should have been in the same .zip file. The xml file is important as there was a change to the texture being used for that button. It looks to me like your version is not loading the texture, therefore it's not being shown.<br />
<br />
B: The AAXP stats as you mentioned are actually the group health gauges. To get those, you have to use the other file, G_PlayerWindow.zip. It is the one which includes those gauges.<br />
<br />
C: The compass going dark- right click on the compass, select 'Alpha' and the 'Normal Level' and drop it down to about 90. My graphic is a bit darker than the one that came from Varent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those simple changes being done, everything should work perfectly.<br />
<br />
And might I also suggest you check out T. King's spell graphics? They look alot better with my mod. Infact, they just look alot better period.<br />
<br />
<br />

Ok, my mistake... apparently I forgot to add the texture info to the spell casting XML file. Please download and install the latest XML file for that windows.<br />

It's not much more than an empty forum site right now. Perhaps in the future, as I get more free time, I'mm add the kinds of things to it that I'd like to see on an EQ site.<br />
<br />
I have high hopes and dreams of this new User Interface that Varent has given us, and hopefully in time they will make it even more flexible so that people like myself and so many others will really be able to have some fun with it. <br />
<br />
I already have some pretty wild images in my head of what my next UI will look and be like, and if and when I do get it finished, I will be posting it on my site. So, if any of you wish to see what I may be coming up with in the future, check out: <br />
<br />
http://elicia.zyberwerx.net<br />
<br />
The domain is temporary right now as I haven't really decided what to call it. I just grabbed one of my other domains for the time being (I have some 10 or 12 various domains that get little to no use).<br />
<br />
At any rate, I've got my current UI posted there as well as screenshots and links. And any changes I make I will be posting there first before they make it to this and some of the other sites around. It's just alot easier for me to keep track of things on my own site, and the files for my skin are stored there anyway.<br />

I love, love, love this skin.  <br />
<br />
I use the G_Playerwindow, so the group window seems pretty redundant... however, I do need the Invite and Disband buttons.<br />

Can you make a group window that only has these buttons?  Somthing I can move and put where ever I want?  (maybe it isnt possible.  I dunno)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I absolutely love the mod. It's perfect for my lower res (1024) second EQ box. For the first time since the new UI was implemented I actually have full functionality and still have a viewable area on that screen :P Needless to say it rocks on my main EQ machine running in 1280 as well.<br />
<br />
I made a few minor changes. Basicly I applied your mods over a modded version of the Vert skin (I prefer the crisper lines of Vert's skin to the bulkier default) with the Group player window. <br />
<br />
I have 2 questions though: <br />
<br />
First: Is there a way to not have 2 group windows and 2 targets? It's not so bad on the high res box but the second boxes are taking valuable space on the lower res box. Is there a fix for that or did I do something wrong in my install?<br />
<br />
Second: Is there a way to reassoign the inventory slots in the hot box window? I'd prefer Primary, Secondary, Ammo, Ear, Wrist, Legs, Feet and Chest(My ahars are Epic Shaman, Cleric and Druid with a ton of right clicky stuff) I was able to do it in the Vert mod but I can't seem to find the right items to modify Instead of my bags <br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the great job.</div></div><hr />

P.S.  I turned my target window into a Maps/Tradeskills window on my own machine, but I won't include them in my released UI as they are technically the work of another UI artist. I just moved the the maps over to my target window, made a few mods, then added the Tradeskills, so I can't very well claim credit for them.</div></div><hr />

It's totally invisible unless you are casting, then the purple is the same size as the stamina bar and draws back to show the stamina beneath when you cast, and vanishes again. It was very simple to do, just add the casting gauge and put it on the exact coordinates as the stamina bar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I really like the group there :) I have a hard time seeing it where I have it, I like it right out there so I can see group health easily :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seem to have lost my cast time altogether. It poofed as soon as I installed the Wrap UI. I tried editing the coordinates in the UI_Player_## file but it still didn't show up. <br />
<br />
Any thoughts/suggestions how to get it back? Right now all I am doing it watching for the spell gems to gray out and refresh. Not a very accurate timer by any means :P</div></div><hr />

You might try grabbing the EQUI_castingwindow.xml file from your default folder and pasting into your custom folder and see if that fixes it. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, I have made a change to my player window mod which tacks the casting gauge onto the mana bar (kinda like how the pet HP bar is). <br />
<br />
Now, as for the regular casting bar appearing on the screen, I also modified that file, setting the size to 0 x 0 so that it doesn't appear on screen. <br />
<br />
These mods won't be online until I get home this evening and get them uploaded to the server.<br />

Truely the best mod i've seen for my tastes. I slightly altered the graphics, and added a few changes I was using with the default skin. This is 98% perfect for my needs, i'll explain the other 2% below and maybe you can help me fix it. <br />

You notice the target window is part of the playerwindow. That is exactly how i'd like it to be. The problem is, I can't seem to correctly insert the target_hp gauge into the playerwindow. Everytime I try to make it a part of the playerwindow, the skin fails to load. I am having to place the target window over the playerwindow and turn off the background and border. This makes everything but the target name and hp invisible, which visiually gives me what I want, but it's not all in one window.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me ask you this. Are you trying to remove the Target gauge from the target window? I don't think the client will allow you to do this. Instead, just copy and paste it to thw Player window, give it a different item name, then give the old target gauge a size of 0x0 and see if that doesn't work.<br />

&gt;&gt; Nevermind. I figured it out. The Alpha setting has to be lowered from 100 for it to be visible at all.<br />

<br />
P.S. Great mod. One thing tho. Holding ALT is supposed to show the name of yourspells. WIth the current set up 2, 4, 6, and 8 are cut. Is this fixable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolleo</div><div class="date">09-13-2002, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found out why it wouldn't load when I added the target_hp item, the first entry for your group listing has an incorrect screenID:<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;Gauge item = &quot;PW_Gauge1&quot;&gt;<br />
	&lt;ScreenID&gt;PW_TargetHP&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
	&lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt;<br />
	&lt;TextColor&gt;<br />
		&lt;R&gt;240&lt;/R&gt;<br />

		&lt;B&gt;240&lt;/B&gt;<br />

	&lt;GaugeOffsetY&gt;16&lt;/GaugeOffsetY&gt;<br />
etc......<br />
&lt;/Gauge&gt;<br />
<br />
The ScreenID should simply be Gauge1. Once I changed that, it loaded up my changes correctly. It was detecting 2 instances of TargetHP, even though the second occurance was actually Target_HP. It's wierd, but that's what was causing it.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, just thought you'd want to know. My screen layout is now 100% perfect in my opinion, and I have you to thank for it. So, THANK YOU! hehe<br />

If you were referring to my screenshot, then i'm using 1152x864. I chose that so the distance between the player window and the spell gems window would be equal to the space needed for 15 buff icons.<br />
<br />
This mod really is usable with probably any resolution though, it is really well made. <br />
<br />
This is for the person that PM'd about the compass being in the cast window. That, I actually cheated. I didn't feel like working with the .xml anymore, so I just changed the graphic to suit it:<br />
<br />
http://www.owensbri.addr.com/eq/wnd_spells.gif <br />
<br />
that little rectangular whole is the size of the compass at the resolution I use.</div></div><hr />

I was wondering if anyone that knew XML very well could help me. Seeing as I don't know HTML, or XML to save my life, I'm asking here.<br />
<br />
I want to replace my Pet Window, to make it look like this.<br />

I know this is supposed to be the spell thing, but I'm a Rogue, and have no need for spells heh. I also know I don't have a pet either, but its the only menu|window thats not being used by me, that might work for this little change. If its possible to make this the pet window... but no visible buttons... that would be nice too. I'm just gonna put it up on my screen and place my compass in that little box for it.<br />
<br />
I like that screenshot (above)   and I wanted to put that into my upper-left corner of my screen, soo I can make my UI a little more even.<br />
<br />
This UI rocks by the way, props to the maker.<br />

<br />
With Cormanth's permission, i'll make my setup available for download. I've made quite a few modifications, but as the origonal mod is his, I don't feel right in distributing my version without his consent.<br />
<br />
I use it at 1152x864 resolution, by the way.<br />
<br />
Here are the 3 major skins i've settled on using:<br />
<br />
http://www.owensbri.addr.com/eq/my_wrapui.jpg <br />
This is the first one I ended up with, and used for a while.<br />
<br />
http://www.owensbri.addr.com/eq/nwn_wrapui.jpg <br />
This one I did using a leather-type scheme that came with DAOC<br />
<br />
http://www.owensbri.addr.com/eq/rogue_ui.jpg <br />
This one I made for my rogue, since I obviously didn't need spells or mana bar. It could be used for any melee, I guess.<br />
<br />
You'll notice that the hotkeybar for the second and third one has 2 extra boxes next to the hotkeys. Those are the primary and secondary slots, I put them there for quicker weapons wapping.</div></div><hr />

That's rather what this is all about. I certainly never expected for my mods to get as much attention as they have. So if you want to take what I started and make something of it, be my guest. And I would think that would go for just about any of the UI mods that are being made out there. The idea of someone taking and expanding upon the works of previous creators sparks creativity.<br />

<br />
Man! What a hack job!<br />
<br />
It's amazing how much better you can do with something when you come back to it later. I did some cleanup and a little dusting off. And after taking some ideas and other people's works into consideration... &gt; this &lt; (http://eq.zyberwerx.net/EQfiles/Leafy_Corners.jpg) is what I came up with.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse, now that I look at that pic I remember that I forgot to add the tabs to the Hotbutton window for right-clickable items. Doh! I'll get it in the next batch of updates.<br />
<br />
I know Rolleo was going to put out his own modified version of this, since he's been doing alot of work on it. And if that's still the case, more power to him. I just felt a twinge of responsibility to put something out that was a tad better than my previous hack job.<br />
<br />
I don't have the files ready for upload yet. But hopefully tomorrow I'll have them up on my site and available for download.<br />
<br />
Oh, and no those aren't just transparent windows you see in the pic. I actually took the time to simulate a grass/leaf texture which just happens to kinda match EQ's grass texture.<br />

<br />
Ok, sorry for the delay on this. Here is a pic of the final product. It looks kinda bright, and transparent because i'm underwater looking at a brightly lit ground. I wanted to show all the pieces, and needed to have the breathing meter up while casting to do that.<br />

<br />
My verison of this mod is intended to be used at a resolution of 1152x864. I have also included a read_me.txt file with instructions on how to install this, and a UI_Name_Servername.ini file you 'should' place inside your Everquest folder. This second file (when renamed to your character/servernumber) will properly place all the elements in thier appropriate places on the screen, at 1152x864. I removed the titlebar from most of the windows, so moving them will be difficult, so I recomend you us the included .ini file.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I use one of the t.king/rem spellbook/gem projects, and I don't know how the spell gem spacing will be with the default gems. If it looks goofy, just use one of those spellbook/gems sets.<br />
<br />
Any questions or comments can be directed to me here, or at the email included at the bottom of the read_me.txt file.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

I have a request of you though, would it be possible for you to modify the hot button + inventory mod so it is turned around and fit to the right corner of the screen instead of the left?<br />
<br />
That would be great if you can spare the time to do that.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

PS: Just wanna add a trick that I use with this UI. I made the player/group area totally transparent, this makes a big difference in visiblity.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if I will be uploading it here or not since Rolleo has already done so with his version of it. However, if you would like to check out my version, head on over to my site (http://eq.zyberwerx.net/forums/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=ui_released;action=display;num=1031590484;start=8) and have a look.<br />

 The files are available for download there, as well as an in-depth description of the modifications and all included files and features.<br />

<br />
If you copied the new UI files from the default folder after the patch, you might experience a few small problems. Otherwise everything should still be working. You just won't have the new windows and new changes to the normal windows. <br />
<br />
However, there is an update to my version of this UI available which is fully compatible with all of the latest patch changes.... follow this link here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=15488#post15488) to get a copy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are going to be using my Player window as a basis for this mod, then yes, you will have to edit it in your favorite graphic editor (I use PSP7). My player window uses a fixed background image (the default UI uses a single 'fill' background for all of it's windows). My background image defines the shape and size of the window, then the XML simply supports that by setting the &lt;Size&gt; of the window equal to the actual size of the image.<br />
<br />
If you plan to make a new player window based upon mine, you'll need to edit the background image to suit your needs (changing the size, shape, texture) then after you've made the graphic changes you will need to tell the XML what size the image is and what size to make the window.<br />
<br />
I don't know what else to tell you... make sure you save your transparent layer after you make any changes to the image, and remember that all windows are square windows, even if your background makes them appear otherwise. Any part of the window that is transparent is only clear, not invisible... it's still a solid square window. So you won't be able to click through transparent areas. If you cover something with a window and think it will be ok because it's transparent.... think again.</div></div><hr />

Click on it and you'll see 'Canopy' listed.<br />
<br />
Download it and unzip it into a clean folder under your UIfiles folder. Don't put any other files in with it unless you are adding other custom mods. You do not need to copy the default files. My skin works just fine without them.<br />

Tried to access you web-site: it doesn't seem to exist :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem: When you load the latest release of my mod from my site (or from the recently added copy here on EQInterface), Everquest crashes to the desktop.<br />
<br />
Cause: My mistake. I am terribly sorry for that. I was looking at the new Raid Window .xml file from the test server when I zipped this up. Apparently I left the file 'EQUI_RaidWindow.xml' in the folder. Seeing as this was the original raid window script before it went live, it would now be invalid since changes have been made since it was on the test server.<br />
<br />
Solution: There are two easy ways to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
1) The first and easiest way to solve this problem, is to open your UIfiles folder where you extracted this skin to. Then locate the file named 'EQUI_RaidWindow.xml' and delete it. This will force the UI schema to once again load the Raid Window from the default folder as it should have originally done.<br />
<br />
2) The second is method is to download a fresh copy of this mod, either from my site, or from EQInterface.com's download section once it becomes available. I will speaking with Kudane about updating the file and possibly adding an addendum to it's description, referencing the error and fix.<br />
<br />
Again, I am terribly sorry. Ordinarily I either delete all non essensial files from the folder before I archive. This particular night it was quite late, and I had just come off the test server after downloading the latest in UI updates from there. I loaded the raid window script to see what new features Sony was throwing at us in the hopes that I could get a head start of modding it as well as a means to alert fellow mod designers of the latest changes to the XML scheme. It was late, I was tired, and after I was done babbling about the new window, I quickly zipped up my UI. The next day (or shortly there after) I uploaded it here, without realizing the extra file was attached.<br />
<br />
I must also apologize for the state of my website. Truth be told, I am utilizing the bandwidth and servers of a client of mine for next to nothing cash wise. And due to changes within that client's company, certain services had to be taken offline for a few days. We (they) have decided to switch to a full T1 instead of their current integrated service. And as soon as I get everything switched over, I'll be able to bring the servers back up... or atleast the download links.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vixyn</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks :) That fixed the crashing isssue :) Now can I post a suggestion? Ah, thankee...<br />
<br />
Could you make the compass NOT attached to the spells? For melee players such as me, well, we have no compass :( <br />
<br />
Also, When I target anything, theres TWO targets so to speak, one in the right area, and one right above the actions box.  This isn't really a problem, i guess, just distracting :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, you do too have a compass. The compass window is not attached to the spell window. It merely rests beneath it in the little window opening. The compass itself is a free floating window. Press ALT+D to Hide/Show it, then move it around to wherever you want.<br />
<br />
As for the double target window.... still looking for that bug. I don't know how I managed to get that to happen, as it used to be perfect. I'll have to look into it further. It may have something to do with the red 'attack' border issue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vixyn</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, i noticed the compass, however, its all black inside, no letters, figured it was stuck into that window. nother bug perhaps? nothing in my UI errors file about it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Set the Alpha level for the compass window to 80% for both normal and fade. I never eally expected people to use my compass mod because it's not really flashy or unique in any way. So I never did anything to fix that alpha level problem. But if you set both levels to 80% you'll be able to see it just fine and dandy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your other alternative is to download a different compass mod.... perhaps something a bit more stylish?<br />

I haven't really been in-game for a while, so I wasn't aware that my UI had problems. I recently purchased LoY and not only did I find the nice little bugs that Varent drew out for us to cope with, but got them all fixed up and even made some other modifications and alterations which were long overdue. If all goes as planned and I have a slow night at work tonight, I'll be able to upload my latest version so that those of you who would still like to use my Canopy UI may do so. <br />
<br />
There haven't been a great deal of changes other than bug fixes. I did, however, finally fix the spell gem icons in the hot button window, added a long overdue 'close' command to the chat window (dunno how I managed to kill that and miss that it wasn't there). I also made a change to the window selector window which allows it to be included on-screen (the old appearance clashed with my UI and was just simply too ugly to have up all the time). And the last change of any importance is the addition of the 'Charm' slot to the inventory window.<br />
<br />
Anywho, all should be up online either tonight or sometime during the wee hours of the morning.<br />

All of my windows use formed graphics as a background. Change the image file for the window, and you change the window.

I was first attracted to the gui by the first post and pic on it that made it look very moveable and able to re-adjust to my liking :)<br />
<br />
Is it the case where most can be moved?  I tend to use most of my windows at about 15% visibility because I like just enough to read the text w/o hindering visibility.<br />

With my UI things are slightly different. All of my windows can be moved around, as well as have their transparency level adjusted to your liking. But 3 of the main windows are designed to be placed in their proper corners. You could move them elsewhere, but it may not look quite right.<br />
