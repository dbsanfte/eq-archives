<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mokas</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so I had my UI all set up and I was so comfortable and happy with it... was the finest thing to ever have. Then LDoN came out. Oh joy. None of the LDoN windows worked with my UI. So I lived with it for a while until people started getting huffy with me whenever I said my adventure window doesn't work. So I did some crazy thing to put files into my ui file and this screwed the whole thing up and now I can't use it. SO the question is does anyone know where I can find this UI again?<br />
I got this on EQInterface. But I've searched all through and can't find it again. I don't remember what it was named because I changed the name of the file so that it would be easier to remember to type in game ;((<br />

It will bring up a box with your UI folders all in it. So you could have tons of UI's in there and pick and choose one for your moods... easy stuff. Good luck finding that UI :) I'll let you know if I run across it.<br />

Both are in the Complete sets group, under the Evil Section. Good luck.</div></div><hr />
