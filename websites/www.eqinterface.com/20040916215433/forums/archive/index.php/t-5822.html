<br />
I THINK the layout is right all the way across... but I haven't been able to get on long enough to get a full group. If someone could load it with a full group and just verify the gauges and names line up all the way across... and possibly get someone to load a pet and check the pet gauge too... I'd REALLY appreciate the feedback!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

No idea whats going on, works when I put the Vert group window back in just fine =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyste</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Confused me when I read this line:<br />

[Tue Jan 21 18:38:34 2003] [Line:73 Source:UIFiles\dera\EQUI_TargetWindow.xml] Couldn't find class:item 'Blackline'<br />
<br />
Since I didn't update the TargetWindow, just the GroupWindow. Then I realized you're loading this with the Vert mod...<br />
<br />
Haven't tested that yet, I'm going to make a specific mod for the Vert mod when I get this one cleaned up. <br />
<br />
Right now, this is designed for the &quot;default&quot; UI, just to get a stand-alone horizontal group bar working... When that's clean, I'll download Vert and get one with Vert graphics working.<br />
<br />
Should be next week sometime, Vert is a ... less than simple UI :)<br />
<br />
BTW, this one is broke, the pet gauges don't line up. If anyone wants to use it with the default UI to replace the standard group window, try this one...</div></div><hr />
