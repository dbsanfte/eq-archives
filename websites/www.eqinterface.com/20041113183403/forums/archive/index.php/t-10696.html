<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drco</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Over the past I have used several UI's. Like anything else it took playing a few days or weeks with one to see if I really liked it.<br />
Well I have finally found one I like that I had passed over many times. Why I don't know, maybe it was because the other's I used were set in a certain way by the artist and while that is handy it can grow annoying when you try to move things around.<br />
<br />
I play a 65 Wizard in a raiding guild and we raid a LOT. Just about everyday. Raiders know all about raid spam and how annoying it can be. As a wizard there is very little it anything I need to know about melee damage, critical melee hits, ramage (always announced in raid say anyway), and a lot of other useless info that is generated in a raid. If you want to see it anyway there is a minimizied window with all melee info filtered into you can open up when you are bored. ;)<br />
<br />
I run at 1600 by 1200 but a fellow wizard who raids with me saw a screenshot of the UI I use, and wanted a 1024 by 768 version of it.<br />
<br />
Well the way I have it set up, it's just not possible. So I did a lot of streamlining and made a 1024 by 768 version.<br />
<br />
Now, this UI is PURE Vert Neptune. No modifications to the XML or UI in ANYWAY other than instead of coming out of the zip file scattered all over and requiring time to set it up the way you want it, I have done that for you. Any patches etc will be found here at EQ Interface.<br />
<br />
Again, this is set up with a raiding wizard in mind. Of course you can move anything you want. If you desire to have it set up just like the screen shot then be sure you follow the instructions in the READMEFIRST.TXT file located in the zip file.<br />
<br />
Many thanks to Sokol and Kudane for the Vert UI<br />
