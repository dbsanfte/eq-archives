<br />
I was wondering if anyone would perhaps create a How Too Thread that explains just the basics. I saw a thread that had some definitions. I know this is a rather broad question, however I’d like to learn how to do some of the code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alshain</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you've worked with HTML then XML is just an extension of that.  HTML has predefined keywords.  Examples of HTML keywords are &lt;table&gt; and &lt;p&gt;.  XML allows us (Sony in this case) to define our own keywords.  Examples of XML keywords Sony has defined are &lt;gauge&gt; and &lt;label&gt;.<br />
<br />
The XML file containing the keywords (called a Schema in XML speak) that Sony has created for the EQ User Interface (UI) is named SIDL.xml.  You look at this file to understand how to code the various UI elements such as windows, buttons, gauges, text.  There is an AboutSIDL.doc file which describes most of the keywords found in SIDL.xml but it does have some errors.<br />
<br />
Some parts of the  UI cannot be changed.  You can't remove or add buttons to the various windows.  You can't create new windows.  You can move stuff around inside the windows.  You can add or remove some elements (gauges and text for example) to the windows.  You can change the appearace of windows (add/remove titles, all the window to resize, etc).<br />
<br />
Just use notepad to edit the XML files.</div></div><hr />
