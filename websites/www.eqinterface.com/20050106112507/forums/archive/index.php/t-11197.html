Not just a mythology book for Norrath, but a story about the journey of a few heroes, like maybe about how Qeynos was founded, or about the War between the Elves and Sol. Ro! It'd be the neatest book ever! :) Agree, anyone?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't think so. The movie would become outdated fast, but a book would be timeless (to me, anyway) and sequels/prequels/spinoffs could be made of it. :D  Let's make a petition for SONY to make a book series for EQ! :p<br />

Vote, people!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is one - don't get confused with the others that are Pen and Paper game books and manuals - just check around for the fiction novels.<br />

The name is rather ambiguous! Anyone have feedback about these books?<br />
<br />
What about this one? <br />

Al`Kabor's Arcana (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1588461300/ref=pd_sbs_b_2/002-9401493-2590428?v=glance&amp;s=books#product-details) <br />
<br />
Are they interesting? Do they have anything to do with the &quot;mythology&quot; of EQ?</div></div><hr />

I have noticed a complete lack in literature regarding Everquest. By that word, literature, I mean BOOKS! Not strategy guides, but real books. I would LOVE to read (in my spare time, or on a rainy / patch day, or when I can't get on the computer) about Everquest (Norrath)'s history or stories! I find it QUITE fascinating! I am sure I am not the only one to think or feel this way. It would be perfect if there were a few books of EQ, a couple hundred pages each, about things like the mythology of the &quot;Pantheon&quot; of Gods in EQ, or of how certains races of cities were founded. It would be a marvelous book and it'd make you guys at SOE even more money than before! And it'd make more people happy than before! So why not give it a try? You've got nothing to lose! Thanks for listening to me! Au revoir!<br />

That might cause some Copyright problems, but I dunno. Sounds neato to me, though! :D If you agree, how come only 3 voted yes so far? :( And that was long before you posted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KelricStormwolf</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno... rather than fiction based in the world (which I can write and read whenever I want, at places like EQ Roleplayer, and even act out ingame - which is why I play a Role-Playing Game), I'd like to see the lore and history put out in some kind of concrete, consistent form.<br />
<br />
I know there's some great websites that have compiled everything they can find... but there's a lot of stuff, from different periods (e.g., pre-release, release, post-Vision, etc).  Heck, better than a book, I'd love to see quests IN-GAME where you can uncover unknown or obscure lore... not fo XP, faction, or coin, just for knowledge. Like... Splitpaw gnolls think they were formed by Brell out of the Clay of the Cosgrove... well, what the heck is the Cosgrove?? Things like that. :p<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I read constantly, so I'd never be against (good!) books. Maybe a series fleshing out the adventures of Firiona Vie, since she and her Companions were the driving force of Norrathian history til they got set aside.</div></div><hr />

EverQuest: Transformation.  Not a bad comic either, try and find a copy.  Thank God for the local game/hobby/geek shop.</div></div><hr />
