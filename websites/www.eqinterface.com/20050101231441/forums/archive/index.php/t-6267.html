<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Colphax</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a cobbled together UI that I really like, but it seems that I have a couple files that are not the &quot;latest and Greatest&quot; according to Sony.  it's so old that it is basically an entire UI file instead of just the mod files I needed.  I have especially avoided mods that changed the EQUI_Animations file for ease of maintenance, but I am still getting the stupid &quot;your UI files are out of date, some buttons may not work...&quot; message everytime I log on or zone.  Although I have tried to put it together again file by file from  scratch using the downloads I have saved, so far I haven't had much luck, the new version  almost always crashes.    <br />
<br />
Is there a list somewhere of every file that has been modified by Sony since the new UI came out (including the &quot;stealth changes&quot; that Sony forgot to post on their patch messages)?  I have tried looking at castersrealm's patch message database, Everquest Live, and a couple of searches here.  I remember seeing somewhere that this information might exist, so please help me out if you can!<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />
