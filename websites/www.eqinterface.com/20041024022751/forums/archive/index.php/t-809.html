There are some new(ish) things to report about the interface, bazaar and other odd things. Some of this you may already know, but some of it you may not. I’m just going to give you a list of stuff.<br />
<br />
   1. We recently changed the way the UI looks for its files. If you load a skin that is missing pieces it will find and use those missing pieces in your default folder. What this means is that if you forget to copy a file into the folder for your new skin, the game will use the default file. It also means that if we update the interface and add new files, your existing skins should continue to work, since the UI will look for those files in the default directory.  <br />
<br />
So, you ONLY need to place files you have changed into the directory for your mod.  Anything else will be loaded from the default directory.  It does place a warning into the UIErrors.txt, but that adds up to about 3k instead of twelve megs of graphics and XML files.  Great thing, if you ask me!</div></div><hr />
