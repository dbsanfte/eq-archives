Problem is, When I put the border in The corners work fine, but the sides only stretch the picture. Is there anyway that you can make it repeat the picture for the sides? Kinda hard to explain.<br />
 the picture I put in was of 2 chainlinks  kinda like this )()( if you can picture that haha. I wanted it to repeat the picture but all it does is stretch it to look something like ):::::():::::::( should post picture but im in a bit of a hurry atm.<br />
  If you have worked with a custom border you prolly know what im talking about. Is this a limitation of the UI where it can only stretch the sides?<br />
 I could put something like this in )()()()()()()()()( and make it really long but then if the window that border goes on is small it will appear like a very tiny chain.<br />

Like I said hard for me to explain heh.<br />
<br />

It's a UI thing, the middle parts of the border are getting stretched as the window resizes, no way stopping that from happening.<br />
You could, of course, draw fixed size borders for all your windows and lock them in size so the fit-in border doesn't get stretched but that sounds like a lot of work.</div></div><hr />
