this is a good spot to start, i loaded Kenna's mod (nice work Kenna) and had a cursor i didn't want but like the rest of the mod. I had to go into the animation^.xml file and change source, name, and LOC of the picture i wanted to use as a mouse manually.. Good luck on your mod works.. this is good tutorial if your going to be adding your own graphics of any sorts.. just don't think in the box.. think around the box :) <br />
