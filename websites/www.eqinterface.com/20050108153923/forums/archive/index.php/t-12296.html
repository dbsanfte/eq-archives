<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things to consider if you are thinking about upgrading that video card. Again, these are just our experiences and opinions.<br />
(Scroll to bottom for quick summary if you aren't the reading type.)<br />
<br />
So my brother wanted a new video card. He went out, and a few hours later returned with a shiny new box. Curious, I went in to see what he had. To my suprise, he had decided on a Radeon 9800 Pro, we had both pretty much always stuck with Nvidia's cards as habit. Trying something new is always good though... isn't it?<br />
<br />
The Radeon 9800<br />
<br />
We unpacked it, took anti-static precautions and proceeded to pop that new monster into his machine. After about 15 minutes of figuring out the proper steps for the installation of the drivers in the correct order we had it all done (the driver software is... messy, in my opinion).<br />
<br />
Thus began the nightmare installation from hell...<br />
<br />
All looked good, everything ran, and it performed quite well... until after about a half hour. Suddenly the screen goes black, we hear window noises for critical stop and exclamation. The video returns but in 16 colors and tiny resolution. A little window informs us that the card has recovered from an error and advises we reboot before continuing - as if it wasn't obvious.<br />
<br />
We reboot the machine, check DX9 and the drivers - all seems up to snuff. We run some 3D apps whilst monitoring the temperature of the card to rule out thermal causes. No problem there, runs quite cool (room temp to +15d above). Again we get the VPU recovery error... this continues for a while during the process of trouble shooting.<br />
<br />
A summary: after extensive changes of drivers, bios settings, graphics settings, a new card (exchanged to rule out defective hardware), power supply units a brand spanking new install of windows again, more drivers, more bios tinkering, another computer - NOTHING stops the constant but random VPU errors the cards are spewing out.<br />
<br />
We give up, at a loss for any explanation and decide to return the card for a Nvidia GeForceFX 5700 Ultra (it was pretty much the same performance of the FX5900 but cheaper).<br />
<br />
The Nvidia GeforceFX 5700 Ultra<br />
<br />
We return with the new card, praying there are no more issues (this is two days later). Pop the new card into the machine (wow, those FX5700s are heavy! Very beefy heatsinks on both sides). Install the NV 53.03 drivers in one step and 60 seconds, reboot, and are up and running.<br />
<br />
Load up various 3D apps and games and everything runs without so much as a hiccup. In fact, we both notice that the Nvidia card is getting a MUCH better framerate than the Radeons were (despite all the documentation to the contrary - web reviews repeating again and again that the Radeon out performed the GeForce 5900 let alone the 5700). We wonder who the heck ATI payed off to write those reviews?!<br />
<br />
Summary of Experience<br />
<br />
ATI<br />
A) Drivers are a pain, quite tedious.<br />
B) Performance is decent (but nowhere near what all these web reviews would have us believe), gamma/color correct system is a total waste of effort.<br />
C) Stability is absolutely horrible. A one legged tripod has more stability. Crashes were random but constant - load or no load on two different cards and two different systems.<br />
D) Included software was out of date. Morrowind? C'mon - why include software that shows off not an iota of the cards capability? Not that I'd want to even play it anyway.<br />
E) Heatsink and card construction seemed... somewhat flimsy and lacked design.<br />
<br />
NVIDIA<br />
A) Drivers are cake, one executable for any of the cards and sixty seconds later you are set to reboot and get going.<br />
B) Performance was excellent! Graphics were smooth, quick and vivid. A quick adjustment through the color correction menu and gamma was dead on.<br />
C) Stable as a concrete block, the card has never so much as flinched at even the heaviest of load (even has a temp warning system should you be the overclocker type).<br />
D)Included software was recent, supplying a game that could show off a good range of the cards capability as well as having some decent reviews. (Splinter Cell)<br />
E)Heatsink was solid and more than sufficient, though the fan seemed a bit small. It's fine for stock, overclockers might want to invest in a better one. Overall construction was very sturdy, nothing to complain about that I can see.<br />
<br />
Thats the wrap up. I'd buy the GeForceFX 5700 Ultra again in the blink of an eye, where as I'd poke my own eye out and poor lemon juice in it rather than purchase the Radeon 9800 Pro again.<br />

<br />
I agree with you on the NVidia fans do seem a wee bit small. During construction of the card, it would of been my opinion to put on a bigger fan. But the testing we do with the cards (which are far more strenuous than those who play at home), the fans do their job fairly well. But I have no qualms to those who decide to upgrade the fan. But be careful as some replacements of the fan can void the warranty of the card (unless it is one of few companies that condone overclocking - in fact some companies give you instructions with the card on what to do. Quite nice of them).<br />
<br />
Again Tellgar, nice review.</div></div><hr />

Good review.  I love the humor and I know the feeling all too well :rolleyes:  ROFLMAO!!<br />

<br />
I agree with you on the NVidia fans do seem a wee bit small<br />
<br />
That all depends on the manufacturer.  I use Abit Siluro cards exclusively, and the cooling on them are excellent, especially if you get one of the cards with the OTES system.<br />
<br />
I've used nothing but nVidia since 3dfx went under.  I have friends that have used ATI and have installed the cards and did not have the nightmare that Tellgar had, but agree that nVidia are much more user friendly.<br />
<br />
To be honest, when it comes down to performance, unless you are a power-overclocker it doesn't matter which card you are using.<br />
<br />
My greatest advice when purchasing nVidia cards is to check the card manufacturer.  The same nVidia chip on cards from different manufacturers will not behave equally.  You will often see the &quot;same&quot; card selling for a wide range of prices because of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kageronin</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I use a Radeon 9700 Pro card and I've never had those probems you talked about.  One question, during the installation of the card, did you hook the power cord on the card to any throughput power supply inside your case?  That would explain why you had the critical stop problem.  Starting with the 9700 series Radeons, they required additional power that could not be supplied by the AGP slot.  There should've been a cable that would hook up to any available power cord inside your comp.  Also I've never had any problems with the drivers.  They've always been autostart and follow the instructions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfran</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not a review.  That's a story showing a bad experience with an ATI card.  Was it an ATI branded/built card or one from another vendor based on an ATI chipset?  I have a 9800XT and didn't have a single problem with it.<br />
<br />
And your summary was laughable.<br />
<br />
ATI<br />
A) Drivers are a pain, quite tedious.<br />
<br />
nVidia<br />
A) Drivers are cake, one executable for any of the cards and sixty seconds later you are set to reboot and get going.<br />
<br />
Why are ATI drivers a pain?  I downloaded one file from www.ati.com and ran it.  A reboot later and I had the drivers installed.  Installing from the CD is difficult?  Ummm...from the CD I clicked a button and it installed.  Pretty tough stuff.<br />
<br />
Oh wait...maybe you had to remove old drivers before installing new ones?  That must have been the problem.  That can be tough.<br />
<br />
<br />
ATI<br />
B) Performance is decent (but nowhere near what all these web reviews would have us believe), gamma/color correct system is a total waste of effort.<br />
<br />
nVidia<br />
B) Performance was excellent! Graphics were smooth, quick and vivid. A quick adjustment through the color correction menu and gamma was dead on.<br />
<br />
Any support for these claims?  Does the gamma/color correct system for the ATI card not work at all?  It works for me.  And when you say &quot;all these web reviews&quot; are lying about performance, any actual support for that claim?  Mine seems to run pretty consistent with review claims.<br />
<br />
And is performance better on the nVidia card or are both excellent?  Is the ATI card not smooth, quick or vivid?  Or did you care?  Did you just want to throw those comparisons in there to beef up your onesided opinion that nVidia cards are da bomb and ATI cards are worthless?<br />
<br />
<br />
ATI<br />
C) Stability is absolutely horrible. A one legged tripod has more stability. Crashes were random but constant - load or no load on two different cards and two different systems.<br />
<br />
nVidia<br />
C) Stable as a concrete block, the card has never so much as flinched at even the heaviest of load (even has a temp warning system should you be the overclocker type).<br />
<br />
This is fine.  This was the point of your post.  The ATI card you got had no stability at all.  You provided an anecdote in support.  If you'd left the entire post to this point--the only one you had any supporting statements for--it would have been a better &quot;review&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
ATI<br />
D) Included software was out of date. Morrowind? C'mon - why include software that shows off not an iota of the cards capability? Not that I'd want to even play it anyway.<br />
<br />
nVidia<br />
D)Included software was recent, supplying a game that could show off a good range of the cards capability as well as having some decent reviews. (Splinter Cell)<br />
<br />
So you're not a RPG fan, but you like FPSes.  Both are outstanding games.  Both were released in 2002.  Both use similar technology.  Neither gets everything out of either the ATI or the nVidia card.  This is another completely extraneous blurb meant to push your point even further to the nVidia side.<br />
<br />
<br />
ATI<br />
E) Heatsink and card construction seemed... somewhat flimsy and lacked design.<br />
<br />
nVidia<br />
E)Heatsink was solid and more than sufficient, though the fan seemed a bit small. It's fine for stock, overclockers might want to invest in a better one. Overall construction was very sturdy, nothing to complain about that I can see.<br />
Again...throwing out an opinion about something you have little knowledge of...or at least show little knowledge of.  How is ATI's heatsink and card contstruction &quot;somewhat flimsy&quot;?  And what does it mean when a $300 video card &quot;lacks design&quot;?  And the word &quot;seemed&quot; in there...are you not sure that the ATI card was flimsy?  Just threw that in there to further sway your readers' opinions?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The boards currently offered by ATI and nVidia are completely even design, performance, driver and feature wise.  If one is better than the other, the difference isn't nearly as much as you make it out to be in your &quot;summary&quot;.  You had a bad experience with the stability of your ATI card which completely overshadowed all other aspects of the card.  The nVidia card you swapped it out for worked correctly.  If you had left it at that...<br />
<br />
But you decided to demonize ATI and evangelize nVidia....and you did it poorly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teddyboy420</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I am an Nvidia man meself. I have used ATI cards and didn't really like them. Granted, the ATI cards I used were a Rage 128 32MB, and a Radeon 9600M 64MB, but even with the low expectations I had for them, they performed miserably. I know I shouldn't judge using a mobile card b/c they aren't built for performance per say, but still, the Rage (which was in a desktop) definatley wasn't anything I would recomend to anyone.<br />
<br />
After the experiences with the 2 ATI cards, I decided that I would switch and give the Nvidia cards a go, it sure couldn't get any worse. So, I replaced the Rage 128 with a GeForce 4 MMX 440 SE 64MB. The difference in performance was a lot bigger than you would expect with such a small upgrade.<br />
<br />
Than for Christmas this year I decided to treat myself to a new video card. After reading alot of reviews for both ATI and Nvidia cards, I found that (based on a few banchmark tests)  the GeForce 5700 Ultra was able to just about keep up with ATI's top o' the line Radeon, and it was ALOT cheaper. That was all I needed to see. I am now extremely happy with my new video card, I can run Horizons maxed out and not get the slightest graphical hitch (The memory leak is another matter though, lol), it's a great video card for the price and I would definatley recomend it to anyone looking to upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I replaced the Rage 128 with a GeForce 4 MMX 440 SE 64MB. The difference in performance was a lot bigger than you would expect with such a small upgrade.<br />
<br />
<br />
The rage 128 was released in 1998. The Geforce 4 was released in 2002...<br />
Saying that's a small upgrade is like saying that a Pentium II 350 to a Pentium4 2.6Ghz is a small upgrade. Or a horse and carrage to a Chevy.<br />
Although the geforce4 MX was a lousy performer for it's generation, it is almost 4 full generations newer than the rage 128... so yes, I would hope that it performed a bit better.<br />
<br />
The fact is:<br />
This thread is why so many &quot;feelings&quot; get spread as fact on the internet. No hard data... just one person's individual bad experience which could have been caused by any number of things... and now some people will read it, call it a &quot;review&quot;... and start posting on other message boards about how ATI cards are inferior. <br />
<br />
Differences in hardware these days are so complex and often times tiny....  that most purchasing decisions come down to one of two things. <br />
1)personal preference (just like picking vanilla over chocolate because it's &quot;better&quot;) <br />
2)Faulty information <br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with #1... if you prefer one or the other, that's great. Buy what you like and what you feel comfortable with. But please... try not to contribute to #2 for people who are looking for factual info to base a decision on.<br />
<br />
It's true, it has to be... I read it on the internet. =\<br />

Since then i have allways used Nvidia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shizar</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off , ATI / nVidia , your all talking about  two different cards ,style / look wise , personal preference comes in every purchase anyone makes , i've tested both these cards straight from the manufacturers , both run flawless , with the ATI card running about 5-8 fps more , nothing too noticable , yes drivers have a major part in everyone's eyes even with nvidia cards they all are  unified drivers,but ATI drivers can be just as easy to install , but with the problems ppl have. I have notice some drivers for both brands of cards that we are talking about , one bad driver can mess up anything both nvidia or ATI , nothing the end-user can do there . , im rambbling here , my point is , both cards are great , ATI is built to perform with a slight increase in temp , the nvidia cards are also built to perform , but not clocked to there best specs , in all honesty both cards are good , reliable , you all just need to test for yourself , every company has a fuilty card or piece of hardware , they call this DoA (Dead on Arrival), nothing to hate the company over , just another part of what we all call life , im not a very good typer, so all i wanna say and point out if you all missed earlier is ... they are both one in the same .. just use what you like. But search around .. not all cards are built the same , nor even clocked the same ... just don't blister a company with reviews , when you only used one of the cards from that company and it was DoA , cause nvidia can produce the same DoA material , im not here to argue , im just stating a point that opinion based off a card that was faulty not returning it to try another of the same model , and grabbing a totally different card and sayin it's better cause it worked is not a good argument , well im late for work you all take care , and this was not ment to insult nor make anyone look bad  , just another opinion , from personal experience,  <br />
<br />
have a good one<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Kuvasie, it was so frustrating - but we got some laughs out of relating the experience.  Glad you picked up on the cynical humor. :p<br />
<br />
Wolfran, Nowhere, at all, in any form did *I* use the word 'review'. I quote myself:<br />
Again, these are just our experiences and opinions.<br />
I can't put it any more straightforward than that. If you want exact number by number stats go to a review website. I'm just putting our experience with the two cards up for consideration as well as making light of the two frustrating days we spent trying to get ATI cards working in the machines. Whether you buy ATI or NV makes no difference to me - I don't give a pizzle which you decide on! I'm also not going to change MY choice because you think I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
If you want to post a positive experience with the ATI, go for it! I'm tired of people trying to turn any post they can into a durned flame war. It's tiresome.  :rolleyes: Please just add your thoughts, and keep the personal attacks to yourself - they do nothing but drive people away from forums. Thank you.<br />
----<br />
In response to the other serious questions:<br />
<br />
We did exchange the card once (I stated that in my post).<br />
<br />
Yes, it was an ATI not a generic with an ATI cs.<br />
<br />
Yes the external power input was indeed connected (the 5700 Ultra also required external power input in the form of a molex connector).<br />
<br />
Power supply was ample and tested fine. (no variance by more than 0.5v and plenty of current).<br />
<br />
I never use drivers from the CD included (though we did try that), because they are almost ALWAYS out of date by a fair margin.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we are happily gaming -  blowing up stuff was great for relieving the frustration of the experience!  ;)<br />
~Tellgar<br />
<br />
 EDIT: <br />
GeForce 5700 Ultra was able to just about keep up with ATI's top o' the line Radeon, and it was ALOT cheaper. <br />
Good point Teddyboy! Forgot to mention that, the 5700 was less than half the price of the 9800 - wasn't that much of a consideration really, but was a nice suprise! Saved $$ is always a good thing. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tellgar thanks for sharing your story i have had simillar experiences with Radeon cards.<br />
<br />
I was a little puzzled by one post where the writer diced your story...seems he took your experience for a review...odd that he took to the time to read but failed to notice you never said review :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfran</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's structured like a review.  It's purpose was to &quot;review&quot; and compare experiences with two different cards.  Just because he didn't use the word review in the &quot;review&quot; doesn't mean it's purpose was to &quot;review&quot;.<br />
<br />
As Fozzik said, it only serves to foster a misconception that one company makes vastly better cards than the other.   Since that was your goal with the post, GREAT JOB!  I totally agree that if I bought a card from a company and it didn't work, returned the card and got a second one that didn't work I'd probably go to a different company and complain about it on the internet too!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the one sided opinion!  I love my Radeon 9500 Pro, myself</div></div><hr />

My experience with NVidia cards has been almost exactly what he described for ATI. To that end I will not ever buy another NVidia card.
