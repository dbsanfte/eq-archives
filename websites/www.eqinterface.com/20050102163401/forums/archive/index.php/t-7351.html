There have been about 5 patches to the interface since undead1.zip was released. Go to the patch forum and read this thread (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?threadid=6589) . Perform all the patches dated after the release of that mod.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Pick another mod with a newer date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, now I have a little bit of an understanding that these patches actually are updates for all UIs.  Couldn't quite grasp that at first.</div></div><hr />
