<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">UsuRpeR</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just picked up Drakahs character select window. He advises to make UISKIN=name-of-folder-files-are-placed-in to have the new char. select window appear each time at login.<br />
<br />
I have edited and saved my eqclient file to define this but for some reason I only get the screen when logging out. I'm using sars at the moment, and even with sars' character select I would usually only get his char. select screen at logout only.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something here, something else to edit perhaps? Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Now I'm assuming that you put the files in your character's mod directory and edited EQCLIENT.INI. That is correct, however, the files in your character's mod are not loaded until you log in with that character. So when you log out, the new seletion screen is there. What you most likely need to do is create a separate folder in the UIFILES directory and just pick a name. I chose /uifiles/charselect. I placed the new seletion files in that that directory and also in my character's mod directory and it works every time. Of course, you would want to remember to change the EQCLIENT.INI to use the new folder as it's default skin. <br />

That should do it! Pardon me if I misunderstood your question.</div></div><hr />
