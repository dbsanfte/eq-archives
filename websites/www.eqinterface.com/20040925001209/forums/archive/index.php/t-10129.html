Any chance that soe or anyone will take notice anytime soon that the gamma in windowed mode is horribly dark to the point that even with ultravision you feel like a naked erud in game at night?<br />
<br />
I hope somone maybe can help on this maybe its just me but i have my sony 21 inch monitor up all the way on brightness and in game features maxed as wel still pathetically dark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Moved to the &quot;Wish List' forum as the folks from SOE that come here know that this forum is for specifically this sort of thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was fixed, but seems to be re-broken. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not having the problem, I run EQ inside EQW, the SOE window was supposed to be dark and choppy I thought.</div></div><hr />

Ever notice how dark screenshots turn out?<br />
Actually if you are in windowed mode you should be able to change the desktop gamma from the control panel. There are also quite a few programs out there that can preset settings like gamma when the game launches.<br />

I want to use my desktop gamma, and EQ keeps defaulting to eq gamma anytime i zone.  I think eq is too bright and i use my brightness to dim it down and add a hazy filter to the vibrance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crackmaster</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow Inok you brought up an old thread :D  I was going to say that without EQW I had the problem but once I switched to EQW I don't have that problem anymore.  I'm not sure if this problem still exists, though, as I haven't played without EQW in a long time.</div></div><hr />
