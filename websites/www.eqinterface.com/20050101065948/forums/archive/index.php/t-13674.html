On my home computer, it works and is great.  Love it.  But on my work computer, doing the same things as I did at home but extracting the files inte EQ UIfiles, it does not shop up on the toon when I go to load in the new UI's.  Please let me know how to handle this problem.  If at all possible, please email me at mel-hellman@verizon.net.<br />

Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

We need that information asked in that thread so people can help you quicker.<br />
<br />
Thanks, and good luck. :)<br />

Also as a friendly tip... It’s best not to post your email address on a busy public forum as there are bots that crawl active forums just to harvest new addresses for spam and once google caches this thread theres even a larger chance hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mores</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was able to solve my own problem buy looking into my UI folder and finding out that I had not expanded Warcraft download within the folder it's self.  So once I did that, I went back in game and found that it was there and ready to use.  It does look different that the one I have at home, but it doen's mastter, it works.  At home I have the 15 spell list running up and down, and on the computer here at my office it runs along the top.  ?????  Well I will work harder to see if I can change that at home.  The best news is that I do have working UI's now.</div></div><hr />

Glad you got it working =)</div></div><hr />
