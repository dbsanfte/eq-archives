It should work with all other mods.. but then should and does are not the same thing. Any comments are appreciated.<br />

&quot;Me? No.. i was somewhere else.. really.&quot;<br />
<br />
EDIT: I forgot to mention the spell icons are not included they are a WC3 set i started making then finished off with some from Raxthorne's set since he found more graphics than i did. I'd have to ask his permission to release them since half of them are his.. i just havn't done so yet. :D</div></div><hr />

I'm trying to keep the feel the same, i do have a mouse done which was quite easy, and i'm working on a nice target window that i think fits well.<br />
And if you can think of something good post it, that way we can all share it.. that's what i think anyhow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ReallyLongTypist</div><div class="date">10-14-2002, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any way you could, say, darken the red color to more of a maroon, or rust type red? Just to keep it in line with the motif? And maybe darken the 'empty' white to a different color... maybe a coal grey or so...<br />
<br />
Dunno how to express it... it looks good, but the red with the white and the blue seems to make it look a little off to me...<br />
<br />
Anyone else see it too, or am I just color blind? (which is a distinct possibility.)<br />
<br />
I definately like the plan though... and I love the circular border :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
for the player info window take a bubble like you have for your target window and make the bottom half a mana bubble and then in the middle put a &quot;cover&quot; over most of the bubble so that you have a place for hp 2342/3433 and percent and then just mana percent but make sure that the &quot;cover&quot; covers all but a thin strip on the outer edge of the bubble so that it gives the illusion of a curved bar...not sure if that was clear enough describing what I meant...I may just have to go make one in correl to show you what I mean....LOL...<br />

Not at all, i'm doing the inventory at the moment, and have finished most of the actual graphics, but i'm trying to decide on a final layout and that's not as easy as it sounds.<br />
<br />
&lt;MJB2K&gt;<br />
&quot;The world is my oyster! ...now if i could just find that darn pearl..&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The stat window could be slimmer... maybe a bit less black space by making the stats 'hug' the inventory circle..  Its not that big for me but then again I play at 1280-x1024 on a 19&quot; monitor.</div></div><hr />
