Most of this mod is NOT my work other than the cut/paste of a TON of code and a few little touches here and there.  I would like to thank and credit the following individuals for the use of their mods/skins:<br />
<br />
Compass skin:  Lythander  <br />
Spell icons, gem icons, spell book graphics, note window graphics, cast bar graphics, casting orb graphics:  Made by Tking!  This man is AMAZING!<br />
<br />
Mods for all of the above mendioned with Tking art and for the animated pointer and the EXCELLENT Readme files which included much of the animations code I used:  Remelio<br />
<br />
For the note window mod:  Siryl<br />
<br />
For all the rest of the xml mods:  Vertebrae and Sokol<br />
<br />
For the BEST Vert skin ever made in my opinion NEXIUM:  Kudane<br />
<br />
I would also like to thank all the people out there who have shared their creations with the public.  You have added much enjoyment to my EQ experience.  *HUGS*  Twylight<br />
<br />
The screen rez I'm using is 1024x768 and I've included my UICharactername_00.ini in the zip.  <br />
<br />
You can find this file in the Mix n Match section of downloads at the main site.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klingk</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just want to start out by saying I absolutly love this UI. I do however have a problem. I'm sure it's not a bug with the GUI, but something I'm doing wrong. For whatever reason I can not get the Ragebringer pointer. Instead it keeps defaulting to the Shaman Epic pointer. I've repeatedly tried replacing the current mouse.tga with the mouse.tga-ragebringer many times, but it has been unsuccessfull.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a suggestion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Makora</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to rename it to just mouse.tga<br />
<br />
I copy the original mouse.tge-ragebringer file included with the mod to another directory, then rename, then copy over the mouse.tga in your uifiles mod directory.<br />
<br />
Hope that made sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twylight</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Ragebringer pointer may not work with this mod as is because I edited the cursor code to include animation changes for the shaman epic animated pointer which Remelio released.  You need to edit it out and put in the original code that vert had for his pointer.   The original code is: <br />
<br />
<br />
	&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DefaultCursor&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
		&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
			&lt;Texture&gt;mouse.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
			&lt;Location&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;Size&gt;<br />
				&lt;CX&gt;32&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
				&lt;CY&gt;32&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;4&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;3&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
			&lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;  <br />
<br />
If you have problems switching out the code feel free to contact me and I will set you up with an animations file that will work for the Ragebringer pointer.</div></div><hr />

Keep up the good work.<br />

<br />
To go back to full screen mode you need to reset your viewport.  Depending on what screen rez you're using  you need to type the following:  /viewport 0 0 1024 768<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are using a different screen rez change the last two numbers to the resolution you are using.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am also recieving several requests to be able to use either the regular mouse pointer or the ragebringer pointer instead of the one that is included.  If you will send me a pm with your email address I will forward the corrected animations file for the cursor of your choice and the appropriate graphics file.  Again thank you for your nice comments and your interest in my setup:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twylight</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to let everyone know I just uploaded the updated UI to the Mix &amp; Match section.  Hopefully it will be available soon!:)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*NOTE*  This update does not seem to be showing up in the Mix &amp; Match section so until it does just click on the Twylight's Mods link under my name at the left to get the updated files.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for a great skin bud and the quick fix!  Playing non-Vert style eq just wasn't any fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you perhaps post your awesome mod with the new stuff for post POP patch? <br />
<br />
A dedicated lover of your mod!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheVlad</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like your mod a lot Twil. Use it in all my chars. :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ntreri</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was delighted to still see the skin still working post patch, but unfortunately it doesn't currently seem compatible with the raid window....when i tried to incorporate the fixes proposed on the main page for the EQUI and Animations files, also copied in the two new Raid.tga's, it would no longer load the skin.  Anyone know how to fix this so i can see the raid window??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twylight</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all and thanks for the kind words!:)  Updated files have been posted!  I apologize to everyone as I thought I did this last night.  Hopefully Dolby or Kudane will approve soon:)  *HUGS*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solipsis</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which changes were made to make the raid thingy work?<br />
I think it might be easier for me to make those changes than to re-install and redo the changes I had, so if it's not too complicated, I'd love to know.<br />
<br />
(Gonna download your new version and compare to see if I can figure out what changes to do, and if I can figure it out I'll post it here for others)<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twylight</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a quick note to those using this mod!  As of the 10/25/2002 patch you may be getting an incompatibility error.  For now to fix this delete the Bazaarsearch window from the custom UI folder.  I'm not going to patch again until something major happens because of all the changing going on and this will fix your problem!</div></div><hr />
