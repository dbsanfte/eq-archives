<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">insomnlac</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what gives? i want to add a new window, what did i do wrong?<br />
<br />
filename: EQUI_moneyWnd.xml<br />
<br />
i've added &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_moneyWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt; to EQUI.xml file and all the stuff for a window is in the xml file cause i copied it from a working window...<br />
<br />
this seems to be all verant does, so why doesn't it work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pini Uldar</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually think there's some hard coding involved on their part. For example, it's hard coded that screens like PlayerWindow are visible at start and the keyboard function alt-p is coded to toggle visible invisible.<br />
<br />
With new windows, this hard coding doesn't exist so it's never made visible. And you don't have a way to add a keyboard function to cause it to be visible that I know of.<br />
<br />
When I wanted to add a new window, I just usurped the FriendsWindows. This window is hardcoded to alt-F but I can remap it with the Options-&gt;Keyboard mappings. So when I split my inventory into player info and inventory, I put the player info into the FriendsWindow (EQUI_FriendsWindow) and then mapped Toggle Friends Window in the Options-&gt;Keyboard to be P. Now I hit P and my player info window opens.<br />
<br />
I believe at this point the only way to get &quot;new&quot; windows is to usurp existing windows and remap their hard coded keyboard mappings to make them useful.<br />

I thought maybe since all of the other windows are also referenced in the character's associated ini file... that if I called it there and set it's values that it would show up.<br />
<br />
Not so. I did several tests. Changed up a few things, and still no dice.<br />
<br />
So much for that map window huh?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">psychogears</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can make your own windows, but they won't function at all. Window functionality is hard-coded into the client. the interface is moddable, but no windows can be removed or added since you'd need to be able to reference that from the exe. There's no xml file that defines available windows to the game.<br />
