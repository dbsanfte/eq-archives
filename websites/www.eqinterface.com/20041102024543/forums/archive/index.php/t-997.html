<br />
<br />
Extras:<br />
- Optional WIS and INT caster player info windows are in extras. <br />
Just rename them to EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml and overwrite in the main directory.<br />
- Regular mouse cursor by default. For Ragebringer mouse pointer just rename the<br />
file in extras to mouse.tga and overwrite in the main directory.<br />
<br />
<br />
read the README.TXT file, it will explain how to do it..<br />

<br />
BUT if you copy the EQUI_hotbuttons.xml From your default folder to the Vert folder it will use the default hot buttons instead of the ones seen here.<br />
<br />
I am sure Vertebrae will be working on some interchangeble pieces as he goes along..<br />
<br />
I have also found that any XML changes will use these graphics if put in the Vert Folder..<br />
<br />
experiment at your leasure and find what works..<br />

The *.tga files are what tells the mod what you want the graphics and the colors to look like.  The info in the *.xml files simply tells the mod where to find the graphics / colors within the *.tga files.  But since, in this case it will be looking for something that's universal to the whole mod, there should be no chance of that belonging to any particular *.xml file you'd want to over-write.  <br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
INVENTORY:<br />
<br />
Rearranged the order of the resists on the Inventory Page to an order that I just liked better (MR, CR, FR, PR, DR).<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
PLAYERWINDOW:<br />
<br />
Added a Stamina Percentage to the Player Window.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
HOTBOX:<br />
<br />
Changed the Hotbox to use different slots, they are as follows now:<br />
<br />
Ear (for Shrunken Goblin Earring)<br />
Bracer (for Cobalt Bracer/See Invis Bracer)<br />
Ring (for Coldain Ring)<br />
BP (for Healing)<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Flipped the Melee Slot order around to:<br />
PRIMARY  SECONDARY<br />
  RANGE      AMMO<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Rearranged the resists on the hotbox to match the order I put on the Inventory (MR, CR, FR, PR, DR)<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Changed some of the Inventory Slots around to suit my own order better (for clicking my AoN and Jboots and opening which bags I need for switching armor items &amp; weapons.<br />
<br />
:D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D <br />

<br />
Also, what is the slightly pink/peach bar that is just below the red HP bar of the target window? Can't figure it out.<br />
<br />
BTW, awesome skin. Just need to put a spellbook icon in there now. Maybe I'll just use /book 1 though.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

the titlebar style is mispelled as so:<br />
  &lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;flase&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;<br />
<br />
eq doesn't choke on it but my editor sure did =p<br />
<br />
Also the &lt;?xml&gt; declaration should be the first item always. No returns, no spaces, no comments or anything should be above it, since quite a few parsers will choke on that, though once again not eq. <br />
<br />
But these are minor nitpicks, the skin itself is easily one of the best out there, if not the best I have seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also this skin is so great! For those few minutes after the patch this morning I was lost without it! I just haaave to know how much mana I have, down to the exact percent!<br />
<br />
So today I decided to play with all the great ideas that were posted and I made this player window. I don't know xml so this is really just a lot of cut and paste of other great ideas. (with some playing with locs of things) But I think its pretty cool and I thought I would share it... and maybe ask a question since this is a vert thread.<br />
<br />
1. This seems to be referencing a 'fatigueimage' area that is located right under the 'M' for mana in the tga file. But when I opened up the window_pieces06.tga in photoshop I didn't see anything in that spot of the graphic. <br />
Now I haven't figured out how to edit tga's yet, but if anyone wants to make an S (for stamina) or and F (for fatigue) in the .tga file... then the stamina bar could have a little S or F next to it, and all would be right with the world.<br />
<br />
I've probably explained that pretty poorly, so  just ignore it if it doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
Anyway here's a little screenshot of my player window. If anyone wants to try it out you can download it too.<br />

I made the change in my ui and now it has a pet bar and looks fabulous.<br />
<br />
Also it is is perfect now because of that great tga fix (there's an adorable little S next to the stamina bar..thanks!)<br />
<br />
anyway here is my player window xml, but its different than the ones that came with the original ui, so probably just copy that code into whichever you're xml using, over the pet section.</div></div><hr />

I could really use some help :(  Vert has to know.. he put it there in the first place.  Also.  I changed the TGA file of Window Pieces 1 so the notches on the hp/mana/sta/grouphealth bars would have 3 in each bubble instead of only 3 in the first one, but that didnt work either.  I dont know..

I have not looked at the XML yet for this mod, but to change the earring slot to the chestplate slot, all you should have to do is replace the EQType for earring with the chestplate.<br />
<br />
Chestplate = &lt;EQType&gt;17&lt;/EQType&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Thank you all for the enthusiasm. It really makes me want to keep tinkering with it, an enhance it further.<br />
<br />
  However, please do not email me requesting to change things like increase the font, or change so and so position, add this and that label etc. <br />
<br />
  This is a mod which i built for my own needs. I am constantly changing it to suit whatever needs I have. I like sharing this mod with you the public, and mainly the modding community. It's really up to the skinners or modders out there to hack and slash it fer thier own needs.<br />
<br />
  I'll try to answer peoples questions thru the board. and thru the boards PM. But really, use this mod in yur discretion. Thoa remember, there are people out there who can explain things better than I can, and honestly, I really don't like playing tech-support.<br />
<br />
So once again, thanks fer all the nice comments and especially, sharing those awsome modded vert_ui's.</div></div><hr />

I've integrated (most) of Vert's graphics into my XML mod set.  I am using the default buff background and spellbook background graphics (or a compatible set of spellbook graphics).  I also don't use any of his Warcraft 3 icons.  I don't have a screenshot of the results up yet, but, so far, its was a seamless integration.  Its actually pretty easy to do it for most any xml set, since his graphics are almost all compatible with the original graphics.  <br />
<br />
What I have available, at the link below, is a zipfile with all you need to recreate my work with my own UI set or with someone else's (If you do it with someone else's XML files, you may need to edit the EQUI_Animations.xml file some.).<br />

sounds like you have a older version of another mod roaming around...<br />
<br />
check these two files<br />
<br />
EQClient.ini (as you mentioned you have )<br />
<br />
UISkin=Vert<br />
<br />
check<br />
UI_&lt;charactername&gt;_&lt;##&gt;.ini (this varies for me is UI_Kudane_91.ini) <br />
<br />
UISkin=Vert<br />
<br />
<br />
most likely your UI_Character_##.ini file is pointing to a folder that has bad files in it.. or not pointing to a folder that exsist.. had 4 different emails with this exact problem last night..<br />
<br />
they were all checking &lt;name&gt;_##.ini not the &quot;UI_&quot; version<br />
<br />
See if that helps<br />

<br />
ok I gave it a shot... its something I wanted too, but the player window is kinda full as it is, so I didn't really know where to put it. <br />
Plus I think it would be kinda neat if it was a blank bar that was always there and would just fill (and empty) when you cast a spell... BUT I don't know how to do that. (If anyone does, please post! :) )<br />
<br />
So this is what I came up with. Basically it just looks like the other player window I had, but a little purple bar comes up when you cast.  It's kinda ghetto, and I'm not using it, but just to see if it was possible, i made this:<br />

Instead, it deletes the buff icons and all you're left with is the name of the buffs. this happens a lot. If you try to make the player window transparent, it removes the icons for attack, ac, etc, and just leaves the numbers.  Same thing with the hotbox window, only to a much large extenct. Trying to make the hotbox window should get rid of the bacground, and leave just the buttons.  Instead it removes the entire buttons and just leaves the text.  <br />
<br />
Also, for the caster UI, it would really be great, if you could stop the box right after the AAXp, since casters don't much care about AC and atk.  That's just wasted space.<br />

For the grouping window, remove the invite and disband buttons.  THis would free up a lot of space, and I don't know many people who use them anyway.  ctrl i and d is so much easier.<br />

I noticed also that if you make the buff box equal 0 when they fade that it makes the buff icons disappear.  I am a warrior so I don't know about the spell icons... but my fix for the buff icons is to make the Fade=0 and the Normal=90 (or whatever you want it to be) and that way it makes the border fade out but leaves the icons and text and such viewable (it kinda seems to work different than most boxes).  Just my 2 cp. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like to get some help if possible on making two slight modifications. The W3 icons for resists and stats are nice but I'd rather make better use of that space for viewing my stats so what I'm looking for is the following:<br />
<br />
1) Modify the player window bar underneath the AA XP bar by removing the icons for Str, AC and Atk and rearranging things to include the following (text only):<br />
<br />
Str: xxx      Wis: xxx      HP: xxxx / xxxx<br />
Sta: xxx      Int: xxx       AC: xxxx<br />
Agi: xxx      Cha: xxx     Atk: xxxx <br />
Dex: xxx<br />
<br />
2) Remove the icons for resists and simply put PR, MR, DR, FR and CR in their places. Someone may have already done this one but can't remember if they still used the icons as well.<br />
<br />
That's really it. I can live with the resists one but the first change would really be a big help since it enables you to see all your stats, which I like.<br />
<br />
Again, looking for some help on how to do this. I don't really know XML at all but would appreciate any help. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

I went back and looked at some of the previous posts in this thread one more time and noticed that you basically have already done both of the changes I'm looking for, just in a slightly different implementation. How difficult do you think it would be to reswizzle them like I described above?<br />
<br />
Also, if space is too much of a constraint for all 7 stats in the player window, then just Str, Sta, Agi and Dex would be fine since I primarily play pure melee characters anyway.<br />
<br />
Lastly, is there any place to add weight to this mod like you did in one of your modifications for someone else?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Thanks a bunch for the help. I'm hoping that your changes used in conjunction with the original XML file will help me better understand how to manipulate this code myself in the future. That way I can tinker with it without troubling other folks like yourself and can also protect myself in case Verant decides to patch the Player_Wnd file in the future. Ack! :p</div></div><hr />

Love what you did but I agree with you in that it's a little too large. I'd like to keep it as close to the same size as the standard Vert player window as possible.<br />
<br />
How 'bout this? Using your new mod as the reference, move Agi and Dex to where Wis and Int are and just drop Wis, Int and Cha altogether. Also drop Lvl and all the resists too as I'm just gonna use the standard Vert resists with icons and be happy about it. :) As for the HPs, they do run over with 4 digits so I'm thinking maybe we put current and max on the same line as the weight. In my head, it would something like this:<br />
<br />
Str str#   Agi agi#   AC ac#<br />
Sta sta#   Dex dex#   ATK atk#<br />
Wt currentwt/maxwt     HP currenthp/maxhp<br />
<br />
If the width on that last line is still a problem, how bout just putting currentwt/maxwt and currenthp/maxhp and just leaving off the labels for both?<br />
<br />
Once again, thanks again for your work on this. I'm slowly getting a grasp on it but the key word is &quot;slowly&quot;. :(<br />

But in defence of the casters, people who want the T. King Spellbar might be disapointed.  or maybe its just me.  I for one cant get it to run.  It keeps telling me that it cant load the skin so it reverts to the default.  I have narrowed it down to the spellbar, it works fine without it.  Interesting stuff.  I think its a conflict with the spell gem look in window pieces and the custom one T.King made...</div></div><hr />

<br />
i did notice a couple things that need to be 'fixed' though.<br />
<br />
1) The spell book needs to be a wee bit larger, hard to see those small icons.<br />
<br />
2) Once you minimise the spell book, its next to impossible to maximise it again, forceing me to camp out then log back in to get it back to size!<br />
<br />
3) the Hot Box on the lower left that has the saves on it and what not....the first 4 boxes show what you have in your inventory (bags, spells, food, ect) on the left side and the other 4 boxes (the right side) show items i have equipt! we should see all 8 inventory boxes yes?<br />

I took the work that you did and gave it a shot myself. For the most part, the only parts I modified were inside the area you marked as &quot;Sokol's stat mod begins/ends here&quot; using cut and paste with the stats I wanted and aligned them accordingly. I removed the other stats and resists that I didn't want from this area but not sure if I was supposed to do that or not. I also marked out some of the corresponding code for these stats/resists at the end of the file but again, not sure if I was supposed to. Made sense to me though. :p<br />
<br />
Needless to say, the mod failed to load properly. I can't figure out what I did wrong so was hoping you or someone else could take a look at it and proof it for me. If nothing else, it should give a pretty accurate blueprint of exactly what I need. Attached is the zipped XML file. <br />

I am a novice in the ways of XML and i do not want to mess up the game so here are my 'Caster' requests heh:<br />
<br />
1) Make it show only 8 bags/items and no inventory slots in the lower left 'hot box'.<br />
<br />
2) Make the Spell book bigger, say 1 1/2 times the size it is now<br />
<br />
3) Make the Spell Book have the ability to minimumize and maximumize with ease like the other boxes.<br />
<br />
thats it as far as i can tell, everything else is prrrrrrfect heh. ;)<br />

Can you make an easier way to close the invertory? Like adding a &quot;Done&quot; buttom somewhere there.<br />
<br />
Also I am a caster and would like 8 bags instead of 4 inventory slots.<br />
<br />
Make the spellbook just a bit bigger. <br />

As of everything else. Nice job with this mob :)</div></div><hr />

I've been doing alot of mods for people.<br />
<br />
Stamina is already there, look at page 7 here, and look at my moded PW. If you do not like that, I THINK the playerwindow.rog.xml is an all melee version of verts window....<br />
<br />
Ok, now for tracking stuff..<br />
<br />
when you remove stuff, or coment it out you have to check the Screen section and remove the pieces that corelate to what you have taken out.. IE you take out the done button, you MUST remove the reference to it in the screen/pieces section or it will crash.<br />
<br />
Like wise when you add something you must put it there to &quot;initialize&quot; it.<br />
<br />
Also having suplicate names ie SW_castgauge referenced in 2 files will make a duplicate entry and cause your mod to crash.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, if not post a list of tracking menu changes you whant done, and I'll work on it when time permits. Which so far has been alot..<br />

It would also be good to see the inventory increased in size a tad. Other than that, this mod rocks. <br />
<br />
Running at 1024x768 just is to small to try and run this UI in for anything other than one chat box. But i like to divert the battle spam to other boxes so I can read what ppl are saying. So I have to run in the higher resolution so I can have more boxes to divert the battle spam to.<br />
