<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reed</div><div class="date">09-11-2002, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Edit: Alpha 2 is below... Don't download this one ;)<br />
<br />
Attached is a .zip file that contains what you need to build (yes, build) a custom bardsong spreadsheet.<br />
<br />
If you're familiar with my spreadsheet, then basically, you just enter values into it, save it as a .CSV file.  Then copy my feedback XML file to your custom directory.  Then run the program which will insert the code into the XML file.  Then you have your own personalized version of the spreadsheet.<br />
<br />
You need Microsoft Excel to use this.  (Sorry those who don't have it).<br />
<br />
It's preliminary, so let me know what you think, etc.<br />
<br />
Here is the documentation:<br />
<br />
Installation<br />
============<br />
<br />
1) Setup the XML File<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
Copy the &quot;EQUI_FeedbackWnd.xml&quot; to your custom UI directory.  Note that the <br />
feedback window is still fully operational!  I've just added some new stuff to <br />
it.<br />
 <br />
2) Generate a Bardsong CSV File<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Run the spreadsheet () in Excel.  Enter your level, instruments, etc.  Get it to <br />
how you want it to look.  Spreadsheet release 3.19 (and above) should work.  <br />
When you're done saving, save it before going onto the next step.<br />
<br />
Make sure you are viewing the first page/tab (the page you can enter your level)<br />
<br />
Do a &quot;File-&gt;Save As&quot;.<br />
<br />
For &quot;Save as Type&quot;, select &quot;CSV (Comma delimited)(*.csv)&quot;.  This is very <br />
important!<br />
<br />
Press the &quot;Save&quot; button to save the file as a .csv file.  It will warn you that <br />
it can only save one page; Click &quot;OK&quot;.  (If you want to exit at this point, like <br />
I do, click on &quot;No&quot; on the next prompt.) <br />
<br />
3) Run the Program<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
Enter the name of the .csv file into the first line (or use the &quot;...&quot; button to <br />
select it.<br />
<br />
Enter the name and path of the EQUI_FeedbackWnd.xml file in the 2nd line (or use <br />
the &quot;...&quot; button to select it.<br />
<br />
Press the &quot;Build XML File&quot; to create the EQUI_FeedbackWnd.xml file.  Note that <br />
this will read the .csv file, and modify the .xml file.<br />
<br />
To display the window run EQ and type in &quot;/feedback&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Customization (Putting the tab somewhere else)<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
When the program runs, it looks for two lines: <br />
   &lt;!-- ReedInsertPoint:Start:Bardsong_Root --&gt;<br />
   &lt;!-- ReedInsertPoint:Stop:Bardsong_Root --&gt;<br />
<br />
The program code replaces everything between those two lines.  You can move <br />
those two lines to any XML file, run the program, select the new XML file, and <br />
the code will be placed there.<br />
<br />
The tab name of the spreadsheet is called Bardsong_RootTab_0.  So you can add a <br />
<br />
    &lt;Pages&gt;Bardsong_RootTab_0&lt;/Pages&gt;<br />
<br />
as a page to any TabBox.<br />
<br />
(I've never actually tried it... Someone tell me if it works ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Future Work<br />
===========<br />
It's a little messy to read.  In the near term I want to put lines in to <br />
separate out the cells.  Also, I'd like to put in the &quot;Song Details&quot; spreadsheet <br />
work as well.  In the long run, I'd like to get rid of the Excel file and have <br />
the numbers be program generated (I don't know when I'll get to doing that <br />
though).  Also, I'm always open to advice and new ideas.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reed</div><div class="date">09-13-2002, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm many are reporting the crashings.  I just ran it on Windowx XP and Windows 2000 just fine.  *sigh*.<br />
<br />
Can you please check one thing for me...<br />
<br />
Open the .csv file with Notepad (not Excell!).  Make sure it looks like a csv file.  It will be human readable, basically the text separated by comma's.  It should have no garbage in it.  Another hint is that the csv file is about 9k, while the excell spreadsheet is over 100k. (When you save to .csv, things get complicated when you try to save and exit.)<br />
<br />
If it's definately a proper CSV file, then it's back to the drawing board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, try this (not using MFC DLL's but compling them in).  I'm not that hopeful that it will work, but trying out the obvious first.<br />
<br />
If you're having problems, please try the attached program.  (It's just the executable.)<br />
<br />
Also, if that works, please let me know :)<br />
<br />
If it doesn't work, can you please post (attach) the .csv file you're using?  (I'd like to try running that)<br />
<br />
Thanks all for the help.  Crashing = bad :(<br />

Edit: Warning: Don't use this... there's a later version below!</div></div><hr />

<br />
ahh i think this works i was having the same problem that it keep on crashing out. I got it to go thru i think but will have to run the game to make shure.<br />
<br />
K go into your EQ directory and go into your uifiles folder and pick the ui you are going to modify and the find the fold. and then in the folder selct the EQUI_feedbackWnd.xml file and then build away. will post back on if it works or not<br />

When I put my true level (57) in the Excel spreadsheet I get errors creating the XML file.<br />

When I set my level to 60 in the Excel spreadsheet it works great!<br />

Not sure if that points ya in the right direction to correct the problem but hope it helps.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reed</div><div class="date">09-16-2002, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bug found and fixed (hopefully)<br />
<br />
That CSV crashes my program too.<br />
<br />
Meaning, it gave me the ability to track it down and fix it.<br />
<br />
New version attached (just the executable).  See if that works.  If it fixes it, please let me know, and I'll put together a new &quot;Alpha&quot; release with all filse.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!<br />
<br />
Details for the curious:<br />
<br />
(Turns out there were two problems: It would only work for a level 60 bard, and for some reason this version used a single quote, not a double quote for text in fields.  Also fixed the problem that actually caused the crash)<br />
<br />
Edit: Warning: Don't use this... there's a later version below!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thielak</div><div class="date">09-16-2002, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woohoo! It worked!<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton Reed. :nana:<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Well, it generated the XML file just fine.  But when I go to look at it in the game, it's blank.  I followed your instructions in the txt file.  Tried reloading the mods, but it's nothing buy a big blank feedback window.<br />
<br />
Here's a screen, resized to 800*600 for file size reasons.</div></div><hr />

The latest .exe worked wonderfully for me, and I am happy to report that all looked good in-game too.  This is easily one of the coolest things I've seen done with the .xml files, and it will be of immeasurable assistance to my bard.<br />
<br />
So, thanks!</div></div><hr />

I downloaded it to see if I could adapt it and make 3 new spell mods for  Druid, Cleric and Necro spells and found that I&quot;m not smart enough to do it lol.  Really wonderful work here.  Ok these two get the banana.   :nana:<br />
<br />
If it wouldn't offend the creators I'd love to help enter data on other casters and help create more of these if I knew how.  I just don't know how to work formulas on the spreadsheet, data entry I can handle.  I'd like to combine Reed's design with Ogular's use of the Help window if possible since the help is obtainable through a click instead of a /feedback.  <br />

I don't know enough xml to to tell one end from the other, but the result is awesome.  More importantly, that spreadsheet work is something else!  VERY nice job on that.<br />
<br />
I'm going to play with modifying the spreadsheet to show Winter's druid info... I am thinking that I can 'trick' the program into using the data I give it... basically replacing the main sheet's data and formulae with raw (no formulae) data about druid spells.  Then, when the program calls the sheet to make it into an xml file, it will have no idea that the contents are different, it will just show what it thinks is right.  Right? This should display the right sort of result for her, but it will be wasting the full capabilities of the workbook.  No matter what, though, I will certainly leave in the author's tag... no way I'm takin credit for that sheet.<br />

You might want to add the fixed generator to your zip or edit your message to point to the new generator zip file.  But now it seems to be working fine.  Very nice and handy program! :)</div></div><hr />
