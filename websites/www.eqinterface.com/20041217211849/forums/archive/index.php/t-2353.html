I wanted to see what others people thought on a wider spectrum on this question I have listed below.<br />
<br />
I am about to buy a new motherboard and CPU from Pricewatch.com.  My question is their that big of a drop off in performance between:<br />
Pentium 4 2gig for 189<br />
Pentium 4 1.9 for 186<br />
Pentium 4 1.8 for 172<br />
Pentium 4 1.7 for 158<br />
<br />
You see I only have about 215 dollars to spend and my current computer only has a 32mb pci Nvidia Video Card not the Geforce.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of getting like the 1.7 or 1.8 Pentium 4 and then get a GeForce 4 agp like 64 megabyte with the rest of the money? Or should I go with the 2gig Pentium 4 and continue using my 32mb PCI video card?<br />
<br />
Is Pentium 4 the better way to go then any of the Athlons?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I myself have a P4 1.5 and it runs very well, no problems what-so-ever. My friend has an Athlon 1.3, which seems to run a little bit smoother, but not by much. AND make sure if you by a P4, DO NOT use RDRAM, use the DDR SDRAM, it costs much less. RDRAM was a mistake on my part.<br />
<br />
The ammount of RAM can greatly increase the performance of your CPU.<br />
<br />
You might want to ask around, because your current video card my bottleneck your system. I doubt it will, but its always a possibility.</div></div><hr />

This is because the processor will be able to utilize the output of the videocard. Its alwase best to get the 2gig then the 1.7gig. Pen vs Athalon it a hard subject because it matters on what your going to do. I sugest you search online for webpage reviews on the chips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Novawulf</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am running 2 computers on EQ  <br />
Comp 1 Is a P4 1.7 with 512 ddr ram with a 64MB SDRAM Radeon<br />
Comp 2 is a AMD Athlon 1G with 640 SDRAM with 32MB DDR Radeon<br />
<br />
<br />
Both are actually very comparable in loading times and actual game speed.   actually in some zone my AMD loads faster then my Intel :eek: <br />
<br />
I think the total ram you can put into your machine helps a lot.  Huge Processor and little ram still = a slow computer ;) <br />
<br />
Hope this helps some</div></div><hr />

Nope! Sorry to break it to you but that's simply not true!<br />
You won't see much of an improvement running EQ on a 1.5 GHz or 2.0 GHz processor while using the same graphics accelerator and same amount of RAM....to be honest, you won't see ANY improvement at all.<br />
On the other hand, using a 1.5 GHz processor with a GeForce 2 and 256 MB of RAM going to either a GeForce 4 or 512 MB of RAM (or even both) you will see a HUGE improvement!!!<br />
This is because the pure main processor calculations aren't really a big thing to your puter while calculating the huge graphics data of the meanwhile far outdated graphics engine EQ utilizes are. And the faster the GPU gets those through the faster your system will perform.<br />
RAM is playing a rather big role on that one, too, because the graphics data is stored there to pass it through from the CPU to the GPU while the GPU's memory is still busy, and additionally the bus frequency your RAM data bus is running on is kinda important too, just as the speed of your mobo's AGP slot is...but that's all got nothing to do with the CPU but more with your motherboard.<br />
<br />
On another note, I'm a convinced AMD user, since the Athlons serve you the same power a comparable Pentium does for roughly a little more than half the price (at least in germany). But that's personal preference I guess and a question of how slim your wallet is...<br />
<br />
I personally would go with a Athlon XP 1700+ and invest what's left in a GeForce 4 Ti 4200 (or 4600 if you got enough left for that) and if there's STILL more than dust and cobwebs in your wallet invest in RAM till you got at least 512 MB (I wish I could upgrade to 1 GB of RAM but, well....you know, dust and cobwebs and such....)<br />
<br />
This is just my opinion though, what do I know about 'puters...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ronindf</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Far as it goes, my input here is only from my findings running AMD driven system. <br />
<br />
<br />
Setup:<br />
<br />
AMD Athlon XP 2100+<br />
ASUS A7V333 Motherboard with raid Controler card<br />
3gig 333mhz Bus Ram 3x 1gig<br />
Asus TI 64mb GeForce3 <br />
Western Digital 80gig HD's x2<br />
Soundblaster Extigy <br />
<br />
<br />
Running what I run most Pentium systems can't keep up with me. Have not been able to Benchmark close to this setup with a P4-2ghz yet, even with lowering ram in my system to only 1gig.<br />
<br />
Thing is Geforce cards use thier onboard GPU to process all the graphics data all the systems CPU has to do then is pipeline in more code for the card to process. This makes system clock charing much more fluid and takes less cycles to route across your main board. Plus running Windows XP and its Allocation abilities to give more priority to programs rathen then windows, allows faster performance in games like Everquest. Best thing I can say is pick the best line of products you have funds available for. Don't settle for off brand items when your building systems either. Stick with Asus or other reputable Motherboard manufactures for your manboard, and make sure you get 333Bus rate if at all possible if not atleast get 266bus. NVidia chipset cards are the cutting edge of graphics cards also, so best bet is a geforce line card. 64mb or 128mb with AGP 4x-pro or better.<br />
<br />
Raid controlers are not a big deal, they just help with data control for managment of backup data. I have a ton of graphics I use in other applications and I can't afford to loose it thus the Raid helps with insurance and speed of getting system going mainly.<br />
<br />
<br />
hope this little info sheds some light.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rallaiel</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just gone from a p3 733 with 512mb ram to a p4 2ghz with 512 megs of the old Rambus... HUGE HUGE HUGE improvement.  Increased my resolution, color depth in game and detail level to high.  Now.. of course I added a new mobo with the processor..same vid card though.. DeForce 3 with 64mb of ram on the card.   <br />
<br />
I did read that Everquest has embedded code specific for the P4 processor to add to gaming enjoyment with EQ.... I have no idea if they did this with Athlon XPs..but almost feel certain that they did.<br />
<br />
HOnestly.... you really can't go wrong with an AMD or an Intel.. both are good quality.  My suggestion is for AMD's Hammer architecture to hit in Q4 of this year and scoop up an XP processor at rock bottom prices!</div></div><hr />

<br />
System running smoothly in 1280x1024, except for Luclin, up there graphics get a bit laggy from time to time which prolly gotta do with the GeForce 2 (gotta update to a GeForce 4 Ti as soon as I got the cash)...<br />
Or the reason might be that I refuse to set my clip plane down from max and that I got all my details set to max...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xguix</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently upgraded from a P3 600Mhz CPU w/384 MB PC100 SDRAM, GeForce2 GTS (32MB) video card and a crappy SoundBlaster AWE32 Gold on a Win98SE with Detonator3 drivers and DirectX8.1<br />
<br />
The game ran ok at 1024x768 in Old world/Kunark, would start to chug noticeably in Velious (I had to lower the clipping pane and turn off spell effects) and I couldn't even think about going to Luclin.  Zone loading times ranged from 30 to 40 seconds, sometimes longer.<br />
<br />
Here's my new rig:<br />
My Motherboard (http://usa.asus.com/mb/socket478/p4b533/overview.htm) <br />
My CPU (http://www.buymstar.com/detailsCPU.asp?pid=637) <br />
My Video Card (http://www.gainward.com/c-1.html?id=41) (64MB model)<br />
My HardDrive (http://www.westerndigital.com/products/current/retailkits/wd600bbrtl.asp) <br />
512 MB of PC2100 (http://www.portatech.com/page28.html) DDR SDRAM<br />
Good ole SoundBlaster AWE32 Gold (so ancient that I can't even find a link anymore :p)<br />
WinXP (SP1) with Latest (40.41) (http://www.3dchipset.com/drivers/official/nvidia/4xx/nt5/index.shtml) video drivers from Nvidia.<br />
<br />
I now run EQ at 1280x1024 with all the video/graphic options jacked up to the max, with all new models turned on (except Barbarians 'cause I absolutely hate their new look).  Zone loading time varries from 5 to 20 seconds.  Even the Luclin zones run fine without any video chugging.  The only place I have to drop the clip pane all the way down is Bazaar :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
What did it for me?  Everything.  Starting from the video card update, of course.  I actually got the GeForce4 TI4200 before other parts came in, so I stuck it in the old machine, but noticed only slight performance boost.  More RAM, new CPU and MoBo all working together is what will gain the most kick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree with this statement... any high end mobo and going to another high end, you wont see that much of an improvement. The only time you will see any improvements is if you are going from a mid-level system to a high level... or if you had an old gen video card and jumped to a GF4...<br />
<br />
Even some high ends of 2G dont perform any better than some 1.4G's! Its amazing, but its all based on your FSB and few other components. But a good place to find info on the works of a good gaming platform would be www.pcgamer.com. They do some good work with testing different specs on systems to find the best all around or the best all around for an affordable price. Try it out and see what they have to show. I myself have upgraded to an Athlon XP from my Athlon 1.3 and have noticed some improvement in speed but as for graphics... yes (only because I went up to a GF4 from a GF2). But the GF2 still does it work very effectively! Just me 2 pence!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conen</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just bought my wife a new setup.<br />
<br />
 She had a Pent 2 266 Gateway with 512 Ram<br />
<br />
 She now has a Pent 4 2 gig 533 processor. At first she only had 256 DDR ram then I went out and got her another 512. She is still useing her Geforce 2 32 Meg MX card and it performs flawlessly. <br />
<br />
 I bought the processor, 256 ram, 64bit sound card, case with 4 usb ports, and the network card all for 350 from ecollegepc.com off ebay.<br />
<br />
 I had the whole system and all the parts boxes in about 3 days.<br />
<br />
 I then got the ram from best buy for about $130<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 As said above the biggest things to get is a good video card and LOTS of ram. My wife has been running on the 266 since pre luclin with very little lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While all of you seem to be promoting GeForce Cards (I have a FeForce 3 Ti200 myself) you might want to consider an ATI Radeon 9700 PRO, it's the best consumer card on the market (it benchmarks well above the GeForce 4 Ti 4600) and (because ATI finally got off their sorry butts and made good drivers) doesn't have the compatibility issues that plagued older ATI cards. A theorhetical &quot;BEST&quot; gaming system would be:<br />
- the fastest Intel Pentium 4 (I use an AMD Athlon XP 1500+ myself, wouldn't switch to Pentium 4 for any reason, WAY too expensive, but still, Pentium is better game performance, AMD is better multitasking)<br />
- 1 GB (if not more) RDRAM (the one thing that Intel has over AMD is fast RAM, and yes, it helps)<br />
- an ATI Radeon 9700 PRO<br />
- ATA 133 (new standard) Hard Drives<br />
- any full-duplex sound card (sound sucks, I don't care about it anyway)<br />
- any monitor (I wouldn't spend over $100)<br />
- High-Speed internet (speeds up zoning times, I have Dial-up, aw)<br />
- Any mouse, keyboard and speakers (although I'd definately go with an optical mouse, and avoid USB mouse and keyboard, USB uses a tiny bit of system resources while PS/2 uses none)<br />
<br />
Argue with me if you think I said something wrong, or missed something, but you will get performance from a machine like this.<br />

Nvidia is releasing its 3x card in quarter 4 of this year.. hopefully before the holidays anyway..  While the Radeon does up the ante with more shaders, pixel pipelines, and instructions.. the new Nvidia is gonna be topdog no doubt and it should come in at around the same price.  The main advantage to the Radeon is that its stamped Dir.X 9 certified.. even though, last I heard, DX9 had yet to be free from beta testing.  With all this said.. I'd wait for the new nvidia GPU.</div></div><hr />
