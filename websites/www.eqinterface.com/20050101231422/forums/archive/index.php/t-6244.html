Problems have been getting worse since the last LoY patch.<br />
<br />
As near as I can tell - there is something wrong with the default UI - but the load process being monitored in the DBG.TXT file doesn't recognize or record that the UI Error has occurred.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">02-03-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to Caireen for having an updated patch fix.  I should be back in business.  This was odd because it only affected certain characters - others loaded just fine.<br />
<br />
Everytime I think my opinion of SOE can't get worse - IT DOES.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">02-03-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - I'm upset.  After FIXING the dang UI files - the stupid patcher - OVERWROTE them again.  So I guess they gotta go in the MOD folder.  I'm getting agitated &lt;twitch&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-03-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just the one Grottel.  Toss the CharacterCreate in your custom folder *for now*.  The other two can go into default folder, they won't get overwritten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">02-03-2003, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">still not working - Tech Support is offline today (not a surprise).<br />
There's something more systemic wrong with my EQ than just this UI file.<br />
<br />
The EQ program itself is trying to access files that havent' been made available.  I'm at wits end.  It's pretty FREAKIN sad.<br />
<br />
Just out of curiousity - does anyone else get the &quot;unsuccessful&quot; erros in the DBG.TXT file.   Even if you enter world okay.  Would someone else check?  thanks.</div></div><hr />

Gonna patch TEST which I've NEVER used before.  Highly dissappointed.  I've had a simliar problem to this in the past, and basically got zero support for it - was solved when they put a new patch out 2 weeks later.  Meanwhile my characters all stuck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FROGEQUIP_CHR.S3D<br />
GLOBALFRM_CHR.S3D<br />
GLOBALONT_CHR.S3D<br />
<br />
now WHY my client is trying to load these and WHY they aren't available via the patcher is beyond me.<br />

Frustruted to the point of quitting entirely.  10 hours of maintenance without support or fix SUX.</div></div><hr />

Basicly all you have to do is run the test server patcher then go back to the normal EQ patcher....that should load all the files that are missing.</div></div><hr />

No...the files ARE NOT AVAILABLE.  NOBODY has them yet and they are not being pushed via patch.

<br />
I didn’t read through the entire thread but you could delete your everquest folder and install from CD again. Painfully long processes though :(<br />
<br />
Hope you find a solution. I hate when things dont follow logic.</div></div><hr />

I got this mornings patch just before going to work.  Loaded one character that I hadn't been able to use before.  2nd Character I tried (the one with the problems) dropped me to Desktop.<br />

The files are listed still havent been made available.<br />

SOE - Why hast thou Forsaken Me??</div></div><hr />

Everquest Crashing to Desktop after Character Select <br />
Submitted by Lenardo on 2/2/2003 9:52:29 AM<br />

A decent amount of people have been having problems with EQ crashing to desktop after selecting their character, and not being able to log in with THAT character. The most common Solution - well besides trusting someone to log in your character to move 1 zone over- is to go into your Everquest directory and to delete the following files. ss.opt and all *.opt files that have to do with that character's name. interestingly enough if you have memory leak/framerate problem, doing this also seems to fix framerate problems as well. It did for me.</div></div><hr />

I remembered reading something similar recently myself.  Heh, one of the threads here, just down a couple.  This (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=32822#post32822) is the specific post I'm thinking of, within that thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skeeno</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a similar problem with my main character. I could load up any of my alts without a problem, but my main would freeze after character select.<br />
<br />
I deleted the UI_{charname}_*.ini file and then I was able to get back in. I had to redo my screen layout again, but small price to pay to be able to play again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As previously stated, I've already dumped ALL customized files (*.ini, *.opt, *.txt, *.txc, etc) and all zone files for the zone the characters were in.  It was a long arse repatch and it made no improvement.<br />
<br />
No, this did not fix the problem that my client is STILL trying to load non-existant files.<br />
<br />
There is something WRONG with the EQ client/server communication that is resulting in my connection timing out after 3 minutes.  If you look at my first post, you will see where this time-out is occuring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry,  I missed that you deleted those files.. <br />

In my dbg.txt I get these Unsuccessfuls:<br />

I'm cheap, so I rely on various warez.  But for this I've broken out the good old PERFMON.EXE (included with WIN98 and others).  It can be set monitor and log all sorts of activity including bandwidth usage both SENT and RECIEVED.   Nice little program.  Sooo, we'll just see whats happening during the time-out period.</div></div><hr />
