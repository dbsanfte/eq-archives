<br />
Not a huge problem, but a bit annoying, any ideas on what I've managed to screw up?</div></div><hr />

Don't see default in there.  If it is off with that too then you should be trying EQ tech support.  If it isn't, then it is within the custom UI's.  You need to confirm that the isue happens with the default UI in order to contact tech support.<br />
<br />
The LDON dungeon locator is competely hard coded and there is nothing in the UI that can affect it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shasriel</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know with Tablets UI the line is off just a bit b/c of the size of the compass in the custom UI. In the latest Tablets update there is a mod for the new compass there that enlarged it so it's about the size of the default one so the LDoN line lines up properly.  Hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On one of my compass windows I have the compass moved 140px to the right.  I had to lengthen the stips, and reassign the letters for everything to line up correctly, but that wasn't any big deal.<br />
Now, the ldon line still showed up, but it did so in the blank area to the left.<br />
<br />
The ldon line is positioned based on location 0,0.  No changeing of the size or the shape of the compass will change where it appears.<br />
<br />
When jmlkicker said that it is off 45° I assumed that he meant that if he was standing there facing the dungeon entrance, then the line was not centered between 0 and 98 along the x axis on his compass.<br />
<br />
I find it difficult to believe that all these UI's have been coded without concearn for the ldon indicator.  I am reletively certain that the compass has been address an is now working for at least the vert2.6 ui that was used.<br />
I would think that there is an error in EQ somewhere for jmlkicker causing the line to show up out of position.</div></div><hr />
