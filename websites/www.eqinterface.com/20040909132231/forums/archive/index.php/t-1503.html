<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gondola</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I created an animated cursor based on the druid epic.  It features the Nature Walker's Scimitar, and some floaty semi-transparent leaves.  Here's a screenshot:<br />

<br />
It's on my site, www.eq-toolbox.com (http://www.eq-toolbox.com).<br />
<br />
I'm also the writer of the UImap mod, which we have an Actions window and Help window version for.<br />
<br />
We've also added an EverQuest item database; check it out.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Would it be possible to include in your readme file a section containing *just the lines you've added/changed* in the animations file?<br />
<br />
As it currently stands, I have to chose between your pointer, or the other mod I have which made changes to the animations.xml.  It would be nice if I could combine the two.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  Yes, you really should include comments in the xml to document where you've made changes.  Apparently there's only two items changed, a new TextureInfo item for the new graphic file and A_DefaultCursor.<br />
<br />
2.  I downloaded this from EQToolbox and it's not correct.  The xml refers to scimcursor.tga but the zip file contains scimcursor1.tga, scimcursor2.tga, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SSoulshadow</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As much as I would LOVE to use this cursor, I just loaded it and the graphic didn't show. Ended up with a &quot;Use your imagination&quot; cursor... no graphic what so ever.<br />
I know NADA about coding and such... so I can't complain. <br />
Has it worked for everyone else?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GoGetz</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:) very nice mods...small problem. I tried the courser per instructions and the courser disappeared..I think you might have forgoten a file or a step you did that needs to be reproduced IMO. Mind double checking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightWolf</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple posts up it talked about a refrense that didn't seem to be the right file, this is probaly the mistake that's causing it not to show, I would try it out, but still in mySQL class so I don't have access to my files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gondola</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has been fixed..  sorry about that!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightWolf</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">did you update the download?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gondola</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, let me know if you have any other problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gondola</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plus, I added Comment lines in the EQUI_Animations file where my changes were made.  There are only two sections.  One is an addition, and the other is a change to the existing A_DefaultCursor that is there. <br />

I think it will keep me happy until I get the real thing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gresnah</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice work on the pointer dood! Now I can honestly say that my lvl 47 druid has his epic...be it a mouse pointer, but still the epic non-the-less ;), NOW, only if there was a mouse pointer for the warrior epic, that would be cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ampleworks</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in reply to the comment about other cursors.<br />
<br />
after I figure out the XML part (been trying to &quot;hack thru&quot; the druid one atm. i believe i have what i need figured out...but well the servers are down right now :mad: <br />
<br />
if all goes well, i plan on making pointers for all epic weapons. :nana: <br />
<br />
but for now, i'm going with 1-image static weapons, then if my ideas work, then perhaps i'll get animations added to everything...including the rogue one...perhaps a nice red glow animation? :D</div></div><hr />
