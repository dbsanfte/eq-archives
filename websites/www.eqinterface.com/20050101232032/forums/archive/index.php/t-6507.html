<br />
it works great! I love it. I have 2 issues with it that I would like to get fixed though if its possible.<br />
<br />
1. when viewing a book (the kind you read), there is an alingment issue with the texture.<br />
<br />
2. there is no charm slot yet.<br />
<br />
If somone would like to try to remedy these two things, or if someone could explain to me how I could do it myself (in lamans terms), I would be very excited. :)<br />
<br />
can see SS's of it at http://eq.dam3d.com/skins/zan_02_07_03/zanskin.jpg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The deal with the Charm slot is that it is a graphic added to the window_pieces04.tga file.  To get the graphic, you either need to delete the window_pieces04.tga file (simplest, but will make your compass the default one) or use the window_pieces04.tga file in this thread :<br />

<br />
As far as the Book goes, this zip file has two different book files.  The one that unzips first uses a different book look.  You will need to rename the spellbook01.tga to book01.tga through book04.tga of the T King spellbook you want to use for your book.<br />
<br />
The second one that is included uses the same T King spellbook as the book as well.<br />

That neck piece looks extremelly uncomfortable.  /shudder</div></div><hr />

I am replying to this thread before working on the fixes, but to answer your question about the neck piece, yea, its a bit tight, but hey, it has its advantages...<br />
