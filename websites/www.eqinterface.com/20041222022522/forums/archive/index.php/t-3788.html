nope<br />
you'd be doing lucky to get the original amount back.  The cards dont really have any use other than being &quot;nifty&quot; and about 60 percent have sucky sketches rather than cover quality artwork.  Even then, the same art piece might be reused half a dozen times to clipped highlight a particular race, class, armor, weapon, etc...<br />
<br />
At the time they came out I skipped the blister packs and purchased a collecters set.  Even with a &quot;complete&quot; set they left a lot to be desired.<br />
<br />
Lastly the index numbers on the cards truely horrific.  I forget the exact logic but it ends seeming almost random if you sort the cards by index number.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably not. But what is worth some moolah is the original D&amp;D monster cards that were published in the early-mid 80's... unopened 'ORIGINAL' (not reprints that you see today) will fetch a good deal of cash. My friend has the original set and was offered a substantial amount of money for them... he's going to keep them for nostalgia purposes.<br />
