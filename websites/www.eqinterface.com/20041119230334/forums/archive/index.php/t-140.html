It's nice, cool, but now I'm starting to think that everyone is using it just because it's there. I'm going to PROTEST and make a UI with no percentages at all... except maybe xp, because even I want to know how far I got to go to hear that sweet DING! :)<br />
<br />
I'm gonna make an interface that A) Looks good ( I know I know, purely subjective but ya), and B) isn't too astoundingly large. I still have to work on that bigfonts interface for that one guy who can't see very well.<br />

<br />
Personally, I'm not that big on putting '%' everyplace where the number is a percentage. Some are just obvious, you see these changes in my small UI mods.<br />
<br />
Other places might need them for telling what's what, and some are just there for looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess seeing a number is a little more acurate than looking at a colored bar.  Sometimes that acuracy it not always needed.  I mean the gauges are all percentages so no real need for a % label but displaying the current HP with the HP gauge helps becuase it is more informative.  Yeah the extra text like the &quot;%&quot; and &quot;/&quot;  is more there for when giving to other people.  When you create something yourself you tend to know exactly what it is, yet a complete stranger may not know what you were trying to display with out some sort of label to go with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">psychogears</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know, utility... I just wish people would be more creative. I've only seen alot of &quot;player window with x gauges&quot; types of mods, or putting things where they're more useful... sure that's great, and I like those, but personally I just want to see one that *looks* spectacular or at least really cool... something that makes playing the game feel cooler just because the interface isn't so blocky... hopefully I can pull that off with my mod. I might end up just redoing all the graphics. o_0<br />

<br />
Make a whole new guage . spell book , thacking window..................... some ideas make the spell book a scroll , or an anichent tome (pardon spelling it is late :) <br />
<br />
Say for Druids make the guages a wodden staf that an ivy vie wraps around as it fills or unwraps from as it lowers . <br />
<br />
You have alot of room to play with in the image dept . use it :) and if labels happen to be needed or will enhance it then fine use em :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arantius</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well as for the labels, I thoroughly enjoy the added precision I have.  I still want to be able to use the &quot;two bubbles&quot; terminology I am used to, but otherwise knowing down to the percent is just nifty IMO.<br />
<br />
And as for the real skins, Tenaka, there aren't many people with both the technical skill and artistic ability to create something like that.  I'm betting these things will come along, but take longer as it's gonna most likely be two people collaborating instead of one geek hacking through the night :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thilandril</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking forward to seeing someone come out with something really exciting and innovative. We're probably going to have to give folks a few weeks to roll out something really radical. I've already seen a few glimpses of brilliance (the Quartz UI, of course. And Oguler's spell book skin). I think as the weeks go by, we're going to see some amazing stuff.<br />
<br />
As far as the percentages go, I definitely agree that they are being way overused, at least for my taste. Although I must admit, the first mod that I loaded into my UI was a player info window with a numerical mana percent. That number in particular is one that I work with so much when I'm in group, that I really found it useful. Beyond that though, the bars are just fine for me. When I'm down to one bubble of health, I don't need a numerical percentage to confirm for me that I'm in trouble ;) <br />

I am also trying to make all windows as small as I can without being too small for my taste, to save space on the screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaasper</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the way I look at it is: What is the purpose for the skins? In my world the skin must improve the utility of EQ. Numbers have much more utility than gagues etc. <br />
<br />
The artistic skins will be nice for a while but in the end anything that steals space from my game window without providing me with some useful information will quickly be left behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's why I'm working on two different mods.<br />
<br />
The first one is a normal looking interface, with improved visibility over the default skin, and everything compacted down as much as I can get it without reducing the sizes of fonts, icons, etc. I'm making custom buttons, window graphics (extremely tedious), and moving things around to maximize space. Basically, it's a lot like the one Vertebrae did, cept I like big gauges without hash marks, and I like to fit the text inside the gauge to save space.<br />
<br />
The other is a necro themed mod, with completely necro themed graphics. The window graphics are even harder for this one, and I'm having a hard time deciding exactly what I want things to look like, but I'm determined to make it as sleek and compact as possible. Expect to see a lot of black shiny buttons and borders made of bone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just my 2 cp : <br />
<br />
Jauges by themselves give more information than a percentage : if you use jauge with small line as zoom in current buble , 1 % is 1 quarter of a bubble on the thin line... No need to say 1 quarter of bubble is more than 1 pixel wide and so u have a better precision with jauge. Even a simple jauge is more accurate , since they are more than 100 pixels wide ( ok , i admit, for this one , it is much easier to look at a percentage than to count the number of pixels ).  <br />
<br />
What i feel is each one have its interests : <br />
<br />
    ultra fast check with simple jauge ( u only have to take a really fast look to know how good / bad it is ), when time really counts.<br />
<br />
    fast and accurate measure with percentage when u consider u can lose some time , but not too much, for a good accuracy.( u have to read 1 number for that ) <br />
<br />
    Ultra precise measurement with zoom-integrated jauge when time nearby does not count , where u can have better than 1/1000th measure ( takes longer due to the need to assimilate 2 distincts informations and calculate the one you want from that)<br />
<br />
So yes, there is no need to put percent values everywhere, but there is some places where they are useful.<br />
<br />
Of course , what i said here is about non resized jauges  but even if you do really big jauges , it would be hard to put more than 3 or 4 screen-wide jauges  where some people want 6 of them , not counting grp and grp pets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Psychogears : for xp for example , i feel that is one of the less interesting percentage , because the jauge is much more accurate and time really doesn't matter when u read XP.<br />
<br />
and still for Psychogears : I just love the jauges u made and shown on forum, and yes , with such nice loooking jauges , percentage is just useless :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizzestra</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In regards to Jaasper's post, I think that utility IS important. However, if it looks stupid, I am going to get very bored with it very fast and try to change it to suit my personal tastes. That's why people make skins. It also helps people get more into character and that makes the game more enjoyable for about 90% of the EQ players. There are of course those who play the game just to kill things and duel, (aka fantasy quake) but I would like to think they are the minority in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe this is only happening to me, but when I have a gauge and a percent label showing the same thing, they always update at the exact same time, meaning that the gauge is no more or less accurate than a percent label, even with the extra line in the middle.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that for values like mana, a percentage is calculated by the client, then that percentage is used to update the gauges and labels. If the actual value were divided up by the number of pixels that could be drawn, I'd see the point to using gauges over percent labels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizzestra</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just think it's a little easier to read a % label and less chance of a mistake being made in a tight situation like on a raid when the difference between 10% and 20% of a mobs hps can make a difference as to success or failure. It's also easier to read when you tell someone to nuke at 60% health, they don't have to guess and maybe cast too early or late and botch the whole thing. Or when you say heal me at 25% and they are busy and in the commotion misread the guage and wait too long to heal you and splat, down goes MA and possibly the whole raid. Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bohorroth</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with Kizzestra, if you are raiding an endmob with like 1.000.000 HP, 1% is still 10.000 HP, and you can't read between like 23% and 22% when you look on a simple gauge. It just makes things a bit easier, and as a cleric I can heal more accurate when I see the mob hits my MT for like 20% each hit, I can estimate when I cast my CH and it's easier for me than a gauge ... I even wish that I could see it with two decimals for the xp bar in level 59 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-12-2002, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, we should be able to see the percentage on our exp label with decimal points, because the exp percentage used to draw the bar isn't rounded to the nearest integer. It's the only exception to the rule though.<br />
<br />
As long as the actual value is sent to the client BEFORE the percentage is calculated, It shouldn't take any extra bandwidth for them to change the way that percentages for drawing gauges for those values are calculated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">08-12-2002, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nennayan, you are sure xp is the only jauge able to have a 1-pixel accuracy ? <br />
<br />
If that's true , so ok , no point in using a jauge with 1% accuracy instead of the percentage itself , but that would really suck and makes me wonder why verant would want to do that ?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-12-2002, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, now that I have a mod that has a bunch of things on it, I'm gonna look more into a streamlined one as well.  Plus fix those pesky buttons on my spellbook :P</div></div><hr />

That would be depressing, personally ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you remember when they added the blue line to the exp bar? Before that, all the gauges were just a visual representation of a percentage, rounded to the nearest integer.<br />
<br />
The exp bar was &quot;upgraded&quot; to show a more accurate percentage, by adding the blue line, which essentially magnified the bar by 5.<br />
<br />
Any gauge should be able to be calculated this way, as long as the client gets the actual data before the percentage is calculated.</div></div><hr />

(like in DaoC, having this info is very usefull)<br />
<br />
I am trying to make an UI with will use has little screen space has possible while giving has much info has possible.  Also I want it to be well order and easy to look at, unlike some chaotic UI I have seen. You can take a look at it: http://brodeure0.tripod.com<br />

I am excellent programmer (its my RL job), but I suck at graphics and design, so I am modifiying the XML windows , but didnt bother with the TGA files yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WHat I would like to see is a UI that doesnt look like a Being 747 control room.. but hey, that's just _me_ :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I HATE the 'streamlined' look. There's a reason I'm not playing Unreal Tournament. I'm playing a fantasy RPG and my UI should build on the fantasy feel of the game, not detract from it.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I need my percents (I'm addicted)...I'm working on a way to make them prettier (nicer font maybe), and I removed the % sign from nearly all of them, and shrunk them to near-invisibility compared to the gauges, but it's important to me to know how much mana a spell takes, in objective terms, and it's much easier to figure out how fast I'm dying from a percent than from a gauge or just a pure number (I convert either of those to % mentally anyway, since I play several different characters and 22hp means a lot to an 18 chanter but practically nothing to a 22 ranger).<br />
<br />
I'm trying to design my mods to be like quartz as far as fitting together seamlessly, but without the feel of the U.S.S. Enterprise control room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizzestra</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rangers only have 22hps so it matters to them alot!</div></div><hr />

That lets me keep my group better informed and helps me decide how to do the healing task.<br />
<br />
When I am playing my enchanter, I know how much % mana I need to cast Koadics, so I don't stand up until I have it ready.<br />
<br />
It's a lot easier to remember a single number from the xp bar when I want to see how much progress I have made in a night.  I got rid of the little blue lines on my bars.<br />
<br />
However, I do agree with you that labels are not as satisfying as images.  That's why I use buff icons to label the stats and resists instead of having a window full of &quot;STR&quot; &quot;WIS&quot; etc.</div></div><hr />

Thats why I tack on percent lables, and remove the guages. Just smaller and cleaner :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm definitly with you guys on hating the blocky UI, but the percentage labels are nice on a couple things. I made my Spectre pet info &quot;box&quot; to use the scythe as the HP guage. Being a necro, the guage is really nice to look at and gives much info at a glance... very important when you're soloing. I put the percent in there thinking it would help out,  and it does. Basically, I can get an idea on how close my medding and my pet's healing are going up. If my pet is healing slower than I'm medding, I will load up the heal spell and take care of it. I like to be able to see when my pet is at 100%, not guess if he is or not because of a couple pixels.<br />
<br />
Basically, I think the percent seems only important on mana and HP... I don't care how much percentage I have left til next level, or my AAXP. BUT it is nice to get a percentage on group members sometimes. Best place to put it, I think, is over the bar itself. Doesn't take up any room, and it's there when you need it. My Spec Pet box (not exactly a box, lol...) is set up that way. The scythe contains my pet's name, and his percent, right where I always look.<br />
<br />
BTW, just uploaded a Spell Scroll for necros (doing a general use scroll for everyone else as well) just to break the &quot;Boxxy Barrier&quot;. When I'm in game, I don't want to look at boxes. I want to see something that reminds me of the world I'm in, not that reminds me that I'm on a computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the only bar i think that doesn't need a percentage is the stamina bar, otherwise i like saying &quot;i'm 47 percent into my level&quot; rather then something like &quot;i'm 2 yellows and 4 blues into my level&quot; (prolly not right amount) same with my power, an how much mana i use. <br />
<br />
I would like to make a super condensed UIand i have a perfect picture in my head for it, but since i only know how to edit currently existing mods, no artistic ability in the way of pictures, and don't know how to make those windows that aren't rectangles, I made a UI with a butt load of crap on the screen. Of course i made it port hole with the 800x600 size, and i can see every piece of information i ever need in almost any situation just by looking at some part of my screen, while at the same time not covering any part of the gameplay.<br />
<br />
Well while i'm here ayone know of a tutorial on how to make windows different shapes? Prolly could do it then.<br />
<br />
BTW, any mod makers ever find that the buff bars are a pain in the arse when trying to make the UI small or sleak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vagabond</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Percents are great for convieing information in a compact and precise manner.<br />
<br />
But they don't have any &quot;Uh Oh&quot; factor.  The bar, for HP and Mana gives you a very fast indication on what your status is, roughly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadzar</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">even with Neverwinter Nights, there is nothing even close to being a MMORG for old school PnP users like myself...who played dungeons and dragons for years....then got introduced into EQ...and 2 years after hearing about figured what the heck and bought Gold Edition...now going from D&amp;D where the numbers are everywhere, to where numbers are just hap-hazardly thrown into the companies defualt ui. can throw you off.<br />
<br />
by haphazard i mean that the default INV window has a few number for you like HP, ATK, STR, etc...well if they thought this was important for you to know, then why not give you all the numbers, including mana, XP, etc. or just give all bars. cause you can in theory and with practice do without any numbers at all cept for money and have your stats for STR, HP, saves, etc.<br />
<br />
and the fact that we most learned numbers as values, we werent taught with bar graphs for everything.....and i mean every value being a shaded bar....no one was brought up that way.<br />
<br />
also quick ease of reading....some people may have bad eye sight in RL which could mean they are left out from being able to do things quickly when having to find how far along this bar is.<br />
<br />
<br />
now myself being one of those color-blind and general bad eye sighted people i love the numbers, and really wish i could see my xp and mana pool values.....but dont get me wrong....i would love to see more fantasy based UIs...not that i wold be able to see thru them with there clashing colors and such....but would love to see the work put into them.<br />
<br />
my favorite INV window is one i dont even use, and it is the Da Vinci model of a man with the slots located on the body parts.<br />
<br />
and being that 2 reasons a UI is made....one for looks to make it prettier, and 2 for ease of use....quicker and better game play.<br />
<br />
the slimline number everywhere UIs are for most servers i think, and those without all the numbers but more fantasy look and the pictures looking like a framed painting are more for the RP servers...<br />
<br />
it all comes down to use what you like, or make it yourself....and that is how i came to this thread.....thank you for allowing me to put in my 2000000000cp worth. (You are now encumbered)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You sure picked an ancient thread for your first post shadzar. It's been dead for like 9 months... how'd you find it? I don't think half these people even post here anymore.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd like to correct a couple things here.<br />
<br />
First, gauges are definately more accurate than percents and do not display rounded data as is what Nennayen said. I have a sub-sub bar to my exp gauges that is perfectly accurate to 0.04 percent (I can kill an old world light blue and watch it move 1 or 2 pixels). Not to mention the hp and mana bars are much more accurate than their percentage counterparts, although for hp the hp value is just as accurate and easier to read than the gauge. Although the target's hp doesn't update constantly, when it does, during that moment the gauge is more accurate than the percent (and the gauge isn't simply showing data rounded to the nearest percent).<br />
<br />
Also, since this thread was started dozens of beautiful UIs have been made.<br />
<br />
It's pretty obvious that since 9 months after this thread was last posted on, percent labels are still used everywhere, and since they were added to the default UI, that they're here to stay.<br />
