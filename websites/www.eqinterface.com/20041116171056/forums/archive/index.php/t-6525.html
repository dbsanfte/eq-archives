<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheriwenTP</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is my very own Vert 2.2(2.3) Inventory with the new charm slot.  I also took away all the info that is found on the pet window already, and added a more obvious auto-equip area<br />
<br />
UPDATE: Many many people requested that I put back all the stats on the inventory, so I did it, and I like the end results better myself.  So here is Kayla's Vert 2.3 Inventory with the charm slot deux.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheriwenTP</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and here is the files.. this has the old vert 2.2 compass we all knew and loved, as well as the new graphic for the charm slot<br />
<br />
UPDATE: These are my new files for the inventory (with stats)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheriwenTP</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, here is a screenshot of my UI , and you can see I customized a buch of it..  All the windows are sized to fit together where I can /viewport it.  And I use the pet window to display my stats, so I can see them without having to open my inventory.  ANd that is why my custom inventory has no stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rebaidah</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh. Ya I figure you had a separate stat box somewhere.  I just have pet window as timer and friends window as a clicky box.  I know how to edit some tho so maybe I'll just tinker with it here and there.  =)</div></div><hr />

I really like the vert look,<br />
But I always wanted teh buffs set up a little different ..<br />
For example ...<br />
<br />
Buffname01 - 1<br />
buffname02 - 2<br />
buffname03 - 3<br />
etc etc ...<br />
<br />
Basiclt I just want the numbers running down the right hand side of the window ...<br />

<br />
Is there an auto-equip area on the normal Vert 2.x inventory? I've never noticed it if there is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheriwenTP</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, exactly, most ppl who use vert don't know it has an auto-equip area either, but it does have one.  The stats area is where you drop items to auto-equip on that one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm using the last version of Vert Ocean Spray (2.3) that was uploaded on the page. This inventory looks really nice... Is it supposed to work with Ocean Spray?<br />
<br />
I copied the zip files in custom directory but it doesn't work when I try to load it..<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheriwenTP</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kept the Vert 2.2 destroy button on purpose, I want to keep vert's UI intact as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Never seen a vert UI that didn't use his destroy button.<br />
<br />
No other buttons on the UI have red text, so I kinda didn't like that about yours either.<br />
<br />
This file contains the destroy button graphics...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raifin</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't really like the red text either, that's how it was though in the file, I just fixed it so that it worked for us non vert users as you didn't include the destroy button graphics initially.  I don't use anything Vert currently.<br />
<br />
Oh, and please don't take this as a critique, I love the mod, I'm using it now.  I'm just not a vert user, and now I can be!  Thanks for the base :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheriwenTP</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I didn't know you weren't a Vert user...  that makes perfect sense now, and if you aren't a vert user I wouldn't use that window pieces 6 file, it will probably mess things up..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have it on the BEST of authorities that Vert 2.3 and 2.2 of Cannabis, Oceanspray, Nexium and Neptune will be updated very very soon to 2.4 to include all the patches today (including the charm slot)<br />
<br />
Sokol has the new graphics and is busy removing some other bugs he found when fixing this one.. (coding bugs, causes lag but not crashes)<br />
<br />
soooo watch for 2.4 to be out very soon!</div></div><hr />
