This theme is ONLY for the resolution 1280x1024<br />
<br />
The installation is similiar to the Quartz theme, so just read the *.txt and folllow those instructions.<br />
<br />
One tiny feature are the playerstats, I used the friendswindow to draw them, so hit &quot;alt+f&quot; to pull them out and see some stats monitored. <br />

<br />
Download 1.21 here (http://mitglied.lycos.de/bohorroth/industrial_v1.21.zip), works with the recent patch<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
History:<br />
---------<br />
<br />
1.2.1:<br />
-------<br />
<br />
- Made it compatible with todays patch<br />
- Compass works<br />
- Modified the buffbar<br />
<br />
1.2:<br />
----<br />
<br />
- Gauges edited [credits to vert (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=903)]<br />
<br />
1.12:<br />
-----<br />
<br />
- Fixed the hotbuttons<br />
<br />
1.1:<br />
----<br />
<br />
- Moved one highlight of the top target window to the upper right corner, because it was irritating a bit<br />
<br />
- Moved the target percentage right next to the target hp bar and changed the color to white<br />
<br />
- Reassigned the chat window to make it better viewable (it's now more visible, even if its not active)<br />
<br />
- Scrollbars moved to the left (intention was to hide the scrollbars, since I use shift+pageup / pagedown to scroll... you can see them now, but scrolling is only available when the window is active)<br />
<br />
- Changed the group hp percentage colors to white<br />
<br />
- Removed the playername<br />
<br />
! Don't forget to overwrite the UI_playername_servernumber.ini again, because I changed the chat window positions.<br />
Also change the UISkin=default line to UISkin=industrial in your eqclient.ini to see the gauge graphics! <br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the positive feedback and also for the suggestions<br />

Enough with the expletives of pleasent surprise! This is really frikkin' cool! Are you a professional skin artist, or did you use something as reference, or what? I mean, it's just awesome looking! i'm installing it as we speak. I can understand animation would prolly be tricky, but i'd love to see if you could get it to work--i'm sure some of the mod gurus around here can give you a few tips. 'Ell, if we can send a dancing bananaman to the moon...err...ui, why not some little flashing light thingies? I wish you luck, and congratulate you in advance on an awesome mod (pending testing my myself O.o)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aalwein</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i will be using this UI as soon as i get home from work.<br />
<br />
i have just one request, and perhaps I will tinker with it myself.  Can you make the group window fit horizontally in that space you created.  maybe two rows of three.  that way I can set up a second chat window there and a melee combat chat window in the top left.<br />
<br />
one question... where is the buff bar?<br />
<br />
damn nice skin, best one Ive seen so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As they said .. give it a couple weeks and watch the UIs come out.<br />
<br />
NICE ....  that's about all I can say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aalwein</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">downloaded it and started playing around with it.  <br />
<br />
A few things that need/should be tweaked:<br />
<br />
1. the scroll bar, chat line and left side of the chat window is covered by the &quot;target&quot; window's border.<br />
<br />
2. the &quot;percent&quot; for the target and group members is just too hard to read as a red color.  i changed mine to white.<br />
<br />
3. the target's name is hard to read due to the color of the graphics behind it.  also, the &quot;percent&quot; for the targets health covers the end of the target's name if it is a longish name.  not a huge problem really (i just moved the percent over to the left into the beveled area).<br />
<br />
I love it.  right now I'm just testing it on one of my alts but after I get photoshop reinstalled (my secondary HD with all my apps and downloads failed a few days ago) I will play around with the group box.<br />
<br />
one last thing... the green gem on the right of the chat window is pretty and all, but i'm going to expand the hotkeys window to include the inventory , primary, secondary and range slots.<br />
<br />
this is a great UI and makes playing with the &quot;new everquest&quot; so much more entertaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aalwein</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see why the scroll bar in the chat window is hidden - because the transparency in the target window is like glass.  you can see through but you cant touch anything. :)<br />
<br />
okay so no scroll bar but i still would like to see the left edge of the text and the actual chat bar in full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walnut</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say I really like this skin and have it running right now. Great Job! :) There is however one question I have for you about this skin..call it a bug or what have you, but..the part with the hotkeys..how do you go from the first set of hotkeys to the next? Usually there is an arrow to go left or right; I tried this to no avail..if you come up with anything or if there has been something like this noticed and fixed please let me know via post. I will check back for it. :cool:<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the great skin and you did an excellent job. Keep up the good work. :D <br />

<br />
I've finished most of my tweaks to this mod now i just have one final problem...<br />
<br />
how do i remove my name from the player window.  I searched it all over and found no refrence to it at all in the XML... how the heck did it get there?<br />
<br />
anyway, got this loaded up on all my toons now.  now im going to bed... 5am... good god where does the time go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe this just occurs on my system but detrimental (ie. RED) buffs in the buff bar appear incorrectly.  it only show a slim red bar across instead of full top to bottom (of the spell icon).<br />
<br />
Also, it seems a few of the hotkey boxes get tweaked a bit when there is something in it, be it an inventory slot or a macro.  only seems to happen on the third and fourth rows.  doesnt affect gameplay and its not incredibly noticable but still a bug.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering about the &quot;animations&quot; that you couldnt get to work.  I'm guessing the colored gems were supposed to glow.  Have you worked on fixing it or did you just say hell with it?  I was thinking you could make the red gem glow/flash when combat is turned on instead of just having a flashing red box around the player name.  Beyond my skill otherwise I'd give it a go myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bohorroth</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the buff window works ok for me, but there's another buffwindow mod you might want to check out by vert contained in his rogue mod (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=508).<br />
Yea i know about the hotkey boxes, and i'll fix that later :)<br />
I'm afraid I can't do that with the animations yet, but I'll try it out again... <br />
<br />
As far as I know you can't remove the glowing box when you're in combat but tell me if someone knows how.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the report aalwein ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aalwein</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">edit to one of those bugs i mentioned.  the hoykey boxes.  it only bugs out on inventory slots, not macros, I reported at first.  seems to be a glitch from the inventory slots not realizing there is supposed to be a gap between the third and fourth rows of the hotkey bank.  does occur on all pages, also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bohorroth</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea it was a typo, added 10pixels too much, heres the fixed  hotbutton window (http://mitglied.lycos.de/bohorroth/EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aalwein</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bohorroth, I made a few modifications to your skin to accomodate my needs further.  Changes were made to the group and target windows.  Below is a picture.<br />
<br />
http://www.splitzero.net/images/skinmod.jpg <br />
<br />
Was wondering if you wanted this code and/or if it's okay for me to post the two files modified here.  I can send you the url to download them if you'd like to look em over first.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I'm going to move on to adding some inventory slots to the hotkey box now... I absolutely love this skin!<br />
<br />
Download the modified files (for the target and group windows) here (http://www.splitzero.net/files/skinmods.zip).  Keep in mind that it does not have any of the changes Bohorroth made in his latest version... i will get to work to modifing his new version.<br />
<br />
You can see the whole skin working in this screenshot (http://www.splitzero.net/yabbse/index.php?board=1;action=display;threadid=284).  It shows a few mods in action actually, as I incorporated some of that crisp rogue skin with Bohorroth's.  Also has those snazzy spell icons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bohorroth</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">feel free to modify anything and post it here for everyone, its nice to see that someone likes my work ;)<br />
<br />
btw I see you're using the v.1.0 of the target window, you can slightly see more if you use the newer wnd_target.tga and EQUI_chatwindow.xml (and don't forget to overwrite the UI_name.server.ini because of position of the windows)</div></div><hr />
