<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blynk</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello friends.  I'm only having problems with one UI after yesterdays patch and I can't quite figure yout why.<br />
<br />
I use LunaWrap2.0 (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=869/) for my mage and continue to crash after char select only when using this UI.  The custom files don't seem to include any that  were patched yesterday.<br />
<br />
My UIerror file seems to just be the standard non custom file found, loading from default. Since the last file attempted  was included (bodytintwnd) in the patch I was wondering if that might be a place to start. I'm including the file text at end of this post. <br />
<br />
UIs that do work for me are Shaman1 (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1046/) and Sars_3 (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=898/)<br />
<br />
I'm new to xml and costum UIs but hope i have given enough info. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I logged in late yesterday after most of the patching circus had been dealth with. I haven't had any problems with the tweaked version I am currently running, except for the various desktop icons showing through my UI, and that's been happening since they added the windowed mode (worse since yesterday, tho). I also have the BodyTintWindow line in my errors, so I don't think  that's the problem.<br />
<br />
So...hrm....not exactly sure why it's causing you to crash...Anyone else having this problem specific to LunaWrap? Do you have the icons pop thru to your UI as well? I'm thinking this might be part of the problem (tho I'm not sure why...) <br />
<br />
Also, I noticed that EQUI.xml and SIDL.xml are not among the files being grabbed from default. If you have these files in the custom folder, you could try deleting them, unless you modded them.<br />
<br />
I know this isn't much help, but I am looking into this. I'll let you know what I find.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blynk</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for such a quick reply :) I haven't moded anything inside. I took advantage of using the smaller buff and mp3 windows. Also using caster player window. <br />
<br />
I've been using it without a single hitch since jan 10 and the only changes made since then was  a rename of the UI_name_serv copy in my EQ dir so I could log in last night. <br />
<br />
I did patch some spell*.tga files yesterday after doing the test server patch 'fix' the GMs recommended in gen chat. Might this in anyway affect the spell*.tga files use in the luna dir?<br />
<br />
I wish I could be of more help, can't think of any more feedback atm. GL! Great skin btw :) Its perfect for my char.<br />
<br />
*snip* Almost forgot to mention, i must not have gotten everything highlighted in my uierror paste. Only missed a few lines which did inclue the UI.xml and SIDL.xml files. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had no problem with yesterday with the Luna Wrap UI.  About 1 week ago I did have a problem where I would crash to desktop as soon as I went into the game.  What I found out for some reason EQ didnt like my UI_Charactername_# file.  What I had backed up on CD all my UIfiles and character files for EQ and alot of otherstuff in Windows XP that I was using as my OS.  When I formated my Hard disk after I backed up everything.  I installed Windows 98 SE since that was the only OS I had the CD for.  Everquest didnt like any of those UI_Charactername_Serv# files.  I would get booted strait to desktop.  <br />
<br />
I am not sure if it will make that big of a diffrence you may want to change your UI to default then if you get that character in game then try loading Luna Wrap UI again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blynk</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok this worked.. sorta hehe :)<br />
<br />
It seems that the UI_char_serv file that comes along with this UI is no longer valid. I redownloaded all the files and reinstalled from windows. (I'd never actually loaded a skin in game and had it work before). This still gave me the same result. So finally, using my default UI ui_char_serv to get in game, then loading from inside EQ I was able to get the skin to load. But, of course it was fullscreen. :)<br />
<br />
One reason i like this skin is for all it has to offer in an oldschool wrap.  What is the command to change the viewport? I think before it was set for a 1024 x 768 screen res with 800x600 viewport. <br />
*snip*<br />
/viewport 96 0 800 600 <br />
<br />
seemed to snug it in nice for 1024 x 768 screen res.<br />
*snip*<br />
Hope it helps anyone else if they have this problem. Thanks again for all the help folks :)</div></div><hr />

I cannot figure out how to modify your spellgem bar to add a sit/stand square above the 'spellbook' square on the left.<br />
<br />
Also, is there a way to not use spell gems and instead put the spell name in the box. I don't like how the spell names all overwrite each other when you hit the ALT key (since the gems are horizontal and not verticle.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">02-01-2003, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, the sit/stand box can only be added to the actions window, so no, it can't be added to the spellcastwindow.<br />
<br />
As far as replacing the gems with the spell names, I have an idea that might work. However, with the horizontal layout, the names will still overlap when you hit the alt key. Let me know if you are more interested in a vertical configuration or the standard horizontal one and I'll see if I can't make something for you.<br />
