I think it would be cool if a guild created a signit ring, or bracer that everyone in the guild had to wear.  What you would do is take the graphic for a velium diamond ring ( i chose this one because in the higher game everyone needs resists). Change it, to reflect your guild. And then distribute the graphic file to all guild members, along with the piece of jewelery. Cool thing about this would be that everyone can wear that particular piece of jewelery, and also signifies that you are in that particular guild (aside from the guild tag above your name). Which also hieghtens the roleplaying experience.<br />
<br />
Down sides I suppose would be that any item in the game that calls for that particular graphic would look like the guild item. Also distributing the items to all the guild would be another<br />
<br />
(for those uber guilds, they can get a really hard item that all races/class can use, change the graphic for it and make sure everyone in the guild gets one ;)<br />
<br />
Just a thought...</div></div><hr />

Interesting idea none the less.</div></div><hr />
