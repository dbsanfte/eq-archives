Anyone have any recommendations, currently I'm on Kane Bayle with my beast and pally. So I'll be looking for a new class to go along with the new server. I'll still play some on my home server but think it would be fun to start all over again. Especially since Kane Bayle is a small server I think I would like to try one with a few more people on it.<br />
<br />
Thinking stromm but don't wanna go there if its got as low of an amount of ppl on it as kane bayle does.<br />

<br />
PS This could possibly be bad as I can't stand not twinking a new character because lvls 1-30 are so horrific cb then pc then hhk.<br />
<br />
Edit Make some suggestions on class to as I'm burnt out on my pally but love playing my beast but hes heavily twinked and don't think I would like playing him as much if he wasn't.</div></div><hr />

I started on Bertoxx like 3 months after the game launched and I liked it course it wasnt as populated as now.  I now play on Torvo and I like it but theres not to many ppl on it. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
First I would ask yourself What do I gain by moving? and follow that with Why do I want to move?<br />
<br />
Once you decided on that, it's easier to make suggestions.<br />

They level very quickly and necro's are great at farming pp.  Checkout necro.eqclasses.com for some game guides (one written by yours truly).<br />
<br />
I play on the tribunal.  There are almost always many people on, but it is the only server  I play on in lenght, so I don't know how it stacks with other server.  I like playing on the test or PVP servers when I get bored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, necro or druid are probably the easiest to start from scratch. <br />
<br />
As far as server, I'd actually recommend going with a LOW population server. Try one of the newer ones ( don't remember the order anymore ) if you can. The Bazaar prices will be lower, the camps will tend to be a little more open, and it may be easier to find your way into a decent guild ( due to lower numbers of people to compete with ).<br />
<br />
But that's just my humble yet vocal opinion ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you need anything starting up (some plat and some gear that I or any of my alts have let build up in bank) look me up and I will gladly help you out.<br />

<br />
I would recommend Dark Elf for a necro because even though they have a relaitvely bad noob zone, that does not matter much. They DO have pretty good stats all around for a necro, and unlike Iksars, can go in other evil places, like the OT outpost, which will have a lot of your essential spells as you grow up. DEs also have ultravision, which is REALLY nice as a noob.</div></div><hr />

Good hunting.</div></div><hr />
