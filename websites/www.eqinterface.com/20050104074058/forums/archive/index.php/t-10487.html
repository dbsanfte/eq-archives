<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rinalthelis</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm attempting to install soes16altbuffs.zip from:<br />
soes16altbuffs.zip File Information (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=2537) <br />
<br />
It installs and works mostly (no errors), however the background isn't showing up. I'd like the numbered background as pictured here:<br />
soes16altbuffs.zip Picture (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=2537)<br />
<br />
Instead, I'm getting a totally transparent window as pictured on the far right side of the screen here:<br />
soes16.zip Picture (buff window on far right) (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1371)<br />
<br />
I did read the FAQ, Read Me &amp; I did a search. I'm running at 1024x768, and I only have one other UI mod installed (a single EQUI_Container file). In my custom folder I have all three files included in the soes16altbuffs.zip file (EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow, EQUI_BuffWindow &amp; drakah_buffbackground.tga), in addition to the one EQUI_Container I had already. Both new EQUI files reference the drakah_background.tga file. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soes</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright.. I tested them out with 3 different UI's and they all seemed to work fine. So that leads me to conclude that there is something conflicting in your custom UI -or- something with your video card...<br />
<br />
What custom UI are you using? Can you try loading the buffs into their own directory and see if that works?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To get it work normal i had to use the CS_Buttons.bmp from the Soes UI and it worked fine.<br />
Dont use the orginal CS_Buttons.bmp<br />
<br />
Dont know if it works for you but did for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soes</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It'll work with the default CS_Buttons.bmp too, thats just the red &amp; blue borders for good/bad buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rinalthelis</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I got it to work, but I'm not really sure how. It worked on one character, but not on the character I was trying to get it to work on. I visually inspected the UI_Name_Server.ini files for both characters and couldn't find any distinct differences, so finally I just wholesale coppied one into the other. Now it works.<br />
<br />
I'll try to do a compare on the two files next week and post what the difference was that caused this problem. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for a great mod, it is exactly what I wanted!</div></div><hr />
