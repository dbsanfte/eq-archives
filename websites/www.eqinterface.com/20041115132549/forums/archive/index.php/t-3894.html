<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay guys and gals here is the fix and update for the druidui that the patch broke.  I like the new one better.  It is cleaner and much tighter.  Additionally I have finished the other three campaigns as well and they are all Caster and Melee compatible.  All inventory is exposed, and a few things are much cleaner.  I created a new caster gauge that fits these mods better.  Watch for them on the complete section of this board.  Yes I know they are 1280x1024.  Sorry about that I am working on the 1024x768 reso versions now.  Jeeze get a graphics card will ya :oP  Just kidding.  Its just that 1024x768 for me is like 640x480 for some cause i run high reso all the time.  Anyway I viewported these so that looting is easier now, and incorporated a buncha things I learned from the first run.<br />
<br />
I would acknowledge the following people for contributions to this UI.<br />
<br />
Graphics from the AYA mod I borrowed just the window_pieces.tga file from it and the nice compass with +/- for locing.<br />
<br />
Oguler for the buff window I believe.<br />
<br />
And as always TKing for his great spell gems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some screencaps<br />

let me know what yas think....  They should be on the complete section as soon as i can get them posted.  And Kudane can get them added.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good Lord, my friend, these are astounding. I may once and for all abandon my gimp excuse for a ui to use these. The quality of artwork here is just...beautiful. I love it.<br />
<br />
I'm rather confused about the spell casting window, though...Does it have a &quot;day and night&quot; animation usually, and then this drains away as you cast? If so, that would be entirely too awesome. I guess i'll have to try it out ^.^ If you can, please explain it.<br />
<br />
 I'm really impressed, even though this is in a resolution much lower than what i'm used to. i'd still sacrifice that quality for such a good ui. The only thing that really bugs me is the &quot;at a glance inventory&quot; seems to leave a lot of blank space beneath it..perhaps you could move some form of the window selector down there in those empty boxes and get it out of the way, but still acessible? I think it would look much better like that. Of course, that's in blatant disregard for the actual work you have to put in to change something like that 6.^<br />
<br />
Great job. I really hope to see more. How's about a more marbley, generic caster or priest one? a &quot;temple&quot; theme, so to speak? Maybe something aztek! You've obviously got a skillz overload. Thank you so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luminea</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would LOVE to see these finished for release.  Very pleasing to the eye, and very good use of space in my opinion.  I personlly like the undead and orc, but I know all 4 would be put to good use :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, im gonna have to have all of them the moment they are available.<br />
<br />
You are my new personal hero =P hehe<br />
<br />
Great Job! I must say, that I rank these high in creativity=) Teriffic job bro =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the spirit of being honest though.  Much of the artwork comes from the Warcraft 3 game I just took what i could use and modified it to work in EQ but it is still a daunting and time consuming task hehehe.  Anyway please feel free to make suggestions I always try to listen to them.  These releases are a result of what i learned from my earlier druid UI.  They're very clean and much smaller but still allow for the addition of things people want like the ton of awsome artwork from TKing etc,  and Atheenaths loc wizard and more.  They are posted to the complete section of the EQinterface board as of 20 minutes ago but they have to be screened by the moderator before being available.  I have them posted on my web site too but my bandwidth limit will choke them off fast so I reserved the links for my guildies for now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasus</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOW!<br />
<br />
Very nice..<br />
<br />
Only thing I do not care for is the spell gems being up top.<br />
<br />
I was thinking maybe using another spell gem bar.. would that break anything in this BEAUTIFUL work of art??<br />
<br />
Also, I think you have the Alt XP and XP reversed as your lvl 20 wiz and 5 Necro already seem to have Alt XP and no regular XP<br />
<br />
I think Reg XP should be up top (correct gauge there currently so u just have to change the text -- mind you I am stupid when it comes to these things) and AA Exp down the bottom, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nooo you droped the casting wolf....sigh.<br />
The only thing i dont like is the size of the buffs. They seem to get in my way that size. But thats a easy fix,down load a diff one. <br />
MAn i cant wait to get it to try..<br />
Also a druid has no use for the hit and miss spot. I get hit iam not doing this right.<br />
I dont know xml but can the top bar be changed some so it shows for a melee..like maybe turn it to show his/her health??<br />
:nana: :nana: :nana: :nana: :nana:<br />
<br />
<br />
:mad: <br />
Dam i put up the orc for my warrior troll.. it wont load the parts with the hit and miss.Doh its the pet stuff! Melee dont have a pet! So there a giant hole in it. :mad: <br />
If you want this for a melee youll need to make one for them. You lose the best parts. man and it looks cool to. IAm going to go mess around with it see if i can get it to work. Realy wisht he top bar would be there..<br />
<br />
<br />
:D <br />
Got it fixed..old ui had messed up my pet window. found it and fixed it now it shows up. nice. WOW.:nana:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a warrior and my pet window shows up anyway.  Try using the alt key to open pet info.  It should be there.  As to the Exp Alt Exp bar Im am really sorry i never noticed it till after i posted...  I tried sending an email asking them to pull them down so I could send new files but have yet to recieve a reply to 3 emails hehehe.  Anyway.  I know of 2 problems for sure with them, the exp alt exp reversal and there is a problem with the INI file I posted with them.  In the instructions its says to creat a directory for example of wc3undead but in the INI file the UISkin=blahblah line says undead1280 which is how i had them loaded on my machine for development so I sould sort out the resolutions as im working a 1024x768 version too.  Anyway, to fix this before copying the ini file and renaming to your character change the line UISkin=undead1280 or human1280 or orc1280 to wc3undead, wc3human, or wc3orcish depending on which UI you choose.  The Night Elf mod is being held back by the moderator of downloads and i think i know why.  I had a problem with the tracking window cause i made it druid friendly and its causing the red some of your xml files are incompatible message.  This is fixed already waiting to post a new one.  Please PM if you all are having problems getting them working etc.  I will do my best to help out.  You can email me at mcdonalj@shinbiro.com.  Valuable lesson in this about rushing out releases hehehe.  NEVER beta test your own junk your not objective enough, and probably too tired from working on them hehehe.  Sorry guys ill try to fix up things as i can.  in the mean time here is some links to the fix files for the Exp AA Exp reversal. <br />
<br />
For Human Mod:<br />
<br />
http://www.my-spiritwalker.com/UIFiles/HumanEQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Night Elf:<br />
<br />
http://www.my-spiritwalker.com/UIFiles/NightElfEQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Orcish:<br />
<br />
http://www.my-spiritwalker.com/UIFiles/OrcishEQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Undead:<br />
<br />
http://www.my-spiritwalker.com/UIFiles/UndeadEQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Once you DL these copy them to your wc3XXXXXX directory depeending on which UI you used and then rename it to take off the Undead or Orcish etc.  It should just be EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml.  This should fix your exp bar reversal.<br />
<br />
Sorry about this again.  I hope to get the fixed files upo to replace the current versions on EQInterface downloads but I can't get them to answer my emails.<br />
<br />
Take care.</div></div><hr />

Just wondering if if got misplaced, or if something changed in transit from you ta the Complete Sets mod download page.<br />

Anyway, using the Necro and human, and they rock!<br />

ps: still waiting for the 1024x768 version :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see it in the complete download section, am I missing something?  Or is there another place I can go to get it?<br />
<br />
I did try the undead one for my necro and I love it.  Keep up the nice work Spirit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shredomatic</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, that looks totally bad ass!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For all of you that are having trouble getting the fix for the Pet Window XML code that has reversed Exp and AAExp, please follow the procedures below.<br />
<br />
Click the link from my post and the XML code will open in a window.  <br />
<br />
From that window click &quot;File&quot; then &quot;Save As&quot; and point the directory list to your uifiles/wc3whichever directory.  Look for the file &quot;EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml and double click it.  <br />
<br />
You will be promted to overwrite the file as it already exists.  Click &quot;Yes&quot; to overwrite it.<br />
<br />
That should get you going. <br />
<br />
I work with computers so much that at times I make assumptions that everyone would know this, for that I applogize.  When I posted the code for these mods to EQInterface I was VERY tired and also excited to get them out for you guys and broke a cardinal rule about beta testing your own code.  I should have let some get them early on so I could find these things ahead of time.  I hope it hasnt been to inconvenient for you guys and please feel free to tell me any other things you may find wrong.<br />
<br />
As to the Night Elf UI I would sear on a stack of bibles that I posted it but I must not have.  Sleep deprivation :P  Anyway I will be posting it to the complete sets with my others tonight when i return from work.  Its worth it as it is MUCH better then the last druidui I made and is more cross class friendly.  I incorporated many lessons learned form the first one into these 4 and expect fully to learn more from these for later releases.  I have been asked by a user to create a 800x600 reso human mod because she has trouble seeing the small items in the 1280 one.  My comment aobut the video card earlier was not very nice and I honestly did no take into account the folks with accessibility issues so I will be modding the Human UI for 800x600.  It will be very stripped down cause of the amount of space to work with.  Since I am doing it I will likely produce a 800x600 reso release for all of them since it isnt hard to migrate code between graphics.  Hang in there guys.  I hope I havent had any of you tearing your hair out.  Thanks for all the nice comments and emails it is nice to know that your work is appreciated as any of the other skinners out there will likely agree.  Good luck to all and keep your eyes peeld for the 1024 x768 and 800x600 versions.<br />

If your not running 1280x1024 resolution in game then that would cause what you describe.  Other then that I have no clue.<br />

I love all 4 of these UI's and the fact I can easily move them around depending on what kind of mood I am in.  &quot;Sure, I can Cure Disease.  (/load orcui)  You sure you really want it though? &quot; Hahaa.  <br />

I've had the nightelf mod since you first put it out, and have been having problems with ONLY the inventory.  I know I could have said something sooner, but I keep forgetting about it.  Anyway, the inventory window (for ME, at least) is pretty much transparent except for the text and the equipment slots.  Also, whenever I have it open, I have bad flashbacks from days of reeally bad lag.  But as soon as I close the inventory window, the lag goes with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The XML file for the Night Elf file located at:<br />
<br />
http://www.my-spiritwalker.com/UIFiles/NightElfEQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Actually causes the AAExp/Exp bars to switch, because the AAExp and Exp bars were not broken in the one I downloaded... <br />
<br />
And number 2... for Lazaru5...<br />
<br />
The inventory thing is explained in:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4070&amp;highlight=night+elf<br />
<br />
Just delete the EQUI_Inventory.xml file... if you are using the old night elf mod with the green leaves, then download the night elf color mod and unzip it.  I think the green leaves version is now called the &quot;druid&quot; skin... but its midnight and im getting sleepy...<br />
<br />
Should take care of your problem, it worked for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still really like these mods alot.  It took only a few minutes to get used to having things in different places, like the spell icons across the top of the screen.  And there is no way to say that the graphics and colors do not add to the gaming experience.  Hell these mods are fun.<br />
<br />
If there was one thing I could/would change though is the inventory/hotbutton panel.  The buttons and icons are so very small.  I find myself not using them much at all because of that, and then when I do, I am just as liable to hit the wrong icon/button when I do try and use it.  When I looked at the 1600 version, I noticed a bigger buttons and no inventory icons.  It was cleaner, and looked easier to use.  Is there anyway to bring some of that over to the 1280 version?  <br />
<br />
This is just a suggestion and a request.  Do not read it as a complaint.  The mods are still fantastic.</div></div><hr />

I'm using the nightelf one at 1280x1024.  The only think I have problems with is that battle spam.  Since the battle spam chat window is small I find myself wanting to scroll back in it to see messages I missed.  However I can't seem to scroll it as the window appears to be under the xp graphic tile.  I've moved it around so the chat area is ontop of the graphic but when I died it switched back and I believe that when I relog it will probably go back.  Any ideas how to fix this?<br />

Basically I want to be able to use my mouse wheel to scroll back messages in the battle spam windows on the left.<br />

I am having a problem though with the windows under the xp bar at the left of the screen....all I have is a totally clear space where I assume my battlespam is supposed to be. I also do not get the My hits/misses or NPC hits/misses window...also clear space (ie I can see right through it to the play screen. Both xp and aaxp bars show up fine though....any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

Can't you simply click in the window (and/or mouse over it) and use your wheel?  I've done it alot, I don't see why it wouldn't work for you.</div></div><hr />

It appears to me that the pet window has two transparent areas.  The three little chat windows show through the pet interface at these locations.  The default UI for this setup has the three little windows setup to be black, and positioned so you see the output area but the text entry area which isn't used is covered up by the graphics.<br />
<br />
So if I move my mouse over these little windows they do fade in so that works.  However using the mouse wheel doesn't do anything.  If I go in and unlock the pet UI and move it exposing the three little windows.  Then I unlock one of the windows.  I change the nonfaded level to 100% so I can see it easily and I stretch the window up high past the area where the pet UI graphics cover.  Then I move the Pet UI back into place.  Then finally I resize the little chat window back so it is the size of the cutouts in the pet ui graphic.  The chat window works fine.  I can scroll it now and everything works fine.  If I exit out of EQ or die when I get back in the chat part is under the pet ui again.  Think of it as if the pet UI has two glass windows in it.  It seems to default to having the UI on top of the chat windows.  So my question is does anyone know how to control the layering of the UI elements??<br />

My custom UI is currently a mix/match of things that I've gone through and downloaded piece by piece. I've had to make some adjustments to make it work from time to time, but I like the end result.<br />
<br />
I have a noob-ish question...<br />
<br />
When using this setup, will other mods I may load in (the one from EQAtlas springs to mind immediately) have the same borders and such?<br />
<br />
Okay I lied. Two noob questions.<br />
<br />
If I delete your Tracking Window file to get it to load the default one, will I need to make changes to particular XML files so I can make the tracking window more useful for my ranger?<br />
<br />
FINE. Three questions... :rolleyes: <br />

Ok, ok, not so patiently after all. <br />
Please, please fix this quickly. I love using this UI so much.</div></div><hr />

If you go though the patch description it works pretty good.  The only problem I had was I needed to rename the song icon in the menu from *4.* to *6.* and make the changes in the xml to match when they say to at *4.*.<br />
<br />
Other than that is was straight forward.  Now I'm gonna create my own version of short term bufs that matches the one that is in this UI for regular bufs. <br />
<br />
I would post the fixed version but I'm not sure how to and I merged all the default UI elements into my nightelf UI so I don't have anything missing.  Good news is my UIerrors file is always totally empty now :)<br />

Carien has made it VERY easy, but to help you out a little, open up the files by RIGHT CLICKING  on them and chosing ot open them in NOTEPAD. Then under EDIT, chose FIND and where she says Search/Find, search for the thing on the first line after she says that within the QUOTATION marks, and then add in what she says AFTER everything she says (I am repeating the instructions she has in there anyway)<br />
<br />
There is one thing you HAVE to make sure you fix, is the EQUI_Animations.xml file, okay?<br />
<br />
That will fix your problem, jsalari.</div></div><hr />

Programming leaves me in the dust, I just cant seem to get the hang of it.  I barely got the original ui I am using running (took about 4 friends and 2 hours to sort out my stupidity).  <br />

People like me need people like the programming gods that post here for insight and directions, and I thank you guys for all the help in the past, but it looks like I will have to run default for a while until my ui gets patched =(<br />

<br />
For the post about (buy a better graphic card)...  it's not that for me.  I thought I'd upgrade my monitor to an LCD panel... love it... but I couldn't afford the 1280 LCD.. so ended up with the 1024 version.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure there are more people out there in my situation so not posting in 1024 is reallly annoying...  :(  <br />
<br />
To resize to 1024 is it just a matter of resizing the graphic pieces? or is it editing the xml?  I know how to work with graphics but not xml.</div></div><hr />
