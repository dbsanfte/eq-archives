<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kyndriana</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello again, your frustrated EQ GUI'er here. You've probably read my earlier post ( My earlier frustrated post (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11597)). Well, I went ahead and deleted EQClient.ini and all of my toon.ini's. I pulled all of the mods out of my singular folders and put them into one main folder out of the way. I WANT those files in the main folder. I am at a fork, as the post suggests. I can either just download full UI's and deal with it (can ya tell I don't like this idea?) OR I can download full UI's and &quot;tweak&quot; them with the files that I reallllly want. I'll post the links here so you get an idea of what I'm talking about. Please, I know there's a way, can someone help me??<br />
<br />
Link to full UI I wanna use Druid UI (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1249) <br />
<br />
and four of ten or more (depending on toon, 10 is the least) of the &quot;inner&quot; mods I wanna insert into main UI<br />
<br />
<br />
Insert One (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2284) <br />
<br />
<br />
Insert Two (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1790) <br />
<br />
<br />
Insert Three (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=376)<br />
<br />
Insert Four (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=667)<br />
<br />
<br />
On my trader, I'd really like to add: [Because I work from a laptop and the lag, etc is horrible, I think this would help]<br />
<br />
Trader Mod (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2826)<br />
<br />
<br />
I just know there is a way to do this. I know it! I can almost see it (except the trader mod *brainfry*), I just don't know the code or what else to change. It's going to be inserting these particular mods into that particular line in the main UI....somehow. Right?  But thats where my guesswork ends and ya'lls help, hopefully, comes in. I am begging here, I am at my wits end. If you can just show me one example of this UI tweaked with these mods, I'll do my best to do all of the others and ya'll will hear nothing from me again except thanks and.. LOOK!!! My first mod/UI! <br />
<br />
 ;) <br />
Thank you ever so much!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the trick:<br />
  Decide which UI you want as your BASE.   Now, download your other items that you wish to include. <br />
<br />
Then comes the important part -- Compare the contents of the UI Modifications.  Check the following things; <br />
 Which XML files are modified? Which graphic files are modified?  Do any of the packages modify the SAME file? Do any of the packages require/depend on other XML files in the same package?  (Example: Does say the Trader mod require certain changes to the XML in the EQUI_Animations.xml file that are different than the ones in your Druid UI. This is just an example). <br />
Once you've answered those questions, you'll be able to tell what your next step really should be. <br />
<br />
If you want the features of more than on UI set, and the UI items you want to change each require other pieces of XML to be modified, you're just going to have to learn XML and code it.  Learning enough to identify various items in the XML code should not be too difficult, and will almost certainly be less painful than posting the same question in 3 different forums and being frustrated waiting for an answer. <br />
<br />
I know I haven't completely solved your problem.  I'm just pointing you to the right road.   To quote one of my favorite movies, &quot;Endeavor to perservere.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kyndriana</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to say thank you to Cairenne and Lothay. No, you didn't answer my questions with an easy answer, you pointed me in a direction I have found that I want to follow anyway. I want to mix/match, make UI's, make mod's. Make the UI that I use personal to ME. If anyone else likes it, great, but people come here looking for something that matches them personally. <br />
I've been, for days now, searching and making files on .xml tutorials, saving favorite pages, etc. I was sooo ready to begin my first UI, till I figured out that sidl wouldn't work for me. =/ <br />
So, back to the drawing board. I INTEND to make UI's for my toons that I like for that toon, right down to the casting bar. Someday this will happen. Until then, I will try not to ask questions that can be found elsewhere, I will try to work things out on my own. I can only ask that some of you will be here for particular questions related to particular tags, etc. <br />
Again, thanks,<br />
