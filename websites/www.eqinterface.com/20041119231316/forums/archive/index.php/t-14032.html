If it's that boring, maybe you're playing the wrong game?</div></div><hr />

They don't have their attention focused on their group or raid. If there was a way I ban them from the game. They endanger the other players by doing so. So like Fyste says, if you're bored with playing EQ, well there aree other games out there, preferably single player so they don't endanger the other players.</div></div><hr />

Umm.. i multibox.. i either play 2 or 3 characters and i assure you know one has ever died because i was playing 2 or 3 characters at once... i played a warrior cleric and enchanter for a while.. but lately ive been playing a beastlord, enchanter, and druid... my attention is more focused on my group then someone playing one character... and having an ingame movie player i would guess he would use it while camping a certain mob.. i remember camping lord grimblox for cleric, phinney, etc etc with my characters and being bored out of my skull =\<br />

I use a leaktek tv tuner and it lets me run picture in picture. I set it to &quot;always on top&quot; and run eq with WinEQ. I can 2 box and have the tv on in the corner of my screen with no more lag than normal.<br />
<br />
I also have the tv on, even when raiding. I am also the main puller for my guild. So saying peopl dont pay attention due to the tv is not always true.</div></div><hr />
