The description of the skin is as follows:<br />
<br />
This skin is design to be used at resolution 1600 x 1200.<br />
<br />
It is based on the work of others - I have mostly built upon the code of others from skins downloaded from this site.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank all those that I have borrowed code from - I will referance the authors that I know deserve the credit, if I misreferance someone else's work I apologies in advance. <br />
<br />
Listed below is a breakdown of the sections of the skin.<br />
<br />
1) Main basis for skin is taken from Katn's Katntkuic.zip and Aya's version 5. Normally I keep the fade transperancy set to zero, except for the chat areas in the viewport at the bottom. (Transparency set to 100 for screen shot)<br />
<br />
Target Window - Removed stats and enlarged percentage.<br />
<br />
Pet - health gauge hidden and buttons realigned.<br />
<br />
Container - Has clickies for primary, secondary, ranged and ammo - No adjustments from Aya's design.<br />
<br />
Viewport - Same as Aya design, no adjustment.<br />
<br />
2) Group Window is Geppen's - I added the mana bar and changed layout to be horizontal.<br />
<br />
3) Hot Buttons is Splitpaw's - Removed inventory slots, except primary, secondary, ranged and ammo. Added character stats.<br />
<br />
4) Bank window is Armengar's - No adjustments.<br />
<br />
5) Spell Book is Will201's from the beraz set - No adjustments.<br />
<br />
6) Merchant Window is Sylphan's - No adjustments.<br />
<br />
7) Spell Gems (Author unknown) - Adjusted to work with main skin set.<br />
<br />
Thanks again to all those that made the original code that I adjusted - This is my first attempt at coding in XML so I would not have known were to begin with out seeing your code.<br />
