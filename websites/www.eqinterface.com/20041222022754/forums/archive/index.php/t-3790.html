But frankly none of them seem to portray the Bard in the light I think they should be in. So I'm just going to buckle down and do one myself.<br />
<br />
What I need to know from you is --<br />
<br />
What would you like to see on there.<br />
<br />
What do you NOt want to see on there<br />
<br />
Very simple questions really. Keep in mind, this is going to be geared soley for bards, and I may or may not listen to your suggestions. Obviously though I can't think of everything so if you have something that you want in let me know. It can't hurt to voice your opinion.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to post here you can e-mail me at toyni_arndroicht@hotmail.com and let me know there.</div></div><hr />

Also some lvl of patch resistance (if that's possible) like Drakah has with his. I also like a little bit of eye candy with my UI so something graphically appealing too.</div></div><hr />

It was the spell gems stacked 4 on 4, ie two rows of 4 gems on top of 4 gems with the book to the side.  Perfect imho for the bard.  If you could come up with something small and compact like that then that would be great!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyndylla</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main character is a bard, and I combined a few UIs to get what I wanted and needed. :) <br />
To start with, I snagged Kaori's KaoUI Version 4.0 and set the hot buttons to my liking so I could facilitate switching instruments and weapons with ease. Then Cairenn kindly suggested her container mod when I asked about something like that on the Kaori thread. That mod includes the primary, secondary, range and ammo slots at the tops of the containers, making switching much easier. Then I took things a step further and downloaded Frostwolf's EQ Tradeskill Companion, since I have mastered a few tradeskills (my second EQ passion lol). I'm going to try Muse's EQ Atlas Generator very soon as well, as that would be an immense help to the fleet footed bard. For eye candy, I downloaded T. King/Remilio's spellbook Mandoline, and T. King's spell gems and icons. Also, for ease of function, I downloaded Xymarra's Bard/Druid Tracking Window (nice big track/cancel buttons on it, no sorting options...much nicer tracking window for me).<br />
So far, all of these programs (except EQ Atlas Generator, I haven't tried it yet ;) ) have meshed just fine together. The only other things I can think of that I would need as a bard are not possible to create due to the info being hard-coded, but hey, I think every class has that problem. :D <br />
Hope that helps you in your quest.<br />
