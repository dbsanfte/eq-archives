<br />
1) You extracted all the files to you &quot;cutom&quot; folder, making sure that you did not extract any folders?<br />
2) Your &quot;custom&quot; folder is located in your &quot;uifiles&quot; folder and not in your &quot;default&quot; folder?<br />
3) Once you are in game you load your &quot;custom&quot; ui using &quot;/loadskin custom&quot; command?<br />
4) You checked the UIErrors.txt file in your EverQuest directory to see if any errors are present?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hughmanayers</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the Sars4 as my main Interface, now.  After doing some modifications to it, though.  My finding is that the Sars items, are sufficiently different that they do not work well alone at all.  I think, but haven't had the chance to test it, that the difference is in the core, uiplayer file, but I haven't found it.  In essence, just moving the Pet window over won't work, bacause the computer doesn't knwo where to find the graphics for that bar, or that the graphics it is using by default (since it doesn't know where the correct ones are) doesnt work with where thigs are, and Viola! broken UI.<br />
<br />
I gave up on mixing things from Sars into other UIs and instead turned it around so that i am matching other things to Sars instead.<br />
