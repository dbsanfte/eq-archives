<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yanedanielle</div><div class="date">03-25-2003, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using the Sars UI and I love it.  The problem I have, though, is I would like to be able to change what items I can have displayed in the right hand columns of the hotkey section.  For instance, it shows a ring - neither of my rings have an effect.  I used to have my ammo slot (horse bridle) showing, but now it doesn't.  It sure made it easy when I wanted to summon my horse to have it showing up right there without opening my inventory.<br />
<br />
I also have arms that I'd like to have in one of those slots for the right click effect.<br />
<br />
So, my question is, how do we change what items will show up in the right hand side of the hotkeys window?  Is there a method to the madness?  Do we need to know the number of the slot, or the name of the slot?  What do you suggest for altering these?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

I read the thread, but it honestly didn't help me much.  I really just want to change a few of the bags out for items, or items for items.  And Ccake won't do it for Sars... :(</div></div><hr />

He's made it so that even a total novice can make the changes quite easily. The XML file has comments built in as well to show what you're editing and what not to touch.<br />
<br />
Print out the read me file thats included in the zip and follow his step by step instructions. You can't miss</div></div><hr />
