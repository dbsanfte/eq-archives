I have currently not been able to log onto EQ for the last week, but am hopeful that next week I will be able to:)  Any ideas would be greatly appreciatted:)  I am a DE Cleric.  Thanks to all who add their ideas, I will be sure to post later what I try when I get on so others can see as well, so the chain will continue:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tefrod</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I created one for me and my friends and submitted it to eqinterface.com. It has the Name/HP gauge, the Mana gauge, the Stamina gauge (gonna remove that one for me), the Exp and Axp gauges, and at the bottom two numbers: %hp and %mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not too crash hot but about the only thing I can think of is a player window much like Qqueen says and also have the group window with every player and the % HP's for each displayed beside them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmier</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 11:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the group box mod wit the %'s already  but I preffer to take the title bar off each of my windows.<br />
<br />
 I would really love  for a buff bar that wrote the name of the buff inside the buff icon.  Not across  like one of the mods I saw. but keeping it small but inside the square have the name. <br />
<br />
for Player info though really only need HP, Mana, cast time is handy too. and unless its possable to make another idea of mine  then exp bars. (bars with %'s where possable   add HP current / max into the middle of the HP bar (less space) <br />
<br />
my other idea is for a box for just xp and AAxp  bars (w/percents if possable) and the % alocation buttons for aaxp +/- .  mainly to not clutter the player info box.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if it is possible to do this:)  I like that idea, it would really help I think.  I have not seen the new interface so do not know what the new icons are, but my girlfriend told me that some of the buff icons have changed.  This would be a big bonus until we learn all the new icons:)  If you see a sample of this I would love to see it:)  Thank you:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The idea of buff names inside the icon is possible BUT the positioning of the icons is hardcoded and the resizing of the window can cause the icons to move from their position, therefore the text (which has static positions) would no longer be 'inside' the buff icon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me know your thoughts on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmier</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats not a bad idea. and pretty easy to add actually. you could have it written in the middle of the HP bar  or put the %'s there and the F buttons on the side.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanje</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want just the group section?  Everything from the top to the group section is all one pannel.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanje</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to be more interest in just the F-key section. Rather than rip apart the existing code, I took Rombus Mindspire's Advanced mod and added the code to the group section since he already has the percentage info as well (hope ya dont mind Rombus, was just quicker and easier lol, if ya do mind, tell me to go stuff it and I'll ask to have the file removed ;) ). <br />
<br />
I also had to increase the width of the window to accomodate the text. Previous width was 154, current width is 160. <br />
<br />
The attached zip file is the Group Window Only.</div></div><hr />

For example, the Player info (self info) is too high up. Previously, with the old setup, I had everything lined up along the bottom of the screen. <br />
<br />
With the updates to some of the files with last nights patch, I'll be taking down the current  package I have linked above and working on a new one with a clean slate.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I did log into the game to check, and yes, the package I had above did blow up with the updated files. Those of you that have downloaded it and have used it, I'm sorry ;)</div></div><hr />

EQ hated it though and kept crashing when it didn't find PetHP in the Player window. <br />
<br />
So, I have to ask.  Will your group window show pet's hit points too? <br />
<br />
I really love the buff window someone posted that has the spell name right next to the icon, so I'd probably remove that personally.<br />

Good work!  I love it.</div></div><hr />

I also stuck in a bunch of other mods I found around including T.Kings's spellbook and a new compass.  Also removed all the extra labels and gadgets that I didn't need.<br />

I use target buttons on raids, they are placed in order of MTO with my CH button on top.<br />
<br />
I target by clicking on the group window.  What I need is a group window with more space between people, I hate CHing the chanter and watching the warrior die, this happened the other night.  I also want the percentage displayed to the right of the hp bar.<br />
<br />
I just need a window that has the bar, percent, name and is easy to target with by mouse and I would like to see the invite and disband on it but no title on top.<br />
<br />
Im slowly learning this xml stuff and have made a player window for myself but cant quite get this group window going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arie</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
<br />
I figured I would toss my UI in here also.  I'm pretty happy with it.  It is basically the vert mod, modified with a couple of addons.  I also have a spell casting vert-style bar that pops up above the target window that I got off of these forums.  I just forgot to add it into the SS.  A few things I love about this mod:  On the memmed spell bar, there are little red light dots that light up whenever a spell refreshes for recast, that is just neat.  On that target window, it has secondary hp sort of like the Exp bars with the secondary bar below them that updates.. it's just a little more interesting to watch I think.  I love having the extra inventory slots on this mod too because I can use modrods from right there in the corner and I can click my shawl for Koadic's Heightened Focus and also click horse without having to open up inventory window.  I changed the colors of the HP bars to red (like I am soo accustomed to) to make it more noticeable.  It is also really convenient to have my name at the top of the group menu for easy mouse click targeting.. (I use the mouse as much as I use hotkeys nearly).   Links below.. if anyone happens to want a copy of it just leave me a message in here.  Nothing special about it really.. I just think it's neat and easy to use... for me  ;).<br />

I love your mod. It looks great. I think it would work well for a mouse using cleric too. I would appreciate it if you could post where the mod can be downloaded or email the file(s) to me at: gordious@covad.net</div></div><hr />
