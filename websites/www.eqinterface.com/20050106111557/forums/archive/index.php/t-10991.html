Re-read.  What I said was that it isn't okay to bash SOE (in any forum) on this board.<br />
<br />
And, I didn't lock your post.  I'm presuming either Dolby or Kudane did.<br />
<br />
If you have any problems with the fact that I won't allow SOE bashing, or the fact that your thread was locked, take it up with one of them (Kudane or Dolby) in PMs.</div></div><hr />
