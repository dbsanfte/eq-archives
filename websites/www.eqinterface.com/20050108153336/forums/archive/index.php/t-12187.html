Is there a way to search the UI's for a specific resolution capability.<br />
<br />
I see alot of nice UI's but many are set for the 1280 x 1024.  At that resolution.. my machine bogs down, and text become very difficult to read.<br />
I usualy run in the 1024 x 768, with a very ecclectic UI (mix of alot of mods)  with a view port of 0 0 800 600.<br />
<br />
I am personaly looking for a complete UI to keep with a single look (minimal is my usualy standard, without any flashy borders, but lots of info available at a glance).<br />
<br />
So, is there a way to search for a specific resolution?<br />
<br />
good hunting.</div></div><hr />

All you need to is type in the resolution in the Search box on the left hand side of the EQInterface.com home page.<br />
<br />
Using 1024x768 (notice I removed the spaces) I came up with a page full of results.<br />
<br />
Also note that many of the UI's posted at the larger resolutions have optional versions for smaller reolutions. Cairenn's are a good example and I believe that Xym just patched his/her(?) 1024x768 version.</div></div><hr />
