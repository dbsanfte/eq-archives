<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tylinn</div><div class="date">10-11-2002, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been trying to Mod some the aspects of the Player Window. Sidlwidl makes this VERY easy, but I have run into a problum. I would like to make the Bars Larger. I play in 1280 mode and the text and graphics are too small. How can I make these Bars larger? :confused: <br />
<br />
   To give you a Idea of what I did, I was useing Maffo's Player Window. I like the Layout. But I don't need all the Stats, just the Resists, Weight, and AC.</div></div><hr />

So either make bigger background graphics or scrap them all together.</div></div><hr />

background graphic on a gauge <br />

There was no Background Graphic on it, that I know of. This is the link to the File I was trying to Mod.<br />

If you wish to take a look at it. My main complaint about most of the UI's is that they don't seem to be very friendly to the Higher Resolutions. Now, I could lower my Rosolution, this is true. But I like playing at the Higher levels. I seem to have a better view. But if I can't find a good way of doing this, then I guess I will have to lower it. :mad: <br />

You will need to modify the size and location (or else it will just grow down and to the right).<br />
<br />
You may need to update the size of the window itself (located close to the bottom) to accommidate the larger size.<br />
<br />
Generally, the graphic will stretch to the parimeters set for the guage size. I found this out on accident when I was making my Spectre Pet Info window. I rushed through and forgot to change the actual size of the guage to accommodate the larger HP meter (the scythe) and ended up with a skinny scythe that was incredibly distorted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astryne</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the file you uploaded:<br />
<br />
&lt;GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
  &lt;Background&gt;A_GaugeBackground&lt;/Background&gt; <br />
  &lt;Fill&gt;A_GaugeFill&lt;/Fill&gt; <br />
  &lt;Lines&gt;A_GaugeLines&lt;/Lines&gt; <br />
  &lt;EndCapLeft&gt;A_GaugeEndCapLeft&lt;/EndCapLeft&gt; <br />
  &lt;EndCapRight&gt;A_GaugeEndCapRight&lt;/EndCapRight&gt; <br />
&lt;/GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Nuke that &lt;Background&gt;...&lt;/Background&gt; line and it should work... I always nuke everything but the &lt;Fill&gt; line so if just taking out the background does not work, try taking everything but the Fill line out and then adding them back one by one until you get what you want.</div></div><hr />
