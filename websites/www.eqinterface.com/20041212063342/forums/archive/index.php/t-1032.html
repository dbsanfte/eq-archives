I lose mine a lot and was hoping someone has made a nice one that can be seen :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wonderbiff</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the same problem.  I am and will be looking for a mouse ICON made out of a sword ... bigger and more eq like and easier to find at raid time.  Also it should not be an existing eq graphic so it doesnt looke like 2 swords are on the cursor :)  when your holding that sword.  Finally I may set out to do this myself although I am not mega graphics man I am confident I can do it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wonderbiff</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well after playing with the rage icon as my cursor it is very nice but it is alas too easy to lose.  :(  Will be lookin for a new cursor.<br />
<br />
If some one has made another cursor please put it in this thread.<br />
<br />
Also can some one tell me if it is possible to put the information that makes the mouse cursor in some other file and maybe suggest a good file that probably wont change?  <br />
<br />
TIA<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khallin</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked at Verts UI, and it's very nice - but I didn't want everything he has.  So, I went through and chopped out parts I do use.<br />
<br />
What I really liked was how he did the mouse - although I think he should have left the default mouse in the window pieces file, and add the custom in a standalone mouse.tga.  That'd make it easier to customize.<br />
<br />
And on that vein... I'd like to see a &quot;shaman cursor&quot; - use the Spear of Fate in the same manner he used the Ragebringer.  It would probably be possilbe to do one per class.</div></div><hr />

Just takes time to complete them so be patient :) . Go check out his site you can get to it by going to the trans. forums as well . I put a link to the site as well in chit chat<br />
<br />
Also here is the photo I use for the pointer in mine till he has wizzy and whatnot done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DJPrez</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone or can I modified the cursor to be EXTRA LARGE?  I use a high res when playing and like most people I lose the cursor when battling and lots of casters are casting.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know, I can turn off the particles but I enjoy them.<br />
<br />
So, anyone have an idea as to how to increase the cursor size?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
