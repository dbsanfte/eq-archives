Straight from Sokol and Kudane comes a new slim MP3 player window in the vert style.. pre colored for Nexium and Neptune<br />
<br />
In the new Neptune Blue<br />

<br />
Download it Here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=692)<br />
<br />
In the older Nexium Purple<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=691<br />
<br />
Download it Here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=691)<br />
<br />
If you find any bugs with it, please post back here and Sokol or I will try to figure them out..<br />
<br />
Many Thanks goes to Sokol for his coding, for with out that this would not have happened and this is my first Original Mod, (by that i mean I created it from scratch to look like the rest of vert) though it is loosely based on the winamp button placement..<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Bad with song names... what kinda music is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">silencce</div><div class="date">12-07-2002, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i cant get this to work, the mp3 player wont show up, i even went to my UI_charName_92 file and found the options for the music window, changed show=0 to show=1 so that it would show up, and i also changed its position to be in the upper left corner so id be sure it was on the screen.. any idea's?</div></div><hr />

<br />
im not a total dub when it comes to this stuff, i've generally tried 90% of the common trouble shooting stuff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-07-2002, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not sure.... Sokol will swing by the forums, maybe he will have a better idea.. we self contained all the items so as long as all 3 pieces were in your UI folder it should work.</div></div><hr />

Did you try typing /mp3<br />
If so what version are you using of vert the exact name of the download?<br />
<br />
Let me know I worked with standard Vert 2.2 Crystal meth from the pop4 zip file so I'm unsure what the problem could be for you without further info as to your UI.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merlinus</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The songs are techno/dance/electronica (hard to say exactly what category really)  I've heard so many remixes of &quot;Rapture&quot; that it could be house, trance, progressive...etc, etc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Iio - Rapture&quot; was a huge hit in clubs over the last year or so, and has been on and off the radio since.<br />
<br />
Apollo 440 I know less about, but that song I know.  You'd probably recognize it if you heard it...I'm sure it's been in some movies.  I know it's fairly old...at least a few years.</div></div><hr />

I use Vert 2.2 CM version w/ some other vert mods, like vert spell and reverse buff window and such.  I tried the alt K thing and I typed /mp3 in my Vert UI.  Nothing showed.  Then I /load Default when the default ui came  up I did a /mp3 and alt K and still nothin.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

If you have the sound in EQ disabled or in your EQClient.ini file have it turned off and or have a NOSOUND.txt file in your EQ directory the MP3 player is also disabled</div></div><hr />
