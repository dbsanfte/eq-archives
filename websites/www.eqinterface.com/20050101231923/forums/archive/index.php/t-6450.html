<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tropo</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having a problem with the alignment issue useing the Dresthin-Thoth UI and was hoping someone could help me out. <br />
<br />
When I load the UI it loads up ok except that instead of all the pieces being connected like the picture for the UI, they are all over the screen.  Is this normal?  Am I required to piece them together in the correct spot?<br />
<br />
I had once used the quartz UI and initially it loaded and was perfect...then after one of the recent patches, I downloaded the new one and it too was giving me the same problem.<br />
<br />
I have tried placing all the parts together like they are supposed to be but for some strange reason they don't mesh well and have gaps and such.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Yes. The first time you load the ui it is necessary. After the first install you can avoid having to do this again by adding the number 1 at the end of the load command. ie; /load thoth 1 whenever you load a newer version.<br />
<br />
This will tell the ui to maintain the current locations for windows.<br />

Well, I cant speak for the author of the quartz ui, but I can tell you I removed the file that pre-sets the screen resolution and window placement for the Thoth ui because it makes the ui easier to load, reduces the need for patching in some cases and makes the ui more flexible and tailorable for each user. For instance some may want inventory on the left and character info on the right, while others may prefer the opposit.<br />
<br />
I for instance prefer no background texture and thus have it removed (tint black) on my own set-up with all windows made semi-transparent.  In otherwords, the ui is what you make of it. <br />
/shrug   Play with it and set it up the way you like.<br />
<br />
But I suspect the Quartz ui had the same file removed for much of the same reasons. <br />

I haven't had this problem and I'm not certain I understand what you mean.  Remember that the chat windows are yours to create/remove/adjust. Create however many chat windows you would like to have, (I use 4) and stretch/pull/place them wherever you like within the ui... by doing this you should be able to fill in any and all gaps quite nicely. Again this is for your flexibility... I personally have three chat boxes along the bottom of my screen as the picture of the ui shows and a fourth chat window up top and made transparent for serverwide chat.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. Good luck!</div></div><hr />
