EQ does not use the generic Transparent background for your files.  You have to define the exact parts that are to be included using what's called an Alpha Channel (Alpha means FIRST, and &quot;Channel&quot; basically means the part of the file that is looked at).  A full description of how to do this can be found in the Graphics Help forum.  Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

Im looking for the steps in saving a transparent .tga file. I know about layers and the alpha channel. <br />
 I need to know if I create a round window in 24 bit transparent, do I start out as a &quot;background&quot; or a &quot;layer 1&quot;?<br />
 Do I save those as the alpha or create a second transparent layer as the alpha?<br />
 If I create one of those as the alpha do I make a raster or vector layer to go over it?<br />
 Do I hit merge visiable before I save it to a .tga or just save it and let PSP merge them?<br />
<br />
<br />
I know its something simple, but at 3:51 in the mornning &lt;shrug&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolleo</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use PsP also, so i'll give you the quick steps I use. You start out with a standard rectangle/square blank image of the appropriate size (based off what is acceptable by the UI.)<br />
<br />
Don't worry about seperate layers if you're just trying to get a transparency over some portions of your image. Just draw the image you want, use the magic wand to select the &quot;empty&quot; space, click on Selections at the menu -&gt; invert, then Selections -&gt; save to alpha channel and click through the screens, then un-select the image ctrl-d, then save the image as a .tga and you're done.<br />
<br />
That's the simplest way of doing it in PsP, but not the only way. There is another way of using seperate layers, with varying degrees of transparency to get extremely clean edged images, and  partial transparency. Unfortunetly, I've yet to get anyone to explain this step on a sufficient level to actually get it to work when completed. <br />
<br />
Oh, and there is a good step-by-step instructional for PsP, with images, somewhere here on the forum. I know, cause I used it to learn this very thing.</div></div><hr />

I understand the invert process now. :)</div></div><hr />
