<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manta</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I created this spellbook because there just didnt seem to be anything evil enough out there. This is my first attempt at making a UI for the game, and I think it turned out pretty good. I am working on making a complete set based arround this spellbook too, so keep your eye out if you like this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alpacapagani</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'll hand it to you and say that this is a good first skin.  Although I myself would not use it, I'm sure others would.  I would like to offer some advice however for any future skins ya do/etc.<br />
<br />
1)  Detail &amp; cleanliness is a must for a UI to be popular.  Even though I'm not a huge poster, I look at almost every UI post here and some others in addition.  I've found that most people, including myself, prefer UI/UI skins that are more compact and constant.    <br />
<br />
2)  The less professional &amp;/or sleek the UI is, the less it will be downloaded.  This is fairly self-explanatory I think.  While the graphics you used were appropriate, the quality of the graphics was not up to par.  I'd suggest tweaking your graphics as much as possible before trying to utilize them into a UI.  If they look shantily made, people won't use the UI.<br />
<br />
3)  Try something really unique.  Ok, while I do like the typical stuff, I feel that trying new and orginal ideas is a great way to become established.  If your UI/skin is sporting some awesome new features that nobody except you has thought of yet, then more than likely people will react positively to your work.<br />
<br />
<br />
By no means was this post a negative post.  I'm calling this positive criticism, so please do not be offended by my suggestions.  Dunno why I posted on your UI, but.....just felt it was right. :D <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the concept is awesome, but it's a bit too satanic for me... and I used to be a Satanist myself! lol!<br />
<br />
I've been trying to capture the escence of the necro myself... so far my biggest breakthrough has been my Spectre Pet Info Box.<br />
<br />
Now, maybe if you did something similar, but more death oriented instead of demon and fire, I would love to have it  )<br />
<br />
AND I think the graphics aren't really too bad. I really like the chains, skull at the top, and kinda like the icon holders... although I think they look more... wizardish. Poison! Disease! Rotting! Night of the Living Dead takes over your EQUI! That's what I think is more necromantic. Kudos on the graphics again though  :-)</div></div><hr />

I downloaded it and it doesn't like my vert mod :(  the book graphic was all funky looking and garbled.  so back to vert's smaller book :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manta</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I havent heard about this yet, but I will definately look into it tonight and post a patch notice when I fix it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mayhym</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it a lot but since i dont know how to put it in with the Quartz UI that im using now I cant use it, but how about a vampire style spellbook I think that defines a majority of necro's best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkelf2216</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok guys i'm currently using ocean spray, but have bits and pieces of different mods.  I have the necromancer spell book and the necro compass working with ocean spray.  in order to use them together simply unzip the spellbook files into the vert (or whatever ui your using) folder.  it'll prompt you somthing about file already exists do you want to replace click yes to all and you should be good to go.  <br />
<br />
One more thing make surey ou have another copy of vert just in case something goes screwy.</div></div><hr />

Please complete the rest of this ui. I am no satanist buT I love death metal so this book is great when I'm playing EQ and listening to Slayer or Junglerot.</div></div><hr />
