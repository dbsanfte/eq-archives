<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xelot Bloodseer</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was using the IceBlue mod that used to be found at THIS LINK (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=813). The UI is either gone or has been moved.<br />
<br />
Since the Jan 28 patch, I'm summoned to Desktop everytime I zone. It will also summon me if I reload the Default settings. <br />
<br />
This is the first full UI that I've used and really liked it. Does anyone know if there is a way to fix it or if there is a fixed version available?<br />
<br />
I am attaching the original zip file if anyone wants to take a look at it. File is too big... &gt;5MB in size&gt; :(  I have zero experience with the XML stuff. There is no UIError file, I assume because the game instantly crashes to desktop.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help anyone can give, even if it's &quot;Find a new UI...&quot; I've also had the exact same problem with the Drestin-Thoth1.3a (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=301) interface.</div></div><hr />

If you would like to fix your UI please read the READ ME forum so you know what information we need to better help you.</div></div><hr />

The problem (in part) is with your Inventory Window.  Using a text editor (Word, WordPerfect, NotePad, etc.) to open the file (EQUI_Inventory.xml) in your custom folder.<br />
<br />
Using the Search/Find feature, look for:<br />
<br />
	&lt;StaticAnimation item= &quot;ClassAnim&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;ClassAnim&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;338&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;22&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;64&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;128&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;Animation&gt;A_ClassAnim01&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
	&lt;/StaticAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
(sizes and location may be different)<br />
<br />
and also look for:<br />
<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;ClassAnim&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
If either of those aren't in your file, add them.  If the ClassAnimation isn't supposed to show, change the size in the first part to 1,1.<br />
<br />
Also, *where* did you put the files from  28 Jan 03 - UI Changes - UPDATED ONCE MORE 12:36am EST (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6012) ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I fixed it!!!!<br />
<br />
LoY will probably trash it again, but for the time being, it's working! I can zone! Thank all of you for your help. I tried to make changes as systematicly as possible, but got lost at 1:30am this morning. :rolleyes: I basicly followed the links that I posted earlier, but realized that I had forgotten the EQUI.xml (or I overwrote because I got lost)<br />
<br />
Cairenn, I edited my EQUI_Inventory.xml file as you suggested. It broke my UI and just loaded the default. So I overwrote the altered file with a backup copy. It still gives the error line about the ClassAnim, but it's not effecting my zoning now. Visually, there's no issues and everything seems to work as it did. <br />
<br />
I added the lines in the iceblast EQUI.xml file (After checking, I realized that I had forgot that part), not the Default.<br />
<br />
The 3 file zip was expanded to the Default directory. One was overwritten by the patcher when I logged in (The EQUI_CharacterCreate.xml, I think).<br />
<br />
I swapped characters before I logged out, so it overwrote my error file. :(  Next time I log in, I'll get the error file and post it for you. But I can say, somewhere in that list of links is the solution.<br />
<br />
Xiss... I've attached the SS of the UI I use. It's not from the person you mentioned. It has all the info I want to see, but uses the /viewport keeps all the windows outta my field of view. Plus it has that cool inventory screen. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Xelot, I would suggest you got to the Mix &amp; Match section and upload your mod.<br />
<br />
the download section can hold upto 6 megs.. and I would name it &quot;Xelot-UI&quot; sooo that when someone ask &quot;what UI is that&quot; you can point them to the Download section..<br />
<br />
use the screenshot you have, and credit Vert 2.2 for base, TT_Inventory and Me for the MP3 player.. and you will be golden..<br />
<br />
two tips<br />
<br />
1. don't upload it to complete sets.. it will jsut get deleted (its not original work by you) <br />
<br />
2. make sure to have ONLY the modified files in your zip, please none of the unchanged default files..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xelot Bloodseer</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is, the original .zip that I got has an entire copy of the Default folder in it. Here is the original README.txt file<br />
(NOTE: IceBlastUI.jpg is the screenshot of this UI you can view before choosing to install it.)<br />
<br />
Instructions:<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
1. Extract the file UI_Icetope_45.ini into your EverQuest folder.<br />
<br />
2. Find the UI file just like UI_Icetope_45 in your EverQuest folder that has the name of your character on it and delete it.<br />
   The number at the end of your file might be different because it's the number for the server you play on. Rename<br />
   UI_Icetope_45.ini using your character name and server number just like it appeared on the file you just deleted.<br />
<br />
2. Go inside the uifiles folder that resides within the EverQuest folder and create a new folder named iceblast and make sure not to use any capital lettering.<br />
<br />
3. Extract all the other files from this .zip file into the new iceblast folder.<br />
<br />
4. Make sure your using the 1024x768 resolution in EverQuest.<br />
<br />
5. Start up EverQuest and once in game type: /viewport 0 0 872 615<br />
<br />
6. Grats you now got a kick @$$ UI.<br />
<br />
Should I go thru the folder and visually compare them to the default and remove the duplicates? The .zip has 172 files and the default folder has 174 (on my system).<br />
<br />
I would like to upload the skin. It rocks for melee, but there's no spellbook button... hehe...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, <br />
<br />
the UI was made back when you needed the copy of the default folder..<br />
<br />
but at least if you go through and removed the &quot;default&quot; pieces, you wont crash as often, and fixing it will be a breeze..<br />
<br />
little more work now for a lot less work later.</div></div><hr />
