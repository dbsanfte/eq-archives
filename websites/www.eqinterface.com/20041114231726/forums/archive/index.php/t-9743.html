<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArkonFerat</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey folks...<br />
<br />
I'm just back to EQ after a year or so away, and this time I'm playing on my Mac.<br />
<br />
So, I've been looking around for a UI I can bring over to that side that meets all the things I want in a UI...<br />
<br />
But, while there are some great ones out there, they just aren't really doing the job. Most UIs I see seem very similar, at least in their general construction. They're all very boxy, and they all seem to conform to the &quot;dashborad&quot; look and feel.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking about something a little more spacious... particularly in regard to the bottom of the screen!<br />
<br />
We don't have windowed mode on the Mac yet, so even with a thin &quot;dashboard&quot; UI I still have to look down a lot to see what I'm attacking when it's close. And, I have to have a lot of transparency going on in order to loot or follow paths... and it makes text really hard to read...<br />
<br />
So, I'm thinking about something with a layout like this:<br />
<br />
CornerUI_sketch (http://idisk.mac.com/plaidpjs/Public/EQ/CornerUI_beta.jpg)<br />
<br />
Mind you, the lines aren't for actual/necessary shape, just for position and layout. I'd really like to know what you all think, particularly whether or not it will work. And, if there is anyone out there who might be willing to lend some assistance in helping me build it, as I really don't know as much as I should to do so (but, I'm still going to give it a shot).<br />
<br />
Caio!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's definately an interesting idea, but where are the chat windows? Most people use at least one decent size chat window, if not 2 or more. Those windows are what hogs up a lot of good screen space but they are somewhat of a necessity. Anyways, figure out where you think the chat windows would best fit and then redraw your concept. The UI layout reminds me of Quartz in a way, and also whoever made those Boots with all sorts of info crammed together and made to sit in the corners of your screen.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with creativity, so keep up the good work :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArkonFerat</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eloora,<br />
<br />
The chat windows are meant to be free floating, but will probably best orient to the top of the screen.<br />
<br />
As such, I didn't add them into the sketch. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback...<br />
<br />
Caio!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rebaidah</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does look interesting :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah ok i see. You'd be surprised how much the chat windows impact the whole UI, that's why I thought you should include them somewhere in your sketch. This is me spouting still lol, but I tried the whole UI at the top of the screen thing once, and it drove me nuts...but who knows it might work for others (I'm kind of a UI snob :D)<br />
Anyhoo, can't wait to see the progression!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eMaRi DaRkLiGhT</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, Eloora.  Everytime I've put anything that wasn't at least mostly transparent at the top of the screen, I catch myself ducking a little bit while I'm playing...LOL.  I know that sounds wierd but when the majority of the UI isn't at the bottom of the screen I get this clostrophobic (sp?) feeling, like walking in a room with a low ceiling...maybe that's just me.<br />
<br />
I do like the concept though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArkonFerat</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehehehe... and here I am feeling like someone's holding a board under my chin with all of the UI at the bottom of the screen!<br />
<br />
I'm starting to work on some graphics for this thing and I'll post some rough ups as soon as I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ArkonFerat, looking forward to seeing more tentative work on this; it's an interesting concept. I want to see it develop as a NEW UI; please avoid using others' graphics. If you make your own, the UI will be a nice fresh new style rather than just a rehashed t.king or Vert knockoff (which is what my UI is, humorously enough). Not that t.king or Vert or any of the other popular UIs are bad, I just think a new style'd be nice.<br />
<br />
Eloora, you probably aren't any more of a UI snob than most people; there's no accounting for taste. I personally like a U-shaped UI (like the old old original EQ marble interface) so that's how mine's laid out (actually it's evolved into a transparent O). My best friend could care less about his UI and toys around with window positions and UI styles pretty constantly, he kinda dislikes the UIs that require windows to fit together and that need a UI file for proper placement though.<br />
<br />
Enok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArkonFerat</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, Haliken, I so do not want to reuse other peoples art work. Some of it is very good mind you, but I am going for a completely different sensibility here. However, I am also not a &quot;great&quot; detail artist... so as this progresses, i will welcome assistance in spiffing things up from any ofthe VERY accomplished artisans on this site... if they are so interested.<br />
<br />
Second, I do want to develop this as a new UI, but will be working on it from the perspective of having it used in Mac EQ, which will, unfortunately, be two releases behind PC EQ after Dungeons is out. If there is enough interest from you PC folks, I will try and keep a PC dev going as this one progresses.<br />
<br />
AND... without futher ado, this is what I have put together so far... CornerUI_v.01 (http://idisk.mac.com/plaidpjs/Public/EQ/testUI.jpg) <br />
<br />
It's only graphics at the moment, and I have tried to move away from straight lines in the corner. I thought I'd be moving faster then I am, but making final decisions on where things will go and what size they will be is more work then I thought.<br />
<br />
CAIO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArkonFerat</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another update...<br />
<br />
I've added positioning on the group window elements, the target elements, and the start of the player elements in the top corner.<br />
<br />
Feedback is welcome... if anyone wants to supply some.<br />
<br />
Corner UI v.02 (http://idisk.mac.com/plaidpjs/Public/EQ/testUI2.jpg)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArkonFerat</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And, yet another version update for the holiday weekend... I mocked this graphics update over a blank screenshot to get an idea of how it would look in game.<br />
<br />
Corner UI v.03 (http://idisk.mac.com/plaidpjs/Public/EQ/testUI3.jpg)<br />
<br />
The files a little big...<br />
<br />
Any feedback?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solonis</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I for one, think it is looking Damn Good!  You have some very interesting concepts working here :)<br />
<br />
I look forward to seeing this UI develop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Irras</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty dead set in my UI, but looking at the concept all i can say is &quot;wow&quot; I may just have to start using that one if someone actually makes it :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, that looks quite good! It's clean cut, and doesn't sacrifice too much as far as information.  The only thing I can't figure out is where to put chat windows without sending it right back to cluttered.<br />
<br />
This is something I've been constantly wrangling with on my own UI... the chat windows. I can't function to the best of my ability without at least 2 windows to 'partition' the tremendous amounts of info that scroll by. (As a support role class, druid, I can't afford to miss certain events)<br />
<br />
My instinct would be to put them right above those player HP bars - right back to &quot;dashboard&quot; or &quot;console&quot; feel again. :rolleyes: It seems inevitable, I can't stand text being transparent and so far haven't found 'free floating' text to be viable.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Tellgar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rebaidah</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definately gonna keep an eye on this one.  I'm curious though.. the player info window, you have a 100/100 in 2 places and then the hp and mana have the percentage on them.  What are these 2 separate 100/100 numbers for?  I was thinking perhaps it was for a min/max hp, but then what is the 2nd one?  Weight maybe? hmmm :)<br />
<br />
It is looking very nice.  Love the &quot;newness&quot; of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArkonFerat</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, Rebaidah, the numbers in the cut outs are for numerical representations of current and max hitpoints and mana. Trying to cover 3 bases for the multiple ways people like to see the information.<br />
<br />
Second, below you will find an update to the ongoing graphics development. This update shows the cast spell bar, the buffs bar, compass, and a &quot;test&quot; chat window layout.<br />
<br />
I still need to do the pet info window, which I think will be free floating similar to the cast spell bar, and the inventory window, which I have a cool idea for.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think!<br />
<br />
Corner UI v.04 (http://idisk.mac.com/plaidpjs/Public/EQ/testUI4.jpg)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solonis</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking Good!  Since your still in the design phase, here are a couple of thoughts.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that the Lag meter is locked in the upper left corner.  It may over lap the compass for those people that have it showing.<br />
<br />
Will the chat windows be movable?<br />
<br />
I for one, like the buff icons to be full size, however, even if you choose not to have a full size version of the buff bar have you considered a version for the right side of the screen?<br />
<br />
Good work!  /Goes off to wait for the next update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rebaidah</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, Rebaidah, the numbers in the cut outs are for numerical representations of current and max hitpoints and mana.

<br />
Ah that was my first impression, I did not think it was possible to have a numerical representation of the min/max mana.  Just noticed, will you have a bar under xp for aa exp? And where will the options buttons be?<br />
<br />
Still liking the look alot, can't wait to give it a try!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like this idea as it is taking advantage of natural &quot;blindspots&quot;, making the UI less obtrusive, all I would recommend is using a theme that is consistent with the games environment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArkonFerat</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, Thomus.<br />
<br />
Can you explain what you mean by a &quot;theme&quot;? I'm assuming you mean colors and textures. But that was one thing I was trying to get away from...<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking a look!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaer</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">will the group box have % signs on the members?</div></div><hr />

will the group box have % signs on the members?  <br />
<br />
Yes... I just forgot to add them to the mock graphic.<br />
<br />
And, i have another update coming, probably by the end of the weekend, but I am a little stuck with the INV window... I thought I had it locked and then realized I forgot spaces for wrist slots... D'OH!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cryogenic</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking real sweet :)<br />
<br />
Would be nice to see the AA XP bar added under the XP Bar and maybe a percentage total in each of them as in the HP and Mana bars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArkonFerat</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehehe... I never knew how hard these things could be...<br />
<br />
But, here is the latest screeny... Corner UI v.5 (http://idisk.mac.com/plaidpjs/Public/EQ/testUI5.jpg)<br />
<br />
You'll note there have been changes made to the Player Window (upper right corner), primarily adding the AA XP bar and the percentage tags to STA (which I don't know whether it can be displayed as such), XP, and AA XP.<br />
<br />
There were also minor shape and position changes made to the Hot Buttons Window (bottom left corner), and the Top Bar of the UI (which will eventually hold the Pet Info Window).<br />
<br />
This also includes my finalized Inventory Window. I know it does not include all of the slots that you PC folk have, but it is modular in design, and will be easily adaptable to include the extra slots when I get to that point.<br />
<br />
Feedback?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for now, this is a slightly updated screenie... added the previously missing money slots, added a few missing tags, chqanged some spacing and made a re-draw of the top bar which will shortly show the Pet Info window and maybe the compass.<br />
<br />
CornerUI v.5-5 (http://idisk.mac.com/plaidpjs/Public/EQ/testUI5-5.jpg)<br />
<br />
Caio!<br />
<br />
PS - And, when the time comes, I will gladly take any and all assistance in coding a working PC version of the UI.<br />
<br />
PPS - Can any of you PC UI gurus send me an email with a list of the buttons, slots, and tags, that are available on the PC which you do not see included in this latest screenie? You can email me at ArkonFerat (plaidpjs@mac.com), just be sure to put &quot;CornerUI&quot; in the subject line.</div></div><hr />

I would be interested as to what it would look like with a pet window<br />
Well worth taking for a spin<br />
Looking forward to trying it out</div></div><hr />

<br />
So only mac users are the only ones that can use this ui?  If so I will be sad......  That is a really nice ui :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArkonFerat</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, Kilaer, I do know I don't have a Charm slot. This first run at the graphics are based on what is available for MacEQ... our release included everything through Planes of Power (no Charm slot, no Shared bank slots, no Shared plat slot).<br />
<br />
As soon as I have the final graphic set for Mac, I will make the laterations for a PC version, then go to final coding.<br />
<br />
Second, speaking of finalized graphics, I think I may be there... I have been debating making custom AA and Bazaar windows, as well as Cast and Breath windows, but Imay just leave those as a later add-on.<br />
<br />
So, here it is... CornerUI v.6 (http://idisk.mac.com/plaidpjs/Public/EQ/testUI6.jpg)... complete with Compass and Pet Info windows!<br />

Can't wait till you make a PC version of it.<br />
<br />
One question though you have the Pet info integrated into the top bar. Is there anything else that you can have in there instead of that no need for the bar if not a pet class.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking about just leaving it clear... or having an alternate layout for melees/no pet class that puts buffs up there... more full-size.<br />
<br />
Otherwise it may jus get dropped to a smaller size and left to be space for chat windows...<br />

This is beautiful.  Amazing graphics look, clean and functional. <br />
<br />
I know I would use this UI if it were available for a PC.  (While I have and love a Mac, it's not running Mac OS X, nor does it have the video hardware to run EQ.)  <br />
<br />
If you want any assistance I can give on coding a PC version, please feel free to ping me for it.  I'm drooling just thinking about using this one. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moze Emdoyne</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First  let me say that this UI could and probably would make me STOP using Delta3.0 entirely...  Always found it a bit too dark for my liking... And this is a VERY clean UI..<br />
<br />
That being said... Im looking at this from a high-end, time-enabled point of view as well...<br />
<br />
Use a view port... or at least it LOOKS as though your designing this to be used at set resolutions...  Everything I see here looks simply brilliant but I DO see a problem with chat box positioning... The only real way I see to get around it is to raise the bottom portion of the UI (Hotkeys, group, target info) and place the chat windows underneat...  Otherwise your going to have entirely too much of the viewing area being taken up by awkwardly placed chat boxes... Using Delta3.0 right now and 4 chat boxes (2 dedicated to melee, 1 to raid channels, 1 to guild/group/say not to mention emotes, other info etc) it all kind of builds up :)<br />
Silding the chat boxes underneath would let you dedicate 2 to melee or spells and 2 to chat (guessing roughly from the size of items displayed)<br />
<br />
That being said...<br />
<br />
It looks simply amazing...</div></div><hr />
