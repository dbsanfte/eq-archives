<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakrarna</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to load some custom UI skins into my EQ.  I have found a few sites that sort of describe what I need to do, but nothing seems to work.<br />
<br />
These are the things I've tried:<br />
<br />
I put the xml files into the default folder, started EQ and typed /loadskin default 1<br />
<br />
I made a new folder called 'new' in the same directory as the default folder, and put the new files in there.  I started EQ and typed /loadskin new 1<br />
<br />
I put the new xml files into the same directory as the default folder.  Started EQ and tried to use the Add UI GUI to add the skins<br />
<br />
I tried editing my current UI_playername_server.ini file to reflect the location of the new files<br />
<br />
What I would like is a detailed technical description of how to add these UI's or maybe a link to a site that will explain it better.  It seems that the sites I have visited kinda assume that people already have a base knowledge of how to do this, and offer no explanations on how to do so.<br />
<br />
It's entirely possible that I just haven't been looking in the right places.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

It's quite possible that I'm not all that bright to begin with... :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The default folder that is... you're just asking for trouble.  What you should have on your hard drive is a direrctory &quot;C:\Program Files\Everquest\uifiles&quot;.  First part of that may vary, but the &quot;Everquest\uifiles&quot; should be the same regardless of any other variations.  In any case, in the &quot;uifiles&quot; directory there should be a &quot;default&quot; directory.  As I said.. DO NOT TOUCH this.  If you want a custom ui, it should have it's own directory withing the &quot;uifiles&quot; folder... For example, the complete path would be&quot;C&quot;\Program Files\Everquest\uifiles\mycustomui&quot;, assuming mycustomui is the name of your ui.   Then, you should be able to use the /loadskin command from within EQ to load up your custom ui.</div></div><hr />

Problem was on my end.  I had a previous installation of EQ on my hard drive in /Program files/Everquest.  I was putting the UI files in the 'defunct' installation.  I went through and erased all those old files, found the current install which was under /Program files/Sony/Everquest and it worked...sort of.<br />
<br />
The first time I loaded the UI it worked...new UI skins and everything.  Then I logged out, logged back in and they won't work again.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
