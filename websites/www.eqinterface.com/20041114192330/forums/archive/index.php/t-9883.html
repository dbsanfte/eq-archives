<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aletheria</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant to post this a lot sooner, but my computer has been on the fritz since near the beginning of August, only a few days after I released my UI. And now I can't remember what I wanted to say. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
As for an update to bring it up-to-date with the latest patch, it will be awhile in coming. My computer is still about 2-3 weeks away from finally being repaired. My video card started malfunctioning, Windows is a mess, and just recently my network card appears to have been destroyed by a firmware update required for the latest drivers. So I've been stuck with a 28.8 baud modem and an old, failing, video card. As such, even though I have my computer functioning again to some degree since a week or two ago, I haven't been able to play EQ for nearly a month now. The problems with the video card have prevented it, and I'm not sure just how big (or small) the latest patch is but I know it takes forever to download anything with an internet connection this excruciatingly slow. Therefore, I can't really fix up my UI yet. (And after all the headaches my computer has been giving me both with trying to diagnose the problem and get it repaired, just the thought of trying to slog thru UI code right now makes my head hurt.)<br />
<br />
*tries to remember what she had been planning to say before all the unpleasantness started*<br />
<br />
Known issues:<br />
<br />
The loot &amp; give windows appear behind the inventory window when they are opened, preventing them from being seen. As far as I know this is not something that can be changed. I just press the &quot;I&quot; key or the Done button on the inventory window to bring them out of hiding.<br />
<br />
The three buttons next to the spell casting window, above the class animation are unfunctional. This window was one of my earliest coding attempts, when I was still trying to make my UI have the pretty much the exact same layout as the old one, which I since gave up all notions of, since there's just way too many hard-coded roadblocks to such a goal. The spell casting window doesn't allow these types of buttons on it, thus why they don't work. I might split it in two and make the left side the window selector window, but then I'd lose the spellbook button, which doesn't function on the other window... &lt;sigh&gt; I'll probably end up just removing them.<br />
<br />
The class animation shows a static warrior graphic, no matter what class char is logged in at the time. Opening the inventory window causes it to display the correct graphic, though once it's closed it is static as well.<br />
<br />
The compass window keeps disappearing whenever something gets targeted etc. This is because it didn't seem to want to cooperate with what I wanted it to do as far as a background behind it, and I had to instead stretch the bottom of the target window down to fill in the background gap. I only really put it in because the actions window didn't let me do it the way I wanted to, so I ended up with extra empty space there, and I decided to squeeze the compass in. I just hit the keyboard command to close and reopen the compass when I want it, to make it appear.<br />
<br />
The text on the hotbuttons, and some of the actions window buttons, is force-coded to be white, and is thus difficult to read. I told it to use dark brown text but it insisted on ignoring me. &lt;sigh&gt; I didn't feel it was a big enough nuisance to redesign my buttons to be dark instead of light; though I did decide the item info display window, that has the same issue, was too difficult to read and changed that background to be dark.<br />
<br />
The actions window is in two layers, that I had to de-anchor from one another because of positioning problems I was having with the coding. Since the UI isn't designed to be moved about, this shouldn't be that much of a problem. If it does get hopelessly out of place accidently, I just reload the skin to reset the coordinates.<br />
<br />
The spellbook window has a problem with spell names that take up two lines being hidden under the spell graphic underneath them. The spacing in between the lines appears to be forced to a fixed distance, so I'll tweak with the book graphics and see if making the book a tad bigger will correct the problem.<br />
<br />
Planned changes:<br />
<br />
The buffs window has been giving me nothing but headaches since I first tried it (but it was one of my earliest coding attempts when everything was pretty much still Greek to me so hopefully it'll be easier to deal with now) so I decided to release it with only minor changes with the beta. I will continue to attempt to adjust/design it so that all fifteen possible buffs can be seen, without taking up half the viewport area. The s.d. buffs window will also be changed.<br />
<br />
Now that I've been using the newest coding changes for a bit, I've noticed that the quantity window isn't used just for what I thought it was when I designed it. I'll be de-standard positioning it (not that EQ paid any attention to where I told it to put it anyway...) - making it a bit smaller and changing the border so that it doesn't look out-of-place in the random spots it pops open.<br />
<br />
The first windows I attempted to design are a bit messy, since I really had no clue what I was doing at the time, so I'll be going back over them looking for changes I want to make.<br />
<br />
That's about all I can remember at the moment...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seeiel</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whenever I click Load Skin for this UI, it just gives me the default UI! I want to play it so badly, because it looks awesome, and I'm kind of a nostalgic person, but it just won't work for me! :( Can you tell me what's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aletheria</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely, it's an incompatibility issue, since I haven't had a chance to update it yet for the last patch (and now the last two patches). :( Simple updates to the default UI don't usually break a custom UI to the point of not running anymore at all, but that last patch was rather complex sounding.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, my new video card will get here within the week *crosses fingers* and once I don't have to worry about my video card deciding to go up in smoke if I leave my computer on for too long, I can leave EQ downloading overnight (28.8 modem is excruciatingly, hours long downloads, slow), and once I get that up to date I can get my UI up to date. :)<br />
<br />
I only got part of LDoN pre-downloaded, and that was a month ago, so... *grimaces at the thought* hopefully I can just update it enough to be non-LDoN compliant for now, until I can get my cable modem back.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you liked it, hopefully all it needs is a patch. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seeiel</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good luck on it. It's a great UI just needs a bit of patch work. :( Also, how come I can't change the spell icons/gems in this UI? :( I'd love it if I could put my old spell gem set in there with it but it won't. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aletheria</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like my old post got deleted, :eek: so starting a new one. Don't remember my list of issues, mostly minor, or the planned future updates I had listed there, though. :confused: (EDIT: I couldn't find it anywhere but it just showed up on the bottom of this post as a related link... :o Old Thread (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9883))<br />
<br />
I'm currently working to redo the compatibility updates that I had made, but lost due to failure of my main hard drive. I also lost all my developmental files for this UI, so it may be a bit rough. :( Have been looking into hiring a data restoration company, but they're extremely expensive from what I see. :(<br />
<br />
For pictures, please see the old thread in the Pre-Beta section. (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9496)<br />
<br />
The version currently available here is almost a year old, and will not run (or will run very poorly) until I finish remaking the updates. Unless you're the industrious type and want to apply the patch code changes listed elsewhere yourself, of course. :) I am working on it, though. :cool:  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aletheria</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Patch from 08-03-03 version to 07-12-04 version available here. (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=14356)<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you find any problems with this patch. There were a huge amount of changes so I might have missed or messed something up. Once I'm sure it's good, I'll merge it into the main release file in the downloads area since that one's almost a year old. :nana:</div></div><hr />
