<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Accent</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm new to this site and Eq UI's in general, so forgive me if this question is asked alot. Are there downloads available for the whole UI, not just chat windows, spells, buffs, etc etc? I'm looking for a complete ranger UI with the chat window and battle spam seperate and I'm not sure where to download one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvasie</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes and no.  There are complete UIs available in the Mix &amp; Match, Featured Interfaces, and Complete Sets sections.  Is there a complete one with the exact chat window configuaration you are looking for?  Maybe.  The two that come to mind, only because I have used them, are Aya's and Carienn's UIs - both in the Featured Interfaces section.  But any of the wonderful UIs out there can be made by you to fit what you want.  Especially the chat window configuarion - you do this in game.<br />

Good luck finding what you want.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure if this is what you're asking but it sounds so...you want stuff like chat (group, guild, ooc, etc.) to be in one window, and melee stuff (hits, spells, skills, crits, etc.) to be in a separate chat window, correct? If this is what you want, the default UI enables you to do all of that already, though it will take you a minute or two to get just right.  You simply right-click the title bar at the top of that or any window to get a drop-down menu. In the chat windows under &quot;Filters&quot; you select almost every type of message that streams by and place it in the window of your choice, and you can make as many chat windows as you want by selecting &quot;New chat window&quot; in the menu.<br />
I hope that helps, I apologize if I missed your point ;)</div></div><hr />

Eloora - I was mainly interested in the seperate chat/spam windows - thank you for answering my question, I set it up already and I might stick to the default UI as all I wanted was to seperate tells from spam. Thanks alot :)</div></div><hr />
