<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seijiro Hiko</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the first time I made an attempt to change my skins (XML) for the new UI. A friend of mine in game told  me about this skin that is perfect for a melee (Warrior). So I asked him to send me that file. (XML) He told me to make a duplicate of my &quot;default&quot; folder from my EQ\UIfiles directory and rename it something else. (Melee). Then he told me to drag and drop the XML file that he sent me to that directory and it will replace the default player.xml to the one that I wanted. When I logged in the game and loaded that skin nothing happened. Then the game started booting me back to desktop when I try to log in with my main. I had no choice but to delete all the other &quot;skin folder&quot; then loaded the game back again to let the game load my &quot;Default&quot; one. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?<br />

<br />
when you get into EQ, type /loadskin *foldername* true. It should load. If it doesn't work, then either the file is corrupt or outdated.<br />

This is a waste of time, space, and Advil later on when Sony does another patch.<br />
