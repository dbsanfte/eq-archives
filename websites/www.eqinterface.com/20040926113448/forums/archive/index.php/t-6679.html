Just re-arranging where things are?  Ripping someone else's graphics apart and re-arranging them to suit your needs?  Combination of all of the above?<br />

Basically, all of the forums here in the &quot;Developer Discussions&quot; area will help.  Stickied threads are usually really good resources.  Any thread that has a lot of discussion.  Poke around.  If you have specific questions, try using the search function, and if that doesn't net you the info you need, go ahead and ask.  A lot of very helpful, knowledgable folks hanging around down here. :)</div></div><hr />
