<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khaalis</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey there.<br />
Ok. I am new here but I have checked the posty notes, and the read me etc. and I cannot find an answer to my problem since the answer doesnt work.  That answer is setting all of the .ini files to settings of Default to go back to the Default UI.<br />
<br />
So... I was hoping you could all help me out with an EQ UI stumper.  I just tried to get back into the game today after having been gone for the last 6 months or so (but accounts active), to find that some of my old UIs are no longer valid (ex: Inventory [no ranged slot but a charm slot instead], Player Status [% on health still good but still a stamina bar and no Endurance bar], etc.).  <br />
<br />
However some of the other game changes worked, like the targeting ring. However, no matter what I do I cannot seem to revert to the Default UI's.<br />
<br />
I have tried all of the following with no success (logging in and out of the game completely inbetwen each):<br />
<br />
* Deleted NewUI=True from the eqclient.ini<br />
<br />
* UIskin=Default is set in eqclient.ini<br />
<br />
* Deleted everything from the everquest\UI\custom folder so there is no xml files to draw on.<br />
<br />
* There is nothing and never has been anything but the default Skin in the Skins folder<br />
<br />
* In-game: /loadskin default 1<br />
<br />
* In-game; Options/General/LoadUISkin/default/load skin AND Options/General/LoadUISkin/default/use ini/load skin  (only rearranges them but still uses the custom xml UIs)<br />
<br />
* Changed the UI_CharName_85.ini from UISkin=custom to UISkin=default<br />
<br />
* UI_CharName_tribunal.ini is already at UISkin=default<br />
<br />
* I checked the xml files, and the dates on the defaults seem to be correct for when EQ changes were made and do not match the custom UI dates, so I didnt write over them<br />
<br />
* Even went so far as to Rename/swap a backup00eqclient.ini (from back in early 2002) and eqclient.ini (all it did was remove Windows mode and make it play music during the load screens again.<br />
<br />
Nothing worked to get rid of them in game. I am totally stumped. Any hints?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may want to make sure you don’t have two Everquest directories thus making changes to an Everquest folder that’s no longer used because of a buggy expansion install.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khaalis</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think I may have fixed the issue. I renamed the uifiles folder and removed all ui_charname_*.ini files to a backup folder, reloaded the game and let it re-download all of the default ui files.<br />
<br />
However, I have a few questions.  I know that the Inventory screen was fixed as I now have my Ranged AND Charm slot, but I have a question on the default player screen. Did they add a %meter to life as a standard default option? When I left the game for a break 6 months ago there was no % meters unless you used a custom UI. This is one that has me confused over whether or not I am back to default or not.<br />
<br />
Thanks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes they added the %'s to the default interface. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khaalis</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, thats a huge help. <br />
<br />
Another question if you please: The default inventory window. Mine shows all of the items surrounding a large open rectangle even after the fixes I did. Is this default? For some reason I keep thinking default was just a 4 horizontal lines of slots on top for items, or is what I am remembering the custom inventory?<br />
<br />
I hate feeling like a newb all over again, but I guess its expected after having been gone for a little over 6 months.  I cant remember what the defaults looked like anymore.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to make sure that I have all of the correct defaults so that I have all of the new functionality, before I start messing with custom UI's again (if I even do this time). I hear that they are changing the UI's pretty often lately so it makes it hard to keep custom UI's up to date. Is that true?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help!</div></div><hr />
