<br />
I have just finished fixing up my Forry UI with the new updates from Cairenn's post (thanks for doing that so well by the way) and noticed that I'm still getting the &quot;This UI is not compatible with current files&quot; message.  I checked and double checked to make sure I caught everything and was still getting the message.  So I finally decided to load the default UI and guess what...that is displaying the message also.  It looks as if Sony forgot to add a combo list box in the Adventer Leaderboard file, because here is the only thing in my UIErrors.txt file:<br />
<br />
[Thu Oct 09 13:10:28 2003] Error: Could not find child AdvLeaderboard_RiskCombobox in window AdventureLeaderboardWnd <br />
<br />
Maybe I just jumped the gun too early and not all the files got download to my computer, but it looks like something is missing from the patch.  Just wanted to let everyone know.  I will repatch and see if maybe I missed the file or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: I checked into things and found that it was the Leaderboard window and not the Animation file that was the problem, so I updated my post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following quote comes from Cairenn's post at this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10609) location:<br />
<br />
While essentially correct, the &quot;problem&quot; with your solution is that if you make the changes to the AdventureLeaderboardWnd in your default directory (as would be expected), the next time you log in, it will just re-download the existing one, overwriting the changes you have made.<br />
<br />
The only way this will actually &quot;work&quot; (until SOE actually uploads the updated file) is for people to make a copy of the EQUI_AdventureLeaderboardWnd.xml file from the default folder and put it in their custom folder, then apply the changes you have posted.<br />
<br />
The problem there becomes the age-old problem of having files in your custom folder that aren't actually custom, creating the opportunity for it to be &quot;broken&quot; in the future.<br />
<br />
It's annoying to see the red error message on the screen, but this error, in and of itself, will not prevent any UI from loading (tested with my own). My suggestion to folks would be to just put up with the annoying message (provided it is only due to this one thing) until SOE uploads the proper file for the default folder. (And yes, they have been made aware of the fact that they overlooked this file.  )<br />
 <br />
<br />
I agree with her, I was just posting this thread to inform others that there may be a problem.  Hope this will help everyone!</div></div><hr />

Ok this is what i did .. i loaded the Testserver .exe , it downloaded a new AdventureLeaderboardWnd .xml , so i then instead of loadin into EQ fully i grabbed that file from the default ui folder then copied it to my custom ui folder .. that seemed to fix my problem ... if this got  confusing for you just to me . i will break it down for you in steps , sorry kinda in a rush .. late on pickin up my son =)<br />

you could leave it in your default folder... as we have said MANY times.. there is no need to copy it into your custom folder, it will pull it from the default folder automatically....<br />
<br />
now when it changes, you have to do this again.. OR it will be broken..<br />
<br />

just a small FYI :)</div></div><hr />
