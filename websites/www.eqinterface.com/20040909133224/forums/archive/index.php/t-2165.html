<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-16-2002, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As of 19 DEC 02 - I am answering the following questions directly at the top of this thread, so maybe people WILL STOP SENDING ME E-MAIL ABOUT IT.<br />
<br />
1 No, I don't have any screenshots.  No, I am not holding them back, so that you have to send me a personal e-mail requesting them.  Please, I have an inbox FULL of people sending me this question, combined from EQBeastlord and EQGUI posters.  I am IN NEED OF SCREENSHOTS in case you still don't understand, I am unable to play EQ, for the forseeable future.  My screenshots were deleted some time ago, and I need new ones.  Please, post screenshots of the UI, I need one of each race, doesn't need to be filled with a ton of windows - just basic screenshots.<br />
<br />
2 The UI should work with the latest patches as of this date.  As I could not personally test the UI to make sure it was 100%, I am relying on other people telling me it works.<br />
<br />
3 No, I cannot shrink, grow, stretch, pull, drag, recolor, or skin any graphics from the UI.  That requires time and energy that I have to devote to Real Life (http://pub140.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm18.showMessage?topicID=310.topic).<br />
<br />
4 If you want to use a graphic element from my UI, go ahead.  I'm not gonna be stingy on the design, especially since I borrowed the layout of this UI from the Techno Donuts design done by Nibbuhlz.<br />
<br />
5 No, you will not see me online in the game, no, I cannot give you any help on the UI from within EQ, because I have to focus on Real Life (http://pub140.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm18.showMessage?topicID=310.topic).<br />
<br />
6  Yes, I can be a prick.  Yes, I do go off on people who may not feel they personally deserve it.  But please, before sending me an E-Mail, asking me something about the UI, see if it is something that has been beaten to death in the Message Forum Thread already.<br />
<br />
As of 6 DEC 02 - download links work, 99% certian UI works in game as of all the last patches I missed.<br />
<br />
Well, the time has come, the mod is completed as best as I can tell.  A few things to note:<br />
<br />
1. there is a ini file included in the zip.  this file has my window settings, including my rather complicated hitsmode configuration that many may not wish to deal with.  it is set for 1280x1024 - you can use it if you want (just rename it to your own ini file) and it will have the window positions lined up.<br />
<br />
2. the graphics for both male and female versions of the inventory are found in subdirectories in the zip. just copy the .tga file for whatever version you want into the main folder.  (male inventory graphic is the default graphic already in place)<br />
<br />
3. Windows are rearranged from normal.  I have moved the content of some windows into other windows for specific effects.  As a result, you may get a little confused.  Here is the rundown of what was changed:<br />
<br />
                           Target Window moved to Player Window:  Did this so that the flashy red box goes around the target, not the player when attacking.<br />
<br />
                           Player Window moved into the Group Window:  The group window's invite/disband buttons will show up around the edge of this window.  Please note: there is a slight overlap with the disband button and the first person in your group.  Do not be alarmed, and please be careful about selecting players by mouse click if that is what you do (I would recommend becoming familiar with the F2 - F6 buttons for targetting group members).<br />
<br />
                           Player Stats are now the Pet Window:  If you liked the pet command buttons, sorry, I didn't.  all your vital stats are listed here instead.<br />
<br />
                           Experience &amp; Right-Click Items were moved into the (now empty) Target Window: they are tabbed, just click on the tab to switch between exp bars, which are 5x longer than normal, or the right-click window, which lists the right-click slots that should cover almost everything for a Beastlord.<br />
<br />
4. Beastlord &quot;by level&quot; chart is now a seperate tab in the help window.  Use the selector window to open the help window, and click on the beastlord table tab to see the chart.<br />
<br />
                                            New version - I changed some things around, converted graphics to smaller sizes, and have added a sort of animated epic mouse pointer to it.  To ensure you don't keep extra files in your mod folder, please empty the old version's folder before unzipping this one - many .tga files no longer exist in the mod (and are now .png instead).  I have noticed a slight improvement in framerate with the new mod from the older version.  Due to the recent UI changes in the patch, I've had to simply release the current &quot;Beta&quot; versions of this UI to make it work correctly.  Enjoy.<br />
<br />
(I guess I should point out, since he's a moderator of eqbeastlord's forums and all....  the compass graphic that is included is Tipop's gold compass.  Also the UIMaps mod from eq-toolbox.com is included in this [as I regularly use it, if anything to make a educated guess where I am at], and T.King's spell icons v. 1.04)<br />
<br />
I have been redesigning the UI's graphics, as well as making changes people had told me they wanted to see in the UI as well (sort-of bug fixes) and have the containers &amp; inventories to complete for this new rendition to be completed.<br />
<br />
I've completed the inventory windows, took me a mere 18.5 hours to design the graphics, and edit the XML from the old version.<br />
<br />

<br />
After some fidgiting, I just copied your ini file over mine, set the reso to 1280x1024 and left it as you created it.<br />
<br />
Some of you peeps must have really good eyes though, because at this resolution, i have to squint to see the text on a 21 inch monitor. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<br />
I leave the ini file as an option, because I.....really altered the way my chat windows are layed out with the hitsmode options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you send me a PM or Mail how you managed to code the optional gauge backround? I tried that but I couldn't get it to work. :/<br />
<br />
I've played around with the idea of including such gauges in my own skin, but for some reason it only displays the gauge I created and doesn't fill them.<br />
<br />
Edit: nm, found my error. :)</div></div><hr />

New inventory for each only or can you replace the bears with gators etc.?</div></div><hr />

Usually, when I look for mods, its hard to find a mod that combines both style and functionality.<br />
<br />
Currently, I am waiting for the Vah Shir version of the mod, no offense, but the ogre doesn't do it for me :D <br />
<br />
Keep up the absolutely terriffic job and I look foward to using your future skins!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasberry</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im curious why you chose to convert the pet window, when beastlords are in fact a pet class. I love the graphics and the usability, except for the fact that I miss out on all those handy buttons in the pet window, instead I have to fill up my hotkey bank with stuff like /pet attack and /pet back off ect. Otherwise, awesome job =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok.... umm...... /rant on<br />
<br />
I personally HATE those stupid pet window buttons.  why?  Because I use macros.  I like having witty little sayings, some sort of emote &amp; animation, etc.  Those buttons were a rather lame attempt by Verant to do something that they could have done much better.<br />
<br />
That being said - what else would I use hot buttons for?  I use ALT + &lt;number&gt; for spells, and hotbuttons for locate, kick, and pet commands.  there's like 100 slots for buttons (10x10) as it is.<br />
<br />
I won't put those stupid buttons in a mod I make, unless there's some substantial improvements done in making them more flexable.  I use the keyboard to operate my buttons, and those pet command ones require the mouse, which slows me down (I only use the mouse for looking, occasionally moving, and maybe to click an invite/decline button - when I don't use the keyboard command - for a group, I don't use it for spell gems or hotbuttons or anything else where I have gottn used to the keyboard commands)<br />
<br />
Plus, I had numerous requests back when the UI first was released, by Beastlords. Mages, Necromancers, and Shamen (you know, the classes who use pets) to make a pet window that didn't have those buttons cluttering the screen.  I don't mean one or two requests.  I mean my inbox was overflowing daily with e-mails requesting such a mod.  Guess I'm not the only one who didn't like the buttons.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
------<br />
<br />
Still getting textures for the other mods.  Haven't been doing much the last couple days, but the weekends are the hardest time for me to break away to work on this stuff.  Cutting the pictures of the different races/genders is currently top priority, then to get the window backgrounds &amp; edges textures gathered.  After that it's just a game of swapping one graphic for another (and a little redrawing of the inventory).  Then the other versions will be available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll be posting screens of samples of the different skins for each race, hopefully that will reduce the &quot;why didn't you make one for &lt;fill in the blank&gt; race of beaslords&quot; e-mails and PM's I've been getting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice! I love the vah shir and barbarian ones. Tigers and wolves are my favorite animals, bears too of course(especially polar bears) ;) Bah, guess I just like animals in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thoorne</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please please please release them out :)<br />
<br />
At least barbarian edition :)</div></div><hr />

I'm getting the others completed, and am working on reworking them a bit as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS : I wait more for your interface release than for PoP :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think i'll use your UI for my ranger too , because I love your wolves !<br />
<br />
I just can't wait to play EQ again and have fun with those UIs<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe make a :nana: edition ? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm ETA? not sure.  I tend to work in spurts.  What I mean is that  I'll have a sort of overwhelming creative brainstorm that forces me to get a bunch done in a little time, then I have to do something else for a bit (usually is actually playing EQ)  As the Hotbutton window designs are pretty much finalized - the Player/Group one is too (they are the same size and shape, only a couple minor differences).<br />
<br />
The stats window shouldn't be too much of a trouble, and the spell gems won't be hard either.  Going to have fun trying to get the container, with it's several varying pieces done up this way, and the target window, due to it's slightly different shape might be interesting too.<br />
<br />
Inventory is already half-done as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starshelle</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been admiring your work for a long time and wanted to thank you for all the time and effort you've put into it. I'm eagerly awaiting your troll version :) I agree with you about the pet window. I do however like using the pet window with my druid since she doesn't use pets very often. Occasionally I'll use animal charm or pull out boo boo for fun and greenie farming.  During those situations I'll use the pet window and I find it very handy as I don't have to constantly switch hotbox banks around and can use what I'm accustomed to using. However with my magician and beastlord, I like sticking with macros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have updated the zipfile to include access to the new /gems window.  That should be the only thing that needed to be changed since this last patch.</div></div><hr />

I use the GIMP and I would be VERY interested in the gauge XML code and graphics files.... I am trying to create a Paladin (and perhaps enchanter in the future) UI somewhat similar to yours.<br />
<br />
I was pondering all day about how to change the gauges, and when I got home I read this post and saw your screentshots (wierd). I would love to know how you did that.... you can e-mail me the files at jharris@lhinfo.com or post here about how to get them.... <br />
<br />
If I do make a Pally UI, would you mind if I use your invintory concept? With a high elf, obviously : ) I can't belive no one thought of that idea sooner, because it is awsome.<br />
<br />
Also, I want to say that this is, by far, THE best UI I have seen. Nothing comes close to the stuff you got here. You have original code, original graphics, and good ideas littered through this UI. Vert and T.King move over...... <br />
<br />
If I can make a UI that is half the quality of yours I will have made something good.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
Astin Soulblade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I appreciate the compliment, actually, my UI has a basis in the Techno Donuts UI that was done.  I have done some rather....extensive recoding and remodding of it, added in other elements (the air gauge was from the fatreduction mod, the compass was designed by Tipop, who is one of the Beastlord forum moderators, and a rather awesome graphics artist).<br />
<br />
However, there is much of this that is my own design - the hp bars, the casting/spell/mana bars, and a few other bits and pieces are things I've added in.  Dunno if I really can say it is a reskinning of Techno Donuts any more, but I still will, as for it anything, it gave me the inspiration, and the basis for the design.<br />
<br />
Even the Inventory, is basically very simmilar to Techno Donuts, with some slight modifications to the layout.  But yea, I don't mind if you use parts of it.<br />
<br />
And umm.... I'm still sorting out the graphics files - I have apparently stored parts of this mod's graphics in scattered directories on my hard drive... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">westfall</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to say, first off your UI is amazing and one of the truly original pieces of artwork available here.  I have been using it with my VS Beastlord even with the bear graphics and Ogre inventory screen, (if I squint real hard it almost kinda looks like a tiger...sorta, as far as the ogre goes, well, it's an ogre).  <br />
<br />
I had a problem last night with the new patch that dumped me to desktop when I camped my BL instead of back to character select screen.  I went to EQGUI and was pleased to find you had already updated your patch.  A quick DL and re-install and everything was fine.      <br />
<br />
My question or hope is, could you give us a clue as to which race your going to release next?  (/prays that it is the VS).  /selfishness on, And any kind of time frame as far as when the VS one will be released if it's not the next in the queue? /selfishness off.<br />
<br />
I will continue to use the Ogre untill the VS one is ready because to be quite frank, your UI IMHO is the definitive Beastlord UI period.  Thanks again for all the hard work and I hope you continue to produce these wonderful UI's.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I have a SK and a Ranger, any thought as to branching out to other classes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the big exp bars you've got. Which file(s) would I need in order to get just the exp and clickies? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Thanks, I'm still working on the elements, I have 2 windows done, a few more left to get the graphics completed on.  it moves faster when I don't have to redo the XML - BUT I have been 3D rendering the windows, which required a bit of learning on my part.<br />
<br />
2. I do try to keep my stuff updated as soon as I can find out.  the change was 1 file, in fact it was 1 line - the line that loaded in the gems window LOL.<br />
<br />
3. I will be releasing ALL the races at the same time.  The Revised Ogre one as well as Vah Shir, Barbarian, Troll, and Iksar.  Due to the nature of how I am doing this mod, it's just easier for me to cut out all 5 versions at the same time rather than 1 at a time.  Plus I like to playtest the UI windows myself, and see how well they work.  So far, with the player/group and hotbutton windows, it works very well.<br />
<br />
4. I don't know, I have some other characters in other classes, I might branch out a bit, but it will be something where I'm not doing a different version for each race/class combination.  At most the inventory graphic will have the correct race/gender, that's it.<br />
<br />
5. I don't know if you want that window which has the XP &amp; clickies.  that is the window formerly known as the target window.  So the Target window's XML file, and there's I beleive the OgulerPieces.png graphic file (for the bars) are the two things that are needed.  There is a line in the Animations XML file that also will be needed - which loads the .png to make it available.  the .png has many, many elements in it that it doesn't need - I have been slowly working on doing away with that file all together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, all 5 skin ideas are shown with the examples now.  I *might* swap the Troll window skin with the iksar one, as gators are more commonly darker than the iksar pets.  I'm having fun making &quot;real&quot; animal pics of the iksar pets, as you can see from above, I took elements from shots of the iksar pet and integrated them into a picture of a komodo dragon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm. I'm afraid I do need my target window. Is there any way I can make something like that in the friends window? How would I do that? Still very new to xml(even though I know a bit of html hehe) I don't really need the clickies, I'm just interested in the huge exp and aaxp bars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">gotta do some editing to the XML.  dunno if the friends window allows for tabs offhand, but if it does, then it's just a matter of making the little text/name changes in the XML so that it works as the friends window, and it should work.<br />
<br />
Going into any more detail would require me to pretty much do the change myself, and then post the changes....  I'm busy working on my current mod presently, but if someone else knows how to do it, then maybe they can help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">westfall</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info on the new skins.  Love the way the tiger looks now for the VS version!  I had one little (hopeully little) request though, is there anyway to put a label on the AC, Attack and weight numbers on the player info screen?  I know I should know them by heart but I'm old and quickly becomming senile.  Raelly would love to see them if it's not too much trouble though.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again for the skins and can't wait for the new ones.  You've made my BL my favorite char to play because of them!<br />

<br />
Edit: I have modified the graphics for the xp bars to be a bit cleaner.  Still not quite what I want, so I'm going to work more on it.  The Player/group window is reskinned, I'm going to be moving the invite/disband buttons around a bit, so that the overlap on the disband button won't exist any more (and also to give another shot at the whole lining them up correctly game)<br />
<br />
Edit2: Once this mod is completed - with all 5 versions for the different races, it will be moving to the &quot;Released&quot; section of the forums, probably into the downloads on eqinterface.com after I'm sure it's working the way it should.</div></div><hr />

But, it's been a free program for a while (closed source). Is very confusing as it doesn't use a standard interface, takes a steep learning curve, but I've been getting the gist of it after a couple days.</div></div><hr />

Its linux-based, and isn't the &quot;Standard&quot; windows format. However, as one site says, as you start to learn the new format, you will find it more effiecient and never want to go back to the &quot;windows&quot; crap.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm..... yea.  I started in the Unix world, and used Unix-based designs for 10-12 years before I saw my first Microsoft computer.  I helped write parts of the Linux Kernel back with kernel version 0.9.132 - 0.9.254 (about a 4-week period).  I prefer and run almost exclusively a Unix environment.  :)<br />
<br />
Personally, I have always seen stepping into a Windows environment as a massive downgrade - it is very, very limited in what you can do with a Windows box, I don't care if you are talking XP, 2K, ME, NT, 9x, or 3.x or whatever little jokes Microsoft claims to be &quot;radically different&quot; operating systems.  Sorry, there's more differences between OpenBSD and Linux nowadays, and they both follow the Single Unix Specification (SUS) so that they both have the exact same commands and structure.  They still have more differences than Windows 98 and ME have.<br />
<br />
Anyway, let's leave the ranting for a bit, and get back to my regularly scheduled UI modding :)</div></div><hr />

As I said in an earlier post, your UI has made my BL my favorite character to play and I was counting the days untill the VS version was released.  I have been using it since the day I found it but it has not been without some grief...<br />
<br />
My Wife ridiculing me as she sees the bears on my screen, laughing out loud as I bring up my Ogre inventory screen, openly mocking me &quot;Your not a Ogre and you dont have a bear as a pet!&quot;   Well, gee thanks for the update Sherlock!!  All the time finding comfort in the knowledge that it was only a matter of time before the cats would be upon my screen.<br />
<br />
But that's ok, I will go on squinting to pretend those bears are cats, and I'll go on looking at my ogre inventory screen as a....well, an ogre.  I don't care.  I will continue to be made fun of by family and friends because I will continue to use your UI, cats or no cats!  And even if you should decide to never code another UI again, you can rest easy in the fact that you have created the best BL UI bar none!  <br />
<br />
Thank you, once again for all your great work and I hope everything in your life works out.<br />

P.S.<br />
please please please please please....at least release the mock up you did for the hotbutton windows as maybe a plugin so at least my wife can't laugh at me for the lower left hand side of my UI.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my reasons:<br />
<br />
<br />
 It's been a long time coming, but hasn't happened yet. The further I get up in levels, the less fun the game is to me. I've been probably spending way too much time playing this game over the last year or so, including my little breaks to keep from burning out. There has been so many other things I really should have been doing with my life that I haven't been, and the drive I've had with this game was to make a character reach level 60 - just to know I did it. With PoP, the levels are increasing to 65, which would make me want to reach 65 as well, but the hours of gameplay just really hasn't added up for me for a while. I am seeing things becoming very raid-oriented, which I detest severely, always have preferred going out, seeing new areas, and gaining XP as being what really is fun for me. But XP has become almost purely a lot of work, raiding will become even more prominent with PoP's release and the new raid system that is coming.<br />
<br />
The game has lost almost all of it's appeal to me, and I play solely because of friends I have in the game. I've tried playing around with the UI to try and keep the game more interesting, but even that has pretty much lost it's touch to keep me interested. The more time I spend away from the game, the less interested I am in playing it. I feel that if I was to take a break from EQ, I'd most likely not return, and I am overdue for another break to replenish my reserves. As it is, this game has caused great strain in RL for me, as friends here see me playing it, are not interested in it, and (rightly so, I feel) think that I should try to hang around with them. My own roommate has gotten to the point of where he absolutely despises it - as when I play this game, I tend to treat everyone around me like they don't exist.<br />
<br />
Originally, I started playing this game, because in the Army, it was a great relaxation from the torments I went through in my job. I know that other military people can agree to that to a degree, but at the time, I was not only in the Army, but also was placed into a job I didn't sign up for, was retrained to work in a branch of the Army that I found repulsive, and really needed some sort of escape from it. I started in the military as a Computer specialist (Information Systems Operator/Analyst, or MOS 74B for you US Army people). 3 years later, I was ripped from that job - for reasons I have never understood, and placed into the field of Finance (MOS 73C) - which I hate dealing with other people's money. I got to go to Germany which I wanted, but the job went from bad to worse (when I was in computers, I loved my job, had a goal and a gameplan for my future with the Army, that whole concept was shattered when I was lodged in Finance, and I had no way of even continuing along my dreams of becoming a Warrent Officer any more - they don't exist in Finance - and the people I worked for didn't care about my dreams, just that they needed the person to fill the position in their office was all).<br />
<br />
An old high school buddy of mine clued me into playing EverQuest, and got me to play on Xegony. Mind you, at that time, playing EQ was VERY expensive for me - as Deutche Telecom would charge me an arm and a leg to play. But I did - mainly because that was the only contact I had with my old friend - who's current main character is Sslithii. He told me to start as a monk, which I did, and he gave me a couple items when I started. Later I met up with one of the original members of the Sky Knights (at that time, a VERY new guild) and was even invited into the guild. I had an interesting position in the guild at that time - being the only person who was overseas, and also not somehow tied to either the Air Force or knowing the others in the guild physically. I was the only Army guy in the guild, and the only monk - for months. And, most of the hours I played, there was nobody online as well - I'd see them only for 1-3 hours each day I played tops - and they'd be getting ready to sleep actually.<br />
<br />
Well, eventually, I was discharged from the Army with a medical disability (back problems - which are extremely agonizing much of the time) after months of being ridiculed, and being put through even more mind games by those who were in positions above me in the unit (my own commander felt I didn't deserve a medical discharge, and was trying to get me dishonorably discharged - with no evidence to support him). I got back home, and an Army buddy of mine who already had left a year before I did had me set up with a job out in Tennessee. I took a road trip from California to Tennessee with my little brother who just graduated from High School (our road trip went by way of Washington and Montana - 3 weeks travelling around in a generally aimless direction) then started up work here in Tennessee.<br />
<br />
Of course, the company I was working for went bankrupt, and I was unemployed 8 months after I had started working. Applying for jobs daily, I found the technological jobs were all closed - nobody was hiring in the area for anything. Fed up with it, I started playing EQ again. Discovering that my old characters were wiped off the game (frustrating), I started over with a new Iksar monk named Rolthenjr, and was on the lookout for names I could remember from my old guild, then got reinvited again. I got my monk up to 53, and then got more and more frustrated with him, thus starting my Beastlord named Oguler.<br />
<br />
Well, Oguler's now 56, my old guild's been divided up to the 4 winds, and those of us who were close for years came to Defenders of Fae [current guild] (well, some of them still are in Sky Knights [former guild], which I hope the best for them as well). I've been slowly going down a path of lower and lower morale with the game. I haven't seen Sslithii online in months, I'm still unemployed (and need to solve that situation), I'm seeing the game stretching out over an eternity of me struggling to reach goals that I have lost faith or interest in persuing. While I could continue playing EQ, I think it's been getting to be detrimental to my life on a whole. I still like you guys, but I've just been losing faith in the game overall. And I don't think I'd play any other MMORPG either - simply because I see how the industry has been defining the way to do these games, and it makes me sick<br />
<br />
I've had a constant vision of designing my own online game that people could play for almost as long as I have been online (15 - 16 years, give or take) which has been always changing, adapting new ideas, developing my own ideas, and never really progressing. When I explain to people what I've envisioned, it usually results in &quot;that can't be done&quot;, &quot;I want to play that!&quot; or the more recent &quot;It can be done, but won't happen for years&quot;. Well, it's something I've been working on from time to time, something that just is in my soul. I know I will complete it. I know I'm getting near the &quot;groundbreaking&quot; of it, and I guess it scares me as well. I've noticed that when playing EQ, I've also been neglecting this part of me as well. I have made no progress what-so-ever since I restarted playing EverQuest. And I guess that has been taking it's toll on me as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, after I release the Beastlord UI in all it's forms, I will be leaving EQ.</div></div><hr />

I'm feeling very guilty about even posting this Oguler because in comparison your RL takes precedence over all this stuff without a doubt.  But man if you don't make the most incredible UI's and I'm totally lost without it.  <br />
<br />
So please excuse my selfishness but If you get the chance to take a peek at it here's my EQUI error file.  I edited out most of the warnings, hoping maybe someone will see the reason why this is not working...<br />

I changed how the Target Window's graphics are loaded in the new version, and it removed a couple lines from the Animations file.  forgot about that.  Umm.... new version of the UI will be out VERY SOON.</div></div><hr />

There shouldn't have been an ini file in this release, if there was, oops.  I will be releasing an ini file with the later release.  What you need to do it reassign which filters aregoing to which window, through the right-click windows for each one.   if you are using my hitsmodes click on the upper border of the hitsmode &quot;window&quot; that is visible, to get the top section.  Then click on the lower border tha is directly below the text for each of the hitsmodes columns to set them.  Top should have all the spell filters, as well as extraneous melee ones.  &quot;other&quot; should be in the main channel.  Going left-to-right with the hitsmodes columns, it should be my hits/misses, me getting hit/attacker missing me, others hit/miss others.  That's it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First I wanted to say that your UI is great.<br />
It is so good it is the only one ive found that I will use.<br />
<br />
Right now it crashes every time I zone and I have to edit the UI_(playername) file and change it to the default UI to log back on again then load it again.<br />
<br />
If you find a fix please post it here<br />
<br />
Thank you for all your hard work it is very much apreciated.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sotek</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First Download the UI to you UIfiles folder as normle.  <br />
<br />
Then open up your Default Ui folder and in there there is a file call EQUI drag that over to the Beastlord UI (for me i used iksarbeast) and it will say do you want to over ride this file say yes.  <br />
<br />
Next there are 2 files in the default folder called  EQUI_RAIDOPTIONS...,  and a file called EQUI_RAIDWINDOW take those 2 files and also drag them to your DLed UI (again for me the Dled Ui file name was iksarbeast)<br />
 <br />
that fixes the problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, no.  PLEASE don't do that.  Don't copy ANY FILES FROM THE DEFAULT FOLDER EVER to my UI, or other ones.<br />
<br />
I've posted how to get about doing things right and get m mod/UI working correctly.  Unfortunately I can't just jump in, make the fix and hand it to you directly, but it's simple.<br />
<br />
First - make sure that only the files from my zipfile are in the Custom UI folder, do not copy a single file from the Default folder, as was explained in a patch message and on the EQLive website about 2 weeks after the release of the new UI.<br />
<br />
Second, use Notepad, and edit the EQUI.xml file from my UI's folder.  Open another copy of notepad and edit the EQUI.xml from the default folder.  Look for the lines that are for the raid windows, copy them from the default file and paste them into my UI's file - in the same basic place.  Save my file when done and exit.<br />
<br />
These two things should make my UI work fine.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to say that your UI is one of the top UIs I've seen and as close to something for a shaman that I want to use.<br />
<br />
I am an Iksar shaman, so I took your iksar inventory, and placed it into the Ogre Main. I then designed my own pet window for inclusion ( shaman pet window (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=559) ) into the whole thing. The result was spectacular. Once again Great Work! I hope that if I keep tinkering with everything I will be that good!!!</div></div><hr />

Then I discovered the other race versions (are there male + female for each race?) I made a Barb Beastie to attempt to make use of this UI.  I haven't been able to download it for days, no matter what time of the day I try, so it is likely busted.  On a side note, I LOVE the mini-beastlord guide page that shows what you get at every level, any chance of these being done for other classes?  I guess not, as you plan to quit EQ...  Personally, I hope you return someday.  I have been playing since March '99, and it's still fun.<br />

I can't devote any time to this any more (job hunting taking all my time, as it is, I'm posting this while home for lunch).  I can't tell you what happened, and I don't have any place to put the files.  as it is, it won't work with the latest several patches anyway (unless you make the fixes for the patches accordingly).  maybe someone else can put up where to download the files.

I think (think) I have made the changes that would keep the UI up-to-date with the last patches. I cannot verify these myself - as my EQ account is suspended until I can pay Verant some more money, and I won't do that until I can actually pay them some of *my own* money, rather than mooching off friends. I was planning on putting the files up onto eqinterface.com, so that there would be downloads available once more, however...... I am missing 4 screenshots. I would love for someone to post a screenshot of the barbarian, ogre, troll, and iksar UI's here. Those then will be used for the screenshots up on EQInterface.com, and the files will be able to be downloaded from the actual &quot;download section&quot; there. That's the best I can do to make them available people. No screenshots, no downloadable links for the UI. so please, if you currently use my UI, could you post the screenshots of it so that I can make it available for other users? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

There's a problem with &quot;fixing the links&quot; - unless the FTP service you use allows for anonymous FTP.  Or was ther a http:// address that can connect to those files?  If your FTP service won't allow anonymous FTP, or there is no http URL that can connect to them, the only immediate solution I know of that works would result in the password being quite visible.<br />

I got the UI working and its great even though I had to redo the windows cause im using a lower res. But....in the vahbeast folder that was unzipped there are maps files.  Is there an in game map that we can access with this UI?  And if so how do we access it?  Thanks lots!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought I stripped out those map files to make the zip smaller.  maybe I missed one.  They were part of another mod, which was at eq-toolbox.net or something like that.  I dunno if it had been continued.  It was a nice little diversion, but in the end, didn't quite work out the way it was hoped for.<br />
<br />
All the versions worked, last I checked - they have the same coding, just different graphics.  I had originally thought of making it so you downloaded the XML code files in a separate zip froom the graphic &quot;skins&quot;, but instead opted just to make it easier on those who were downloading.<br />
<br />
The files *should* unzip into a folder, based off the race.  barbbeast, iksarbeast, ogrebeast, trollbeast or vahbeast.  Under the folder that is made, is all the files, as well as a &quot;Male&quot; and &quot;Female&quot; inventory graphic folder.  Each starts with the male one defaulted (I play a male Beastlord, so I made the male graphic default).  If you want the female graphic (or to get the male one back) simply copy the file under the correct folder into the main one where the rest of the mod files is at.<br />
<br />
I have not been able to test my UI personally, or play EQ for a while now - and won't until I get a job.  Meanwhile, I did at least give an attempt to make sure it worked with the latest patch changes as well as I could.  The UI is in the &quot;Beta&quot; section on this site because it was, and technically still is, a work in progress.  There was much more I wanted to do with it, but ran out of time.  It works, to the best of my knowledge, as is, but is &quot;incomplete&quot; to my sense of aesthetics.</div></div><hr />

What line is that, you ask?  I don't know off hand. As I have stated numerous times, I don't play EQ currently, I had to stop, and am stopped for the concievable future, as I am still job hunting.  Either rub a couple brain cells together, and study my EQUI.xml file &amp; compare it to the one you have in the folder or just put mine back in.<br />
<br />
Why am I being so rude?  Because a question like you gave above means you would rather follow what someone else has said is a &quot;fix&quot; for a UI, rather than pay attention to the UI's author.  Especially since the UI worked with the latest patches (that I am aware of), and did not need a fix.  Or you decided to add another mod ontop of my UI, and didn't pay attention to what you were doing.</div></div><hr />

other then that this is the best UI i have ever seen :) great work man!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lazaru5</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best bet as to what the xml file error is about is probably concerning the new bard box, since I am also getting the same error every time I zone and dont have one visible.  Odds are, the coding on the default file for it is not compatible with Ooguler;s coding.  And since I don't know diddly about xml coding, I've been content on waiting until someone can post a fix for it.<br />
<br />
As for the pet window, that is the vertical oval-shaped window on the left side of the 'default' positioning of the UI, which has all your stats in it.  if you want access to the command buttons, just do what I did and made hotkeys for them.  I prefer using keyboard shortcuts for alot of the commands in the game rather than clicking on the button for whatever I want to do.  It's way faster, especially in high trafficed (lagged out) zones, to simply hit a key on the keyboard than it is using the mouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More than likely, in order to make my UI work with the latest patches, you just need to do one of the following things.<br />
<br />
Option 1:<br />
<br />
make a backup of the EQUI.xml file from my UI's folder (barbbeast, iksarbeast, ogrebeast, trollbeast, vahbeast), call it something like EQUI.xml.old or something<br />
<br />
copy the file EQUI.xml from the default folder into my UI's folder, look inside it for the line that loads in the spell casting-bar window, and place &lt;!-- at the beginning, and --&gt; at the end.<br />
<br />
Option 2:<br />
<br />
open the file EQUI.xml from both my UI's folder and from the default folder. compare the two, and see which lines are in the one from the default folder but not in the one from my UI, copy the lines and paste them into my UI's EQUI.xml file, save, and exit.<br />
<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Now, those two options both basically do the same thing.  see if it works.  Anything beyond that, I cannot help with - sorry, but as I haven't played EQ in months now, don't even have it installed on my computer any longer, and don't see this changing in the foreseeable future, I can't help you.  I wish I could, believe me.  But I can't.<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
And I'll post my views on the pet window once again - it was a nice idea, but severely lacking.  Without a keyboard shortcut for the buttons, as well as without the ability to add extra macros to the buttons, I found them to be not only useless, but distasteful.  Long ago, way before this UI came into existence, I was already using a set of buttons for my pet-using chars that I would type in manually in the hotkeys.  I just kept using those, and if/when I ever return to EQ, if the pet window buttons are still as useless as ever, well.... I will still not include them in my UI's.<br />
<br />
While I'm at it, I'll bring up the point about the percentages - I like little percentage numbers, but only on certian things.  many of them aren't really all that necessary, and just clutter up the display, especially on this UI.  People ask me constantly about why there's no HP percentages for the group window, no percentage for your pet's hp, etc.  My response is simple - I didn't want them.  They would clutter that window even more than it already is.  It's the same reason there is no stamina bar.  Now, I didn't come up with the layout for this UI - I borrowed it from another one available on EQGUI.com, the Techno-Donuts mod.  I liked it, and reskinned it/enhanced it for beastlords, as that was what I played.<br />
<br />
And people who ask me why I didn't skin the MP3 player, or other recent window, it's simple - they didn't exist when I released the UI.  Some of the windows that did exist when I released it, weren't done because I hadn't come up with a design yet.<br />
<br />
If you want something added/changed to the UI - why not figure it out yourself?  The coding/graphics are only as complicated as you think they are.  The XML is extremely simplistic, if a little tedious. I always follow a rule of &quot;learn by breaking it&quot; when it comes to software.  It's my &quot;crash course&quot; which guarentees that I can usually help with technical support/expertise for people I know on software I've only seen ten to fifteen minutes before.  Give it a try some time.  Computers are really quite more resilient than people give them credit for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry you're not still playing!  But I took your advice and I hacked around on the XML, and it isn't all that bad!  I was wondering why there were XML errors when I opened it up, and I got them fixed then I broke it to where it wouldn't even load!  Then I got it working, NO ERRORS!<br />
<br />
I came here to register and post and saw this forum:<br />
http://eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=36<br />
and that info on the patch update, well it's what I just hacked my way and was about to post!! LOL!!<br />
<br />
The only thing is I FIXED windows 4.tga!!!  So I have the UI, WITH songs window, songs button on the selector AND the song icon in there AND the UI compass graphic!<br />
<br />
I'm about to hack my way through updating the Songs window to be like the effects window.  I have two problems:<br />
<br />
I don't know where song icons are.  Are they in the spell icons, so i can just adjust the XML to match the effects, and not worry about the graphics?  Can I use the default icons for now?  Can someone point me in the right direction?<br />
<br />
I don't have a bard to test this to make sure it works.  So if I get something, I won't know if it's functional.<br />
<br />
So follow the instructions in the patch forum and your UI will work to a &quot;T&quot;<br />

<br />
I got my UI working also by going through the posted instructions but I was wondering if you could make the &quot;windows4.tga&quot; available to download that has Oguler's original compass ( love the colors of it).  I attempted to edit the pic itself with unsavory results.  I am using the default campass but without the song icon in the selector window.  I'd appreciate it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nytekat</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok guys.. I fixed my UI so for all of you that love this UI I'll post a fix.  I think I got all the files that I changed.  I put a new buff window and compass in it also (you don't have to use this but I put it in cause I added everything that I changed to make it work.)<br />
<br />
If it don't work PM me and I'll dig it all out again.<br />
<br />
PS this will work for any of the BST UI's!  It dosen't have anything to do with the graphics.. just the xml files.  I hope this helps!!</div></div><hr />

I really dont want to use anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll mess with the inventory file when the charms window comes out, I like Oguler's windows SO MUCH more then the default.  So when it's out plan on using the default for a little bit til I get the code sorted out, should be a simple cut and paste method, but you never know.  SO yeah I'll be working a fix, now I use the Vah Shir UI so you might have to some cut and pasting yourself, but as soon as I know it i'll post the fix or link to it! ;)<br />
<br />
Here's the compass file I use.  You'll notice that the music not doesn't fit the UI, I don't know what tint Oguler used so if someone wants to match it and post that's up to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: updated with the 2/4 patch pieces.</div></div><hr />

For me to keep up with the patches at this point, is extremely tedious, as I cannot actually log into the game - if anyone wants to pick up and keep it coming, fine :)  I have the original files for the graphics and such packed away on my computer, however they are not Photoshop files, they are GIMP files.  I had lost the Blender3D files I had which made the window borders, and haven't reinstalled Blender3D since I reinstalled my computer to make room for a Linux partition once again.  I cannot send the original files through e-mail, nor do I have a place to drop them off online for someone to access.  If you want them, I need an address I can FTP them to you.<br />
<br />
I hope to one day be able to get back to playing EQ.  Months have gone by with no luck on tracking down a job still and frustration once again is building rapidly.</div></div><hr />

When it comes out offically I'm Sure i will come up with something. I mean sure it a nice inventory to keep it like it is, But kinda huge for me. I'm so used to  smaller inventories. I have noticed too that the containers the slots dont really line up with the items you have in them, not to say that they are huge as well. Might just go with the default untill someone really picks up on this UI to revamp it. Though it is a very nice UI, I think it need to be shrunk up some.</div></div><hr />
