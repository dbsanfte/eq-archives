<br />
Please pardon me for an unsuccessful attempt when searching the forums for any existing information on this subject.<br />
<br />
What I am looking for is a UI that looks like the old pre-luclin UI. Remember that beautiful, simple chat box? The one that looked like a thin rectangle drawn in MS-paintbrush? Yeah, I want all of my windows to look like that again. No fancy vines, busy colors, and no window names. I think everyone plays often enough to know which window they are looking at without having to read the window title as a reminder. Yes, I know you can just put a &quot;.&quot; for your transparent window name and it's barely noticable, but for any opaque window the name area is just taking up space unnecessarily.<br />
<br />
One day, a few months ago before the old velious UI was abandoned, I switched to the old UI for kicks and realized how simple and non-distracting it was. Don't get me wrong, I like the features of the new UI such as item links, multiple chat windows, the compass, the song window, and the map system on occasion, etc..., and I would like to retain these features, but every UI I have seen so far is cluttered, sci-fi, or artistically bold and I just don't have time to create a simple UI of my own. <br />
<br />
I currently use the default UI that loads with everquest because I got sick of looking for updated UI's whenever a UI patch occured, however I would gladly do the extra work for a simple one.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know where to find a bare-bones, user made UI that closely resembles the one from the velious era?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help. =)<br />

I think there may have been a third, but I don't remember for sure, and the fact that I don't suggests strongly that even if there had been, it hasn't been kept up to date.</div></div><hr />

 I saw the post on the glade and came here, but to me it was like finding a needle in a haystack. I'll check out these two, thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Forestien</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i checked those out... although they are fine examples of the extremely oldschool UI, they are a different type of old UI than I was looking for. <br />
<br />
I always played in full screen mode back in those days, with the simple black rectangular boxes where you could set their transparency, move around the screen by clicking the corners to drag them open.  Simple, simple, simple.... i'm sure you must remember the difference between those two links and the full screen mode that i am talking about. <br />
<br />
Anything like that here? I'm looking for as little screen clutter as possible, with as least art as possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
here's what i personally am looking for:<br />
<br />
-simple rectangular boxes<br />
-no titles on anything <br />
-no wavy artsy crap<br />
-no jamming every single thing into the bottom of the screen<br />
<br />
doesn't have to be a full ui in fact i would be pretty happy just getting all the title bars off the default ui</div></div><hr />
