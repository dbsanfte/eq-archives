This file was patched on Sat. Oct 2nd 2004.<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
open eqlsplayerdata.ini in your EQ folder<br />
change:<br />
HasViewedWebOrder1=false<br />
to:<br />
HasViewedWebOrder1=true<br />
<br />
This was true as of yesterday, but the problem is back again as of Oct. 4th 2004 eqmain.dll patch. The issue still however has to do with custom load screens and the &quot;buy SOE stuff&quot; window. If you want to get back in, just change your eqlsplayerdata.ini.file.  CAUTION: This is as of 10/4!!! and may need to be changed again next time Sony wants us to buy stuff or releases some news.<br />

HasReadSWarning=true<br />
OmensFirstOffer=1084929848<br />
OmensLastOffer=1095133933<br />
HasViewedWebOrder1=true<br />
WebOrder1FirstOffer=1096762630<br />
WebOrder1LastOffer=1096851559<br />
<br />
[UI]<br />
XMLFilename=EQLSUI_custom.xml<br />
<br />
[NEWS]<br />
LastViewed=-814016356<br />
<br />
If you want to avoid this all together you can revert your eqlsplayerdata.ini file to the default.This will no longer use your custom loadscreen, but will get you in game.<br />
<br />
Change:<br />
[UI]<br />
XMLFilename=EQLSUI_custom.xml <br />
to  <br />
[UI]<br />
XMLFilename=EQLSUI.xml<br />
<br />
and change this back to:<br />
<br />
HasViewedWebOrder1=true<br />
to <br />
HasViewedWebOrder1=false<br />
<br />
I got back in with this, so hopefully it will help get you back in as well.</div></div><hr />
