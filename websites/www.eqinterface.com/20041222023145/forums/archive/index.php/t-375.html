I really don't think you'll find a better source of info than this. Try using the search function, it's helped me a lot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">comtesse</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the best thing to do is look at the default files and compare them to the mods pepole have posted here, then go into a copy of the default skin and play around with it and see what you can break and change, note what you did and how it changes the layout of things, once you understand the basics, like adding text guages or lables then move up to more dificult things and work you way to the backgrounds and when you get stuck ask questions here about what you want<br />

hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jeremyf</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest you don't need to know anything about XML to be able to change the interface.  The most complex part is understanding what you can and can't include.  As mentioned already, if you copy the original file from the default directory you can then change it to your requirements.  The main thing is to keep an item together ie<br />
<br />
&lt;InvSlot item = &quot;InvSlot1&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;ScreenID&gt;InvSlot1&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
......<br />
&lt;/InvSlot&gt;<br />
<br />
The value inside ScreenID i think is used by the engine and must stay the same.  The item name can change but must match with the Pieces decleration in the window definition.  It appears certain items are expected on a window.  Inside the item definition is a field called EQType.  This tells the engine what the item is.  For your first attempt try just moving things around using the Location values.<br />
