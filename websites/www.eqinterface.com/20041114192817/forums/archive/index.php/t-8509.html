<br />
The Confirm Destroy Window just wont stay put.  Everytime I zone, I have to reposition it :(<br />
<br />
<br />
WARNING<br />
Open a merchants Bag.  Start to buy from a merchant then open their bag.  It will open the container window with no slots.  So whats the point?  <br />
<br />
Its a bug that it allowed.  Since you can open as many containers as the merchant has container types for sale - you could in theory open 80 of these windows.  The problem is that when you do this, you are creating new entries in your characters INI files that could result in it becoming corrupted.<br />

<br />
Has anyone summoned something when they had a HOTKEY on their cursor?  Just wondering if it causes any problems.<br />

Still using my night-vision chat window - All I can say is WHOO-HOO it rocks.</div></div><hr />
