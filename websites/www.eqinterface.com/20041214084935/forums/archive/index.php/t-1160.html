<br />
Here's a list:<br />
sit button in bottom right hand corner<br />
groupbar+spellbar same height juxtaposed with one another<br />
bigger buttons for action window<br />
names in buff window<br />
all critical buttons on the bottom right hand side of screen<br />
pet healthbar moved to hotbutton window<br />
player window and group windows on right lower portion of screen<br />
Spell gems as close as possible to group window.<br />
All window tabs and toggles on the bottom of their appropriate windows... The less my cursor has to stray from the lower right hand corner of the screen the better.<br />
<br />
The Venje Cleric mod is a great example. If only the stuff happened to be on the right hand side =P.<br />
<br />
Maybe I could draw a picture to show what I mean. Anyone willing to take a look? Or try their hand?<br />
<br />
PS- is it possible to integrate the hotbutton window into the action window and have it accessable via a tab. Hot buttons are great and all, but the action keys have one superior advantage(in my opinion at least). The buttons are unmovable, ie they will never &quot;stick to the cursor&quot; as sometimes happens during lag.<br />
<br />
Right now I could care less about looks, my main concern is functionality.</div></div><hr />
