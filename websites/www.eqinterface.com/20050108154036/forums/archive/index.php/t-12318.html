I haven't done any fletching for awhile because I had plenty of arrows and bows. I need more so I went to my fletching kit and began as usual. &quot;You can not assemble these items in this container type&quot;. My first thought was maybe I was using a Tunare kit, so I purchased another Kit in shadow haven. I got the same result. My second thought was that the UI I use (AYA) had a problem. So I switched to default. Tried again  with the same response. I rechecked my components to be sure they were correct and they were, I think I've done enough to know if they are correct. Does anyone have a reason they can pass on so I can figure this OUT.</div></div><hr />

Go to eqtraders and double check the recipe.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Mortis.<br />
<br />
I keep stacks of Fletching Components in the bank and mixed in Vanes instead of Shafts. Darn stuff uses the same Icon.<br />

Anyway a clear head found the problem (Yours being the clear head) thanks.</div></div><hr />
