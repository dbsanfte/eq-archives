I put my first &quot;public&quot; skin up yesterday and some of you have already found it.  As the name implies there is nothing fancy about it.  I redid the group, inventory, hotkeys, buffs, and container windows to make them more useful to my play style.  Some cosmetic changes to several other windows to make them fit in better with the new ones and a custom spell bar as well.  The A version was designed for a caster but I put in a few extra tweeks to keep it viable for a melee.  If there is any demand for it I can finish up the B mod for the pure melees.  All of my windows that do not use custom graphics are fully compatible with the &quot;default&quot; standards and can be freely mixed with other mods.  Feel free to commence with the praise, criticism, bug reports and other comments. :D <br />
<br />
I also posted 2 versions of my bags independently for anyone who wants just them.  I shrank them down just about as far as is possible without overlapping or changing the size on the slots.  I also made them &quot;sticky&quot; so it is nearly impossible to move them by accident.<br />

&lt;snip&gt; <br />
noticed one issue with group window...<br />
it truncates the last digit on the player hp's and mana only shows the first 2 digits hehe <br />
know if there is a fix to this ? <br />
 <br />
<br />
hmm, it was showing all three when I tested it....<br />
Is it just happening on your entry or is it doing it to other people in your group as well? also what resolution are you running at? Will take a look at it and see if I can figgure out why it is giving you trouble...<br />

Is anyone else having this problem?  Hoping that someone else in the 80 plus people that have downloaded it so far can give me some info. I have not been able to duplicate the problem myself, however I would like to know what is happening and see if I can resolve it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind that some people have HP, and maybe even mana, up to five digits.  If some people have trouble with missing digits and others don't, it's probably because they're using a different font.<br />
<br />
As for stayput bags: the original stayput containers are already updated -- see the container section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marcin</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The EL container mod still has not been updated.  No offense to your stayput bags as they are nice, but there are some features about the EL version that are more pleasing for some. Seeing as this is two months old, I will work on this update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marcin</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got it working and have submitted it for approval. Once approved the link should be http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3671<br />
<br />
If there are any problems let me know, I tested the functionality of deleting an aug, and removing an aug / re-adding without any issues.</div></div><hr />

I am back to working on this again after a long time of ignoring it, should have version 2.0 out sometime in the next week or so...</div></div><hr />
