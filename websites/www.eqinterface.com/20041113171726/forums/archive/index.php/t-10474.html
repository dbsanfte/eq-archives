<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Praetor</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know about the rest of you folks out there, but I'm too lazy to multi-box on more than one box.  I'm also too cheap to buy a box that can do this effectively, so I have to run at bare-bones minimum graphics; this means the tiniest resolution possible.<br />
<br />
Now I loooooove the original Vert mods and have followed them since the beginning, dedicatedly modding them every patch before Sokol does and even adding in a few new spiffy features that I personally prefer (t.king icons, my own custom inventory, and so on).<br />
<br />
What's been frustrating me lately is that my low res window doesn't have a lot of mod options for the UI, especially my beloved Vert mod.  So I finally reached my breaking point, and spent a good five hours reconfiguring some key windows to fit properly in my teeny screen.  I've attached a picture of the preliminary end result below.<br />
<br />
Some changes include:<br />
<br />
- No more inventory access from the hotbutton window.  I love this feature on my main, but it's not necessary for secondary and tertiary characters and it takes up lots of room.  Off it goes!<br />
- Ultra-small buff windows.  I spent about 2 hours trying to make decent smallish buff windows, but in the end I just shamelessly ripped it off from Jaryn UI 3.3.  They did it infinitely better than I anyhow, my apologies in advance.<br />
- Added a cast bar to the player window over the XP bar.  You don't need the XP bar in combat, and it cuts down on clutter when casting.  Why not?<br />
- Haxed together an oldish spell bar from a long-deceased Vert version, added the spellbook icon and removed a casting bar.<br />
- Radically modified the inventory window.  Changed to a more classic EQ layout, moved a few buttons around and removed the redundant stats that are visible in the player and pet windows.<br />
- Some other stuff.  Cleaned up some code and modified some files to add a colour scheme for my brother's shadowknight (Charcoal?!).<br />
<br />
I don't want to actually release it unless I get the blessings of the original authors (both of the Vert mod and Jaryn).  I really just want some feedback, mostly to see if people would be interested in something like this.<br />
<br />
Constructive criticism is welcomed of course.</div></div><hr />

One thing that I think would help on yours would be to ditch the button window and replace it was one that has made the buttons smaller.  I don't know where I stole mine originally, but it probably came from this site.<br />
<br />
I would see if you can find the code and incorporate the &quot;small&quot; features of it into the one you are using.  It would reduce it's size by a good 40%.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WoRlaNN</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestion is if you want to see the screen better, turn the level of fading down to a much lower number (mines at 30)... You can still see the windows, but they aren't as intrusive on the display.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orpington2019</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you need to move the players hp min max to right above the 100% on the player health bar...where it is currently is not an ituitive place to look...<br />
<br />
Other than that looks great...include a mini map window too...&amp;))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Praetor</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The HP move I actually considered once when I originally saw the first Vert mods.<br />
<br />
The reason I didn't actually involves a bit of basic psychology though.  Without going into too much detail, the brain processes analog input a fraction of a second faster than numerical.  This is why healing classes shouldn't choose a UI that eliminates the HP or mana bars:  The split second it takes to process the numbers is enough to let a person die, so it requires greater amounts of guesswork to preempt healing the target(s).<br />
<br />
I found that if I moved the numerical HP display right next to the analog, I would try to read both at the same time (and it was to the detriment of my group, since my main and secondaries are a paladin and druid/ranger respectively).  Having it on the opposite side of the window still allows it to be seen when I have time to calculate the best heal, but isn't so obtrusive as to inhibit split-second reactions.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary.  It's pretty trvial to change:		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;76&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;60&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;into:		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;76&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;-1&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;anyways if you prefer it that way. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
a) make it tiny<br />
b) make the arrow white (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10398) and<br />
c) not have to work/go to class 24/7<br />
<br />
Edit: And trim up some of the code I had to hax out in a few of the modified windows.  While changing the form of them is easy, leaving extra code is too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tpfethos</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awsome idea - looking forward to its release *hurry up i cant wait much longer!*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csivils</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use EQW as well, I've been working on a 640x480 UI.  Here is a picture of what I've got so far.<br />
<br />
My biggest complaint was the tunnel vision that came from having such a small window, as a result I've focused on trying to keep everything as transparent as possible.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions/ideas would be welcomed, although I'm not an expert at the UI XML, I just kinda tweak stuff till I get what I want.<br />

I may consider using this some time if I ever get around to learning how to effectively play a warrior and shaman at the same time :)</div></div><hr />
