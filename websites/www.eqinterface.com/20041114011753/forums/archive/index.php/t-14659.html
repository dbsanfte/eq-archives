I have done a little reorganizing and have finished the latest beta version of it.<br />

You can download the attachment if you want to try it in game. I would like a little feedback so that I can put the final touches on it. Thanks! :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks neat.  One thing to keep in mind is that people who use Vert graphics (and most other bar mods too) have taller xp bars -- 8 pixels high instead of 6.  You might want to move the two xp bars up just a smidge.  Also remember that some people have 5-digit HP... be sure to leave enough room for that.<br />
<br />
There's one more thing, that's really just my personal preference.  I'm not a big fan of pictures of spinning swords.  So I set that item to size 0 by 0 in my inventory window.  With that gone, you can move the stats and coins and xp bars further to the left.  The destroy button can be made transparent and placed on top of something else... I put mine over the xp bars.  The autoequip area can also be transparent... I put mine on top of the stats.  With the spinning sword and gaping black hole removed from the center, the whole window would be more compact.</div></div><hr />

Thanks those are some useful tips. As far as the spinning sword, that will be whatever class you are's emblem. In the picture it is just an example. I like the transparent ideas though so I will look into maybe doing that. Did you test it with 5 digit HP? I haven't had a chance so if you did let me know. I am abotu to go to Hawaii so I won't be able to do anything for 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />
