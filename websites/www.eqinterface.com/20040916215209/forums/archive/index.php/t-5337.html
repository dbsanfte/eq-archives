<br />
Basically a very quick hack of the &quot;standard&quot; vertical buff window that is available for VertMod.. <br />
<br />
Basically it's like this;<br />
<br />
[small icon] song name<br />
[small icon] song name<br />
[small icon] song name<br />
[small icon] song name<br />
<br />
in a very small and flat manner. <br />
<br />
it's nothing fancy, as it's pretty straight forward, but I figured I'd post it anyway. It might be slightly bigger than 4 bard songs, but I didn't get a chance to have 4 songs played to adjust it perfectly. Easy to do at the bottom of the XML however. I'll update with a more exact Y value if people want.<br />
<br />
To use, just overwrite your current XML file with the one in the zip. <br />
<br />
/rain<br />
<br />
Edit: Messed up my first upload with wrong version of the XML file, should be the right one now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you fix it up, or tell me how to fix it, such that its transparent like the normal buff window, with icons visible? Would like to keep the same style.  fade/normal 0 doesn't seem to do the job...<br />
<br />
Oh also can you include the numbering by any chance?  either from 1 or 16.... like the other buff window.<br />
<br />
Thanks =)</div></div><hr />
