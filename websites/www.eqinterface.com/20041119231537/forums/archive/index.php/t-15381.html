Any TGA's you use in your UI can be converted to this DDS format.<br />
It should speed video performance, and use less video ram.<br />
It is a direct x9 Feature so any card that supports EQ and Dx9 will support DDS.<br />

<br />
Ok, to begin try converting window_pieces01.tga to DDS.<br />
then search your Custom UI folder for all calls to window_pieces01.tga via the windows search feature. Open up the files and replace window_pieces01.tga with window_pieces01.dds.<br />
<br />
Now that ALL the calls for window_pieces01.tga are changed in your custom UI folder you now have to search the DEFAULT folder for window_pieces01.tga<br />
If there are any XML files that are different containing this call you have to copy that file to your Custom UI folder and mod it aswell. <br />
<br />
NOTE: You can ignore the XML files that start with EQLSUI_ as they are the preloader files.<br />
<br />
You have to do the above for each and every TGA file you convert. Make 100% sure you didn't miss any Default files that use these TGA's.<br />

Sokol said to copy the files fron Default over to your custom UI folder before modding them, so you end up not touching anything in Default per say.<br />

Kudane said &quot;DDS UIs are not cross compatible with TGA UIs.&quot;<br />
Meening just that the XML files that were changed to call DDS wouldn't work with a TGA mod. For example if I tossed my Right aligned buff mod for solaria 1.x in solaria 2.x DDS it would fail to load the UI.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcherPhate</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here Is What You Do To Update or Convert To DDS <br />
<br />
1- Get the UI you want to update or convert.<br />
2- Using PSP, PS, or one of the converters listed in the Stickyed post by Kudane, Convert all TGA to DDS.<br />
3- Change all references to the TGA versions to reflect the new DDS versions.<br />
3B- If any of you windows contain refrence to a default file (default UI componet) then save a converted(from TGA to DDS) version with the updated/converted UI.<br />
4- Delete(or store elsewhere) the TGA versions.<br />
5- Your UI is now updated/converted!!!<br />
<br />
Here's an example*<br />
<br />
Files<br />
WindowPieces_1.tga<br />
EQAnimation.xml<br />
<br />
Change WindowPieces_1.tga to a DDS. It will look like this.  <br />
Windowpieces_1.dds<br />
Delete( or save elsewhere) the TGA version.<br />
<br />
Now go into EQ animations and <br />
<br />
Change<br />
&lt;TextureInfo item = &quot;window_pieces01.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
	&lt;Size&gt;<br />
	        &lt;CX&gt;256&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
		&lt;CY&gt;256&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
&lt;/TextureInfo&gt; <br />
To<br />
&lt;TextureInfo item = &quot;window_pieces01.dds&quot;&gt;<br />
	&lt;Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;CX&gt;256&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
		&lt;CY&gt;256&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
&lt;/TextureInfo&gt;<br />
<br />
and now your done.<br />
<br />
*- For simplicity sake, we are imagining that there is only one referance to the file we are using.<br />
<br />
RULES TO REMEBER!!!<br />
<br />
1.)No UI can have both DDS and TGA in the same UI.  You must have all TGA or all DDS.<br />
2.)All refrences to the TGA version in XMLs MUST be changed to reflect the new DDS.<br />
3.)Any default images, files that come from default folder, must be in  the custom folder, as DDS, if you want to use them as DDS in the UI.<br />
4.)Be sure to save you DDS on the highest resolution setting to prevent picture disfigureing<br />

<br />
check your &quot;save as&quot; setting make sure you saving them in full resolution. there are a TON of options for saving DDS format.<br />
<br />
I saw no loss of quality in photoshop when i reopened my DDS files. If you are seeing it you may want to double check your settings.</div></div><hr />

I  got my plugin from the NVidia link provided.<br />
I Downloaded and installed to the plugins folder.<br />

I Can now save as DDS.<br />
<br />
One thing to note.  When you go to plugins via effects tool bar.  It's under nvtools(default name) and tehy only effect gives you this window.<br />
http://img14.exs.cx/img14/9557/Look.jpg<br />
<br />
 So If you are using PSP make sure to check The Alpha Channel Box In corner.<br />

NOTE!!!<br />
Clicking 3D Preview caused me to crash to desktop.  This may ahve been caused to the lack of anything on teh image, i had been just opening a sigy layout and just going strait to the effect.</div></div><hr />

you do not need mip mapping. If the preview files with the character creator are what we expect to see in EQ2 you may need it for that one. but for EQ you do not need MIP Mapping</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
they wont be playing EQ if they can't support DX9.0. Remember they switched EQ to DX9 many months ago.<br />
<br />
sooo SOE took care of any issues of this sort when they said you had to be able to support DX9 to play EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sokol</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well with the popularity this format seems to be getting from UI authors I am sure that SoE is probably atleast looking into converting their Default UI to DDs as well. True if this happens alot of the old unsuported UI's will fall by the waste side. (Although they would always be reverse TGA compatible) But over all i'd imagine EQL gaining a nice performance boost.<br />

<br />
Using Fraps, here are the following results I have found:<br />
<br />
In the bazaar with trader mode on and trader window open:<br />
Forry UI version 3.4 (.tga files) - approx. 44fps<br />
ForryDDS (.dds files) - approx. 45fps<br />
<br />
In the bazaar, not in trader mode:<br />
Forry UI version 3.4 - approx. 48fps<br />
Forry DDS - approx. 50fps<br />
<br />
<br />
The numbers came out the same in full screen and windows mode.  All tests were performed on a Dell Pentium 4 processor (3.06Ghz with HTT), 1Gb of Ram, Windows XP Prof., and a Geforce4 4400 with 128Mb onboard.<br />
<br />
So I am seeing an improvement, but it seems to very slight...this may change with different UI's though...I believe my UI has always been pretty decent with fps.  Who knows?!  I still like the new type because of the drive space it will save.  :D</div></div><hr />

Take mp3's  cut the bitrate down to 64 kbps  and you end up with a poor sounding song ..  I think its the same way with png's. Loose too much detail with a highly compressed format.   <br />
Now I haven't played with png's alot but I think that is the case ... it should be ok with small files but larger ones may look very bad.</div></div><hr />

It means that it wants to save in DXT2 format but your editor doesn't support it (most likely you have a choice of DXT1, DXT1, DXT3, and DXT5).<br />

the problem is PNGs do not support Alpha channels. I worked with PNGs when I first started making UI mods, but both Sokol and I were not happy with the pixelization and degredation of small images when brought into the UI. <br />
<br />
and when i saved a 256k TGA as a DDS like i saved the Solaria files I get 2.6k not 6.81... sooo you must be enabling MIP Mapping or another setting. (it might also depend whats *in* the image)<br />

Actually what this means is that the width and height must be to a power of 2. (e.g. 1x1, 16x4, 64x128, 256x256, ...) up to 1024x1024. So the only acceptable numbers are: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024. Images larger than 1024x1024 aren't supported. This is easily fixed if you are using Photoshop. Just enlarge, (or shrink), your canvas size and anchor everything to the upper left hand corner. Then go in if you have an alpha channel and fill in the new part of the canvas. Save them as DXT 1 ARGB (1 bit alpha) if you have an alpha channel and no MIP mapping. (Save them as DXT 1 RGB, if you aren't using an alpha channel).<br />
<br />
Do not save them as an 8:8:8:8 scheme. This is saving them as 8 bits per channel with an 8 bit alpha, (which is not necessary, unless you have fades). This is where the increase in file size is coming from as these are basically uncompressed files.</div></div><hr />

Because PNG is open source and Microsoft won't be caught dead with anything even remotely related to a GNU-style license in its OS.</div></div><hr />

What if we are using a setup like Quartz, where it only uses a few modified Window pieces then utilizes the defaults. This won't work, because your modifeid window is usind DDS and the ones that use default use tga, hence broken UI. So to copy ALL of Deafult into your UI file (Say Quartz) then copy over the Quzrtz files, you convert everything to DDs and it works, but next patch your UI that was (hopefully) unbreakable is now busted cause your no longer calling default. That pretty much sum it up? You have to convert the whole default directory to DDs and then make your modified UI from that directory?  :nana:</div></div><hr />

If you only have a one or two small .tga files in your custom folder, I don't think it is worth switching.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm using the profiles posted here btw. I use the one posted by Jethal to preserve the &quot;fading&quot; of some mods, and I use the one posted by Kudane on the rest.<br />
<br />
I modded Delta 3.0 and I noticed some pixelation and some loss of what can be described as &quot;smoothness&quot; in the graphic files. The buttons have a few &quot;blemishes.&quot; I'll try post a SS of what I mean later.<br />
<br />
I'm wonderng what can be done to prevent this from happening.</div></div><hr />
