<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this name was being tossed around in chat on test, there weren't many people in kelethin this morning so I think only a handful were in the hut that the ?GM/NPC?* spawned.  If anyone knows what was going on.  Or has a spoiler for if this is a expansion they are planing on, please post.<br />
<br />
heck it could be a idea to expand the war with the orcs in crushbone for all I heard.<br />
<br />
Or maybe they are going to open the looping planes, or drakescale hills on faydwer.<br />
<br />
anyhow keep your ears to the ground ( or to the trees in this case ).<br />
<br />
*NOTE: the GM/NPC had no name so couldn't tell the colour of his title, it looked like one of those little treants you see in the newbie area.</div></div><hr />
