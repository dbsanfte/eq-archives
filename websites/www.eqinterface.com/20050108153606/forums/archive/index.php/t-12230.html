<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reedok</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just downloaded the WoW inspired UI located here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2564) that Drakah/Soes created.  I Love it, as do many others.<br />
<br />
I have a small request.  On the hotkey bar the normal XP bar is located.  Included in the download is a AAXP bar mod.  So, you can have either one or the other.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to add the AAXP as a small thin purple (or whatever color ya think fits the UI best) line (very much like the patch file download indicator, or old style XP bars) over the current (Yellow) XP indicator?<br />
<br />
AND alongside the numerical value of the XP -- have the AAXP bar value ?<br />
<br />
I so love this UI .. and this would make it perfect in my eyes.<br />
<br />
IF anyone can do this OR show me how to do it .. I would be very happy!<br />
<br />
Thanks to all who read and this great site and its contributors!<br />

<br />
This harder to do then I think it is?  <br />
Are more details needed?  Please let me know if there are things you need to know.<br />
<br />
Also, if this is meticulously intense and time is a factor .. i surely would appreciate a shove in the right direction ... as I would enjoy doing this ... just not sure how to get started.<br />
<br />
Please, if you can help, just get me on the right foot, I would surely be one happy fella. :)<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
