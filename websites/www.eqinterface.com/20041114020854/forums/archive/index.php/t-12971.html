Wow - you want the giant guages in the player window too?  Hrm... Maybe as an option pack, the idea does have some merit.</div></div><hr />

Would be cool if you could make the player window horizontal.<br />
<br />
<br />
HPgauge    Managauge   Endgauge  Exp   AAEXP maybe stats here.<br />
<br />
Same height as pet window.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If anybody, Particularly Lothay is interested, I've modified the Inventory screen to include the Current and Max mana values.  I've attached a screenshot of what this look like.  You'll notice I've also added Current and Max Weight values.  This is something I did for personal use a while back.  I use version 1.1 of Lothay, but this should also work for other versions.  <br />
<br />
Note:  Since I believe Lothay is still active in the EQ Modding community, I will not post the actual code for the XML file till he gives me the go ahead.  I'm also sending the code to him directly for his approval.<br />
