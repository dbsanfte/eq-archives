Intel and Microsoft are gearing up to move toward the first major overhaul of the innermost workings of the personal computer--the boundary where software and hardware meet--during 2004. The companies will begin promoting a technology specification called EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) as a new system for starting up a PC's hardware before its operating system begins loading, a process that kicks in every time a PC is switched on or restarted. <br />
<br />
The pair will establish a forum to promote the specification as a standard. If EFI-based software is accepted broadly, it could prompt the first changing of the guard in preboot software in the history of the PC industry--even though some critics say the transition may take a while or may not happen at all. <br />
<br />
Right now, the task of getting a PC's hardware ready to accept the operating system is handled by software called BIOS, or basic input/output system. While the BIOS was once relatively straightforward in its design, over the years it has morphed into a figurative bowl of spaghetti as it's been changed and updated to accept new technologies.<br />

Intel and Microsoft subscribe to a very different theory, &quot;If it ain't broke, redesign it until you can make a ton of money off of liscensing and supporting it, cause now it will break quite often.&quot;<br />
<br />
Think about your install of Windows. Can you imagine if your Bios was that hopelessly complex? that full of security holes? That unstable and unpredictable? That full of spamware and adware and whatever elseware that anyone wants to put on your machine when you accidentally glance at an add banner?<br />
<br />
I hope and pray that this doesn't become a standard. Is Microsoft honestly trying to say it's the BIOS that makes computers boot slowly!?! I mean good grief.<br />
<br />
The bios is one of the last vestages of software or firmware that was written to do a job, and do it reliably. Now they want to complete the transition to software and firmware that is designed for one single purpose. Make Intel and Microsoft money.<br />
<br />
There is no better way in this industry to make money than to create a &quot;standard&quot;. God this kind of thing makes me sick. <br />

The original public BIOs software was constructed from a set of commands ripped from IBM chips.  I agree, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but this may inable future advancments like when computer manufacturers started using PCI interface rather than ISA.  Let's just hope this does not turn into the whole beta/VHS fiasco where marketing outweighs better technology.</div></div><hr />
