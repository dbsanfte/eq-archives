<br />
I don't need an OS that displays every movie and picture in thumbnail form, and layers the windows as if they were on a z axis...<br />
<br />
I need an OS that doesnt crash everytime a dust-mote falls in the gears, and doesn't hog all the expensive memory I bought specifically for everquest to hog. <br />
<br />
(Well, I also need an operating system I can understand, and plays my entire current library of games, otherwise I would definitely be using Linux right now)<br />

And macs... well: http://www.ugo.com/channels/games/features/switch/media/switch.mov</div></div><hr />

Yes. Exactly. Thank you.<br />
<br />
I detest monopolies just on principle, but you have to wonder about the world Microsoft is living in... YES, people keep buying their products (and we could argue about why til the cows come home) but it's not like the need each product to sell out to remain successful... they could take risks and make their software take LESS HD space, LESS memory, run FASTER, be MORE compatible with each incarnation... every time a new Windows version comes out, the same complaints are registered by major respected reviewers... and still... <br />
<br />
What does it say about Windows that they incorporated a process in XP to handle crashes better? :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
&lt;sighs&gt; Apologies for the rant... anyway, thanks for the heads-up about Longhorn, I certainly have good reason not to upgrade now. ;)</div></div><hr />
