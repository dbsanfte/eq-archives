*** PLEASE NOTE ***<br />
The UI will come out mangled unless you copy the UI_YourCharName_YourServerNumber.ini file and rename it accordingly, for Veeshan players it would be like this: UI_Soes_35.ini where you would replace Soes with your character's name. Once you renamed the file, copy it to your BASE EQ DIRECTORY and make sure you overwrite whatever existing ini file might be there. IF YOU DON'T DO THIS THE UI WON'T WORK CORRECTLY!!!!</div></div><hr />

So how do we figure out what our server number is?  <br />
<br />
Look in your EQ Directory, you'll fine a file called UI_Petros_##.ini... where ## = your server number.</div></div><hr />

Great skin love the reso :D <br />
thanks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PetrosDaroc</div><div class="date">01-15-2003, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, a few things I am noting that I would like to see included...<br />
<br />
1. I was having problems moving some of the windows (tried renaming the file and such, but still wound up with windows in their original position, so moved 'em myself to organize it the way it should be...will decompress file and try again shortly).  Actually, the only window I had problems moving was the stat window (the one with the resists/clicky/pet tabs).<br />
<br />
*edit* Problem solved...after inspection of the UI_Your....ini file, I realized that I had named the skin differently than what was in the UI file, so I renamed the directory and voila, things work..  :) *end edit*<br />
<br />
2. Is there any chance of getting a bar with reg and AA xp percentages showing on the screen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rencro</div><div class="date">01-15-2003, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CLICKS has the exp bars in it...<br />

ie. Player  Clicks  Pet --just above the resist numbers</div></div><hr />

i like your Ui but its a pain typing /book everytime you need to open your spell book otherwise its a beauty skin  <br />
<br />
Just make a hotkey for your book,<br />
<br />
i have hot keys for all the different spells i have.<br />
<br />
slot 1 on page 10 Name of hot key<br />
<br />
1 Spells<br />
<br />
/book 1<br />
<br />
2 Gates<br />
<br />
/book 5<br />
<br />
so on and so forth<br />
<br />
when you do it this way you dont need to use back and forth buttons in the spell book for most cases<br />
<br />
Hope that will help you<br />

<br />
Newbie question: I'm curious how I would set this for a viewport using 1024x768 version, or if it's compatible with viewport at all? Would love to use it but my p.o.s system pretty much demands that I use viewport mods. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help/response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valgard</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This uses a viewport already for 1024x768 resolution.<br />

<br />
<br />
Anyone know how I can change the font size on my main chat to match that of the melee window?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ashur</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The crash is caused by failing to have the new tint XML file included in the EQUI.XML file in the \Soes folder.  Simply add:<br />
<br />
&lt;Include&gt;WhateverTheHeckTheDarnTintXmlFileIsCalled.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
note: placeholder name for the actual name, which eludes me (I'm not at home)<br />
<br />
at the bottom beneath all the other Include statements and then save the file.<br />
<br />
I had the same problem and resolved it with this fix.<br />
<br />
- Ash<br />
<br />
Also, Darkrigel, I think you just need to change your game settings to the 1024x768 size.  The Soes files have settings for both in them and should be cued from the client which set to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No matter what I add to my EQUI file it crashed when I zone.<br />
What I did notice if this helps. If you take out the 2 EQUIExtra lines out of your EQUI, the skin loads default, but you can then zone and not crash.<br />
<br />
Would really like some imput on a fix here thanks.</div></div><hr />

See above posts, which explain why its happening.<br />

I'd have it fixed if I could figure out how to resize the bar that runs across the top (under the target bar)</div></div><hr />

In fact, even the DEFAULT ui is bugged.. i noticed that it still moved windows when I zoned!<br />

I'm anticipating that Sony will patch the servers again soon..</div></div><hr />

<br />
The windows move when they are sized so that they are off the screen.  The fix is to move them back onto the screen.<br />
<br />
The new charm slot messed things up too, the inventory window has to be changed so that we can see it there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
THIS IS ONLY FOR 1024x768 RESOLUTION<br />
<br />
Any larger resolutions and the windows will be too small, any smaller and the problem will come back.<br />
<br />
As always unzip the file into your Soes 1.3 directory and overwrite any old files.<br />
<br />
If the fix for the inventory needs to be posted up reply here and I'll zip it up too. :cool:</div></div><hr />

Ok, here's what I did to fix it.  I d/l'd the ui again (with the 2/4 patches) re-installed the ui, unzipped Trallos' fixes into the directory, re-copied the UI_***_***.ini file and renamed it, logged on and all is well!</div></div><hr />

It's very interesting to see all the different types out there.<br />
<br />
This UI for example, I used it for about two weeks before it drove me nuts.  I tend to be in at least 2 or 3 different chat channels at a time when on a raid.  One feature of this UI that I didnt like was that you couldn't, easily, make a new window and move it to where you wanted to.<br />
<br />
For me, thats paramount.  Otherwise, this is a great UI and it pretty nicely laid out.  Nice work!!</div></div><hr />
