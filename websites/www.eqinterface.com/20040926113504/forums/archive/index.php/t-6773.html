<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katn</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok I'm using adobe 6.0, I would like to make my own borders for the chat window..but I can't seem to figure out how...<br />
<br />
What I am trying to say for example in the default there is window_peices02.tga...every image seems to be separate even though its on one sheet...the sheild is named something else so it will come up in the code when put in the xml..I want to do something like that but can't figure out how to name that certain peice on the sheet...(thinks she explained that ok :P)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onetwo1212</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice is make the border fit within the size of the default border, that way all you have to replace is the tga.  The best way to do this is have the alpha channel visable while you edit the image.  This is done in photoshop by selecting the layers tab in the paths window then cliking the eye next to the alpha channel.  This makes an almost unbreakable mod since when the tgas are changed, EQ does not care that it puts blank stuff in the place of a picture.</div></div><hr />
