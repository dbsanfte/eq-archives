<br />
The problem is with your Inventory Window.  Using a text editor (Word, WordPerfect, NotePad, etc.) to open the file (EQUI_Inventory.xml) in your custom folder.<br />
<br />
Using the Search/Find feature, look for:<br />
<br />
	&lt;StaticAnimation item= &quot;ClassAnim&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;ClassAnim&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;338&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;22&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;64&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;128&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;Animation&gt;A_ClassAnim01&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
	&lt;/StaticAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
(sizes and location may be different)<br />
<br />
and also look for:<br />
<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;ClassAnim&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
If either of those aren't in your file, add them.  If the ClassAnimation isn't supposed to show, change the size in the first part to 1,1.</div></div><hr />

Thats the error the end tag on line 1202 is messed up...<br />

Seriously though it's not all that hard.. I learned by playing around with the XMLS... But if you ever do fool around with it make a backup before you start... <br />
<br />
There's  a lot of good information here:<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=29<br />
<br />
Also, There's plenty of good people here that can help if you have any questions...</div></div><hr />

This package we have been working on is pretty nice.. maps, loot, etc.. I think the guy that did it hasnt updated it in a while is the reason I had so much trouble.. Without you and the others I'd still be scratchin my head!<br />
