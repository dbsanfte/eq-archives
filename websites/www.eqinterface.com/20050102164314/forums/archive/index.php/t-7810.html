<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rausch</div><div class="date">03-30-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had a problem with my display in eq and had to delete EQ and then reinstall. This took all day. saved my old UI to a differnent file. After i had installed EQ i move those files back to where they belonged and entered EQ. When i went to skins in options, my UI was not there. Typed loadskin (filename) and nothing happened. Came back to this site and downloaded some new UI's and followed the instructions exactly. Still would not work in EQ and did not even list the 3 skins i had downloaded. Followed the FAQ and the readme files and i still cann't load up ANY skins except default. the skins are KatnTKUIv2 and zwfucr and Vert 2.4a. Anyone have ideas? and dont say reinstall EQ again! :mad:</div></div><hr />
