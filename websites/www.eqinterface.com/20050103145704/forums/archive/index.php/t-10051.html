<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">(The following text is only my opinion and personal pondering, additional discussion and opinions are welcome.)<br />
<br />
The Internet is proclaimed to be the the greatest innovation in communication this century. Certainly it has opened up new frontiers for business, commerce, education and personal communication or recreation.  Yet also offering up the darker side of unregulated and freely accessible media and/or content consisting of anything the imagination can conjure up. Surprisingly, the latter does not alarm me much -- I support free access to whatever someone chooses to make available. It is my job to decide what is acceptable or what is not for myself and my children, and thus my responsibility to exercise caution and sound judgement on what is off-limits.<br />
<br />
Now I'll move on to what really begins to worry me. Literary skills and the Internet or, shall I say, lack thereof. Every time I visit my favorite message boards I am astounded (even assaulted) by what seems to be a total disregard of literary skill and proper grammar. Indeed, in many cases, it seems to be better described as rampant illiteracy! Sometimes I find myself wondering about the overall 'health' of linguistic skill among the general population.<br />
<br />
I certainly do not proclaim myself to be perfect when it comes to sentence structure, grammar, and even punctuation. A certain amount of 'slack' is to be expected in informal or recreational literature. However -- maintaining a certain amount of proper literary technique is something I (personally) try to accomplish. Is it foolhearty to expect the same from others? Facing the reality of the day, expecting something that would be considered close to normal/proper english in a game like Everquest or online Forums might be better compared to wishing for a utopian society!<br />
<br />
&quot;hi. cud i get a sum hlp plz?&quot;; &quot;can u hlp me w this tks&quot;; &quot;wat can u do to mabey teech me to make a inretface for eq&quot;, these are examples of what I receive both while playing Everquest and often private messages. I understand not everyone is great typist. I myself plot along at a decent 30 to 40 words a minute or usually less, even after having been working with computers since grade school (a priviledge as not many schools had computers available to students at that time). Often enough the text is even less understandable and contains so many instances of backward grammar, spelling errors and abbreviations that it becomes unrecognizable as the English language.<br />
<br />
When I find myself stopping and wondering about the future of this colossal collection of literary cacophony we label the 'Internet', I do hope this trend of mangling the english language is just a small 'wobble' in the 'steps' of a society learning to communicate in a new and diverse means.<br />

Whacked up punctuation, failure to capitalize (especially the pronoun I) and over-use of abbreviations drive me nuts. A regular poster here at eqinterface.com named kenney would make Santa Claus himself vomit with rage if he saw kenney's posts. I'm not perfect; when typing quickly I often reverse letters such as &quot;u&quot; and &quot;s&quot; in the word just (so I type jsut). I hate it the most when I botch up the word please and type pelase.<br />
<br />
But, I live with it. I do have a pet peev however: if someone asks me to to do something and tacks on plz or pls I just outright ignore them. If you want to ask someone nicely to help you, be polite enough to type out the word please.<br />
<br />
I do not type properly but I do not hunt and peck either. I've been using computers for about 13 years now and have my own system (I use about 3 fingers on each hand, I get maybe 50 words per minute at my fastest). This is a problem I should probably work to correct as it may help me to not reverse the orders of letters when typing quickly. Guess I just need to get a typing for sucky typists program.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is in no way an attempt to excuse some people's issues with typing the english language... but It's something perhaps you haven't considered.<br />
How well do you type in Spanish? Or French, for that matter? Many people who play EQ are learning English as a second language, and probably deserve to be cut a little slack on their sentence structure and spelling. <br />
Like I said, just another point to consider.<br />
<br />
All language evolves. Because it's really a means to an end. It is a way for one to convey his thoughts and emotions, and a way to interact with others. The spoken language has evolved and changed so much just in the last one hundred years that if you went back in time to about 1900 it would take quite a bit of effort to understand and be understood in conversational english. Why shouldn't the written language follow suit? Especially considering the internet, a medium which takes the time and effort out of conversing in written language. <br />
Written language has for a long time been much more formal than spoken language. Why? Because when you wrote you could take your time... correct your mistakes... think out each statement. It was only a kind of hazy representation of how you actually talked.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I don't mean to excuse the 13-35 year old kid out there who finds it easier to type a complete mess than to actually gain a vocabulary, but there are many very intelligent people who may not sound that way in &quot;conversational&quot; written language. Because now it's real time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's all about ezness and speed.  Using thx and plz and wtf and omfg and things of that nature relay responses quickly.  Ppl on mssg boards are not there to write thought-out letters, well-puncuated and gramatically accurate.  And if you're talking about eq specifically, speed in typing is more convenient as well.  Instead of typing out &quot;Hey, let's go fight the creatures in Vegarlson, the Earthen Badlands&quot;, you could just as easily say &quot;let's go hunt mobs in poe.&quot;  Much faster and can relay the same point using less text.  No one likes to read long messages, it seems like more of a chore.  Using one or two sentences instead of a paragraph isn't always a bad thing.  And last, message boards and games are fun, not english class. =/  Not trying to flame, but just trying to defend the 1337 speech and shortcuts of the online world.<br />
<br />
And also, trying to get people to really hear out what you're saying isn't helped by the fact that you use words like &quot;cacophony&quot;  i for one have no clue what that means and I really dont' want to look it up.  I could understand your point more if it was less complicated and more like a conversation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many people who play EQ are learning English as a second language...<br />
<br />
Indeed true, and I do recognize that fact. In most situations when that is the case, it is generally something I can recognize and thus does not apply to what I meant to discuss.  I studied French as a second language, and I can say without a doubt that my written French is in all probability, absolutely horrible at this point in time. :D<br />
<br />
I was mainly addressing those who use English as a primary language. Many using English as a second language are actually more articulate and generally spell out things such as 'please' and 'thanks/thankyou'. I've noticed they actually come across as more formal, if a little broken.  Common reversals of noun/verb/pronoun are usually a dead giveaway that English is a second language for them.  ;) <br />
<br />
Abbreviation was part of my point, but pure spelling and grammar were more the heart of my objection and concern. Methods of abbreviating a language for faster communication comes and goes with the technology of the times -- but the underlying structure they are based on evolves a lot more slowly. This brings me to my next quote.<br />
<br />
All language evolves.<br />
<br />
Absolutely! This was also part of why I was discussing this. Though I do hope that most of the 'internet lingo' remains unacceptable in modern literature. I couldn't stomach something in which I constantly saw 'plz' 'r u' 'g2g' or the like, though I suppose over centuries the incorporation of it would go mostly un-noticed by the generations.<br />
<br />
There really seems to be two different factions I run across. Those that absolutely hate and refuse to use that method of abbreviation and those that use it almost constantly.  Many often use what are now generally accepted as derogatory terms for it such as 'AOL speak' or even 'leet speak'. I generally do not use those abbreviations, though I do tend use 'lol' or 'rofl' occasionally.  'Rolling on the floor laughing' takes a bit of time to type and in many cases the funny moment would pass before you could get it out.  Please and pls/z are just being lazy, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
To be perfectly honest, it does affect my perception of the person that is on the other end of the conversation. I don't necessarily take offence at it BUT someone who types 'Can you help me please?' is likely going to get my attention -- while someone who types 'can u hlp me plz' is probably not going to be acknowledged.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the intelligent conversation, as it was obviously something I felt worthy of being discussed. I was beginning to worry I would have to request the thread be locked to avert what seems to be some hostile reception of the post, and that would be quite disappointing as it was not my intention.<br />

Nevertheless, (omg a big word there, sorry!) I used to be bothered by people who did this as well... especially when they were begging for plat or an &quot;uber&quot; item I could give them.  That's what /ignore is for.<br />
<br />
My big pet peeves were people who used &quot;they're&quot;, &quot;their&quot; and &quot;there&quot; improperly.  Stuff like this just kinda sticks in my craw, however, as something like people forcing religion on others.  <br />

I'm sorry, no offense intended, but this is the way in which I carry on a conversation on an everyday basis.  I'm not going to stunt my own speech simply so other people can understand every sentence, it is your job (not mine) to decide you want to learn.  You have every right to choose to remain ignorant of the definition of words you come across and do not recognize.  Now if I was writing instructions on how not to electrocute yourself with a hairdryer I might keep it more basic, being a matter of life or death. ;)<br />
<br />
Not reading because it's a chore? You're most likely sitting on your behind - how much of a chore could it possibly be? This does, however, provide another excellent question to pose.  Is it pure lethargy responsible for the deterioration of the English language on the internet?<br />

If you're offended then you're pretty sensitive; I mean were talking about internet communication here, not racism, sexism, abortions, war or religion. This isn't something controversial to get worked up over. Tellgar wasn't out to start a fight, he was just reflecting on the current state of online grammar.<br />
<br />
I, for one, do talk like I type (except when talking I use the word &quot;like&quot; a whole lot, probably once a sentence, like, you know what I mean?). I speak very flatly and use very little slang other than, uhm, I forget the name of them... the words like they're, can't, etc. (contractions?) where you use an apostrophe. In fact, as I'm typing this now, I'm thinking of how I'd speak it. I guess that's just how I type.<br />

<br />
Yep, lethargy is the main reason I use the speech.  It's also the same reason I didn't look up cacophony.  It's the same reason I get ports to CS instead of getting the key and running there.  It's the same reason I use the microwave to heat things up instead of an open fire.  It's the same reason I use Easy-Mac instead of cooking real macaroni.  If you can save time and energy, why not do it.  Language evolves, there's no real problem in using shortcuts or being lazy.  Apply it to anything... would u rather take an hour to get to the grocery store driving in a Jag, so ppl think you're sofisticated?  Or would you like to take the shortest route regardless of what people think of your beat-up El Camino and get the same job done.  'nuff said.  (I know TERRIBLE example, but it's late)<br />
<br />
Using long-winded sentences to relay a few important ideas adds nothing, it's fluff.  And this isn't the first time english has &quot;detoriorated.&quot;  Shakesperian talk is no longer used widespread.  Even 1900's speech isn't used widespread.  As you may find slang and poor sentence structure annoying, keep in mind that other people may find speaking in perfect english and using 2-dollar words every other sentence can be annoying too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To try and continue whatever is left of the thoughtful discourse (discoarse? hehe) in this thread... :D<br />
Here's another idea to chew on.<br />
I try very hard to understand people, their ideas, their intentions... no matter the method of communication they use. The reason is simple. I'm not somehow better or more understanding then the typical EQ player, I just perhaps have a different perspective. I look at it this way...<br />
My wife and I are both fairly well educated, intelligent, and creative people. But this can be hampered somewhat by the method by which we communicate. When she speaks aloud, she uses the word &quot;like&quot; about every third word, and says &quot;ya know&quot; at the end, and sometimes the beginning, of every sentence. I don't say this to belittle her, she is one of the most intelligent people I know. When she types, the &quot;like&quot;s and &quot;ya know&quot;s disappear. She &quot;sounds&quot; more intelligent (represents herself better) when she types. <br />
I am the exact opposite. I type like I speak in that I just think of the idea I want to convey, and let my fingers go. My grammar and spelling are horrible when I type. I &quot;sound&quot; much more intelligent when I speak. The exact opposite of my wife. <br />
Whether typing or speaking, we are the same people. Yet depending on the medium and the &quot;listener&quot;.... we are sometimes &quot;smarter&quot;. :rolleyes: <br />
This is the main reason I, on most occasions, try my best to see the person behind the chosen method of communication.</div></div><hr />

You can express yourself quite easily and articulately if you use the right wording and spelling.<br />
<br />
And as for learning a new word every now and then. You merely spread the education to others when you use it before them. Then they will, in their best interest, to verify its usage and then actually learn the new word and continue the passage of education.<br />
<br />
I personally wouldn't contribute the Internet solely to the declining of the vocabulary education, as much as the slang that is spoken on the streets. Much of it is crude at best. And not to mention the usage of it, spoken or written, just plainly looks like illiteracy.<br />
<br />
The english language is a dying language, as slang and street speak corrupts the language itself. And not to mention 'gamers speak' is just a lame attempt of outcast individuals who want to set themselves further into the mainstream of trying to stay within the 'in crowd' of said 'coolness'. But, in my opinion, it makes them look less intelligent than the ones who mispell words continuously.<br />

No one is saying anyone is stupid or ignorant for not knowing what a word is, but one would be acting ignorant for not bettering themselves further with knowledge.</div></div><hr />

Are you omnipotent?  I think that the mindless majority sets the trends in the realm of the Internet.  Is following a social trend morally wrong?  Am I jumping the video-game-player bandwagon and trying to feign something I am not?<br />
<br />
See, anyone can try to sound smarter than they are by dropping silly phrases and crafting sentences.  I had to re-read this myself to follow exactly what I was talking about.  But to put it blunt, I think that all the ppl out there who use complete sentences and don't degrade themselves by using gamertalk are trying to put us down =(.  We are responsible for the downfall of english language.  I'll keep that in mind that the next time I use ppl, or sup, or ty, or plz, or omg, or wtg, or vn, or wmp, or g2g, or uber, that I'm really contriubting to the downfalll of the English language.  It realllllly doesn't matter, you obiously get what I'm talking about when I say plz, or thx, or omg.  <br />

<br />
Languages of all sorts have one purpose, one alone. To make you understood, I despise people that don't understand that and constantly try to correct minor misspellings or misuse of words. If they understand the person in question that is enough, and likewise it is everyone’s duty to try there very best to make themselves understood. Using words that maybe 1% of the worlds population understand without a dictionary is just plain stupid in my humble opinion (IMHO for you online folks).<br />
<br />
Now in my opinion it is your job, not mine to make yourself understood if you want to be understood, if you want to appear like a teacher by all means continue your use of such words.<br />
