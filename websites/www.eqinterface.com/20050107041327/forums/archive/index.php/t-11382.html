<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eMaRi DaRkLiGhT</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was looking through the new stuff and saw this:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=2802<br />
<br />
picture of the trade window which had an &quot;invite&quot; button that had been added to the window.  According to the thread at the top of this forum, buttons cannot be added.<br />
<br />
My question, of course, is: Has someone figured out how to add buttons, or are there just situations where it is possible to add buttons like this, where it is impossible to add other buttons.<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is, I want to add to my LootWindow a destroy button and an equip button (auto-equip, yea I know what the thread says...can't be done), but I was wondering if either of these things are possible now?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can place a button anywhere (as in, you will see a button on the window) but it won't work unless it's in the window which it was designed for..  You can click it and it'll show the animation, but nothing will happen, because the actual coding for it to do something is on the server side..  So until SOE provides a way for us to tell them what the button is doing, you can't use a button in a window it wasn't already programmed into..  (that's also why they have to be named a certain way in the window) ..  <br />
<br />
Unless SOE changed some coding on their side, I doubt this mod does anything other than place a useless button in the window..  (and now I'll have to go home and test it.. hehe)</div></div><hr />
