I just downloaded KatnTKBriar-Fixed from this site, I unpacked everything into my everquest\uifiles folder (can only be that UI folder since I only have it installed in one place on my harddrive) then I did as the readme said and copied the files from the 1024 folder since thats the resolution I'm using. I renamed the UI_Name_servername file and placed it into my everquest folder.<br />
<br />
Then I logged into EQ but all it did was rearrange my windows but didnt load any of the custom UI graphic. (Dont have any sub folders, everything is in \everquest\uifiles\KatnTKBriar-Fixed)<br />
<br />
Checked my UIerror file and got this:<br />
