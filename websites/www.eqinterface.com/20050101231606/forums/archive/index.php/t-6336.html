<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lauden</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a command that can be input into either the eqclient.ini or the individual character ini's to load a different skin for each character?<br />
<br />
Example. My main is a ranger, I have a melee style UI made with elven type graphics. I want this UI to load every time I login my ranger.<br />
<br />
I also have a UI built a UI for my SK that has red borders, an darklord spellbook etc. I want this to load automatically each time I login my SK.<br />
<br />
And so on and so forth. Should be very simple, just not sure how to do it.</div></div><hr />

Campout and login second chairictor load their skin and campout. login 1st again should still be the same ui you last had with the 1st char.<br />
<br />
each chair has it own UI ini file that labled what the ui for that char should be. and the ui that is loaded gets saved into the ini when you campout.</div></div><hr />

All you have to do is create a specific modded UI folder for EACH toon or desired UI setup.<br />
<br />
For example, I have a specific UI setup for each of my toons.  My monk's folder is called &quot;monk&quot;.  My mage's UI folder is called &quot;mage&quot;, and so on.<br />
<br />
In your &quot;uifiles&quot; folder in the EQ main directory you will have the default folder and your Ranger's modded UI folder.  Just make an additional modded UI folder for your SK.<br />
<br />
To do this, make a copy of your &quot;default&quot; UI folder and rename it whatever you'd like.  &quot;SK&quot; comes to mind.  Then just copy and paste whatever modded UI files you're wanting to use for your SK into the SK folder, log onto your SK, type &quot;/loadskin SK&quot; and that should do the trick.<br />
<br />
You just have to create a specifically modded UI folder in your uifiles directory for each different UI you want to use.<br />
<br />
Hope that answers your question :).</div></div><hr />

No, you do not need a seperate install for each character, you simply need a seperate folder for each character within the uifiles folder.  Don't change the eqclient.ini line, it can (and should) remain set as &quot;default&quot;.<br />

Yup, this is basically it in a nutshell.<br />

All correct, except for the part about copying your default folder into your custom folder.  Do not do this.  The only files that should be in your custom folder(s) are the files that are actually custom.  EQ will automatically go and get any files it needs out of the default folder if it doesn't find them in your custom folder.  Copying your default into your custom merely means that many more files that can &quot;break&quot; every time SOE patches something.</div></div><hr />
