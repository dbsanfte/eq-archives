<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kungpo</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently Been working on A UI it based in screen Resolution 1024 x 700 or so =)  heh.<br />
<br />
There are a few things in this Ui that are my Own creations ..But Alot of it is Borrowed and modified creations of others =)<br />
<br />
like example: Window_pieces_01.tga was borrowed from 1 UI ..and Window_pieces_02.tga was from another etc hehe<br />
<br />
The reason Calling it The Ultra UI ....here is the kicker ...I added some of Tk's and drak/tk's artwork and modifications As an optional Addin to the Base UI. <br />
<br />
What prey tell are in the option you ask =).... Well here its a list heh:<br />
<br />
atm ALL of Tk's Class Anime's<br />
-Tk/Drak 's Chat Window<br />
- Tk's Re-make of the Gem icons /spell icons<br />
-a Tk Inventory <br />
<br />
these options will Be of a seperate *.zip ...with this even compacted Smallest i could get it down was like 4.57MBs hehe<br />
 It will also include a The Xml's aswell so you can just copy and past them into the Main Ui =)<br />
  I didnt Bother making an *.Bat file for the reason i would had to make 4 seperate ones.<br />
<br />
I do have the Original Semi-working but still Trying to Fix the Spellbook window as you'll be able to tell from this screen shot i have =)<br />
What ya dont see in the screenshot ..is a compacted Bazaar search window i created as well as a barrowed compact modification of the Bigbank window =)<br />
 <br />
 Well without Further wait here is screenshot of my UI =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kungpo</div><div class="date">03-14-2003, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Altho i am still am in midst of still doing some tweeking to a few files and making sure everything is working ...i was able to load the Tk options i talked about in my last post =)<br />
<br />
 In this screenshot ...There is a pic of Tk's inventory ..unfortunatly was an older artwork before Charm inventory slot was introduced.. With a little editing i was able to add a charm slot to<br />
 Tking's inventory that i have in this Ui ..also updated the Xml to include the new buttons ..Armor dye and face picker.<br />
