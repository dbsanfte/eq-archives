Many people all with the same question asking it on multiple threads, and those trying to help are having to repeat them selves many times.<br />
<br />
Also, it seems everyone wants there UI's fixed now, and not many are willing to wait for the original author to update there own creations.<br />
<br />
Like Kanon, some modders are not even residents of the United States, and may not even have access to new expansions and new content from patches the same time US residents do.<br />
<br />
We need to give the site and modders time to catch up before the onslaught.  I've spent so much time working on other peoples UI's that I have forgotten to check my own mods, that I am not currently using, for breaks.<br />
<br />
I suggest making the forums READ-ONLY on the day of patch, and possibly the day after.  Except for the Released and Patch fixes forums.  At least for days like the Discord release with such extensive changes.<br />
<br />
This would help keep question on topic with th UI being used.<br />
<br />
The primary adverse affect I see is that people that have made changed to their UI's themselves and need help will have to wait longer, but as one of those people I like to see if one of the &quot;expert&quot; modders has resolved my issue in a way that I did not see before asking for help anyway.</div></div><hr />
