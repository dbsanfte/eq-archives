<br />
I Love this UI and i have admittedly changed a couple things for myself and my playing style but i can't seem to find a use for the numirical timer that is in the lower right hand corner of the UI.<br />
<br />
I have some bar timers that i got that i  find are simpler for me(heheh  and i am simple :)   )  that i have imported and am useing to time my Mezz and Speed spells, so it is really just kind of there counting down to nothing.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I developed the bar-style slider timers, I stopped using any sort of digital timer in the UI as well. I agree with you that bar timers are much easier to use. It looks like the digital timer included in the Slayer UI is actually one of my older timers, since I can see my comments in the XML file. To remove it, you can do the following:<br />
<br />
Open EQUI_GroupWindow.xml in a text editor, and scroll to the bottom. You should see a section as follows:    &lt;!-- BEGIN timer pieces --&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;TimerHour&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;TimerColonA&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;TimerMinuteA&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;TimerMinuteB&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;TimerColonB&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;TimerSecondA&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;Pieces&gt;TimerSecondB&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
    &lt;!-- END timer pieces --&gt;Go ahead and delete the above lines from the file. This will cause the digital timer to not be displayed at all (there will just be a blank area where it used to be).<br />
<br />
Edit: Wanted to add that you could clean up the file even more by removing all timer-related XML from the file. However, doing so would be purely optional; removing just the lines listed above is enough to remove the digital timer from your UI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Open the targa (something_timer.tga) file for the digital timer and make the alpha channel all black<br />
<br />
or:<br />
<br />
Open the targa (something_timer.tga) file for the digital timer and replace the numbers with weird random symbols, then, intead of a clock in the corner, you'll have a WEIRD ALIEN ANIMATION-majig. <br />

<br />
Thanks very much to everyone who works so hard on this site and to everyone that makes the wounderful UI's that we all enjoy so much :)  It is great that you all are able to put up step by step instructions so that computer illiterate people like myself can even use the tags :)<br />
