Since I took it on myself to post his inventory for download, kept it updated with the charm slot, I am in the process of fixing it for LOY..<br />

<br />
I had quit playing EQ for quite a while. Sony kindly gave me 7 free days to play so I figured I would check back here. Low and behold this inventory has the highest number of downloads!!! Haha... crazy. :)<br />
<br />
Never the less... it's way cool that you modded this. I'm so out of date with everything now it's a race just to figure out all the new changes since I last played.<br />
<br />
I'm considering playing a little EQ for a while after the 7 days... So if anyone has any inspiring thoughts as to why, that would be way groovy. Man... it's just so cool to know you guys like my work.<br />
