What I'd like to do is actually use container slots instead of inventory slots for my swap sources. Anyone done anything like that, I can't seem to find much info about it.</div></div><hr />

There's only one XML for containers that describes all bags and there's only one EQType for each slot in the container. There's some hard wiring behind the scenes that knows what bag is what and what items are in which bags. There's no way to directly reference Slot 4 of Bag 3 in the XML.<br />

Sorry.<br />

I really don't know if it will be possible because the code for the ui is static but your containers are dynamic.  Ok, so lets sat you have a 10 slot bag in your 1st inventory slot and code the 10th slot of the bag into your window.  Now, what happens if you change that 10 slot bag to a 6 slot one??  I hope this helps.<br />
