 Vert left the UI in my hands when he left, and I have never failed to come up with an update the same day a patch has broke soemthing. Kudane has joined me in this effort, and theres always room for more, but we need to have it be an organized effort so as not to confuse people.<br />
<br />
 On a side note, the vert compass was always 45deg off, thats why we changed it temporarily to the old style compass, untill we had the time to fix it. Also Kudane and I are working to update many of verts features, and have just abotu finished a new UI Called Solaria, we've rescently started discussing just including some of our changes to vert and renaming it. <br />
<br />
 Kudane and I have put alot of effort into Making Vert what it is, and were not trying to stop people from making changes, we just want uniformity, and people to understand were updating it, and if something isn't relaeased right away like the charm slot the reason is that theres more coming in, and the slot doesn't work as of yet. I just have never liked releasing an update 4 times in the same month.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Sokol  <br />
<br />
Ditto<br />
<br />
(hehehe)<br />
<br />
Soooo while we are on the topic, <br />
<br />
Some of the bigger changes we were going to wait an introduce in Solaria we have decided to add to Vert for &quot;vert 3.0&quot;.. some really nice things.. and we have decided that as Vert evolves inot what Sokol and I have added to it, we want to make it our own and change the name..<br />
<br />
So far, <br />
<br />
SOL<br />
Solar<br />
Solaria<br />
<br />
are the names discussed.. Vert was named after the original author, and since he has left EQ all together, and the only thing really left of his orginal work is some of the base graphics, which are slowly changing, we want a new name to go with the new image <br />
<br />
<br />
But we would like your input... take a look at the attached image, (its Solaria in the color Saturn) its the latest beta image of the full MOD we are going to release after LOY is out and we can release it without patches.. what name (listed above) you think fits it.<br />
<br />
We are going to add a few of the items you see to &quot;Vert 3.0&quot; so far we are including the new hp/mana/stamina bar, (no ticks) and the new spell bar, we are also discussing the group bar.. <br />
<br />
give us  some feed back on what you think. but dont be offended if we dont do everything, that everyone suggest.<br />
<br />
UPDATE: change screenshot to stop some confusion over what is seen in the image.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the player bar is designed to be at the top of the screen with your basic info going across the top, this is a beta screenshot, sooo not quit in the right place.<br />
<br />
and the spell gems borders are much brigher in game... they are the color of the spell.. an actually bigger than the 2x2 square that is in the current version (lol)<br />
<br />
but remember.. this is still a beta shot, its not even playable yet. the inventroy was not done, thats the default inventory...</div></div><hr />

<br />
remember, that alot of the screen shot is not done yet.. only look at:<br />
<br />
spell bar<br />
group bar (which currently includes all 6 members) <br />
the physical &quot;bar&quot; of the hp bar<br />
<br />
that is what we are looking at adding to the next evolution, the rest of it is still in development.. the horizontal player window and such is still being experimented with..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this person.  The thing that I loved so much about Vert 1 (which I still use because it is the best) was that it was so minimalist.  It was set up so you could arrange the windows anywhere in any way and they wouldn't get in the way with all the necessary and useful information right up front so you never had to look at anything else.  I think successive versions of Vert have gotten away from that minimalist approach (particularly Vert 2.2, which I hate with a passion, just my opinion.)   Vert 3.0 seems to be getting back to that approach, which is good.  The one thing I see missing from the screenshot, is the inventory boxes attached to the hotbuttons.  That's one of the handiest features of Vert and should not be left out.  <br />
<br />
As for the name, one fits as well as another, though perhaps retaining the Vert name would be an appropriate step in preserving the legacy of this skin and a way to give props to the guy who created one of the most popular skins in EQ.<br />
<br />
That's just my opinion, I could be wrong...</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I would flip the spellcast window so that the icons were on the left.<br />
The group window Looks nice. Although I don't really see the need for Pet %.<br />
And I like the hotbuttons Without the Inventory to the side I feel it just takes up to much space there<br />
<br />
<br />
just my opinions. Cant wait to see what you guys do next.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
not saying your right or wrong, but only about 15% of what is left currently is what vert actually created... a lot of it has been re-coded for lag, and other issues by Sokol, and tons of the graphics have been update by me..<br />
<br />
but as the amound that vert did actually gets less and less, Sokol and I would like it to be something that represents us..<br />
<br />
Sokol got an email last week asking why the vert site has not been updated (last i checked it still said sept 9th) which was nearly 6 months ago, and vertabrae left the EQ game 6-8 weeks before that.</div></div><hr />

hehehehe, <br />
<br />
well not exactly the feedback we were talking about... we ment a more constructive type..<br />
<br />
but I guess it takes all types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nevergone</div><div class="date">02-17-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, this is a great UI in the making! To improve upon the original work as you are is a truly rough task, especially when there's so much to be expected from people that don't neccesarily like to give input, but still enjoy the customized skins.<br />
<br />
I *love* the look you've given the spell gems. They are sleek and I've always been a fan of having the names displayed permanently, otherwise I have a hard time distinguishing one healing spell from another. I could live without the spell book button though. It seems to get in the way more then anything.<br />
<br />
I have a few suggestions on the placement of certain elements.<br />
<br />
1. In my very humble opinion, the casting time guage should always be somewhere close to the target window. This way I can see clearly and easily how long my spell has left until it will effect said target.<br />
<br />
2. I know that the bar displaying player hp, player mana, etc, is meant to go at the top of the screen, but it would also be nice to have it rest on top of the group window, so that player mana is always close to the rest of the group's health. This makes it easier to see how much mana is left and how direly it needs to be conserved at that point in time. By the looks of it, I would say that the spell window is the tallest window in this mod. If you could make all the non-stretchable windows fit to that size so that it was a neat and uniform line underneath the &quot;player bar&quot;, that would make it all fit together better, once again, just my opinion.<br />
<br />
To me, this is a great new mod, a few minor changes however can be made so I don't have to look all over the screen for information, my eyes get tired quickly. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Great job Kudane + Sokol!!</div></div><hr />

I hope that the cake program can still be used with this version cause the extra slots are really helpful.<br />
I like the spell bar, but the one stat bar across the top might take some getting used to. Over all the I like the way things are going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cymrich</div><div class="date">02-17-2003, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like what Nevergone said about the casting time gauge... <br />
<br />
I currently use a vert derivative (bawkin) with the T.King target bar that incorporates the casting time bar right into the target bar... would be nice to see something like that on the target bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">02-18-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">our current group window includes all 6 members, (you and your 5 members) the casting gauge is actually the border around the word &quot;spell book&quot; (will get screenshot of it in progress).<br />
<br />
but the target window could easily have the normal gauge mixed in with it as an alternate mod..<br />
<br />
thanks for all the kind words..<br />
<br />
the version of solaria you see in my first post will most likely be the 2nd release of Solaria. we are discussing the best way to mix what we are creating with what we know is popular about the current vert.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Masin</div><div class="date">02-18-2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with RedBishop's comments with regard to the 'minimalist' approach.  Though I might not use minimal as the word, as the Vert mod has a lot of things in it.  Perhaps low profile is more how I would describe it.  Either way, I like the Vert mod because it fits a lot of utility into a small space.  Since I play at 1024x768, the Vert mode is nice because it still allows me to 'squeeze' a lot of UI utility onto the screen but still have room to see the land.  Vert looks nice and doesn't crowd out the view.   <br />
<br />
It is probably why I have not moved on to 'prettier' mods like Drakah or t.king (though I do use the t.king spell icons).   Please keep your new UI in a compact form, or at least provide some more compact mods that can be switched out for components.  Please keep the inventory items and hotbutton window together, and if the CCake applet still works for it I will be very happy.<br />
<br />
Solaria looks nice, but I agree with the others that perhaps wish it to remain compact.  The player info horizontal window looks interesting, but I'm not sure if I would want it placed at the top or not.....<br />
<br />
All in all, please keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weawen</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the new look, one thing I would like to add.  The group window is very nice looking but I personally like the changing ball on the T.King group windows that change color depending on player health.  I think that would make a great adition to this window.  Instead of making circles they could be squares and that would be nifty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wal^</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like everyone that has posted already i love the vert UI. I hadn't realised that you guys had taken it over and kept it alive so kudos to you.<br />
<br />
The reason i like the vertUI is that it is neat and compact and even tho I play in 1280x1024 and could use Ui's that take up more room i want to be able to see my Ui but also the eye candy of my surroundings. Using vert i can have all the windows + 3 chat windows all situtated at the bottom of my screen which is where i want to keep it so a horizontal bar across the top of my screen would have to be unobtrusive for me.<br />
<br />
Most the information in the current vert is nicely boxed and of the same width and so stack up neatly. I stack the group/target/player(pet) stats/player info boxes together so i can see at a glance my health, my groups health, my mana, and mob health which i find invaluable. The group bar you have with all 6 members is a good touch but how about having an integrated player/group window.  Make it the same height as the hot buttons window (please add the inv/player clickable bit back on) so it lines up nice and tidy, at the top you have the target bar and then underneath you have the players details..name, HP, pet HP and mana and then underneath again  slightly seperate of the group. <br />
<br />
I have attactched a very poor cobbled together image of kinda what i mean using the existing vert mod. <br />
<br />
I can kinda see where you are going and i can appreciate you both wanting to release something that you can call solely yours.<br />
<br />
Another note is can we lose the title bars for the windows (pet, actions etc) i really like the stripped down versions in vert2.4.<br />
<br />
I have quoted vert alot in this post and i am not saying that it shoul be like vert, i am just pointing out some of the reason i chose vert :D<br />
<br />
GL and i eagerly anticipate the release of this UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the horizontal Player window (would take some getting used to though) but along with that, a horizontal group window would tend to tie the whole thing together IMHO.<br />
<br />
As far as the name, I agree that it should be something other than Vert as his support stopped a long time ago and apparently very little of his coding remains.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

1) clean lines, his UI is complex in that you get all your info into a small footprint, and yet he kept it clean, i like this.<br />
2) nice contrast on the buttons/screen, his(and your updates) have nice color contrast on the buttons and screens<br />
3) his cake hotkeys. i am forever changing what right clicks/inventory i got where esp now with so many PoP items having effects and clicks, this is huge imo<br />
4) a footprint that is uniformed in hieght, i like mine all at the bottum of the screen but where ever you put the info make sure it can be stacked/placed to give a uniformed footpring (all one hieght) i just like that.<br />

will give more info in a bit<br />

actually that was used to stand for &quot;SOLARIA&quot; it also happen to be a dollar sign, but it was there as a stylized symbol for the mod..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jabu</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like the look of this UI.  A couple of questions:<br />
<br />
1: The UI I use right now had turned the player window into the target window.  When attack is on the target window has the red box around it.  I have to say this is very incredible.  Now when you check the mobs health you can tell if auto attack is on.<br />
<br />
2: Again, the UI that I use has the EXP and AA EXP in % only without that bar.  This did take a bit of getting used to, but it allowed them to put all of my stats there.  I do like being able to see my stats on the screen without having to open my inventory.<br />
<br />
3: Could you please put weight somewhere on the screen?<br />
<br />
4: May be a smaller Inventory screen?  Like in the current version of Vert2.4.<br />
<br />
5: I know for Melee's a spot to swap out our weapons.  I do like the Vert Hotbutton setup for this.<br />

I be willing to bet Sokol will too.. (thought maybe he should change his name to Solok, :D :D )<br />
<br />
and in discussion last night we decided to leave vert 1.xxx at Vert.. we are not really supporting it anymore, and at least one person has released a TGA only version of it, which makes it 99% patch proof..<br />
<br />
soooo in the future Vert will refer to Vert 1.xx since he completed it, and we (sokol and I) have not really done much for it, and actually after POP stopped making updates for it.</div></div><hr />

Though recently i've added and removed and changed and smushed so much stuff together I hesitate to call it vert too much anymore, but the majority of my UI is still based on vert 2.4.<br />
<br />
First off, solaria is an awesome name. :D :D<br />
<br />
I love the minimalist look. The horizontal bar with hp/mana/xp/aaxp is nice but making it such would definitely mean it has to go along the top or bottom-most area of the screen..kinda takes it out of &quot;easy viewing&quot; range, i guess.<br />
<br />
I suppose it could fit just as easily at the bottom but any way it could perhaps be made a little bit narrower?<br />
<br />
Same with the party window, it's a really nice idea but sectioning off things so much (hp = 1 box, name = 1 box, pet = 1 box) makes the overall party window a lot bigger than it needs to be. Again i think that detracts it from the minimalist goal, if that's what you guys are still aiming for.<br />
<br />
The spellbar is awesome though, if you look at the screenshots i attached, you'll see i'm all for having spellnames showing all the time. Especially when it's 4am and I forget what spell is memmed in which slot.. ;)<br />
<br />
(And of course I had to have my &quot;frufru&quot; graphics (ahem, quote, unquote) for my spellbook and inv to complement the simplicity of the rest of my UI :p)<br />
<br />
Not sure how you would feel about this suggestion but is there any way that maybe borders could be removed or narrowed some for the chat windows? Got a friend to edit mine out because I usually have 2-3 windows stacked vertically for different heal channels etc, and the combined space taken up by 3 borders really does add up a significant amount.<br />
<br />
Love the way it's coming along otherwise though. Definitely would be nice to have a UI that gets edited/fixed with patches in its entirety so I dont have to go wading through hundreds of lines of xml i totally do NOT understand, trying to fix something and breaking it even more as a result. :rolleyes: <br />

I like what Nevergone said about the casting time gauge... <br />
<br />
I currently use a vert derivative (bawkin) with the T.King target bar that incorporates the casting time bar right into the target bar... would be nice to see something like that on the target bar.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Adding new casting gauges is easy, and indeed you can have more then one. Were planing on having MANY custom windows for this, so one can pic and choose between the mdos they want.<br />

Actualy Vert has been gone for about 8 months, and never did patch updates. Thats what I was for. I will still be updating all Vert versions, were just in the process of trying to come up with something &quot;Next phase&quot; as it where. Very similar to what we have always done with vert Mods, Solaria will have many many Mods/updates available to fit every one's tastes.<br />

Currently when we switch here are the color schemes.. (these are estimations, and could change)<br />
<br />
Cannabis will become Venus<br />
Ocean Spray will become Saturn<br />
Nexium will become Jupiter<br />
Neptune will become Neptune<br />
Pepto will become Pluto<br />
<br />
(yes there is a planet theme there) and as you can see, we have some room to expand.. the mockup was done in the nexium/jupiter color... it wont be the only color.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crystal Meth has been done away with (as stated in first post)<br />
<br />
Ocean Spray is almost the exact same color as Crystal Meth, and with Neptune being a 2nd shade of blue we looked at download counts..<br />
<br />
Ocean Spray had four times the amount of downloads of Crystal Meth, and Neptune had just over Twice as many..Try Ocean Spray, I think you will see that its only a tiny bit different shade of blue.</div></div><hr />

To begin with, I like your UI very much. Thought I'd suggest a thing or two to help make it as good as possible. <br />
<br />
I almost only play casters and I remember way back when all you got to see of a fight were a few short glimpses in between medding. (Had plenty of time to memorize the layout of my spellbook though). <br />
The point is that apart from being extremely boring, it worked because you had a clear view of your party's health and your own health and mana.<br />
 <br />
My suggestions are therefore (For casters):<br />
<br />
1) A target window with target's health, your health and mana, and a clearly visible casting bar. (Great even for soloing).<br />
<br />
2) Group window that fits nicely with this and is easy to 'decipher'.<br />
<br />
The less you have to scan the screen and the easier it is to detect IMPORTANT changes to your group's state in the middle of an intense fight, the more effective you will be. Your chanters and other paper wearing classes will thank you for this :)<br />
<br />
As for the look of the UI in general: NICE!</div></div><hr />

As always, you guys never fail to impress me. The only &quot;suggestions&quot; that I'd make is that you both continue to do as you have been so far: make &quot;alternate&quot; mods that can easily be dropped into a skin. That's one of the things that made me such a huge fan of Sokol's and Kudane's; everyone could pick from a nice variety of things and each of my characters could share the same basic UI, with only a few minor changes to suit my preferences for that character. It's looking pretty darned awesome however! <br />
<br />
As for a name, hmm, what is in a name? Though I strongly feel that you guys should receive the credit that you deserve for all the work you've done to date.</div></div><hr />

What I like in a mod is maximum information in a minimal amount of space.  The other important thing (and I think some have touched on this) is the mod should be MODular in nature.  Each of the different mods (windows) should be sized so that they can be arranged in a myriad of configurations and allow for a nealty organized window to the world.  Latter version of Vert got closer to hitting this target but as an example, the hot button clicky combo window was always sized in such a way that I never could find a &quot;neat&quot; spot to fit it in with the other windows.  All in all, you guys are on the right track and I sincerely appreciate you guys keeping thiese mods working though all these patches amd for working on continuing to improve upon them.<br />
<br />
I love the new group window especially having the 6th person shown.  I love the long revamped player window along the top.  As a minor point, I've never really liked the spellbook button from the gems window.  Personally, I use the keyboard for this but at least perhaps find a new graphic for this.  Cast timer on the gems window - important.  Streamline the inventory window as much as possible.  Personally, I could care less if there is much player info on this screen as I usually have it elsewhere for referrence (i.e player info/pet info combo window).  When I go to the inventory screen it is usually to do an equipment related task.<br />
<br />
All in all I can't wait to see what you all end up with and I'm sure I will use it.  Keep up the great work!!!</div></div><hr />

Well thats the point, VERT is a minimalist UI packed full of information, with not alot of EYE CANDY to interfere with serious game play. by targeting to have MOST if not ALL the information in a tight confined area you get this desired affect. thats the point of this type of UI. (Although admitedly Solaria does get abit off course)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lomack</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off I think you guys do a great job with UIs.  However, I have to agree with some of the statements i've seen in the above threads.<br />
<br />
When I first saw Vert 1.0 and 1.1 (which I still use) I found exactly what I wanted.  A UI that was low profile, with no fuss and no muss.  It was very clean, boarders cut off when they really weren't neeed.  You've kept some of that with the boarders being fairly minimal.<br />
<br />
The less rounded more angular nature of Vert also attracted me and you have kept that too.  Because it made the UI feel more clean in presentation.<br />
<br />
However, one of the main things that drew me to Vert 1.1 was the hot button window.  All 10 hot buttons with 12 customizable invintory slots.  Default was 4 bags, 4 invintory + primary, secondary, range and ammo.  Vert 2.X skimped down on this feature (moved to only 8 slots instead of 12) and I have never understood why.  In your v3.x those quick access slots are completely gone.  Not to mention the resists which lined the bottom have apparently been removed as well.<br />
<br />
Verts invintory window was very minimalistic.  The auto equip was over the stat section, there was no picture, etc...  You've gone back to a more default setting here and frankly I won't give up my screen space.  I don't need a picture of a dagger (im a rogue, among others) to make me feel better.<br />
<br />
I have a druid and a cleric as well, and for the life of me I don't think I have ever really had a problem remembering what spells are in which slots.  If I do forget, I hold my cursor over the icon for a second and up pops a message telling me.  Some people may want this feature, I understand that, but its the wrong way from the Vert slim down UI that was originally presented.<br />
<br />
I saw you mention that the player window was designed to go at the top of the screen.  What if I don't want my player window at the top of the screen?  Customizability and ease of placing windows where you want them is another key factor in a good UI.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to be all negative.  The graphics are clean and neat, it looks like a nice UI.  However, I sincerely doubt I would ever even download it.  To me its not Vert.  Its not what I found in Vert 1.1, its just like all the other UIs out there, extravagant.  <br />
<br />
No offence, but I'm glad the name is changing, because thats not Vert.  I was sorry to read that you don't plan to keep up with vert 1.xx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Novbre</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with what a lot of others have said....the new version is taking a big step away from the minimalist features that drew alot of players to vert to begin with.<br />
<br />
I'm currently usuing a mix of vert 1 and 2 stuff. and for the most part I'm happy with it...little details like % everywhere I don't like but I can live with for the smaller foot print.<br />
<br />
The player window for the newest vertion is both crowded and busy.   Two completely seperate bars for a player and a players pet is over kill, and  makes them group window bigger then it needs to be. <br />
<br />
The inventory is considerably bigger then previous versions, and as mention, looks like a tech'ed out version of the default.  I don't like it...to me it seems to be going in the opposite direction.  Things should be getting smaller, not bigger.  The only non vert piece I'm currently useing is winterwinds slim inventory, which is the best laid out inventory I've seen yet, and thankfully get's vertified (=P) so it still looks like the rest of my ui.<br />
<br />
Too many colours.....part of what I liked in earlier vert versions was a little bit of subdued colour as accents that gave the ui some style but didn't compete with the  new coloured armor I've seen running around lately.  (/em's eyes bleed)  <br />
<br />
The spell bar also is much bigger then it needs to be.  I've played a caster for more then 2 years now...putting my thumb on the ALT key on the rare days I can't tell when spells I have memmed works for me.  I don't need spell name flags that take splash more distracting colour on my screen and take up up 2X as much room as the spell icons them selves.  I have much the same problem with all the vert buff bars I've seen too...I really don't want the flags, just a counter bar and the icon is enough for me...but like I said, hitting the alt key isn't a big hardship for me.<br />
<br />
Adding space for functionality can be a good thing, but most of what I've seen in the changes isn't so much adding fuctionality as it adding bells and whistles.  It looks nice, don't get me wrong, it's just flashy and too big for what I'd look for in a ui that I'd use in game.<br />

<br />
<br />
Ok for starters... VERTABRAE stopped supporting Vert 1.xx when he made 2.xxx <br />
<br />
the player window in the DEFAULT Solaria will go at the top, but we OF COURSE are planning add-on/swap outs just like vert has now..<br />
<br />
and the inventory window only gain about 21 pix in size.. we had to put new buttons on it, and a hell of a lot more people wanted a done button than wanted an auto equip area, just happens we could put a small one in by being frugal on the space.<br />
<br />
we have no plans for class animations to be added into the inventory.. not sure WHERE you pulled that from<br />
<br />
and YES we are changing the name because its NOT Vertabrae's creation anymore.. I tell ya what, Download Vert 2.2, and/or Vert 1.1 and see if it will even load. and when it doesnt Email Vertabrae and let him know.. see if he emails you back.. <br />
<br />
Sorry if I sound short, but we do take feed back, but I really don't appreciate being told that everything we are doing &quot;offends you&quot; because its a change from what you have been seeing.. <br />
<br />
Why not wait till we release the WHOLE program not just tease you with one screenshot.. <br />
<br />
and if you read the post it said look at player window, spell window and group window.. the inventory in that screen shot was the default inventory because we have it in its own folder, and none of the other vert files were there at the time...<br />
<br />
more people have looked at that screenshot and decided that was the COMPLETE MOD, and I can not stress enough (or often enough it seems) that its not done yet... wait till we release a shot of the whole thing.<br />
<br />
&lt; Sigh &gt;<br />
<br />
anyway... feel free to give feed back.. but maybe not just repeat what others have said. <br />
<br />
and as a tip:<br />
if you have to put &quot;not to be negative&quot; and &quot;no offense&quot; in the same post... there is a good chance that your post is mostly offensive and negative.. (as an observation)<br />

You guys are doing a kick ass job!!!  Please keep up the fantastic work.<br />
<br />
Thank you for keeping the Vert 2.xx up to date.<br />

I know from what I have seen Sokol do, he will put out a ton of mods so people will get what they want.<br />

Since you guys are creating a whole new UI.....Name it anything you want.<br />

<br />
Honestly I didn't mean to offend either of you.  But, your calling your new UI &quot;The Next Stage for Vert&quot; and thats why I and others are going to compair it to Vert 1.xx, 2.xx, etc. What you have created is nice.  There is no doubt about that, but it is not Vert.  I know Vertebra has stoped supporting it.  But why not just tell it like it is, and say that your no longer going to be supporting any version of Vert, as well.<br />
<br />
I appologize about the class animations.  The screen shot dosen't show them, as I though it might have, maybe I was just up too late.The area I was confused about was the default's auto-equip area.  However, as you pointed out, that part was not updated yet and was still in default mode.<br />
<br />
Your UI dosen't offend me.  I realize thats not a complete mod.  However, based on the screen shot, and extrapolating what the rest of the screen would look like, I just don't see any reason to claim that this is some version of Vert, as the topic of the post claims.<br />
<br />
tip:<br />
I used those terms &quot;not to be negative &quot; and &quot;no offence&quot; so that you would know I was trying to give you constructive critisizm.  Since you called this &quot;The next stage of Vert&quot; its only reasonable to assume that you planned to keep the low profile, easily interchangable, with a high degree of functionality, feel of vert.  You didn't keep that feel, IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Let me clarify why we stay the next stage for Vert..<br />
<br />
Because we are going to add about 3 pieces (maybe 4) to the current Vert Setup, and release it as Solaria 1.0 we plan to continue to have all the add-ons that you could keep the basic vert look... but solaria 1.0 would be the hybrid between the two..<br />
<br />
Then down the road, we will introduce a WHOLE NEW UI, with a few of the elements from Solaria 1.0 and it will be Solaria 2.0 and have its own set of add-ons (no determination yet if this will be compatible with vert 2.xx and Sol 1.xx items, as its not even built)<br />
<br />
Sooo instead of adding 3 new pieces and calling it Vert 3.0 we are changing the name..<br />
<br />
All make sense now?</div></div><hr />

I'm a big fan of vert's uis and are the only ones i use.  Even though i tried other i've always gone back to VERT.  Here's what i do like about the new one posted above, or actually what i like about old vert.<br />
<br />
I use 1280 by 1028 resolution.  I like to have most of my stuff on the bottom of the screen and nothing topps the height of the hotbuttons, which i love the ones with 10 hotbotooms on one side, and inventory slots on the right side.  my buffs go along the left side of screen up high.  with chat, group, player info all along the bottom.  This gives me a Sweet UI with minimal obstruction of the view.<br />
<br />
The new playerinfo bar i dont like becaue it's too large, it will take up valuble spacce for me. <br />
<br />
Dont like the new group bar compared to the old one, not sure what i dont liek about it, just ain't feelin it<br />
<br />
spell slot are way too big,   the old ones (also with spell names next to em) fit nicely along side the chat windows and aligned perfect with the setup</div></div><hr />

.  There is no doubt about that, but it is not Vert.  I know Vertebra has stoped supporting it.  But why not just tell it like it is, and say that your no longer going to be supporting any version of Vert, as well..  <br />
<br />
<br />
I will always continue to update Vert, I've done it sicne vert 1.x every patch was my work, the vast majority of addons were my works. I will continue to support Vert Ui, as it's got so mutch of my time and blood built into it.<br />

I don't begrudge you all the opportunity to build any kind of UI you all want to make.  More power to ya. :)  This beta one just didn't have the same vert feel, to which I felt it was being related to.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your continued work.</div></div><hr />

It is easily usable by melees, casters, and hybrids, as I use it on all my toons. I really like the look of this new UI and will be trying it as soon as released. I have just 1 concern as i have seen posted before, the inventory slots with the hotbuttons, but other than that can't wait to see it. Thanks again from a diehard Vert fan 8)</div></div><hr />

When we release Solaria 1.0 (aka vert 3.0) the intention is to keep it in &quot;the family&quot; ie.. we want to continue to support it so we are making it &quot;our own&quot; as I said, we will easily have the add ons to make it look JUST like it does now.. we are just phasing out the name &quot;vert&quot; <br />
<br />
as far  as Vert 1.xxx goes, several people have released TGA only version of this, and at least 2 people still do all the updating for it.. THIS will never change names.. and in time will just become VERT as both Sokol and I believe that he had &quot;finished&quot; this one and as such should be left as is, to be a small tribute to him.. MUCH of Vert 2.xxx was coded or RE-coded by Sokol and ALL the graphical updates done for any of the last dozen patches were done by me.. sooo we have alot of blood, sweat, and tears in it.. and want it to continue..<br />

<br />
Looking at the sneak peek image, I thought it was interesting that you're moving the player window to a bar view. I had toyed with this idea myself but grew tired of it before it was completed.  :(   Anyway, what I was thinking, if you do go into a bar view, it would be nice to maybe build the compass into the bar and have the bar sit at the very top of the screen.  Basically, the player window turns into more of a *stat* window.  Essential information is being maintained in the group window.  I've included an image of what I mean for the stat/player/compass combo bar.  Just ignore that it has stats represented as numbers instead of bars like yours. :)   Oh, it would be nice if it came in different lengths to support various resolutions.<br />
<br />
P.S.  For the love of Marr, I hope you update the spellbook icon. That think it's hideous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LISIMBA_SHAKIR</div><div class="date">03-04-2003, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i LOVE the UI, you and Sokol have put forth emmensely :) <br />
I know you guys are looking for ideas buts its hard to improve on perfection :P<br />
<br />
But I want to help you guys out so heres a couple ideas off the dome,<br />
<br />
1. I dont know if this would be able to happen :( It would be nice if you could make it so the player life bars would change from green (100%) Yellow (60%) Red (30%)  Would help out alot I think cuz we already have alot of data cooming at us. especially at different resolutions where the numbers are tiny hehe <br />
<br />
2. Dont know if i like the bar at the top of the screen with important data spread out liike that . It takes away from middle of screen and I think you lose precious time scanning width of screen. <br />
<br />
3. Im wondering if you guys can improve the window frames texture, like give it a metallic look instead of flat gray. Also maybe try tinting all the frames a diferrent color instead of jus changing highlights, but nothing neon hehe maybe like a platinum look or maybe dark geen, Carbon fiber maybe hehe. Also I LOVED the crystal meth color :P<br />
<br />
4. Keepp frilly stuff outta Vert , thats for T.King and Aya to do hehe<br />
<br />
5. KEEP the onscreen mini-inventories LOVE THEM. <br />
<br />
6. Have a few options on spell gems. I like BIG gems (anxiously waiting T.King next generation of Icons) w/o names (I know what  spells I have up hehe) But my wife like the names on her gems for her bards songs (can you make sure that the bard songs can fit their stupid loong song names on it hehehe)<br />
<br />
Well those are a few of my ideas but thats just icing.<br />
 <br />
The cake it self is GREAT w/o it hehe<br />
<br />
GOOD JOB FELLAS!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">03-04-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We actual do have a compass to fit inline about where you put that compass in the mock-up. just with all the changes to the TGA that has the compass we had not patched it for the screenshot you saw.<br />
<br />
we are looking at a few things, of course we will have a text and no-text version of the spell bar, we have people that like both, and we didnt have any frilly stuff planned.<br />
<br />
thanks for the feedback everyone .. going to lock this topic for now.. will post a new one with the official screen shot of Solaria 1.0 in a few days.. just need to get with Sokol on some minor details.<br />
