I'm sure they had a good reason for this, or something, but anyway, it can't be tabbed, and since this mod wouldn't really be functional without the ability to tab (mark) the spots, friends window is a no-go. I suppose the author, in her boundless grace, could make it possible to mod the friends window, but it would seem kind of pointless to me. <br />
<br />
In the earlier &quot;analog clock&quot; version of the mod, you could select to have it in the friends window; it just wouldn't have the markers. <br />
<br />
I would love to see something like this for the actions window--that is, a &quot;fifth tab&quot; on the actions window with a clock graphic that would display the analog and digital clock. I've checked, and it's the perfect size, and I see no reason why it couldn't be done...though i'm not sure if the tabbed, mark-able version would translate very well, since it would involving having two different types or rows of tabs O.o Still, if someone could be kind enough to do it, I'm sure we'd all be very greatfull. Now wouldn't we? &lt;pounds mallet into palm menacingly a few times for effect&gt; That's right. Good kiddies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm. I was able to successfully run the configuration generator on three different machines using IE 6.0 (WinXP Pro, WinXP Home, and Win98). Please post the exact options and settings you used, or send it to me in a PM. This will allow me to (1) test the particular configuration you used, and (2) send you your configuration while this problem is being investigated.<br />
<br />
On another note, the generator was developed on IE and only tested for IE, due to the high percentage of IE users. It hasn't been, and most likely will not be, tested or made compatible for Netscape (sorry Netscape folks!).<br />
<br />
As for the graphics file not being downloaded: are you using a download manager like Download Accelerator? If so, try pressing ALT as you press the download button to disable the download manager.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I'm not mistaken, Vert 2.2 requires the pet window (it is used as a combo player/pet info window), so this timer cannot exist in the pet window if Vert 2.2 is also to be used. The help window is a good choice in this case for the timer.<br />

As far as I know, there is no hotkey option for the help window. This may just be an oversight on Verant's part, so sending /bug or /feedback might help get it fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Edit (9/16): As of today's patch, the friends window now supports tabs, so the timer can now use the friends window.<br />
<br />
From the looks of the replies so far, lots of folks are probably wondering, or will wonder, about the following:<br />
<br />
1) Can this new timer be used in the friends window?<br />
2) Can this timer be put on a separate tab in another window that already uses tabs?<br />
<br />
The answer to both of these questions is &quot;no&quot;, and both are due to the same reason: this mod uses tabs. It cannot be used in the friend's window because the friends window does not support tabs, and it cannot be put on a separate tab in another window that uses tabs because tabs cannot be nested.<br />
<br />
By now, I'm sure most of you are wondering, &quot;this mod doesn't look like it has tabs&quot; or &quot;why does this mod need to use tabs&quot;. I'll try to answer those here, please bear with me:<br />
<br />
In my first prototype of a &quot;slider&quot; style timer (posted in this thread (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2375)), I used an actual slider element (like the kind you'll find in the options window). The main problem with this approach is that the slider granularity is really bad. What I mean is, you can't position it exactly where you want it, because there are only a few valid positions along the bar. Other sliders that are hard-coded into the game to represent specific values had reasonable granularity, but add a dummy slider that doesn't do anything, and it'll have bad granularity.<br />
<br />
In order to fix the granularity problem, I had to move away from actual slider elements altogether. Instead, I used a horizontal scroll bar, and made it &quot;look&quot; like a slider. That's right folks, that slider is actually the middle part of a horizontal scroll bar. Most importantly, this approach has the benefit of really good granularity (you can drag and position the &quot;slider&quot; wherever you want). It also has the side benefit of having directional buttons that can be used.<br />
<br />
Getting a working scroll bar into the mod is a bit tricky. Of the &quot;scrollable&quot; elements (not counting windows themselves), the tab page is the only one that lets you control the size of the scrollable area. The list box and STML box, for instance, cannot be populated by a mod, so the scroll bar will not become active. So, in each timer, there is a transparent tab page overlay that houses the horizontal scroll bar.<br />
<br />
The width of the scrollable area is controlled by putting a blank, dummy label element on the tab page, and setting its size. By adjusting this width, I can vary the speed at which the scroll bar moves when the &lt; and &gt; buttons are pressed. I've included this as a configurable option in the XML generator.<br />
<br />
As a final (slightly unrelated) note, I've noticed that since the last patch, real slider elements no longer work in the friends window (the friends window version of my original prototype stopped working). Therefore, the friends window will not allow sliders of either type: &quot;real&quot; sliders, or &quot;fake&quot; scroll-bar sliders housed in a tab page. Even if it did allow real slider elements (which it doesn't appear to), I'm sticking to the scroll-bar slider, because it gives much better granularity.<br />
<br />
Whew... that was a long one. Hope this clears some things up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also - when I try to save the xml file I get a 0k help window xml file with nothing in it.<br />
I just tested the timer with Vert 2.2, and it worked just fine (screenshot attached). In the screenshot, I was using the help window version of the timer.<br />
<br />
As for the 0k XML file, maybe you can give it another try? According to my log files, lots of people are generating timer configurations right now. Maybe the server was bogged down and didn't respond?<br />
<br />
Edit: I just re-read your post, and it sounds like the XML file was generated (displayed in IE) but then failed to save. Sorry, I originally thought you meant that it wasn't generated at all. Please do try it again as you've mentioned in your next post. Also, it might help to make sure the XML is fully generated and completely downloaded (IE is no longer busy) before attempting to save the file.<br />
<br />
Edit again: Based on that error message you just posted, I'm *guessing* that the problem is related to the file not being fully downloaded - since the file is incomplete, the top-level XML node doesn't have an ending tag. Maybe you can try giving it a bit more time to fully download - if it looks like the server stopped responding, sometimes re-submitting the form helps. Good luck.</div></div><hr />

In the middle of NToV now - I'll try it ALL on that machine after the raid and see if it maybe it has something to do with attempting to save the xml file across the network.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, resetting animations requires reloading the UI (/load folder 1), which can take several seconds, depending on your system. This was a major problem for some people and the main reason why people didn't like the digital timer.<br />
<br />
The slider timer was introduced to address this issue. Instead of resetting the timer, you simply move the slider to mark the bar instead. Of course, you can still reset the bar if you'd like via /load, but using the slider is preferable as it doesn't require reloading the UI. Also, keep in mind that if you reload the UI, all animations are reset at the same time; you cannot reset each one individually. So using the slider is better because you can set a different position on each slider.<br />
<br />
For more information on resetting animations and reloading the UI, please see the Timer FAQ (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/faq.asp).<br />
<br />
An example on how to use the slider:<br />
For instance, let's say I configured a 16-minute bar for timing hastes. When I cast haste on someone, I move the slider so that it points at the current length of the bar. It will take the bar exactly 16 minutes to reach that position again. So as I see the bar approach that position, I'll know when to refresh haste. For shorter duration spells (like low-level mez), you can also just eyeball the length of the bar instead of moving the slider.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it is possible to have both the digital timer and the slider timer at the same time (but keep in mind that reloading the UI to reset the digital timer will reset all animations, including the bars in the slider timers). While developing the slider timer, I had the slider timer in one window and the digital timer in another window, in order to verify that the bar is on track with the specified duration. Could you do the following: try to load both again, let it kick you back out to default, then log out and look at the contents of UIErrors.txt in your main EverQuest directory. Look for any line that has &quot;Error&quot; in it (&quot;Warning&quot; lines are normal), and post it here or send me a PM. I'll take a look and see if there is anything I need to change in my XML. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Edit: I forgot that I did rename some items after testing, so the two timers actually won't coexist at the moment due to duplicates. I will update the XML generator tonight to address this issue.<br />

You're right, this sounds like the same problem that someone else was having. Just now, I've changed the XML generator to explicitly set Content-Type to &quot;text/xml&quot; in the response header. I have no idea if this will fix your problem, but give it a try and let me know. If that still doesn't work, the other person was able to resolve the problem by using another computer to download and save the XML, so if you have access to another system, try it with that one as well.<br />

Yes, that will work, if you don't mind reloading the UI whenever you want to switch. First, duplicate the exact folder you will be using for your normal UI. Then, download and place the timer XML and TGA in one of those folders (overwriting any XML that is there with the same name), which will become your &quot;timer&quot; configuration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An alternative way of saving the XML is to right-click on the page, and select View Source from the context menu. This should cause a notepad window to open up with the XML. You can then use notepad's File &gt; Save As option to save the XML file.<br />
<br />
A reminder: copy-and-paste of the visual XML from IE won't result in a valid XML file, because IE inserts minus-signs in front of every element (for opening and closing the node). Use the above workaround instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are considering using one of your mods for our clerics to make our CH rotations more consistent.   The one I would like to try is your slider timer, but since it seems to be built for chanters the second increments go from 00 seconds to 06 seconds.  Would it be possible to add more options, a 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 07, and 08 second option?<br />

Sure, I'll add that option in my next update. Currently it only supports 6-second increments mainly because in-game ticks are 6 seconds (didn't realize there was a demand for other increments). Also, the bar is exactly 120 pixels long (120 frames). I wanted to keep the frame duration (in milliseconds) divisible by 120, so that each frame can have the same duration.<br />
<br />
For any duration (in seconds) that is not a multiple of 3 seconds, the XML generator will have to round up/down to the nearest millisecond for each frame, and make sure that all the frames add up to the full duration. It'll require some changes to the code, but is definitely doable. I'll post again when I get around to making and testing the changes.<br />
<br />
By the way, did you by any chance send me a tell yesterday? I was logging out, and right before my screen went blank, a tell showed up in my chat box. I didn't get a chance to catch the full name, but it looked similar to yours (started with M, had some y's and s's). If it was you, sorry I didn't reply, since I was logged out by the time I realized I got a tell.<br />

Lelyia - I got your email and wrote a reply, but when I sent the message it got bounced. I haven't tried using Netscape so I don't know if that'll work, but here is another workaround. If all else fails, you can copy and paste the visual XML as you've done, BUT you'll need to manually remove the minus signs (use the search-and-replace function to replace &quot;- &quot; with blank).</div></div><hr />

Just a guess here, but it's possible the timer was not installed to the correct location. Make sure you create a new folder under ....EverQuest\uifiles\, for example, ....EverQuest\uifiles\timer, and that the XML and TGA files are both placed in there. Putting them in the folder named &quot;default&quot; will not work, as that folder's contents get overwritten whenever you start the game. See the EQInterface FAQ (http://www.eqinterface.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=FAQ&amp;file=index&amp;myfaq=yes&amp;id_cat=3&amp;categories=Installing+Mods) on installing mods for more info.<br />
<br />
Assuming you had the timer installed correctly, make sure the window is toggled on. You've made sure that the window position is on the screen, but it is possible (again just a guess here) that you didn't toggle the window to visible. Some windows will always start up hidden regardless of the &quot;Show&quot; parameter in the .INI file. Check the options panel under &quot;Keyboard&quot; for the relevant hotkeys (except for the help window, which must be toggled with the window selector). Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

It's a good idea, but as far as I know it doesn't work. Animations do not restart in the way you describe - the frame that gets displayed depends on the time you last reloaded the UI, and nothing else. It will show frames as if it's been running continuously since the last reload of the UI.<br />
<br />
Someone else came up with a very similar idea, but upon trying it found that it didn't work (see this thread (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2307) for the details). Here is a quote from that thread:<br />
Originally posted by grottel <br />
Good concept but apparently doesn't work that way, the animation continues to run the whole time.  Also tried changing the cycle to False but then image would only run once for entire game session :(<br />
<br />
So unfortunately, as of now, the only known way of forcing animations to restart is reloading the UI.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah, I forgot that some of the stuff got renamed after I finished doing my testing (which used temp names). And yes, some of those items names are duplicated, which would cause errors. I'll update the XML generator tonight to allow the timers to work together. Thanks for the reminder.</div></div><hr />

This is a similar problem to the one described above, that occurs when you try to use the slider timer and the dial/digital timer together. However, in this case you are using two sets of slider timers together, so the code generated will be the same for both.<br />
<br />
To get this to work, you will have to remove (or rename) the shared named items from ONE of the slider timers, and rename other duplicated items.<br />
<br />
I will modify the XML generator for those who want to generate more than one set of slider timers, in different windows. This will automatically generate a different name for everything in the window, and will also resolve the problem in the previous post. The names generated will be based on the name of the window being used, which will ensure uniqueness among the items.<br />
<br />
Look for the updates tonight - I'll post again when they are available.</div></div><hr />

It seems the larger part of the timers isnt the timer itself its the buttons and the name/time labels.<br />
<br />
Maybe you could reduce the size of the buttons?<br />
<br />
You could even do an option to drop the name/time totaly. In theory most people should know what each timer is for anyway because they created the timers themselves.<br />
<br />
The only other option is to have a longer timer than 2hrs as some buffs last longer than this 2hr limit with AA skills and definatly will for PoP.<br />

When I try to use the timerUI I'm running into the problem that the timer isnt resetting when it reaches the sliders for some reason.<br />
<br />
From what I understand the timer should reset when it reaches one of the sliders... is that correct?<br />
Actually, the timer works in a different way. The bar fills up all the way, and then starts over when it reaches the very end. It takes exactly one full duration of the timer (whatever you specified when you generated the XML) to fill up the whole bar.<br />
<br />
The slider is there so you can mark the location of wherever the bar is when the event started. Then, you know it will take exactly the duration of the timer for the bar to reach the slider position again.<br />
<br />
For example, let's say that you want to time mend, which is available every 6 minutes. You would create a 6-minute timer using the XML generator. Whenever you use mend, you move the slider so that it points to where the bar is currently. The bar will keep filling up as usual, and start over when it reaches the end. It will reach the slider's position again when exactly 6 minutes have elapsed.<br />
<br />
The timer had to be designed this way due to the limitations of UI mods (can't reset animations without reloading the UI, can't add any sort of scripting or functionality).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. For more information please visit the Timer FAQ (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/faq.asp).</div></div><hr />

The generated XML file needs to be saved using the correct file name (the name is specified near the top of the XML file).<br />
<br />
In your case, since you are using the help window, you should rename xml.asp to EQUI_HelpWnd.xml - this will allow the timer XML to load.</div></div><hr />

What I have found to work is to go to the beginning of the second line and back space to the end of the first line and then add the enter again and save it again and everything works fine.  Give it a try and let me know.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the bar starts filling up as soon as you log in, and continues moving, starting over whenever it gets to the end. Keep in mind that with the timer duration set to 2 hours and 30 minutes, it will take 75 seconds for the bar to fill up by one pixel (so it may take some time to see a noticeable difference).<br />
<br />
Your description for how to use the timer is entirely correct. When you past aego, move the slider to the current position of the bar. The bar continues to fill up, and starts over when it reaches the end. The spell will wear off at exactly when the bar reaches the slider position again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahlee</div><div class="date">10-13-2002, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off...WOW...great mod!!!<br />
<br />
I am a very 'anal' monk, as my wife would say, because I have stopwatches velcroed to the base of my monitor for when I'm pulling.  This mod is a much more convenient and easier to follow way to track times than the stopwatches I currently use.<br />
<br />
My only problem is that I haven't really figured out how to set it up to work best, and I was wondering if any other monks out there have a setup for this that they would recommend. <br />
<br />
The problem is that every zone has a different spawn time as you know, and some areas have different spawns for different mobs, so making a timer for 30 min that can't 'reset' means that you can only really time 30 min intervals using the slider methods mentioned above.  The only solution I have come up with is making a set of multiple-timers and rotating through them for times, with the only problem being that you'd have to calculate (spawn time minus time to end of bar) and set that value as your new slider postion at the beginning of the bar.<br />
<br />
I realize you can reset the timers by /loadskin foldername 1, but with the bug that resets all my hotkey titles, that is not really a practical solution.<br />
<br />
Once again, great mod, keep up the good work...this is an invaluable tool for every class out there!!! :) <br />

Agreed, the slider timer is best for timing things that you know the duration of beforehand, like spells, abilities, etc. Task-specific timers are the easiest to use because the timer will use the exact duration of the event.<br />
<br />
For timing events where the duration varies, like spawns, I usually recommend creating one general-use timer with a nice round duration (similar to what you mentioned), like 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, or 2 hours. This makes each tick mark in the timer represent an integral number of minutes, so you can use that to determine how much time has elapsed. For example, with a 1-hour timer, each tick mark is 2 minutes, with each major tick mark representing 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
With general-use timers, where the duration of the timer does not match the duration of the event, I usually just move the slider to point to the current position of the bar when I want to start timing (like in task-specific timers). Then I can look at the timer to see how much time has passed since I started timing. Another alternative is to calculate and move the slider ahead, as you've mentioned.</div></div><hr />

Hmm... that is strange. The timer mod is completely unrelated to the spell effects, and shouldn't be affecting it at all. If you were using the old UI before this, it could have something to do with the new UI (/newui). Has anyone else seen this problem?<br />

That's a nice suggestion, but unfortunately it's not currently possible given the limitations of UI mods. The slider itself is actually the middle part of a horizontal scroll bar (see one of my earlier posts (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=12327#post12327) for more details). So clicking to the left/right of the slider may move it in that direction, but not necessarily move it to where you clicked. Also, the bar is just an animated image that's placed underneath the slider, so the slider doesn't have any connection to the position of the bar.<br />

Your problem with downloading the XML file sounds like a similar problem to what a few other people have reported, which prevents the file from being saved correctly with the browser. If &quot;View Source&quot; doesn't even work, then your best bet is to download the XML with another computer (as you have done). After you download the file, open it with a text editor to make sure that it is complete, as a corrupt file will cause the UI to crash. Scroll down to the bottom and make sure you see the &lt;/XML&gt; ending tag.<br />
<br />
Also, check out the workaround mentioned in this post (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=14022#post14022) to make sure that it isn't the problem.<br />
<br />
As for not being able to download the graphics, it could be related to your download manager, if you have Download Accelerator installed (in which case pressing ALT as you click the download button will solve the problem). If that still doesn't work, downloading it with another machine, as you have done, is fine also.<br />
<br />
Installation:<br />
<br />
Given that you are using the Bug Window for the timer, here are the two files that you need:<br />
1) EQUI_BugReportWnd.xml - the XML file. The XML file must be saved using this name in order for it be loaded by the UI engine.<br />
2) BugReport_Timer.tga - the graphics file. Again, the file must use this file name.<br />
<br />
Place the two files into the UI mod folder. If you want to use it with your existing Vert mod, place it inside the Vert mod's folder, instead of creating a new folder for the timer. Also, from the error message you posted, it looks like you were trying to use a UI folder named &quot;Meth Timer&quot;. Not sure if this matters at all, but having a space in the folder name may cause problems with the /loadskin command, which might treat the two words as separate parameters. Use a one-word folder name to be safe.<br />
<br />
Try the above and see if it works. If for some reason you are unable to successfully save the complete XML file, as a last resort you can email me with your desired timer configuration, and I'll generate the XML file and send it to you.</div></div><hr />

Was wondering... is it possible to make the timer bar start out full and empty itself, moving from Right to Left, instead of the current way of starting empty and filling left to right?<br />
Sorry it took so long for me to get around to this, but I've been busy with RL work lately. This feature is now available in the slider timer XML generator.<br />
<br />
When creating your timer configuration, you now have an option called Bar Animation - the available choices are &quot;Start empty, gradually fill up (default)&quot; and &quot;Start full, gradually empty out&quot;. This option will be helpful for those who like to visualize the elapsed/remaining time differently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The short version: When you cast a spell you move the pointer to the CURRENT place of the timer.  The timer keeps going continuously.  When it reaches that point again, you know the spell is about to wear off.<br />
<br />
Example: The timer is just going on and on, but you're medding so it doesn't matter.  Then the mob spawns, so you stand up and cast Dooming Darkness, which has a duration of 1 min 12 seconds.  While the casting bar is going, you glance over and see that the Dooming Darkness timer is about half way through, so you quickly move the little arrow to the mid-point.  You then back off and fear or root or whatever your normal xp-gathering procedure happens to be.  During the battle you keep an eye on the timer... when the bar starts to reach the arrow you positioned, 1 min 12 seconds later, you know it's time to refresh Dooming Darkness.</div></div><hr />

/cast 1<br />
/enable timer1<br />
<br />
or something like that. I'm sure that day is coming... in the meantime, the timer works great for spells like dooming darkness etc, nice job!</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing you may want to double-check is to open the XML file, and make sure that you've downloaded the entire file. The last line should be &lt;/XML&gt;. It is possible to get a partial file if you attempted to grab the source before it is completely done downloading. If this is the case, just generate another timer and wait until the browser is no longer busy before saving the XML.<br />
<br />
If you've checked the file and it appears to be fully intact, look in your EverQuest\UIErrors.txt file after attempting to /loadskin. See if there is a line with &quot;Error&quot; in it (&quot;Warning&quot; lines are normal and expected), and post it here. I'll take a look to see if it is a problem with the XML.

if i copy, paste, the contents of the xmp file, it copies the little 'tick' marks, that close/open sections of the xml, but are not supposed to be part of the syntax itself...<br />
