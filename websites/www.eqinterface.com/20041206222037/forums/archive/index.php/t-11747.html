I could understand you bumping a thread after a day or two but making another post after 4hrs? Come on.<br />

I don’t know man, the downloads work fine for me and about 150,000 others today &amp; yesterday.<br />
<br />
Would be helpful if you would include what software you are using to browse the internet, isp, do you have any goofy download managers installed, what file have you been trying to download, have you tried to download other files? Have you checked your ISP's network status page to see if they are having peering issues with XO, cognet, or various other bandwidth providers? Information like that. :)<br />
<br />
Hope we can come to a solution soon after we get more information from you. Please feel free to email me at dolby@eqgui.com. It may take me awhile to respond becuase I've been very busy the past few weeks.</div></div><hr />
