Wow, what a couple days, eh? Here's all the Patch News I could find, all in one place...<br />
 Cairenn's Corner! Cairenn has posted a complete list of changes and fixes (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5314) for this patch; it is current through the 01/09 update and 01/10 re-patch. Also, the Full Patch Message is posted here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5317).<br />
If you have question about what's changed and how to fix it, PLEASE read her post FIRST!<br />
<br />
 EQ has a Windowed Mode! It can only be accessed once you are fully in game (i.e. not from Server or Character Select, etc); to access, use ALT+ENTER. Once you're in Windowed Mode, you can use the following commands...<br />
<br />
     - ALT+SHIFT+R will give you cursor control while in the EQ window (allowing you to minimize, etc);<br />
     - ALT+TAB will switch between open application windows (will only work if you have another window open);<br />
     - Window Key+M will minimize all windows, including EQ (likely unnecessary once you have cursor control, but...)<br />
     - ALT+ENTER again will return you to Full Screen Mode (only if EQ is the active window).<br />
     - WinXP and ALT+TAB: If you're having problems in WinXP, see this post (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53598) from the Developers Corner on how to enable it.<br />
<br />
 A Separate Song Section! The Short Duration Buff Window (aka the Bard Box) is now active!<br />
<br />
     - It will hold up to 6 beneficial Bard Songs, upping the potential max number of buffs to 21.<br />
     - Not all Songs will go in this window, for a complete list, see Lucy's 148 changes on Live (http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Live&amp;date=2003-01-09%2011:57:28); note no Selo's songs are included.<br />
     - Uploads for mods of this window should be made to Buffs &amp; Effects (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?op=showfiles&amp;catid=21); downloads can be found in this area as well!<br />
<br />
 A Longer Piece... To go along with the new Short Duration Buff Window, a new button has been added to the Window Selector window, making it a bit longer. Customized Window Selectors will likely need to be patched.<br />
<br />
 Lost your Compass? The Window_Pieces04.tga file was patched, which is the graphics file used by the compass. If you have a custom compass, it may need to be patched.<br />
<br />
 What's the Story? Included in the Patch but not mentioned in the Message is a new Story Window (EQUI_StoryWnd.xml); as far as I know, no use or explanation has been found as of yet (though speculation leans towards it having to do with PoP storyline flags); watch here for further developments...<br />
<br />
 Pressing Your Buttons! From the &quot;It's About Freaking Time&quot; Department... the Load UI Skin button (in the Options menu) now works!! I know tons of /feedback and /bug reports were submitted... but let's be sure to give Kudane some well-deserved credit (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5250), too!<br />
You da man!! er... Cat!<br />
<br />
 Just the  F.A.Q. (http://www.eqinterface.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=FAQ&amp;file=index&amp;s=)! 01/09-10 info will be added soon, but most of your pre-patch questions can still be answered in the F.A.Q.! (http://www.eqinterface.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=FAQ&amp;file=index&amp;s=) Be sure to check there first! <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;a name=&quot;updates&quot;&gt;Latest Updates&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
Don't worry, they're coming... I'm giving everything the weekend to settle, then I'll have a (no doubt) huge list of new mods for you to check out, both pre- and post-patch!<br />
<br />
Have a great weekend!</div></div><hr />
