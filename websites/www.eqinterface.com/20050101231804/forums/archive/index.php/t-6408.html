<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Backkstabber77</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im SURE some other people are having trouble with their UI window locations...After todays patch, all my windows (Drakah's btw) were all like shifted to the left like an inch, and some were over-lapping and some didnt even fit. I deleted my UI .ini file and put back in default UI .ini from the drakah download. Same thing happened. Also, I tried this with Quartz1.6. Same thing happened. I run 1280x1024 resolution and I like it so im really not ready to go back to 800x600 w/ Default skin. I REALLY need some help here!</div></div><hr />

I'm running 1280x1024 also. When I switched to 1600x1200 the left shifted things were there and fine, but when I switch back to 1280 they're gone again. I even dragged the shifted windows to the middle of my screen in 16x12 mode and again when I switched to my normal rez those items are again lost off the left side of the screen. I am soo sick of this UI aggrevation. And I just started using Kaori's V4 UI last week and got it set up the way I want it <br />

Many many many people (everyone? I know I am) are having this problem.  This (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6358) thread has various temporary fixes that folks are coming up with to help deal with this situation until SOE gets it fixed.</div></div><hr />
