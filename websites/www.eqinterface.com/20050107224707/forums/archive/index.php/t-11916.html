I am trying to install AYA650 R3 B3. I did everything the readme says and when i log in after i pick my character i get a EQ has crashed error window. my UIError.txt looks like this:<br />

now what i don't understand is AYA650R2 will work. but even when i install R3B3 in a new install (delete folder remake with only files for R3B3 in it) or install it over R2 and change the ini to R3's. it still crashes. I hope someone can help me because i would really like to get this UI to work! Thank you  :)</div></div><hr />

I figured out which window was causing it, deleted the xml for it and edited it again.  Try loading the default in your UI_Player_server.ini file, then loading the ui from in the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure its a corrupt xml file.  This is exactly what was happening to me.  Load only one custome xml at a time.  Make a folder called Test.  Copy lets say the targetwindow.xml from your custom ui to your test folder.  Load the test folder as your ui.  Keep adding xmls from your ui folder to your test folder til it crashes.  When it crashes after you just added an xml you know which one it is.</div></div><hr />

Yes what Inokis said is correct, one file in the R3B3 UI is corrupted OR more likely calling an object twice (normally only cause a UI Crash)..<br />
<br />
the only way to trouble shoot this one is to add one XML file at a time and reload the UI in game till it crashes. then remove that file and reload to make sure it stable.. once you find the file that causes it, we can figure out whats wrong with it.</div></div><hr />

I loaded the EQUI_AYA file and it crashed I havent went any further inthe test.</div></div><hr />

When I put the EQUI_AYA file back into the AYA file and tried to reload it I crashed again.  Must be something wrong in the EQUI_AYA file ?</div></div><hr />
