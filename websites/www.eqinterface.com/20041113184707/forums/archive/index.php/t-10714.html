I'm not sure what version I'm using, because my infiniti ui doesn't match any of the above pictures.  I think it was 2.0.  I can't promise it will work with your versions.<br />

I  was only able to get 15 buffs to display, and I can't figure out why the rest won't; however, it's not exactly all that often that a pet gets his buff slots full.</div></div><hr />

<br />
infinity9 -  I love your UI.  I found it by accident when I came back after a 6 month leave.<br />
<br />
Hoping the changes made by today's patch are not too difficult to fix/add.  Looking forward to an update.<br />
<br />
UI related portion of Patch News:<br />
** Interface **<br />
<br />
- We have added the consider color to the Target window.  The art used to display the consider color can be removed or edited via XML by custom skins.<br />
<br />
- We have also added a 3D target indicator.  The ring color indicates the con color of the target.  This can be turned off in the Options window. A new settings file in the UI folder can be edited by players to customize the appearance of the indicator, including different animated textures for each con color and other interesting settings.<br />
<br />
- Added /fontface command (usage /fontface &lt;fontname&gt;, e.g. /fontface Courier).  This will change, on the fly, the fonts used by the interface (and over character's heads).  Fonts can also be selected in the General Options page.<br />
<br />
- Added /tell windows.  Each time you get a &quot;tell&quot; from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window will only display &quot;tells&quot; from the particular character, and any message sent from the chat window would automatically be sent as a &quot;tell&quot; to that character. You can turn this option on and off in the Options window.  If you have the maximum number of chat windows open when a new tell is received, the tell will go to the main chat window<br />
<br />
- Temporary pets will no longer send their buffs to the pet window.  Generally they have none, and they would replace the buffs of any standard pet.<br />
<br />
- The buff display portion of the pet window will now fade.<br />
<br />
- The Auto-inventory area of the Inventory window now fades with the parent window.<br />
<br />
- The Dump button in raid window now creates the proper, non-blank, file.<br />
<br />
- We have also added time-stamp to Raid Dump output file.<br />
<br />
- Pop-up dialogs no longer close when you press ESC.  This will prevent the rez dialog from being closed accidentally.<br />
<br />
- Lay on Hands will no longer &quot;gray out&quot; the Inspect and Open hot keys in the Hotbutton window.  This was fixed earlier in the Actions window, but now it is fixed in the Hotbutton window as well.<br />
<br />
- Alt-tabbing in and out of EQ should no longer cause mouse issues.<br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that sometimes left charmed pets health bar in the group window after the owner of that pet is killed.<br />
<br />
- Find trader can now be cancelled in bazaar.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Items **<br />
<br />
- The Copper Medal of Rapture now gives a bonus to Int. instead of Wis.<br />
<br />
<br />
** For the New Player **<br />
<br />
- Left-clicking on an NPC prints out a message indicating what type of NPC they are and indicating that you should right-click on them.  This message can be turned off in the Options window.<br />
<br />
- New characters will now start with a bag.<br />
<br />
- Added a tip window that pops up when you invoke the Quantity window that explains the use of Shift and Control when selecting items.<br />
<br />
- All characters will gain a Sense Heading skill of 200, if it was below 200.  All new characters will start with a Sense Heading of 200.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous **<br />
<br />
- Explore mode works properly again.<br />
<br />
<br />
** UI Files **<br />
<br />
* Changed *<br />
<br />
EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_TargetWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_Animations.xml<br />

<br />
This is a problem with the game, not the UI. Many people have experienced this with different UI's, including the default one. Not sure of the cause, hopefully SoE is looking into it.<br />
<br />
Also, has anyone seen the problem I described in my last post above? It's in the last paragraph. I still occasionally get the lag when my inventory window is open. <br />

In all my use and modding of the infinity interfaces, I haven't seen this problem before. Not sure what might cause it.</div></div><hr />

As for the missing &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; on rezz windows or when Looting &quot;No Drop&quot; items, I had the same problem about a month ago with this UI and the Default. I was taking some time looking for a new UI and did alot of replacing files from other UI's and figured I screwed things up. Even after copying over all files in the Custom UI dir with the orig files that I know worked, was still missing the Yes and No (Default UI included). I reloaded EQ completely and no change :(<br />
<br />
I wiped and formatted  the HDD (Ah what the heck. It had been atleast been 6 months since last wipe/format), reloaded/patched  the OS and re-installed/patched  EQ and things were back to normal. Reloaded this UI and again all was good. Really freakin weird..<br />

<br />
I have a suggestion/request regarding the target window though.  I kinda bastardized mine to make the con color show up and it works, but isn't as pretty as the original.  Also, I saw on another UI (Delta3_Spaghetti I believe) where they had the HP of the target in the window.  I thought these two things would make your UI even better.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pangaea</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I am hoping this will help some of you, this is what I was told to do by EQ tech support to fix bugs with buttons.  My specific bug was not being able to click on the &quot;Skills&quot; button on only one of my characters and go to skills page.  Basically the &quot;skills&quot; page was bugged.   Soo....here's the fix...<br />
<br />
From your EQ directory...<br />
Delete the &quot;uifiles&quot; folder<br />
Delete eqclient.ini<br />
Delete eqgfx_dx8.dll<br />
Do a search for UI*.ini - and delete those files<br />
<br />
<br />
Notice, you delete your uifiles directory so you will have to redownload your UI's.  My guess...is that if you create a character after having installed custom UI's it bugs your new characters, as those were the only characters that had any problem for me.  Hope that helps.<br />
<br />
Oh and I absolutely LOVE the infinit2_8 UI : )  though I wish there was a way you could put a line around the spell windows and song windows to resize them without having to switch out of the UI. <br />
Later folks : )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lueamdar</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is another fix for windows not coming up, like the Skills window...etc.<br />
<br />
If you look in your UI_charname_server.ini under the different [headings] you will see positions for different resolutions you have used.<br />
<br />
For example, if you are running in 1280 x 1024, and your skills window isn't showing up, under the heading [SkillsWindow] you would see 2 lines like:<br />
<br />
XPos1280x1024=0<br />
YPos1280x1024=0<br />
<br />
If they are 0 (zero) then that should be the problem.<br />
<br />
Change these 2 values to something like 100, save the .ini file, and log your character back on.  You should now be able to see your Skills window pop up, and then move it to where you like.<br />
<br />
This was a fix for me about a week ago, so I thought I would add it in.<br />
<br />
Hopefully it helps someone out. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw on the tech support forums that the fix Lueamdar posted works for most people. The patch in the middle of december caused the skills window to be resized to 0,0 for some reason.<br />
The lines you want are just below the ones Lueamdar mentioned. Search the ui_character_server.ini and find this section:<br />
<br />
[SkillsWindow]<br />
XPos1024x768=0<br />
YPos1024x768=0<br />
Width=0<br />
Height=0<br />
<br />
The first two lines are position. If they are set to 0,0 it just means the skills window will be in the upper left corner of the screen. The second two lines are size... if they say 0,0... change it to something like:<br />
<br />
Width=300<br />
Height=300<br />
<br />
And then log in and resize the skills window however you like.</div></div><hr />

I petitioned and the GM said &quot;never heard of it, sorry&quot;  well... after deleting ALL my UIs and repatching...  still bugged...  and after pulling my hair out...  I finally decided to delete all files having anything to do with my character's name.. and voila  all fixed.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure I've pinned down the problem of the laggy inventory. Post here if you are still having the problem... and tell me if your char is a wizard. =)  <br />
<br />
Yes I am a Wizard and am having the lag problem (As I stated earlier) when the Inventory window opens. I  am gonna install the latest version of the UI tonite. <br />
<br />
Thanks and again Very impressive UI =)</div></div><hr />

It doesnt happen all the time but does occasionally. After about a minute the lag stops. My character is Wizard as stated earlier.<br />
<br />
Just letting you know. <br />
<br />
Other than that,  Love this UI!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is caused by missing animation frames. The game is trying to find the animation frames for the TKing wizard animation... and they are not in your infinitymix folder. The easiest thing to try is to remove all other custom folders from Uifiles. If you just have the infinitymix folder and the default, the lag should go away. You won't see any animation in your inventory, though.<br />
Another fix is to install the TKing wizard animation (I don't think it matters if you chose fire or ice). This should fix the lag and give you a nice animation in the inventory.<br />
The last fix is very involved, and requires the animations.xml file to be adjusted... so that it looks for the default wizard animation .tga's... I wouldn't recommend this unless you are fairly sharp with EQ's XML.<br />

The instructions dont tell me where I should run the XXXinstall.exe and the Remmy.exe from so I assume I just run them and the directories will be found automatically.

I know my version isn't Infiniti's, hehe and I prolly shouldn't post here on this thread, but so far with Cairenn's patch fixes I have managed to get Infinitimix to work/load without errors. I'm just missing the new spell gem/icon's added and the new combat ability button in the window selector.<br />
<br />
Hopefully Fozz shows up soon to save the day and help me finish mine along with all the other infiniti UI's. It's honestly not that much. I'm just a complete noob at photoshop and can't fix it myself atm.<br />

Thanks for your help and advice.. <br />

Also, prior to the 10 Feb (GoD) patch, I installed Direct-X 9 and then installed the latest drivers for my video card. <br />
<br />
I had no problems when I logged in after the patch and am using the latest verion of the UI. For those that are having problems, verify you have Direct-X 9 installed as per the direction from SoE, If you dont have version 9 installed then you will encounter problems when logging in. Obviously make sure your video card will support Direct-X 9 before installing it. :-)   ..<br />

Curretnly when loaded it will state that there are some XML files that are not compatable, however I have yet to find any problems with it and have been running it for around 12 hours. All new GoD features are included.<br />
<br />
It works completly for Melee classes ( I tested it with my monk). Please be aware that with a caster there may be some problems with spell gems or something else as I have not got around to testing it with a caster class yet. Also please be aware that the only GoD function I have not yet tested is the new tradeskill interface I would assume that is working as intended but am not positive<br />
<br />
As soon as it is approved and available for download I will reply to this post with a link<br />

There are NO .xml errors when loaded. The only thing that I can find wrong is with the selectorwindow (alt+W) where there is a space with no button in it (no button is actually missinsg). If anyone knows how to fix this that would be very helpful. If not, whatever its not really I big deal, I don't keep that window open anyways.<br />

It's not a huge issue at all, but the numerical Endurance only shows 3 of 4 numbers since it bumps right up against the Mana tag (mine says &quot;5546/554&quot;).  I'm not sure what a good fix is, since it's already a very small font and there isn't much else to put it.  Mostly I just wanted to make sure you knew about it.<br />

Since Yel is working on Infiniti and knows what the heck he's doing :p  I won't bother updating mine :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raine</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also looking for an OOW compatable one. I know Sage Blazynice's Inifiniti Mix is compatable. But I'm looking for one that looks more like the original one. with normal hotbox and buffs down the side with vertically, rather then horizontally... you know like the Ture infinity version.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raine</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fozzy released a new infiniti series updated for OOW in the download section. I slightly modified it so that the buff window doesn't have a boarder when you scroll over it and it says the names of each buff next to it, which is very easy to do. Check it out if your looking for something that looks just about exactly like original infiniti series.</div></div><hr />

I have added the 9th spell slot as well as Buff Slots 16-20.  As many have requested, I have also added the left/right buttons on the hotkey window, and corrected some of the issues with the inventory part of the hotbutton window.<br />

Do you have a version that scales?</div></div><hr />
