<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythal</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't particularly like the twist factor of the default target indicator, so I made the following:<br />
<br />
Type 1:<br />
http://www.mythal.com/images/indicator1.jpg<br />
<br />
Type 2:<br />

<br />
The two lines of runes move, one clockwise the other counter-clockwise. Color indicates con, as normal. I could have used more colors in the runes, but as there are already 12 frame files, using more colors would have meant a minimum of 36 files just for the target indicator, and I thought that was a bit excessive :b<br />
<br />
The first type has slimmer runes, and I have to admit looks better. However, I saw a bit of fuzziness when the indicator got stretched (i.e. on larger-sized targets). I made the second type to be more visible, at the cost of some visibility on the outer-rim runes.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think please. Any suggestions welcome :)<br />
<br />
You can download the files here:<br />

Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

I would assume the more graphic files that the game has to load would cause more lag.  Please let me know, because I would like to use the frame concept for a ring for myself :p   Very nice work!!</div></div><hr />

Hope to see more of your artwork in future :)</div></div><hr />

I'd say it might cause as much lag as having a custom T.King class animation showing on your UI (or having the inventory window open) -- I say approximate because there are the same amount of frames more or less.</div></div><hr />
