<br />
I check there first whenever I hit the site and I thought there were a lot of updates to skins I use when they were actually Mac skins.  I think its great that you have skins for all these poor people who have been left out up until now, but I have to admit they are not very useful to me.  To save time and your bandwith could you color-code or italicize the names of Mac downloads?<br />
<br />
Thanks, and you have a GREAT site!<br />

So an easy solution can not be found at the moment. <br />
<br />
I’ll keep this in mind though.<br />
<br />
In the mean time when you click on the interface you will notice towards the top it will say its in the Macintosh category if its mac only.<br />
<br />
<br />
Update: If you hover your mouse over the interface name in that right block you will see a small description. If the author puts in the small description it’s made for Mac you can tell that way too.<br />
<br />
Another update: Just tried the new join method to join the two tables in the mySQL query. It worked but it was still very hard on my server. Page generation went from 0.2sec to 2.9sec. This is because it has to do 15 queries, 1 for each new download shown. I might just do an if statement and hardcode the cats that are for mac only to show a mac icon since the file table stores the catid (just not the cat name).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was able to figure out a way to add the category name to the list of new files and not kill the server load and page generation time. I’ve learned a little more about the JOIN command for mySQL querys too. :)</div></div><hr />
