Or if i try to put in the stand alone will I just go back the default UI and have that stand-alone there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I am understanding you correctly, after you have loaded up a complete set from here, you want to add pieces you like instead of what came with the complete set, correct?<br />
<br />
If so, thats easy enough. Once you have downloaded the complete set into your custom UI folder, simply add the choice pieces you want from a stand alone feature (i.e., you like T.Kings Inventory better than you like Fiddlefaddles Complete UI Inventory). Now beware though, some complete set UI's are bordered UI, meaning that they have like a decorative window border and have intergrated their player window, group window, inventory, and so on, so make the UI complete. Changing anything in the border may cause issues from the UI not working properly or at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only issues to watch for are: <br />
<br />
* Dependencies.  Some UIs require graphics files or rely on other XML files.  So mix &amp; matching from two or more complete sets is doable, but might have issues.  The UIerrors.txt file will be your friend in resolving them. <br />
<br />
* As covered above, looks.  Somethings just won't look right if you squish them in with others.  Your personal choices are, of course, up to you.</div></div><hr />
