<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dvaren</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...I have gotten the Vert 2.2 mods to load.<br />
<br />
Yet there is a much more serious problem now, that noone else has ever mentioned. I will try to be brief.<br />
<br />
After my Vert mods broke in the first place, I initially peiced together a bunch of little UI pieces (one by one and tested each one to see if it would error or crash) until I had a full UI to use. THis UI generated no errors nor did it crash me to desktop. <br />
<br />
BUT...<br />
<br />
A strange thing happened....all the sudden, EQ was constantly accessing my harddrive (I hear it buzzing away down there) and giving me SEVERE lag. Very similiar to what most of us experience in the bazaar.  So I reloaded default and sure enough, away it went!<br />
<br />
Now...<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone who posted here and abouts, I have Vert2.2 runnign error free and crashless. Yet as soon as I load it, there goes the harddrive and lag again.  I load the default, and WOOP...no hardrive noise or lag.<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain this to me?? I'm goign nutz! (I been up 12 hours straight now messing with this and I'm about to fall over..lol)<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone,<br />
<br />
Dvaren<br />

I have now checked, and sure enough there is a new error text in my log that is INFINITE....it goes on and on and on and on and...<br />
<br />
Heres a sample:<br />

I must be the greatest .xml idiot on earth<br />
<br />
But apparently this neverending error and search is the cause of the lag...but what is causing it??<br />
<br />
This thread (also unanswered) seems to be the exact same problem:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The usual cause for the infinite uierrors.txt file is because of a graphics file missing that one of your xml files is asking for.  It ends up looking for the file in an endless loop and just continues to right an entry to the error file.  The best thing to do is look and see if there is also a texture.txt file that is quite large in your Everquest folder along with the large UIErrors.txt file.  If the texture.txt file is also large then you can be pretty sure that there is a TGA file missing somewhere along the line.<br />
<br />
Some one else here may be able to help narrow down what file it is looking for but I have always just used my debugging skills and looked through all the xml files I have in my skin for all entries of .tga.  Then I just check to make sure that all of the .tga files that my skin is asking for are either part of my skin or are in the default directory.  I uaully find the culprit and everything is fixed.<br />
<br />
The best thing I can suggest if this is the case is to use the Search function in your xml editor(whether it is notepad or wordpad or something else) and search for all entries of &quot;.tga&quot;.  then make sure you have them all.</div></div><hr />
