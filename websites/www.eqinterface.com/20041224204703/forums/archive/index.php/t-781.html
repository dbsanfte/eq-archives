I used the exsisting pieces05.tga file, I also was using one of the two tga files that aren't really used by the game since it seems Verant put the graphics from pieces04 &amp; 05 onto pieces 03. They must of done that for some reason and I might of figured it out.<br />
<br />
I redid the square buttons in the Hot Button Window using a pieces05.tga.....when I loaded my mule that I used for testing the buttons worked great for the 3 custom folders I have. Then I went to play two chars at once, first one on the buttons worked fine.....2nd one there were no buttons at all just the type. I thought maybe a cache problem so changed my options before logging on and same thing. Only way I got it to correct was to put my new graphics on pieces03 over the exsisting buttons and not use the pieces05.tga I had them on.<br />
<br />
My point is don't get to carried away now :)<br />
<br />
Here's the URL if you'd like to check out the buttons I made:<br />

I have a faster puter too, 1.9ghz, with 512 megs of ram.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to download the buttons here's links to save them. I will warn you though....the pieces01.tga which has the arrow buttons on it, you will need to resize the arrows and center them in your Hot Button.xml file. The Defaut buttons are enlarged and it seems graphics with a straight edge on them don't enlarge too good. The arrow button should be set at it's normal size which is w22 X h12. <br />
<br />
No changes at all are needed for the Hot Buttons graphic to work right, which is pieces03.tga<br />
