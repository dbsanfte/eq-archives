<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;Brain Orgasm&gt;  Seeing this spellbook's animation is the answer to the *Shaman* dream I have been having since creating my SonaSpell book (whacky layout with mana icons) which is basically floating icons with spell gems, so here is the thing that will haunt me til I can make it work or Kuvasie (hint hint) can make the bookmark (#5.tga) a complete transparency...<br />
<br />
Plan:<br />
1) Take the Bookmark Item and get it modded up to no longer have the book background, just the dreamcatcher and feathers.<br />
2)  Use the TK_Bookmark UID2 as the base for SBW_SpellIcon##.  Now the spell book has 16 animated spell icons.<br />
3)  Dynamically place the Spell Icons into location as hanging dreamcatchers.<br />
4)  Determine a way to import spell gems in a) a circle fitting in the eye or simply b) set them just below the eye so that it is always visible.<br />
5)  Create a separate UID2/Static anim that is used as background to the spell text info.<br />
6)  Eliminate any semblance of bookishness.  (The Shaman has many dreamcatchers that he/she focuses energies from.)<br />
<br />
Obstacles:<br />
*  Is there any way to prioritize layering of Static animation items/text and gems?  Need to have the catcher in layer back, spell text blunt in layer 2, spell gem in layer 3 front and text in layer 4 front to make it all work.....<br />
<br />
No mock up yet, just trying to work it out in my head before going home tonight to completely forget about buying my new spells and start work on this.<br />
<br />
Please dont flame for dreamcatcher/shaman etc...look at it and you know it really is a dreamcatcher.</div></div><hr />

I know that is the way the pieces work.  As I said though I am not 100% sure that the animations work the same way.  but you can try it and find out.</div></div><hr />

ROFL - I haven't had a chance lately to play EQ -  I haven't even loaded this one on my shaman yet.  :mad: <br />
<br />
Good luck.  Had to read your descritpion a time or two to 'see' what you are talking about.  Sounds very interesting.<br />

When the right dreamcatcher comes along, then it will be as easy as redefining the ui2d section and bingo! New look to old setup.<br />
