<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blacklife</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have a copy of the R2 release of the AYA UI.  I had a hard drive fail and lost my copy.  The R3 release crashes EQ and causes memory issues immediately upon load.  In fact all versions of the AYA UI on this site either load funny or crash upon load.   I run R3B3 on another computer without issue so yes something is funny about this one system of mine.  I love the UI and would like to get another copy.  If you know where I can get one please post here.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help</div></div><hr />

I did that prior to posting.  Basically, I was unable to find any usable information.  The problems fell into 3 catagories, UI_Character_Server.ini issues, video card issues and undefined bad XML calls.<br />
<br />
My issue is not any if those.  The R2 release worked well on that one computer. Switching to R3B3 immediately prompts XP to throw up a low virtual memory error.  This has never happened before.  It is a ****ty PC but it does have enough memory.  I have R3B3 running on another PC without issue so I know its not that version something with that PC does not like R3.  <br />

Thanks for the tip anyway....</div></div><hr />
