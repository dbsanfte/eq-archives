<br />
just wondering if anyones game to help out here, I have an idea for a necro pet box but due to being bad at graphics wondered if anyone would assist me.<br />
<br />
Basicaly i have an idea based on picture added id like (but have no idea on how to do it) have buttons on the skull and spine  maby in a rune type thing (sorta etched look) on the skull and spine so for example have spaced over the forhead pet attack pet back off pet guard and the rest spaced down the spinal collum<br />
what i though to show pet health was maby fully lit eyes (red glow) slowly fading out to black as health decreases.<br />
<br />
As u can see the picture is very basic but it was modled in 3dmax and left plain so u can add any artistry u need to like age the skull<br />
draw in  symbols ect my inspiration for ths idea was te gothic alchemy skull omega which can be found on their site u will see its covered in inscriptions and symbols.<br />
<br />
well thats it let me know what u think or post designs u make)</div></div><hr />
