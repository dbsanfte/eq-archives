When I put the frame on it the text labels right justify the text instead of center, and there's nothing I've found that can make the icons fill left to right, tho I can make the labels fill left to right.<br />

I'm thinkin these are EQ UI bugs, not a problem with the XML.</div></div><hr />

Miele, there are lots of vertical buff bars with the text labels and background colour (blue/red) on the site.  :)<br />
<br />
Dagurr, unfortunately, there is no way to make EQ fill the buff slots from left to right, much as we might prefer it that way.  Sorry. :confused:</div></div><hr />

I'd like to have the vertical buffs without the blue and red labels, but the one with the transparent labels and small yellow (white?) text.<br />
A numeration from 1 to 15 would be a nice upgrade, or at least a frame which can contain just 15 buffs.<br />

This is what I'd like to obtainLook here (space.tin.it/clubnet/etaboni/buffsilike.jpg)</div></div><hr />

Perhaps more work than you fell comfortable doing, but to get transparent buttons on any mod is pretty easy. All you have to do is find each of the button objects and set the &lt;Style_Transparent&gt; tags to be true.  This way you can look at all of the mods to find one you like and then simply edit it to be transparent. The button objects will start with &lt;Button item=&quot;BW_Buff#_Button&quot;&gt; (where # is a number 0-14) and will contain a line saying &lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt; . Just change that to true and you are in business.</div></div><hr />

I hadn't logged in since my Birthday (on the 21st of October) and my favorite skin (right hand Quartz - god bless Quartz!!!) wouldn't load anymore.  So I downloaded the latest version, and my buff bar was gone!!!  After spending 2 hours trying to find the latest version, I booted up my Dad's computer and stripped the old buff bar from there.<br />

Here is what it looks like...<br />

I also tested it, and it still works, so thank goodness for that!  Enjoy!!!<br />

I also uploaded this to eqinterface, so hopefully they will host it soon.  I can't believe this mod was ever removed!!!<br />
