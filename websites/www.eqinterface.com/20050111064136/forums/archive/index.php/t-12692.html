<br />
i was just thinkin how amaising eqis<br />
<br />
ok in eq u can make/obtain something and sell it in the bazaar for plat or u can wait and see if the sell price goues up. Then things happen liek a newfeature and everything cahnges. take the new TSing window.  With it being so easy to do TS's now the market is going to be flooded with items.  Prices will flucuate like a real economy.  and if something bad happens(like a game designer dies) the markets going to take a hit. all this and there is still alot of wayes to doo stuff.  u can get together  with the rest of the sells of an item and all make up the price(makesure  it a commenly bought item) and make alot of pp because  peoiple always need things.  With the new TS wiondow the prices(i bleave) are going to skyrocket.  with farmers being able to get more for there good they will farm more and more. and people will pay more and more.  it will all lvl out in a few mounths but by then someting news going to come out and the market will flucuate again.<br />
<br />
i seroiusly think they should put a stck extange like thing in EQ. Real life economics apply to EQ its great.<br />
<br />
