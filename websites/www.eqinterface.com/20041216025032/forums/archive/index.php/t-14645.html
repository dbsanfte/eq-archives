Once i was finally able to give up the game, giving up control of the UI and my legacy was the next logical step.  Bonecracka has volunteered his time for almost 2 years to my site and has officially taken over my UI and my webpage, which has been condensed down to the Forum.  The familiar address of  Sars.Has.It will still work and will be changed to go directly to the forums soon.  Updates for the melee version have already been posted there and the caster and hybrid versions will be coming soon.  Likewise as soon as we figure out how to give him control of all of my downloads on this site, he will be updating and continue to update my UIs for me in my absence.  Sorry for the long lapse and Thanks again for all the wonderful years of support you have given me, and I am glad I was able to give something back.  <br />
