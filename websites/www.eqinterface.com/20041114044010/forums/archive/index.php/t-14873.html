I've been working on my UI for personal use for a while now, and it's gotten to the point where I've decided I might as well release it.  :)<br />
<br />
Here's a picture of all the modded windows with labels:<br />

<br />
Made for 1024x768 with a viewport of 100 0 804 570.  Basically I wanted to emulate the general layout of the origional UI while retaining the new functionality.<br />
<br />
So, feedback?  Would anyone use this?  What changes would you make?<br />
<br />
(Also, little question.  Right now the mod includes an altered EQUI_Animations.xml, and I'd like to avoid that if possible.  The only alteration is for the buff icon background.  I tried integrating the stuff into the buff window file but I could never get it to work: it always just used whatever was in the Animations file even if I told the buffs to use a different background.  Any way to do this without altering any core XML files that might need updating?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only change would be to have the AA/EXP % under the gauges.<br />
<br />
Post the files so we can try it out.</div></div><hr />

One way to do this is to create a new xml file called something like EQUI_Deathbane.xml and have your custom graphic definitions in there.  Then, if you look in the EQUI.xml file, near the beginning you'll see a bunch of &lt;Include&gt; lines for each of the other xml files.  Just add an &lt;Include&gt; line for EQUI_Deathbane.xml.  The format of the line should be very obvious.  A number of custom UI's use this method.  If you want a specifice example of one, Lothay 2.5 (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3174) uses this method.</div></div><hr />

So basically I'd have to move the altered &quot;core&quot; file from EQUI_animations to EQUI.  :P  I think I'm better off leaving it, that way if there's an update you just lose some graphics instead of losing access to the new window.<br />
<br />
I considered moving the XP/AA to the bottom, but for two reasons I left them.<br />
<br />
1- Although it's pretty close, if I moved the bars you'd have to look at a different point on the screen to check HP than I'm used to.<br />
2- Too lazy to move everything.  :P<br />
