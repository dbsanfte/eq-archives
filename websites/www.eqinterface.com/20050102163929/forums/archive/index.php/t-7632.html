<br />
Can someone plz explain this attribute.  Now you CAN legally play EQ in a window (without using EQWindows)?  Is that what the feature is for?  <br />
<br />
Ive got a problem with it maybe someone on here can help me with.  I run dual monitors on my system.  Two video cards two monitors.  When I try windowed mode, it displays MOST of the EQ screen/window on the primary monitor but a small amount of it shows up on the other screen as well.  This causes THE MOST HORRIBLE LAG ive ever experienced because windows is having to distribute the information through an AGP slot and a PCI slot simultaneously (and lets face it, PCI is trash compared to an AGP).  So, I was wondering if there is a way to resize the window in windowed mode so it will fit totally on one screen (without the obvious disabling the secondary monitor).  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tbigg</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that this is because you have the EQ display attributes set to the the same screen resoultion that you have set for MS Windows.  When running EQ in windowed mode, it adds the typical MS windows frame, which extends the size of the window beyond the limits of what MS Windows can display on one screen.<br />
<br />
Try reducing the EQ resolution and it should fit within one screen.</div></div><hr />

if 1024x768 go with 800x600 (or in my opinion instead raise your windows resolution to 1280x1024 and go with the previous)<br />
1600x1200 users will find 1280x1024 ok, just wish there was a setting halfway between the two.</div></div><hr />
