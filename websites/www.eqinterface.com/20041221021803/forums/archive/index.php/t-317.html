I want to colour his name red, and as he loses HP, it starts draining his HP name and filling it in with white.  HOWEVER, I just CANNOT find the variable that holds your group members name.  There has to be one because the server has to send you his information.  Anyone find this yet?</div></div><hr />

We can put the group member's name in a box.  We can give it a color.  We cannot change this color, and definetly not change only part of the name's color, based on his current HPs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Group Member 1 Name - 30<br />
Group Member 2 Name - 31<br />
Group Member 3 Name - 32<br />
Group Member 4 Name - 33<br />
Group Member 5 Name - 34<br />
<br />
Remember this has to be in a label code.</div></div><hr />

That does not mean I was right. Let him try. If he succeeds it will look cool.  If he fails, oh well.</div></div><hr />

I am all coded out from making my monk special inventory (Copper and Silver Coin with a destroy button in the player window!) so I will try and play with it tomorrow.<br />
<br />
The thing is though, it will probably just turn out as a big bar going through the name since there has to be a static picture.  If SOMEHOW I can get it otherwise great.  If not, scrapping the whole thing because it will look stupid.</div></div><hr />
