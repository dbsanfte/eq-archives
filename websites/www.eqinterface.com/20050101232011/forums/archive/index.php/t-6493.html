<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">02-08-2003, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sort of error happens when you have two different pieces in either two different windows or rarely the same window that have the exact same name.  The way to resolve this is to rename one of the pieces.  You will need to &quot;Replace all&quot; one of the names in the window and see if that fixes your problem.  It also helps to mention what pieces you are using in your UI.</div></div><hr />
