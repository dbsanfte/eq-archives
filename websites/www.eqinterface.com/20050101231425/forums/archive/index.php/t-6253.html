<br />
Well, I have done everything listed here, and I'm still crashing out when I try and zone out or change video modes, or load the default UI when using my custom UI.  If I can make it to the default UI, everything seems to work normally.  I checked on TWolf and Remelio's site for any patches, but there doesn't appear to be any.  As far as I know, theirs are the only mods I'm using.  Any idea what else I can do?  I sent a bunch of information to EQ's tech support, but havn't heard anything since last week.  =(.  Should I try to rename my default directory and run the patch again?  Would that completely reload the default directory?  Argh!  Why couldn't I be blessed with brains instead of being so dang good looking?  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notright</div><div class="date">02-03-2003, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I have the problem fixed.  Earlier in the day I had run the test server patch program, then re-ran the EQ patch server.  This fixed the problem with my default UI settings, and the game worked fine.  Problem was with my custom UIs.  All of them did the same thing.  So, on a lark, I cut and pasted the EQUI.XML file from the default UI directory to each of the custom directories and replaced the existing EQUI.XML file.  That did the trick.  Is this something I'm going to have to do after every patch?  As far as I know I never touched that file in my custom UI folders.  Argh!  Remember when EQ was easy? :p<br />

Sorry, couldn't resist.  ;) I'll resize my sig when I get some free time.  It is very close to the recommended size.  I don't need 10 different sigs to satisfy 10 different board requirements, but I'll do what I can!  :)</div></div><hr />

Then dont use your signature here if you dont want to re-make it. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I removed your signature in a nice silly light hearted manner....  and surely thought you would understand. Then you complain about it and put it back. Did you not think I would not get mad about that? You are makeing more work for me.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry your signature is too large... please just respect our rules and you will have no problems. If you had a forum I would  respect your rules.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notright</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, I've seen some very large images and screenshots in messages on this forum that were much larger than my Sig.  And I didn't put my sig back, I just linked it as an image on ONE message, not in my profile or on all my messages.  It was pretty obvious this was done in the spirit of light hearted banter.  But you couldn't see the humor in that, and apparently can't resist an opportunity to agitate.   Must have been a slow day yesterday.  It was more work for you because you chose to make it so - you could have just chuckled and moved on.  <br />
<br />
Speaking of moving on, if you are done with the chest beating and flexing of your administrative muscles, can we get back to my original post and questions?  I see that in today's patch they list several UI files with the .XML extention (including the EQUI.XML file) - this mean I need to copy these files from my default UI folder to my custom folders?  Or is this for the benifit of the mod programers so they can make appropriate changes to their mods?  Argh!  Where is my Doom CD.... :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your problem, well... not enough information. What UI are you using, it is something you made yourself? A UIErrors.txt file could be really useful in pinpointing the problem.<br />
<br />
All I can make out, is that you are crashing for some reason.. and possibly using a Remelio mod.</div></div><hr />

this mean I need to copy these files from my default UI folder to my custom folders? <br />
<br />
No, absolutely not..<br />
<br />
If you dont have these files in your custom UI then they will pull as they did yesterday from the default folder,<br />
<br />
If you DO have these files, then they were editted by the author of your mod and need to be updated... <br />
<br />
Three Suggestions<br />
<br />
1. Post your UI_Error.txt File (find it in your default EQ folder)<br />
<br />
2. Post what mod your using, and a link to the file here<br />
<br />
3. Always start HERE (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=44) when you have a problem with a UI and HERE (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=36) When a Patch breaks your mod.</div></div><hr />

the bazaar window should simply be deleted from the Vert mod, it was somehow included in a few releases from Vertabrae but was never modified.</div></div><hr />
