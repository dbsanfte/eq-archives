<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meow~</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello! This is what I did and my question will follow : After the most resent patch, I just totally deleted my custom folders and started from scratch. <br />
<br />
I have read 2 different things you can do .. 1st being that you can copy your default folder, rename it, than extract the new mods you would like in that folder. 2nd being that all you need to do is in the new custom folder put the new mods you want, than the rest will be taken from the default folder when needed. So, before the patch I did it the first way, makin a copy of the folder, and clicking Yes to all .. to overwrite the old files, everything worked ok. After the patch, I did it the second way and just put the different mods into the custom folder.<br />
<br />
So, my problem is this .... I got the custom folder working correctly when I logged on. I did the /loadskin newfolder, and it was there. So , after checking out my new UI, I decide to hit the alt D function to bring up my compass, and than BAM!! off to desktop I go.:mad: Of course I try loggin back on, thinking this may be some freak accident or glitch, but now I could not log this char back on, I would hit enter world from the char select screen, and right when I would almost be ingame, boom, back to desktop. I than got p'ed off, deleted the new custom folder again, and finally logged back in under default. <br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong with this new compass thing when trying to use a custom UI. I have all the new files in the default folder from the patch, so I am literally clueless. Please anyone that can, give me some words of wisdom, advice, maybe even a link to an uber UI that is bard friendly that works now after the patch, with easy to read instructions for the computer illiterate as myself! LOL<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading all that ... I tend to type more than probably needed, I just like to get the whole point across, make you feel like you were there, ok i'm done blabbing, thanks again!<br />

<br />
my guess is your new mod is overwriting one of the files that was changed in the last patch.. browse the forums and find the list of what was changed that was posted on weds, see if the file names that changed matches one of the files your using in your mod... if so.. need to figure out what code needs to be added to it.<br />
<br />
once you figure out what file is changing.. then we can tell you what to do to fix it =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meow~</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okies, this is what I did.<br />
<br />
I went back and tried it like I stated in my previous post, first with just the new mods in the custom folder. I logged on, new stuff was there. I hit alt D again, to see if compass would come up, than went strait to desktop again.<br />
<br />
So, I went back to the uifiles folder, made a copy of the default, took and cut the items I had in the first custom folder, than pasted in the new copied folder, renamed it to what my original custom folder was, just to see if I could log back in. I can not :( <br />
<br />
As Kudane stated, yes there were files that had the same names as others in the default folder, but they were the new mods vs. the &quot;old&quot; default mods. That is why i figured when i just cut it afterwards and replaced it, I thought I would have been able to log back in.<br />
<br />
So, now again, I am totally clueless....:confused: <br />
<br />
Maybe I wasn't meant to have a custom UI:rolleyes: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meow~</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I don't know if this would help you Kudane, but this is the list of the new patched files:<br />
<br />
EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_BazaarWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml<br />
EQUI.xml<br />
window_pieces04.tga<br />
EQUI_CompassWnd.xml <br />
<br />
And this is a list of the new mod files I am tryin to use:<br />
<br />
EQUI.xml<br />
EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_Inventory.xml<br />
eor_inv1.jpg<br />
EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml<br />
<br />
I do see that one of the new files,  EQUI.xml , is the same name both for the default, and the new mod, so how do I go about changing this? Also, just out of curiosity, why is it the compass that is makin me crash. Because before I do the alt D command to bring the compass up, it works fine.<br />
<br />
Thank you again :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - continue using your second method... just putting the new files in another folder, then allowing EQ to grab what it needs from the default.<br />
<br />
But the problem is that it changed the EQUI.xml file.  That's the file that tells EQ what to load.  If you'll open that file that belongs with your custom UI up in Notepad (right click on it then choose open with, if it tries to open with Explorer first).  Now scroll to the bottom of the file.  There should be a list of stuff saying: &lt;Include&gt;...an xml file...&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
At the bottom of that list, right under the last &lt;Include&gt;&lt;/Include&gt;, add the line:<br />
&lt;Include&gt;CompassWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
Then when you load, EQ will know it needs to load that window when you load your UI.  And when you hit alt+D again, EQ won't freak out because it's looking for something that doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
That should fix your problem.  :)<br />

<br />
see how EQUI.xml was changed in last patch.... gotta patch the older version (follow her instructions) and it should be all fixed..<br />
