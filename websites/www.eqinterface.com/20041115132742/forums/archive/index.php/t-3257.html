<br />
This is designed to go with the Sars UI 3.01 interface. He built his for 1280x1024 resolution and you can get everything but the group window in at 1024x768. Which happens to be my res...<br />
<br />
This mod will turn the group window horizontal and I put it right above the chat windows near the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
If there's intrest, I'll do some work on this and make it stand-alone.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Posted this where it's supposed to be... links updated<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Tested with Sars 3.1a and it works fine <br />

<br />
Would it be too much for you to check if you could adapt it to her UI? It would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyste</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm...<br />
<br />
Would you like that as a long bar, like the long compass window across the bottom of her UI? Or a shorter bar like the one I did for the Sars UI that you can position in multiple spots? ( That one really is only about 500 pixles wide, you have all kinds of space even at 1024x768 )<br />
<br />
Could do it either way... the long one is probably more in keeping with her scheme tho.<br />
<br />
BTW, that's a beautiful UI!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jahari Durden</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay.. The way I have it set up is simple.. I got the Spellcasting window on the left, the actions and hotkey/inventory window on the right. Those are the smaller versions which are posted in that same thread.<br />
<br />
What would be ideal is for the bar to fit in between those two things, basically in the space where I have my chatwindows as well. This way I could make the chatwindows slightly higher to accomodate for your bar.<br />
<br />
Please tell me any info you'd need for this. I did a quick check in the XML files but I couldn't find any reliable digits that'd be the exact width of those three windows, but if you'd point me to where those would be, I could add them up for ya and give you an exact number of what the desired / ideal width for your group-bar would be.<br />
<br />
If you'd need screenies, I'd be more than happy to supply those as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the effort!<br />
<br />
 Looking at your screenie I realise this is kind of a long shot, but.. If at all possible, could you add the F2 to F6 labels somewhere as well? I used Quartz before and they greatly helped me with assists and such. Just saves you that split second in which you need to figure out which button to press. :) No problem if you can't, but hey.. It -would- be sweet. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
A screenshot would be perfect, draw a circle around where you want the bar and I'll measure out the pixles.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback :):</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyste</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jahari, looks easy enough... I'll do that one up tonight or tomorrow night, depending on time. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyste</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jahari, I just downloaded the new Cairenn mod to Kao's UI... have you looked at it? Looks like you were using the last one, judging by the numbers in your group-box... this one is a LOT smaller.<br />
<br />
Which one are you going to use? And do you still want a horizontal group box at all?<br />
<br />
I REALLY like this new one. It's tiny, but it's NICE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jahari Durden</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cairenn's new work indeed is rather cool, but if you could spare the time, I'd really appreciate the horizontal group window.. I have some plans for my current layout in which I'd quite need it.. If you get around doing it, I'll get you a screenie of what my UI looks with with the  changes I have in mind as well as your bar. :)<br />
<br />
Would be much appreciated mate! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there a version of your horizontal window that has the F-Key labels yet?<br />
<br />
Also, Would it be difficult to have a verion without the Invite/Disband buttons? <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

In case you missed it, Fyste. :) Would still be much, much appreciated if you could spare the time. :)</div></div><hr />
