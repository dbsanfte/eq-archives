<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soes</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 04:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about adding a quick entry comment system to the downloads section, where we can use our forum login to post comments underneath individual downloads. Not every file in the database has a forum thread ;)<br />
<br />
Edit - Oh yeah.. ratings too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liek this idea, but I can see where having the smaller comments area will end up being used as a &quot;help, I can't get this to work&quot; area instead of people posting there help requests in the proper forums.<br />
<br />
If this does happen, I'd like the comments to be approved by moderators before being posted or have the comment area actuallly a seperate area that does not show initially.  Have a line that is a link that says &quot;Comments&quot; and shows the number of comments, where when you click it the comments appear.  Like Neowin has for its headlines.<br />
<br />
I've been on other boards where these kinds of comment areas have been abused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Comments and voting/rating are both &quot;bad ideas&quot; in terms of resources and return on investments. <br />
<br />
Voting leads to ballot-stuffing.  And it's one more thing to Database and display.  <br />
<br />
Comments end up being used for everything except reviews.   Again, more database space and bandwidth used for little gain.</div></div><hr />
