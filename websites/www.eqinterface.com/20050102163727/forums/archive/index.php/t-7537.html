I am tring to load the Blue Quartz new.zip ui... However everytime i follow the process, only thing that loads is the compass.. I read the FAQ and followed it detail for detail... Heres what i did, made a new folder, named it quin...all lower case... did not touch the default dir... downloaded ui to my folder, then unzipped it... Now I have tried a couple things at this point... After I unzipped, the unzipped folder was still in there, so I tried it that way, only compass loaded, so i deleted the zip folder, only compass loaded, lol... I tried to do this many moons ago, but i was runnin into this problem back then too... I hope yall can help alittle gal out... thanks =).. if it matters, i am runnin win xp....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qool</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you download a UI, the author could have zipped it in ones of two ways:<br />
<br />
1st - all the files were just zipped<br />
<br />
2nd - all the files were zipped under a directory<br />
<br />
What this means is this: Here is your everquest directory:<br />
<br />
\everquest\uifiles<br />
<br />
In here is the default directory:<br />
<br />
\everquest\uifiles\default<br />
<br />
So if you made a directory called &quot;quin&quot; the contents of the \everquest\uifiles directory should contain<br />
<br />
default<br />
quin<br />
<br />
Now, if your skin was zipped in the fist way and you unzipped the file into that directory, it would look like this:<br />
<br />
\everquest\uifiles\quin<br />
<br />
file1<br />
file2<br />
file3<br />
file4<br />
etc, etc, etc<br />
<br />
However, if the files are zipped into a directory... it will look like this... pay attention to the \directory structure.<br />
<br />
\everquest\uifiles\quin\quin<br />
<br />
file1<br />
file2<br />
file3<br />
file4<br />
etc, etc, etc<br />
<br />
This means all the files are now under another directory. So when you type /load quin in everquest, it looks in the \everquest\uifiles\quin directory and sees nothing because the files are acutally in the \everquest\uifiles\quin\quin diretory.<br />
<br />
All you have to do is move the files from \everquest\uifiles\quin\quin to the \everquest\uifiles\quin directory.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind i do not know your drive or folder names here and I am using examples. The \\ stuff may not match your system exactly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

You need to have Quartz 1.6 already installed.</div></div><hr />
