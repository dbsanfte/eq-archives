<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nerill</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to install &quot;everymod.zip&quot;<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=337<br />
<br />
I have tried a couple of different ones. I basically want a buff window that is smaller and has the text of the buff next to the icon.<br />
<br />
I can't seem to get any of them to work. When I go into EQ the default UI loads. I try the /loadskin command and I get my custom UI windows back up but I still see my old buff window.<br />
<br />
I am installing the files to my custom UI folder in C:\Program Files\EverQuest\uifiles\myui<br />
<br />
Is there some trick needed to get these types of buff windows to work ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=50<br />
<br />
and when that one didnt work I tried this one:<br />
<br />
http://eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=350<br />
<br />
Where it differs from his problem is that when type /loadskin, I get the default UI, everything default.<br />
<br />
I am installing mine to  C:\Program Files\EverQuest\uifiles\Custom<br />
<br />
Just wondering if anyone else is having the same problem as us, and how to get it to work :)<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

You need to have the files from the custom buff and short duration buff windows in the same directory as the rest of your UI.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenardo</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the reason why its not working is there is an equi_animations file there that is OUT OF DATE - what you need to do is look at the default equi_animations, compare it to the custom one and put anything that is in the default and not in the custom, into the custom.<br />
<br />
and every patch where they modify the equianimations file, you will have to do the same thing all over again.<br />
<br />
or even better i just noticed he has an animations changes file there... open that and open the default equi_animations file, copy whats in the changes file into the default and save to your custom</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santheb</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any way to put that in a bit more simple terms?  Hehe thank you for all your help everyone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenardo</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the equi_animations that comes with that buff box is BAD since soe changed it recently thus it will not WORK..<br />
<br />
what you do is they have a animation changes file<br />
<br />
open that there is CODE listed there highlight and copy to clipboard<br />
<br />
open the DEFAULT equi_animations.xml file<br />
<br />
PASTE that information  you copied into the equi_animations file at the bottom but before the last line closing the file<br />
<br />
save it to your custom ui folder and it now SHOULD work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santheb</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where is the code?  Like will it be at the very beginning?<br />
<br />
Have a feeling its this...&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;us-ascii&quot; ?&gt;<br />
<br />
But I have no clue.<br />
<br />
Anyway I tried this one too..http://eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=350<br />
<br />
Didnt have an animation file in it but when I loaded it into the OceanSpray folder and did /loadskin it took a realllly long time and then EQ crashed saying it couldnt find the xml file.<br />
<br />
The log is here<br />
<br />
