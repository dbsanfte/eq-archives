<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinkfu</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is going to be a app, that popsup when your character enters the world, it will give you a D3D window for 30 seconds over the game which right now says &quot; a New patch has been detected on the sony patching servers, Do you wish to patch?&quot; and I have it partially able to tell me what kind of files it will be patching, but that part is not 100%<br />
<br />
The whole point of this is you can be in the game let the patcher run, and another D3D window will appear asking &quot;Do you wish to initilize the patch?&quot; all that will do is request you zone and then it overwrites the files in your EQdirectory with the new ones, and jolts the Eqgame.exe, effectivly tricking it into thinking you have just shutdown the game, patched, and reloaded it...<br />
<br />
Right now the app is buggy and unstable on live servers, but it works somewhat well on test.  The loading time if you zone to a new zone has been increased from (on my system) 10 seconds to 34 seconds, and if I gate to my bindpoint in the same zone it is increased from 6 seconds to 22 seconds.<br />
