<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take a look in your error file and see what's wrong.<br />
<br />
Everquest\UIError.txt<br />
<br />
Did you copy them streight over from the Invetory window? Might be conflicting names. You can't have more than one Item= name.<br />
<br />
Or, it could just be a syntax error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aalwein</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i will check that thanks.<br />
<br />
one more question: can you remove the &quot;chat bars&quot; from chat windows?  so you have just the chat text and not that bar you actually type in.<br />
<br />
edit: check UIerrors... yep was using duplicate names</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think enough people need to /feedback it. It's stuck on, and no way to remove it, side from moving your chat window below the window bottom.<br />
<br />
Of course, that's if you have your chat window at the bottom of the screen, unlike myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koplal</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No i believe if you mess with the chat windows anchors in the xml file you can make it so you can resize the bottom of the chat window to cut off the text typeing field. I did something similar with the done button in my spell book today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh? /ponders .. Never tried it myself, but that seemed to be the original general consencise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koplal</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if you are familar with layers when designing graphics, but it was like the done button was on a different layer then the spellbook and i could move it around and place where ever i wanted without moving anything else including the other buttons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have all about layers. hehe .. THe Done button is actually set with an offset ancor, thus one I found and modified. :)<br />
<br />
And looking at the Chat window, that is too.<br />
<br />
There might very well be a way to remove it, or atleast hide it. Although, do note, hiding it in the XML file calls will completely remove it from your UI. There isn't any way to get it back by hitting 'Enter', like the old UI.<br />
<br />
THis will also mean that there will be no way to tell if you've accidentally hit 'Enter' and you're really typing a big line of 14123121213314 instead of actually attacking. :)<br />
<br />
I'm not 100% sure how to do this w/out moding the UI myself, and requires loading up EQ and all, suckage.<br />
But locate the &lt;Editbox&gt; in the EQUI_ChatWindow.xml file. In there you'll see a number of &lt;**AnchorOffset&gt; Tags. I would start by making them some neg numbers.<br />
<br />
The Main chat window is set to autostretch, and I think this is border to border only. So, it shouldn't auto stretch off screen if you move the cat bar way way down, off window.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koplal</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps there is a way to make it so you cant type in it ie. lock it some how or make it only type to a channel that isnt there like make it only respond to tell target and then relog or something so you dont have a tell target but because you are still set to only talk in that channel it might not let you type since you have no tell target. i don't know just a thought. <br />
<br />
<br />
hehe kinda confusing :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ha .. That ability is the on UI itself. Unfortunatly, the one ChatWindow.xml file effects all chat windows created, including your main chat window.<br />
<br />
What you do to the one file effects them all.<br />
<br />
But, there is a way to make the Main WIndow the only &quot;chat&quot; typeable window, and a way to make only X window use spacific channels only.<br />
<br />
Just right-click on the titles to see all the features.</div></div><hr />
