I've noticed that when in attack mode, you get what I suppose is a suprise, hehe...;)  But haven't noticed any others yet, so will probably be watching my UI later today while playing. <br />
Only thing that I'm having slight issue with is the visibility on the casting gauge...while twisting, I rely on that heavily for when to twist to the next song (no macros for me, hehe...not reliable, and too used to my older version of song twisting to change). Is there a way to make the casting gauge darker that I can do on my own? Going to also try to download one from T King's website I think, but have no idea where I would put it. :p <br />
Once again, great work! :D</div></div><hr />

What colour would you like the casting gauge to be?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the folder you should see a file called UI_Name_server.ini<br />
<br />
Rename it to your character name and server name, so it looks like:<br />
<br />
UI_Cairenn_eci.ini (as an example)<br />
<br />
Drop that into your main EQ directory.  It'll ask if you want to overwrite your existing file ... say yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, I customize it a bit by shrinking one chat window and add a third.  I then put all my chats (Guild, Group, Raid, Chat channels) into it.<br />
<br />
Problem is:<br />
<br />
1) No matter what I do, I can get the new chat window to resize.  I even gone into the UI file and located it and changed the height of the window.  Nothing changes.<br />
2) Again, no matter what is done, I can close that chat window.  I can bring the pop up menu, but, the option to close is not available.<br />
<br />
Help?!?!?</div></div><hr />

I found one. Or I thought I did, until you told me it was a mistake.<br />
<br />
So, what other surprises should we be on the outlook for?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelias</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, downloaded and started installing this tonight... haven't actually used it to fight with yet, so take my comments with a dragon sized grain of salt.  ^^<br />
<br />
I missed a help TXT file.  Not that the UI was hard to set up, but just something to explain the different options.<br />
<br />
Once I got in game, the very first thing that kind jumped out at me was that the right sidebar equipment list kinda blends into the background... you might wanna put some sorta solid neutral behind it so that it stands out better.  The main viewport window is slightly larger, and overall I had a sense that everything was even better organized than in the original Cairenn UIs.<br />
<br />
I like the new, smaller inventory... though I'd still like to see one that is just buttons and coin as an option.  The redundancy, especially where I've placed my inventory in the bottom right of the viewport, of having two bag inventories just feels kinda odd still.  Aside from that, the inventory is something that i'd been missing, neat, clean and small enough that it doesn't block the entire view when it pops up.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, cool looking as the new spell book looks, it was one of the first things that I replaced with a smaller book.  This is mostly me, but it's also because I swap spells a lot in fights, and a small spell book really helps because you can see how far the MoB your sit agro is dragging toward you is.  Yours is a great design, but it was just too big for my tastes.<br />
<br />
One of the things I always had problems with your original UI was that the buff bars were in the main viewport, and I'd forever be trying to click on something through it and wondering why my target wasn't showing up.  Kudos on moving the buffs to the top edge of the screen, where they are visible while still being outta the way.  ^_^  Kinda miss the mp3 player, though... oh well, can't have it both ways, and I'd rather have the buff bar outta the way than an always visible mp3 player.<br />
<br />
The spell gem bar is another of the nice, and neat little pieces, and fits in perfectly with the theme.  Kept this one.  ^^<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if I like the new 'Target Dragon' yet...  The fact that it shows con color is great, but it seemed kinda awkward in the middle of the screen like that, so I stacked it on top of the spell gem bar instead, along the bottom left corner of the screen.  The pattern fits with the gem bar as well as it did with the group/self info bars, so another kudos there for excellent re-arrangement capability.<br />
<br />
My main is a ranger, so I like the hybrid combat abilities bar, though as I mentioned above, I switched the position of the gem bar and the combat bar just because I was used to my spells on the left side.<br />
<br />
I did run into trouble with the chat window bug...  when I tried opening a new chat window, it appears at the very bottom of the screen, with the text input off the bottom edge... Might wanna look into that - along the same lines, is it a bug or by design that more than half of the windows have their 'close' option grayed out?<br />
<br />
The Map window was the second window I outright replaced... it's just far, far too big, even in the full size viewport, much less one that's been made smaller.<br />
<br />
I like the new self information bar, but I'd very much like to see a return of the healing spheres for the rest of the group in the little group box, as they came in very handy in my guild - the flashing red always drew my attention in enough time to retarget and heal while our cleric rattled off a C Heal - bear in mind that I haven't actually tried the UI out in a group, so if they're there when you're actually IN a group, my appologies in advance.  ^^<br />
<br />
The 'YES' and 'NO' buttons on the pet caster bar are a little vague...  funny, once you realize what they are, but vague, and while not many people actually click on them, the extra time it takes to find the right button might for some people be time they don't have.   Also, I wish that the pet get lost button were clearly marked and seperated from the rest like it was in the old UI... I can foresee panic clicking problems with it as is.<br />
<br />
The bright, flashing 'ATTACK!' that appears when auto attack is on is a great idea, specially for a dumb ranger like me that some times forgets to turn it on.  ^_^;;;<br />
<br />
I do agree with what Tyndylla said... the cast time bar is too obscure to be made out till the spell is almost done casting...  maybe place it to the right of the mana gauge, in what appears to be empty space between it and the spellbook icon?  Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Overall - I'll post a followup message when I actually get in and get some battle and group experience in on the UI, but it looks great so far and as solid as your other UIs.  Most of my problems have stemmed from personal preferences and pet peeves, though the chat window bug and the cast time bar have the potential to cause problems in a raid setting where things are hectic and the wrong spell at the wrong time or a raid instruction lost to battle spam can cause serious destruction.<br />
<br />
One random thought - perhaps a vertical version of the spell gem bar as a choice?  Some people like to be able to see their Alt-Spell Labels.  <br />
<br />
In any case, it does look great overall, and very much up to the standard I've come to respect in your work.  Congratulations on a job well done thus far.<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Ok, now that I've gotten some group experience, I've come up with two things to add - first and foremost, the group HP percentage number is next to impossible to read with it inside the HP gauge, at least for me... It might be different for other people.<br />
<br />
Second - I like the idea of the Invite/Disband buttons popping up only when there's an open invitation... except that the buttons didn't work for me when I tried clicking on it.  Again, that might just be my own inept usage, but it's something worth noting.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, another excellent UI.  ^^<br />

allo im pretty new here, love this ui! this may sound somewhat noobish  and i may be missing something, can anyone tell me how i get my mana bar to show up? im not seeing it anywhere, also if i dl soem new spell icons, how do i get them to show up instead of the odl ones as well? thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelias</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thohrn - the mana bar is in the spell gem window, and you have to copy it into the main UI folder from the 'spellcastbar' folder under the main UI folder.  Just copy it in and you're good to go.<br />
<br />
As for the new spell icons, just extract them into the UI folder, overwriting if you have to, and they'll be automatically loaded the next time you start up EQ, or when you do a '/loadskin (ui folder name here) 1'<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyndylla</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have replaced alot of stuff on this UI to make it more functional for me. Everything I have plugged into this UI has had no problems working, and all was found here at eqinterface.com.<br />
Because I am a bard and switch Primary/Secondary on the fly alot, I snagged a container mod with those slots in the tops of the bags. I added T King's spell icons and class animation, a smaller map window, tradeskill UI mod...and the neat little bard epic cursor (which, coincidentally, makes it tons easier for me to target stuff now, hehe). Also I added the T King Arcane casting gauge right above the player name and title. I am used to adding to UI mods to get the functionality and look I want. And now that someone has mentioned it, I have also tried to change background color to a darker shade so I can see the inventory item slots better, but it didn't work.:p <br />
The wonderful thing about this UI is you have the versatility to switch things around to your liking and it doesn't break the UI when you do it. Here's a screenie of what it looks like for me...gems are T King Version 2.5, silver filigree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is completely &quot;usable&quot; in it's current format in higher resolutions, just the border pieces won't all line up to form a continuious rectangle around the &quot;viewable&quot; portion of the screen.<br />

Not what you wanted to hear, I know. =/</div></div><hr />

No matter what i do my very last buff slot is allways partially hidden and it WILL NOT let me click any buffs off that i have there. this is a huge problem as alot of time my weapons are procing useless buffs on me that i cant click off to make room for mgb heals while on raids, anyoen else having this problem or have a fix for it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
and, well, one more question....  what are these &quot;surprises&quot;?  3 days using the UI and havent come across any others besides the attack flashing thingy (which i assume is a surprise)....  heh, it's killing me wanting to know.</div></div><hr />
