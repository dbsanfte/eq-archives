At the very least, to be able to display whether or not a mob/npc was KoS or not.  If SoE were to give us the flexibility for the indicator to recognize faction leves, we'd be able to come up with some pretty neat things.  (ie: spiked rings if the mobs was KOS, circles if indiff, and another texture for kindly/ally)<br />
<br />
just a thought at least.<br />

<br />
They hate you. (Scowl, Glare)<br />
They don't care about you. (Apprehensive, Indiffierent)<br />
They like you. (Amiable, Kindly, Warmly, Ally)</div></div><hr />
