I decided that the melee need a little eye candy too. So I've gone ahead and made a warrior based inventory mod. A LOT of experimenting went into this, but I'm fairly happy with the end result so far. May still tweak this some, but it looks okay for you folks to check out for yourselves at this point.<br />

Click here to download this mod (http://br.crashed.net/~ink/files/tt_inventory.zip)<br />
<br />
Enjoy... and please... LOTS of feedback on this so I can improve it more before I officially release it.<br />
<br />
Inspiration for this mod came from seeing a techno design that xlorepdarkhelm did at some point. No code or graphics from xlorepdarkhelm's mod were used, just the inspiration. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is absolutely stunning!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ReallyLongTypist</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incredible.<br />
<br />
Absolutely, incredible.<br />
<br />
Here's what I like about it, so you know what to keep:<br />
<br />
1. All the information is logically placed. Meaning, I don't have to go searching around my inventory screen just to find what I need in terms of HP, AC, exp, hell even my name if I'm a moron (;) )... that in and of itself makes it a useful inventory. Here's what makes it a great one:<br />
<br />
2. The concept of the junction of visual information ques with necessary interaction: AKA - the lines coming from the body part to the inventory slot. At first it helps you get accustomed to using the inventory, and later will help you visually grasp what you need to interact with. Its the reason I like using both the numerical and graphical representation of my HP... it gives me a good idea what I'm looking at *quickly*.<br />
<br />
3. Its relatively compact considering the artistic merit it has achieved. There's no 'fluff', everything looks like it is where it should be, and while there is 'empty space' between different 'objects', the space is transparent... meaning while maybe larger than a 'mini' inventory, it won't completely obstruct your vision, and may even be slightly less obtrusive than even the tiniest of inventories.<br />
<br />
4. Artistically speaking, I think there can be no doubt, it is quite appealing to the eye.<br />
<br />
I like it, and I explained why :)<br />
<br />
Personally, assuming all the XML is working properly, I think by rights you could release this now.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the only thing you could change from what I can see is the destroy button... I'd put it maybe in the upper right hand corner. The only reason is that the destroy button makes me nervous when its so close to other commonly pressed buttons like AA and 'Done'. But thats really minor.<br />
<br />
Definately a 'ten naner' :nana:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously tho... quite visually impressive. <br />
<br />
Certainly the most creative inventory mod I've seen thus far. Altho, I wouldn't mind seeing a more compact version of this, perhaps something without the stats and ID info. But as is... well done.<br />

I would change only one thing, and that is switching around the bracer and gloves slots on the arm on the left.<br />

A magnificent piece of art. Keep it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it wouldn't be too much work, maybe you could alter at least the image slightly to either suit other classes or to be more generic in nature? I'm currently using t.king's inventory but my UI's a mess of all sorts of things for as long as he isn't releasing a full UI.. This window might just be really cool on some of my characters. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it looks awsome I like it alot I would want to use it.  Only 1 problem I have is it is a Barbarian Warrior picture in the Middle.  Is it possible to get probably one of the fewest played Race Class combo in all of Norath is the Gnome Warrior.  I know Gnomes are warriors?  Isn't that like Military Inteligence?  Well I play a Female Gnome Warrior on Tarrew Marr.  I would love to see if it is possible to get diffrent Races in the player window.  Or if possible explain to us how we may put our own picture in their.<br />

Thanks it looks awsome.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dillomjm</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice mod man, very nice.  Its good to see someone doing something a little different than the tried and true rectangle windows.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh and btw .. you have the glove and bracer position flipped backwards on the left side.. IE you have the bracer line running to the guy's hand and the glove running to the guy's forearm.<br />
<br />
<br />
And to the person above who asked about changing the image from a barbarian to something else:<br />
You'd have to open the tt_inventory.tga file and edit it to look how you want.  (basically to get it to look like it does with the barb you'd need some skill in a program such as photoshop)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow!! First I have to thank you all! I've been thinking about my inventory design for a little bit and it's good to know my efforts are paying off. :)<br />
<br />
Okay... now for the fixes, changes, etc.<br />
<br />
Bracer and hand switched on the right arm... yep... absolutely true... that is definately off :)... I'll get that fixed.<br />
<br />
a good portion of the &quot;Character Stone&quot; is actually a &quot;Auto Equip&quot; area. This is to further help getting used to where I thought things should be. But that bracer / hands thing... well heheh I attribute that to being tired. :)<br />
<br />
Graphicly speaking I'd say this is about 90% done. There is a LOT of graphical tweaking I plan on doing with this... from refining the graphics themselves to moving things a little here and there.<br />
<br />
Action buttons... &quot;Done&quot; &quot;Destroy&quot; &quot;Alt-ADV&quot; and &quot;Skills&quot;... Yes... I know.. I didn't place them where I wanted. The fact of the matter is that it was one of the last things I put on and the current placement was dropped there for the &quot;beta&quot; of this thing. My current thoughts is to place the &quot;destroy&quot; button in the lower right, just above the weight... (I thought putting it near the copper would be nice as well as moving it away from the other buttons so it's not used &quot;accidently&quot;.<br />
<br />
The topic I KNEW was coming... the character image. I first chose to work with a barbarian warrior because... well... I am one. :)<br />
<br />
My plan is to make this more universally addaptable. I thought I would first make it for my Main though... then make some other version that fits more people for release (or find some suitable design that allows for more races).<br />
<br />
There is another slight problem... The actual holders for the items (circles surrounding the gem) contain little pictures of the character gem with the part of the body shown that the item will fall on. I was thinking it might just be better for the sake of changing the main character silloette that these be more &quot;generic&quot; in nature. Will add some time to the design... but I want to refine this thing until it's exactly right. :) I was thinking some kind of &quot;symbol&quot; system for those. and perhaps making the background inside them more transparent. This will come with time as this is a work in progress. :)<br />
<br />
Down side to making it more &quot;Non-race/gender&quot; sepecific is that I think it takes away from the overall design. I personally enjoy seeing a silloette of my character in there, however  I also know others would like that same joy. Lucky for us all, when I built this thing I made that pretty easily replaced... The one big problem I have is the &quot;eye guides&quot;... they go over the gem and point to various parts of the body. This may be the biggest problem in changing the character gem.<br />
<br />
The upside is I can make multiple versions of this for each of the classes / races. Changing gem color for the different races or something? (gem color is VERY easily changed as well).<br />
<br />
I'll most likely be posting a updated version of this later today. Thanks for all your feedback and DEFINATELY keep it up! The more you tell me what's not right about it... the more I learn and the better I get! A very valueble thing indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ReallyLongTypist</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno... I don't play a barbarian at all... for any of my classes... but personally, I'd like a version with the setup you have... I love to have the 'line leads' directly to the actual part of the body they correspond to...<br />
<br />
...if you do change it, if you could leave an old version available *with* the barbarian in it...<br />
<br />
Only other thing I can think of is that since all the 'main' character information is on the left, I would place the 'weight' on the left instead of the right where it is currently... in other words, I'm more often pre-occupied with how much I'm encumbered (if at all) than with how much exact pp I have on my character...</div></div><hr />

As far as the character silloute goes, how bout doing something similar to Abbitor's, which let's you insert a screesshot of your own character?</div></div><hr />

Thats a nice inventory though. Going to use it for sure. :nana: <br />

Nibbuhlz made the original design of the inventory, however the one I've just finished for the Beastlord UI, while simmilar in design, has my own graphics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done some minor tweaking to this mod today. The screenshot in my first post has been updated to reflect the new changes. Here are the changes so far (more to come later):<br />
<br />
1. Brightened the colors of the mod. I first saved it a little too dark I think.<br />
<br />
2. Switched the Bracer and Hands icons (they were accidently placed wrong in the first version).<br />
<br />
3. Moved the stat numbers to a more &quot;flowing&quot; kind of form. I think this improves it a lot.<br />
<br />
4. Changed the way the way the HP and AC and ATK is positioned. Didn't like it scrunched.<br />
<br />
Thats about it for this version... I'll be making more updates but thought that those of you using the mod already may want these things fixed.<br />
<br />
Thanks much for your support and feedback! Keep it coming! :)</div></div><hr />

How about something that will match our Dragon spellbooks?<br />
Another dragaon perhaps? or maybe some other medival creature/thing/place?  Just my 2cents!  Love your work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My current plan/idea involves a LOT of work and design... what I'm thinking of doing is finding a person who fits the classic &quot;look&quot; of each gender of each race. This is not the easiest thing in the world to do. As an example... the barbarian in this version is obviously male... but... he has no weapons in hand. He could be any number of differnt classes. Soon I will do a female barb version... then human male, human female, dwarf, gnome, troll, etc.... This would require a LOT... I mean A LOT of versions... but I think that is the only way to really modify this interface to please all the different race/class/gender people?<br />

<br />
Very Very nice!  I don't have the best eyes so something that looks so clean and smooth is just beautiful to me!  Well done indeed!  I don't have any ideas that haven't already been said i don't think hehehe...  <br />
<br />
Couple questions though:  would you be able to post a screenshot that shows the whole eq screen, so one could get an idea of the size ratio?  Also, what resolution do you use, and would this be compatable for all resolution options?  <br />
<br />
=)  ooooooooo ok yes i do have ideas hehe...  I think it would be good for anyone not just tanks hehehe but that's my opinion LOL...  but ya know...  i would think a matching spell gem bar would be sweet /GRIN... (got a bard and a clr in addition to a monk hehe)...  You know, totally transparent except for nice smooth round gem holders that maybe match the look of your nice smooth glass looking buttons on the inventory?  /drool!   hehe absolutely beautiful work you've done...   oooooooo and maybe both a horizontal version of said spell bar and a vertical one?  I use horizontal for my bard now but vertical for the clr hehe =P    i think you should do a complete set in the inventory style you did....   Hehehehe i know that would be a ton and a half of work i just think it would be beautiful and clean and aerodynamic looking in a way...  =)  (almost like looking at the dash of a really luxurious sports care hehehe)   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ReallyLongTypist</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thrangor, if you really want to please everyone, I think the only way to do it is to do as you suggested yourself - one for every class/gender combination...<br />
<br />
To be honest, though, I think thats a bit more work than is necessary for this to look good...<br />
<br />
If I were in your position, I'd just do a female high elf to represent the 'female' version (high elf to add some variety... easily could be troll or ogress ;) ), and start working on another mod...<br />
<br />
I think the point is, don't get burned out fulfilling every possible customization everyone wants on just one mod... do what you really want to do :)<br />
<br />
P.S. No I don't even have a single barbarian male or high elf female character, so there's no question of bias here... I just don't want to see our best UI'ers burdened with the menial task of catering to every customization asked of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as making it more appealing to all classes/races, you could just use a human male and female silhouette... (tho, I'd love to have a dark elf... heh.... but that's a bit biased)  Those two would probably satisfy most people.<br />
<br />
Whatever you decide, i'm going to use it!  heh<br />

And I think thats the deciding factor into how deep you should go into personalizing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yeah, and I think whatever you want to do with the design to make it more &quot;customizable&quot; is fine. Could also be that I'm a male barbarian too LOL. :)<br />
<br />
A suggestion though. Those icons in the equipment slots look kind of strange. Maybe make them more recognizable? No offense but I see 5 helms in different possitions for each part on the head. :(<br />
<br />
Awesome though, I'm putting it in my mod right now :nana:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cragzak</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Small suggestion... ok, I LOVE this mod, but the only thing that kinda bothers me is the way the inventory is set up.  I'm just too used to having it setup with two rows, so having them all in one line is freakin me out!  So I would suggest that you bring the bottom 4 slots up next to the top 4 slots (hence being put into 2 curved rows) and then moving the Melee Weapon slots in closer to the middle (where you just took the inventory slots from).  This would still work nicely, and would help us people that don't like to adjust the feel of the game... just the look of it. :)<br />
<br />
But if you don't wanna... I can TRY to figure it out... but I'm not too hot at figuring out locations on things. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had considered making the inventory two rows but decided against it. The reason I decided against it is that the inventory was never ordered &quot;correctly&quot; in my eyes for the original interface. So I decided to make one row of 8 instead of one row of 1-4 and one of 5-8. Just didn't seem right the other way. Still in the process of working this out... <br />
<br />
I have to say... I'm VERY glad to find that none of my mods caused the interface to fail with today's patch. Although I've been fielding UI support from tons of people in my guild all day... though I've come to expect this after a patch with UI files. Always seems to happen. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically I got rid of all the stats, as I have all that im my player window, I moved the bags to the left side, and brought the coins, buttons, weight listing, and melee slots closer in, then cropped it. <br />
<br />
I'm also enjoying your spellcast window, but I am having trouble getting the gems to fill in correctly. Perhaps another place i will find info on it.<br />
<br />
VERY nice work on the inventory btw.</div></div><hr />

The zip contains the original pic (stats, etc still there) with the 2 row main inventory instead of a single long row. I had to shrink the primary/secondary/range/ammo slots to fit it this way. There is no sample screenie, as I don't plan on using this version.</div></div><hr />

Lol, did I come across as sounding demanding?  Well I certainly didn't mean to!  Anyways, thanks a BUNCH for putting this together for me... I'm gonna go check it out right now!  I'll tell ya what I think! :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to make a suggestion on the personalized graphic in the middle.  Maybe you could just add one extra graphic file (jpg or tga) to the zip that is just the sphere with dots at the edges that shows the location of the lines to each inv. slot.  That way someone could edit that picture with an image of their own character and add in the lines to each part.  That would save you a lot of time creating one for each race/class.  Then that file could be saved with the proper name to be displayed in game.<br />
<br />
Also wanted to say that this is a great looking window.  :p</div></div><hr />

I suggest using the single row version until I have a chance to finish the modifications to my version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cragzak</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey bro, I'm glad to hear that you're making an official 2 row inventory version.  Just thought I would let you know that I noticed in your original version (I'm pretty sure anyways, cuz I have been using the 2 row one made by the other guy - but I don't think he messed with the items you are currently wearing) you have the bracers and earrings on the opposite sides, the right bracer is on the left and the right earring is on the left and vice versa (not sure if you did this on purpose to match the picture of the character in the middle or not though).  But anyways, if you didn't mean to do it that way, just letting ya know that that's the way it is set up.  If you did do it that way on purpose I can certainly understand why and it's easy to swap on yer own if one would rather it the original EQ way.  But figured I'll let ya know so you don't have to fix it later in case it's an accident.  Keep up the nice work and I'm looking forward to the 2 row inventory... been checkin everyday for an update :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe... Well the idea is that it's in relation to the character pic you're looking at. He's facing you... so his right hand is on the left side of the picture and vice versa. :) Otherwise I'd have to show the character facing away from you... and who wants to look at a big barbarian butt. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pheonixheart</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOLOLOL!<br />
<br />
...stage left...  ....stage right...  heh heh heh =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durnitol</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry about that. Thangor has done a really terrific job with this artwork, I'm just &quot;the other guy&quot; who VERY crudely butchered his creation as a quick fix. For that I have no shame. I'm not bein sarcastic here, my graphic artist talent is next to zero. My ability to take what other people have created and suit it to my own needs is far from insignificant, however. <br />
<br />
This work is thangor's and no one elses. If anyone asks you what this mod is, you should reply &quot;Thangor created this awesome looking skin and some guy named Dern or somethin altered it a smidgen&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
In any case, here is the fix:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay guys... I've completely revamped this sucker. It is QUITE a bit different code and graphics wise (in a way)... Here's what's changed.<br />
<br />
Due to needing to expand the mod out a few pixels, I exceded the 512 pixel distance... so I needed to expand the image but didn't want to take it straight to 1024 (the next power of 2)... <br />
<br />
So... what I did was broke the image into 6 parts... each part is 256x256. Now this would seem to make the whole thing too big memory wise... BUT!! I've also changed the file format from TGA to PNG. This greatly reduced file size (and in turn memory used) for this mod. The TGA 6 file version was 1.5 meg... This version is about 300k. :) ... that's an 80% reduction of memory used for this mod. :)<br />
<br />
You'll notice (from the screenshot on page one of this thread) that the &quot;barbarian&quot; is no longer a &quot;barbarian&quot;... I've made a rough &quot;human&quot; shape that should suffice for enough people that I don't think a new version will be required.<br />
<br />
Next... since I changed the graphic of the guy... armor slots have been moved to more intuitive positions.<br />
<br />
Primary, Secondary, Range, and Ammo have been moved to below the &quot;gem&quot; to make room for the two row inventory slots.<br />
<br />
Primary, Secondary, Range, and Ammo all now show the first letter as the &quot;icon&quot; (AKA: P = Primary, S=Secondary... etc).<br />
<br />
Inventory slots are labeled 1-8 with a number.<br />
<br />
Destroy button was moved to the lower right hand corner.<br />
<br />
Skills, Alt-Advance, and Done buttons were arranged slightly different on the left side.<br />
<br />
Alternate advancement's percentage bubble now actually contains the percentage.<br />
<br />
With ALL that said... hehe I think this mod is just about ready for release in the download section. Please give it a go and give me your latest opinions on the new update... please let me know if you find any bugs in it. :)<br />
<br />
NOTE: if you want to download it... use the link off page one of this thread... I've replaced the original file for download with the updated one.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, no disrespect Durn'... I can't tell if you're being serious each time you post... but if you are I think maybe you're reading things in the wrong light.

This looks awesome as hell man!  I'm psyched to go try it out! :)  Keep up the GREAT work! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed there was a problem with framerate drop on this. I figured it had something to do with the graphics. So I made an adjustment to it.<br />
<br />
Switching it from 6 images to 1 large image did the trick. Using the PNG format meant that the filesize was almost the same as using the 6 smaller images, but it made a HUGE difference in the performance. So I switched it.<br />
<br />
The new version is available through the link on the first page. Nothing changed outside of that. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
one thing though, as I do happen to play a barb warrior as my main, any chance of getting the updated/fixed version with the barb graphic back? :) (I am still using the orginal version of the inventory with the barb)</div></div><hr />
