<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am posting this version of Lunix 3 in beta because I want to find other testers of various classes and races to test it before it goes into final production.  I respectfully request some all classes test this version and tell me what you think and post and bugs you run accross..  And if you post them, please say which version you saw the issue on.<br />
<br />
*known items that might look like bugs*<br />
<br />
 Class Animation in the Inventory window doesn't show ( this was removed because I don't see a point to it )<br />
 there are no guages for endurance and mana in the player area on the group window ( true, all that information is included in the selector, but in the future will also be held in the player section of the group window )<br />
 the player window appears to be the default window, this is redundant ( true, Lunix doesn't use the player window, however if I remove it from the loader pressing ALT Y will crash you to desktop, so till I make it a ghost window it will remain in the UI )<br />
 what happened to 2_03 - 04_000 ? ( uhh, they failed certin tests )<br />
 the spellbook that was in Lunix 3 2_02_000 is missing.. ( it was removed, not sure what I was thinking, it was counter-productive to the interfaces principles )<br />
 ok the spellbook is understandable, but don't you still have a graphic heavy map window? ( ...uhh..  hush it's purty )<br />
<br />
<br />
*updates*<br />
<br />
 {August22,2004 ( 2_05_410 )} fixed missing map window parts and resolved issue with bad scrollbars.<br />
 {August21,2004 ( 2_05_262 )} made target background transparent again.<br />
 {August21,2004 ( 2_05_260 )} resolved issue with duplicate gauge entries, fixed consideration graphic in the targeting window.<br />
 {August21,2004 ( 2_05_010 )} fixed gauge errors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok I've resolved what I was told through tells and email, however I haven't heard from any melee classes..  Is anybody there?  Does anybody care?  Should Lunix just die where it is now...  seemingly the least talked about nor mentioned to XUI, less I am the one mentioning it...  Have I alienated everyone now?  Perhaps it's time to give this thing a break...<br />
