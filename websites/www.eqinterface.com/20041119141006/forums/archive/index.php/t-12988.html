Between speels and AA hotkeys i need more room. If i could have like 2 sets up at one time that would be great. Have something instead of clicking the page 2 or next buttone have 10 slots for spells and 10 other for aa hot keys or maybe mix them up. Either way jsut have 20 slots open at one time. Maybe like SWG hwo you can have 2 sets of function keys goign at one time. <br />

Thx<br />
Be well. . .</div></div><hr />

Check out my combat ability window under skins.  I have mapped all of these keys to my 10-key pad on my keyboard.  It allows me to activate disciplines on the fly, and it seems like I have two hotkey banks.<br />
<br />
I am currently working on a project to do the same thing for the casting bar.  It would be a similiar setup, but... well... spells instead of abilities.<br />
<br />
May not be exactly what you are looking for, but the functionality should be very similiar.  I'll be uploading the new casting bar as soon as I get it done.</div></div><hr />

Figure out how to do this for a caster and you will be a god! =P</div></div><hr />

I go with 1-8 corresponding with the spell slow.  This is extremely helpful for me because of #1 I play a bard sometimes, and #2 I dont like to use the mouse.<br />

This is basically what Turlo did, least sounds that way from what s/he said.</div></div><hr />
