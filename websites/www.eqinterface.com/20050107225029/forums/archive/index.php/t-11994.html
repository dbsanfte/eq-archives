There are a ton of mods out there that either have a mini-inventory constantly open on the screen, a few slots that you can modify to suit your needs constantly open on one window or another, or there are innumerable container mods that have the two (or four) &quot;weapon&quot; slots added to the top.<br />
<br />
Look around, there's lots out there.</div></div><hr />

I'm no UI coder (yet, har har) but it doesn't sound possible to me... well, apart from the Pri/Sec thingy...<br />

neat idea tho...</div></div><hr />

Bag slots have to stay in the container window.  What I would suggest is finding a bag mod you like and using a window like my pet melee window.  I has the primary, secondary, range and ammo slots along with the eight primary inventory slots.  FYI I just uploaded an updated version.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool..peaple really read this.<br />
<br />
Yes add bag slot and weapons to the hot button.<br />
<br />
Clearer...hummm look at all the examples given can we say &quot;OLD&quot;.<br />
I have tryed to make my own,i bow to thouse who do.<br />
<br />
As i said it a rant. Most ui that are made of late are caster ones.<br />
<br />
This was ment as a coment on the fact that there are melee out here who change weapons,dont sit on a mount and cast.<br />
<br />
:D  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mogur</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya. As one who plays both I can understand, but I was gonna say just leave your weapon bag open next to the Hot Button box for easy switching back and forth. Sure it will close every time you zone but nothing can be done about that.  Consider using a /viewport option if you find that open bags and big HB boxes get in the way of your view too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to put a slot from INSIDE a bag into a hot-button, that can not be done.  It's not possible. <br />
<br />
If you want to have your inventory slots (the ones uses to hold bags) next to your hot keys, then there are many mods that do this.  <br />
<br />
There are also many mods that add the Primary, Secondary, Range and Ammo slots to each bag window, making it much easier to move stuff. <br />
<br />
Give them a look, many were linked here. <br />
<br />
And as for why there are so many UIs which include stuff for casters, well, almost everyone in the game (save monks, warriors and rogues) have some sort of casting ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was making a point only. All most all ui's being made  are caster basted. That a fact. Not melee freindly. I'am not asking for anything to  be made ... only for thouse who do to remmber that us melee players have a few needs. <br />
<br />
Also puting slot to top bag dont help me if i got to open my main inventory,then the bag to change my weapon.<br />
<br />
Melee dont cast! Dam sony being f*&amp;^ stupid with this cast crap.<br />
<br />
If you want or care. This started becase iam trying to find a ui for my warrior. The one i was using no longer works becase of the added windows. I keep lossing screen to needed and or uneeded stuff.</div></div><hr />

For example, mine.  It is most certainly good for melees, a large number of them in my guild/alliance use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mogur</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, you do realize you can permanently close any unused or un-necessary windows to make more usable screen space. For instance a melee player has no need for a spell gems window to be open at all so close it by hitting &quot;alt s&quot; on the keyboard. If you look in the Options/Keyboard/UI window you can see all the keyboard commands to open or close the windows that you want to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the spell gem window (casting window) won't even open if you are a pure melee character!  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;New&quot; Ui's dont seem have the weapon slots for melee. I know this site inside and out (yes dont have a life). Very few of the new ones have the slots. Look...dont keep telling me to look at old ones. Where talking NEW.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gandolf2600</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try searching again. I found a nice NEW Ui in the featured area. I use the XYM for my Sk, but with a small patch it converted very nicely for my warrior, with all inventory slots open down the side.  That way all you need to do is open the bag with your weapons in it and change. no need to open inventory window.</div></div><hr />
