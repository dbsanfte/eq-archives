I did it exactly as the how to guide said to, my old machine, everything works fine, however on my new one, when i type /loadskin it only lists default as available.. only difference between the machines is the machine was installed with with trilogy, so the path is different (Program Files/Sony/Everquest Trilogy/)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am watching the Verant boards today to see if there is any mention of this..<br />
<br />
he swears he did the right thing. but his new folder would not show.<br />
<br />
some thoughts on it..<br />
<br />
did you copy the default folder or just the items inside?<br />
<br />
see if your old computer has &quot;show hidden files&quot; turn on.. and the new one have it off.. <br />
<br />
there may be a INI file in the folder that you didnt grab that makes hte folder show up as a legitimate &quot;skin&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corenthalas</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked all the file locations, directories, and settings on my computer. Everything looks fine. I followed all the instructions on installing mods, but when I type the /loadskin &lt;foldername&gt; line in, it just loads the default. I have tried logging to every screen in the login process and even the desktop, but the mods never show up. I'm not sure why it is happening, but as soon as I get home, I'm going online with EQLive techsupport and see if they can help me fix this problem. I used the trilogy pack to install eq as the first post did, and it isn't working. In a couple of boards I've been to, it appears that this problem is somewhat more common with trilogy users. If anyone can supply more information as to why it's not working I would appreciate it.</div></div><hr />
