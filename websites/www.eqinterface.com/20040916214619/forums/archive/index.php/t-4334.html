<br />
I did take out the dripping blood background as it made the GUI get annoying for me after a while.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, feedback is welcomed.<br />
<br />
P.S. I think I have it so it's not broken with each patch.  I've gone through 3 patches with no problems yet (knock on wood)<br />

Kaenil's Spellbook fix (http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=22360) Thanks Kaenil!<br />
<br />
Also, forgot to credit Kaori for the use of the buttons from their GUI (window_pieces03.tga).  :p</div></div><hr />

I'd edit the spell book a bit though. Black text on a black background isn't that readable. I use the same one but I changed the text and moved the page numbers, and also got rid of the title bar :p If you want me to attach it here just lemme know ;)</div></div><hr />

Here's the spellbook.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">taellaar</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's like two different UIs mixed together.  The pet window and spell window look like they both came from some other UI - to me, they really stick out and kind of marr the otherwise very nice look.  I don't like the spellbook much, but that's because I prefer the small icons, but I really do like the pet window - I just feel it should be in a different UI.  Perhaps the icons should too, as their cartoon-ish feel doesn't match the UI, but I can't say I don't love them, so they can stay ;)<br />
<br />
Love the fact that you've managed to put the inventory up for use at any time without making it take over most of the screen, good job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcLite</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback.<br />
The reason it has that patched together feel is because it's a mix and match.  I wrote not a single code of XML.<br />
I just took parts of the GUIs I liked and tossed them together.<br />
<br />
I'm actually considering going to t.king's v2 spellbook or going back to the original one I had in V1a of the bloody necro GUI.<br />
While I like the new spellbook and Kaenil's fix for it works great I'm just not warming up to it as I thought I would.<br />
<br />
On the Spell Icons.  I didn't really included those for artsy sake.  :D <br />
All the other icons I've seen except for some of the remakes of the originals are to hard to identify at a glance for me.  I use these because they are easy to see in the madness. heh<br />
<br />
Note on the Pet info window.<br />
Earthscum has been working on v3 of his Spectre Pet window.  Hopefully it'll be done soon.  *cough*Hint Hint*cough*<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the feedback.  Glad you enjoy parts of the GUI.  lol<br />
<br />
Have a good one<br />

This GUI works best at 1024x768 resolution.  If you are using smaller, it may have loaded it off screen.  The effects window is actually invisible with no border so unless you cast a buff on your self you won't see it.<br />
One way I have found to get it back is try <br />
/loadskin skinname 1<br />
or if you did that and nothing happened try...<br />
/loadskin skinname<br />
Also, make sure your effects button is clicked in the toolbar.  :D <br />
<br />
<br />
About the spell book.  You need to unzip it into the directory you unzipped Bloody Necro to.  Just overwrite whatever it asks.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps some.<br />
