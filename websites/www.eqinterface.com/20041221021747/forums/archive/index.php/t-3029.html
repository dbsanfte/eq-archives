It looks pretty cool.. would be a decent pet or warder... too bad they're going to change it.. sigh! Well at least it was fun for a short bit..<br />

<br />
It has been about 1-2 months so I finally bit the bullet and tried to fix it...  I tried EVERYTHING.  I reinstalled hardware, drivers, etc... nothing...<br />
<br />
I ended up removing and re-installing ALL of EQ from scratch, this worked great.  Trust me the pets are just the beginning.<br />
<br />
Shadowhaven had funky banjo wallpaper all over it.<br />
Armor was not showing up correctly.<br />
<br />
It was a mess...  everything is peachy now though.</div></div><hr />

Walla.  This is a &quot;common&quot; problem.  Works like a charm for me whenever it happens.</div></div><hr />

I decided to head to Cabilis and do a bit a running around and lo and behold, a scaled wolf came a runnin' to me when I arrived... oh not through the pricey payment of a port but through the wonderful porting ability of the PoP! Weeeeeeee! Bout bloody time! But here is what I saw!<br />
