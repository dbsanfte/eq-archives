I haven't done it myself, but I know others who have. <br />

Alt-Enter switches you from full screen to windowed.<br />
Alt-Shift-R frees up your mouse cursor.<br />
<br />
To two-box on one computer, use an EQ resolution that is smaller than your desktop so that you can get at both windows easily.  Start one and get fully logged in.  Then get yourself to windowed mode (if you aren't already), free the mouse, and start a second copy of EQ.  I have found that if I try to start the second copy while zoning or loading in the first copy, at least one of them will crash.  Once both are logged in, I usually have a small amount of lag, probably related to the fact that my video card is a bit old.<br />
<br />
While you are zoning or loading you can't get your mouse back, so the other character will be stuck.  It is ok to zone both characters at once, with auto-follow for example, but I haven't found a way to get both to zone through a click portal like a PoK book.<br />
<br />
With 1GB of ram, I can run both pretty well.  With 512MB, it was pretty choppy.  I tried running three copies and my computer freaked out.</div></div><hr />
