If I put each in a seperate folder and load each folder, than that particular one loads just fine. How do I get it all to load together. The FAQ mentioned something about &quot;keep ui&quot; but I do not see that anywhere.<br />
<br />
This is the message I get when I put them all together in one folder...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfran</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick and dirty version of the &quot;How To Install mix and match UIs&quot;:<br />
<br />
1.) Create a new directory in your uifiles directory.  Name it whatever you want.<br />
<br />
2.) Choose ONE modification (preferrably just one window) and copy the modified .xml file and all supporting graphics into the new directory.<br />
<br />
3.) Fire up EQ.  At the command line type &quot;loadskin [dir name]&quot;.  Make sure it works and that your new window shows up.  <br />
<br />
4a.) If it works and you wish to add new windows, go to number 2, choosing another modification.<br />
<br />
4b.) If it doesn't work, go to your EQ folder and look for a file named UIErrors.txt.  There will always be a long list of stuff.  Look for the one that refers to the filename that you just added to your custom folder.  The error message won't always be really clear, but it might help you figure out the problem.  If you can't figure it out, remove the faulty modification from your custom folder and go to 3.<br />
<br />
5.) Once you've added all the modifications you wish to add to the single custom folder, you can breath a sigh of relief and begin positioning and tweaking all your new windows.</div></div><hr />
