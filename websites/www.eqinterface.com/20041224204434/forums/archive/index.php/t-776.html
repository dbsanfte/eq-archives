<br />
And for your name. Nothing broke, it's always like that.<br />
<br />
Your Name and Surname are attached to your HP bar. Suckage, I know but that's how VI designed that.<br />
<br />
You can either use it, or you can set the TextOffsetY to some ugly number to hide it and create a new Label (EQType 1) to display your name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, I couldn't see it until I viewed teh image seperately... but I agree with BM, it doesnt' look right.<br />
<br />
Of course, I have no solutions to offer, either :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's layout - Your HP, you Group Member HP and even your Pet HP bars all Have to elements &quot;built in&quot;<br />
<br />
The Name ( it &quot;caption text&quot; per say ). This is the Full name, if it's you and first name for your pet, Group members and I believe their pet.<br />
<br />
When you first start your playerWindow mods, you have a Single gauge, I mean, didn't you think it was odd there was no EQType Label for your name? There isn't one, it's on the HP bar!<br />
<br />
Lets take a closer look at the HP Bar.<br />
<br />
	&lt;Gauge item=&quot;Player_HP&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;PlayerHP&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;!--&lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt;--&gt;<br />
		&lt;TextColor&gt;<br />
			&lt;R&gt;240&lt;/R&gt;<br />
			&lt;G&gt;240&lt;/G&gt;<br />
			&lt;B&gt;240&lt;/B&gt;<br />
		&lt;/TextColor&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;3&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;108&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;41&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;TextOffsetX&gt;8&lt;/TextOffsetX&gt;<br />
		&lt;GaugeOffsetY&gt;33&lt;/GaugeOffsetY&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
		&lt;!--&lt;TooltipReference/&gt;--&gt;<br />
		&lt;FillTint&gt;<br />
			&lt;R&gt;240&lt;/R&gt;<br />
			&lt;G&gt;0&lt;/G&gt;<br />
			&lt;B&gt;0&lt;/B&gt;<br />
		&lt;/FillTint&gt;<br />
		&lt;LinesFillTint&gt;<br />
			&lt;R&gt;220&lt;/R&gt;<br />
			&lt;G&gt;220&lt;/G&gt;<br />
			&lt;B&gt;0&lt;/B&gt;<br />
		&lt;/LinesFillTint&gt;<br />
		&lt;DrawLinesFill&gt;false&lt;/DrawLinesFill&gt;<br />
		&lt;EQType&gt;1&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
		&lt;GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
			&lt;Background&gt;A_GaugeBackground&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
			&lt;Fill&gt;A_GaugeFill&lt;/Fill&gt;<br />
			&lt;Lines&gt;A_GaugeLines&lt;/Lines&gt;<br />
			&lt;LinesFill&gt;A_GaugeLinesFill&lt;/LinesFill&gt;<br />
			&lt;EndCapLeft&gt;A_GaugeEndCapLeft&lt;/EndCapLeft&gt;<br />
			&lt;EndCapRight&gt;A_GaugeEndCapRight&lt;/EndCapRight&gt;<br />
		&lt;/GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Gauge&gt;<br />
<br />
Now, You see everything how it is by Default.<br />
Take a look at some odities of this bar:<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
  &lt;CX&gt;108&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
  &lt;CY&gt;41&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
<br />
That's a TALL bar .. Wonder why it's 41 hight when the others are only 8?<br />
<br />
&lt;Location&gt;<br />
  &lt;X&gt;3&lt;/X&gt;<br />
  &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Interstings isn't it? 3,0 but your HP bar is so far down.<br />
<br />
How that's done? More odities:<br />
		&lt;TextOffsetX&gt;8&lt;/TextOffsetX&gt;<br />
&lt;GaugeOffsetY&gt;33&lt;/GaugeOffsetY&gt;<br />
<br />
Note, how these work.<br />
<br />
TextOffSetX - This means move the text off 8 to the right. So, in that 108x41 window at 3,0 your name will be at 11,0. See that?<br />
<br />
Then your HP bar is a gauge. And now it has an offset of 0,33. So, once again in the 108x41 window at 3,0 your HP bar will be at 3,33.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, enough explaning the text lable.<br />
<br />
Why is yours messed up? (damn, your server's busy and I can't load your image. )<br />
Okay, so I'll go off memory. Your Name is over your HP Bar, right?<br />
<br />
Sounds like you did this:<br />
<br />
You complete removed the TextOffsetX and GaugeOffsetY and changed the Size to 108x8 ( or something around there ).<br />
<br />
To fix this, either do one of two things:<br />
<br />
1) Put in TextoffSetY and set it to 20. 20Y in a 108x8 window  is 108, 20. Far enough off the HP bar and no you do not need some big a.. number, something simple. KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid ( live by that ;) ).<br />
<br />
2) Increase the size of the window back to 108x41 and put the Offsets back. This will put things back to the way they where.<br />
<br />
And dat about it. VI built the player name(s) into the HP bar. Stupid, but that's how they designed it. Stupid, I know .. but nothing we can do about that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And to conclude, I sure hope this HP bar tutorial was of help. Thank you, I'm here everyday for your tutorial needs in words completely understandable by people unlike myself. :nana:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been using a group window that uses labels for the group member names (30 to 34 I think).  The problem with using the labels is that if someone is not in the same zone, their name doesn't appear in the group window, only the darkened red hp bar.<br />
<br />
Looking over the xml, I noticed that the x's and y's you refer to were indeed moved and replaced with labels.  I don't know why, but you can sure bet with your info I'm going to play around with it and see if I can get the names that will stay in their proper places.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
