<br />
to quote one part I think is also important to the LOE pop-up issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Over the last few days there has been a growing community concern about possible cheating, exploiting and platinum duplication. Rumors and speculation have begun to run rampant, and I've received a lot of concerned email on the topic.<br />
<br />
First of all, I want to thank you for your concern. The fact that you worry about this stuff as much as we do makes me feel good about the community that I work for. I want to especially thank those that have sent in detailed information about what they thought might be dupe or exploit situations. That information has been very helpful.<br />
<br />
You can read the entire article posted Here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11538) in our chit-chat section<br />
<br />
I hope that you can stop by and read the entire article, it should alleivate concerns about massive cheating in EQ.<br />
<br />
have a great day!<br />

that instead of spamming the /petition forum or doing a &quot;stand-in&quot; you simply use the DEV feedback button.. Just as these people did..<br />
