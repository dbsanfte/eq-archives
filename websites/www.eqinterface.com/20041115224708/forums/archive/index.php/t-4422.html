I think it's pretty good anyways.  Some of ya other classes might want some pieces etc also.  Anyhow, take a look and DL if ya want. :)<br />

I have the UI thing in the zip also (with all the positioning etc.)  Just rename it to your character's name and server number.<br />
<br />
There is a stats window (in the pet window) it's just not displayed in the pic.  Also, I have the vert stype music thingy that you can't see too.</div></div><hr />

       I love that inventory window, but unfortunately when I try to use it with my current UI, Quartz, it crashes to the desktop :( <br />
<br />
What I tried is this, I copied the tt_invertory.png file to my quartz folder and the equi_invertory.xml file, but as I said the game crashes to the desktop the moment I try to log on with the toon that I use the quartz ui.<br />
<br />
Any feedback to resolve this issue will be helpful<br />
<br />

Thanks<br />

I don't get why it wouldn't work for you then... that's all the files that came with the DL... just the pic and the xml.  Sorry I can't help with that.  Only thing I can suggest is maybe the animation file... maybe mine will work with your Quartz UI and make the Inventory run... but this is purely a guess.<br />
<br />
webwolf11:<br />
Should only need the buff xml file and the tga with the numbers in it... just look at the pics tga's that come with it and find the one with the numbers... I'm too lazy to look for you. :)</div></div><hr />

I was hoping what resolution you use and if you are able to customize the buff window for higher resolutions.  Or, I was wondering if you had a seperate mod (with instructions) for the buff window that you are using, since you did say that it was a mix/match UI..<br />
<br />

I really like this setup. I do however have a questions on it.<br />
how does one go about getting rid of the black band that covers the bottom portion of the display.<br />
i understand that this is where most of the windows would reside, but i would like to arrange them in a different manner and be able to see the full screen if set all the alpha transparencies to 0%.<br />
i am sure there is a simple answer to this, but alas i have never like code all that much and at this time i seem to be unwilling to dig a little deeper and experiment with the settings to get rid of it.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

Crag could you do an update? Alot of people cant use that mod because of the Sword pointer. Can you edit your mod but instead use a regular mouse curser?

I also am having trouble getting the UI to take on my computer.  I did all you said in the readme file, but nothing happens when I did what it said.  Any suggestions?  The only question I think might cause it to not work is in step 2.<br />
<br />
2) Edit eqclient.ini file. Change the line UISkin=default to Ukin=vert <br />
  (make sure the UISkin line comes after NEWUI=true)<br />
<br />
Where you say UISkin=default to Ukin=vert, should that be UISkin or Ukin like listed in the readme file?  Just some questions. <br />

Heya, sorry that readme file isn't mine, actually... it's what came with Vert 2.2.  Originally this was a Vert UI that I changed around a bit.  But to answer your question YES it should read &quot;UISkin=vert&quot; (or whatever name you gave to the folder this UI is in) NOT &quot;Ukin=vert&quot;.  So if that's what's been messing people up I hope this fixes it... enjoy! :)</div></div><hr />

I did a little peeking around for this &quot;Sars 3.1&quot; you were talkin' about but didn't see it (I admit I didn't try very hard).  Mind pointing me the way... if I like your idea I might take the time to do it. :)</div></div><hr />

       I'm still not able to get the Inventory window to work with the Quartz 1.5 UI. :(  I copied the tt_invertory.png file to my quartz folder and the equi_invertory.xml file, but as I said the game crashes to the desktop. :confused: If you get a chance will you see if you can get it to work with Statix's Quartz 1.5 UI?<br />

You rock.  One request: I can't seem to get it so EQ doesn't keep warning me about how the skin isn't legit after the 1/09 patch.  All the windows seem to work fine, but the error messages are annoying.  I don't suppose you could post a 1/09 fixed version.<br />

Not sure what's wrong... unless you are maybe telling it to load &quot;vert&quot; yet you have it in a folder named &quot;cragzak&quot;.  Which would be pretty dumb lol.  Try to describe what exactly you are doing step by step from the point of download and I can try to see what you are doing wrong in the loading process.<br />
<br />
cheshire6:<br />
Thanks for the compliment... but I only put it together, I didn't do the coding etc (though I did modify a couple things here and there from what my meager XML skills could figure out).  Anyhow, I haven't logged into EQ for a while... sorta needed a break for a bit.  But I will DL the patch tonight or tomorrow and see if I can figure out what's up.  I'll be back! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorc Veinfinder</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a folder inside the Vert folder that is named Crag.  So, should I be loading the Crag folder, or the Vert folder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cragzak</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, In your &quot;Everquest&quot; folder this is another folder named &quot;uifiles&quot; and in that folder you have another folder named &quot;vert&quot; which has the &quot;cragzak&quot; folder in it... that's your problem.  You can only go as deep as to have a folder in your &quot;uifolder&quot; with a name.  So you need to pull out the &quot;cragzak&quot; folder from the &quot;vert&quot; folder and put it next to the &quot;vert&quot; folder so they are both in the &quot;uifolder&quot;.  Get it?  It should read:<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\EverQuest\uifiles\cragzak<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\EverQuest\uifiles\vert<br />
<br />
depending on where you want to keep all the files.<br />
<br />
Then you have the issue of having changed the command in that text file to UISkin=vert.  This might end up being a problem too (unless you have the stuff it needs in your vert folder too) if you are going to keep everything in a folder named &quot;cragzak&quot;.  So if you are keeping it named &quot;cragzak&quot; and you move it into your &quot;uifolder&quot; next to vert... then to make sure EVERYTHING works fine and dandy i would suggest you change that to say UISkin=cragzak.  You should be good now... lemme know! :)</div></div><hr />

After LoY was released though the ui got all scred. The equip grafic went back to the default one used in the reg UI. Also all the spells no longer have name next to it.  As for the AA exp and reg exp % this got whiped out to. Is there a patch to fix this? Can I do a reg vert patch im seeing or this screw it up more. Just alittle curious if theres anything can update to to at least get back inventory and buffs part back</div></div><hr />
