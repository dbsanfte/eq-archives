<br />
Wish I could code my way out of a wet paper bag but I can't =(<br />
<br />
I'm an artist, not a programmer, I would love some insight.<br />
<br />
Thanks all =)</div></div><hr />

As a shaman (well you better be if you want alchemy recipies), how exactly do you plan on opening the tracking window to read the recipies out of ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stregar</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm...ya know what, I'm RETARDED<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So how about we put it in my BUG window, since you are right, how the F*&amp;% would I open the track window?<br />
<br />
ehheeh<br />
<br />
thanks for pointing out how stupid I can be in the early morning =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wonderbiff</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are many resources to editing xml files available but the tracking window may be a bad spot to put this.  <br />
<br />
I would really consider putting it onto a tab in the actions window. <br />
<br />
XML is a definition file for objects.  A tag is any item surrounded by &lt;tag&gt; followed by a closing &lt;/tag&gt;. <br />
<br />
Here is an example of a tiny piece of make believe xml. <br />
&lt;bowl&gt;<br />
  &lt;sizewide&gt; 40 pixels &lt;/sizewide&gt;<br />
  &lt;sizetall&gt; 40 pixels &lt;/sizetall&gt;<br />
  &lt;locationdown&gt; 100 pixels &lt;/locationdown&gt;<br />
  &lt;locationover&gt; 100 pixels &lt;/locationover&gt;<br />
  &lt;pictureofobject&gt; mybowl.jpg &lt;/pictureofobject&gt;<br />
  &lt;specialstuff&gt; sizable &lt;/specialstuff&gt;<br />
&lt;/bowl&gt;<br />
<br />
So if I were to read this piece of code in plain english <br />
It would read: A bowl that is 40 pixels wide and 40 pixels tall. It is 100 pixels off the top of the screen and 100 pixels from the left of the screen. The graphic associated with my bowl is mybowl.jpg and it has a special tag that allows it to be resized. <br />
<br />
The organization of the file is layed out so you can determine what is an object and what is a property of an object.  Notice bowl is at the begining of the line and everything else is indented then /bowl finsihes the description of the object.  All the lines between bowl and /bowl are properties of that object.  Html works the same. The only difference is xml you can give any tag any name as long as the program reading the file knows what to do with the tag something will happen.. Html all tags are predefined.  If you were insane you could type all your xml or html on one line. <br />
<br />
The actions box has tabs along the top of it you could add one tab called tinker and put anything you like inside that tab. heck go crazy and add 5 tabs with classes of tinkered items or names of vendors locs or prices.<br />
<br />
When you go to make your edit just find the code that creats a tab.. in the actions window in the actions.xml file<br />
Copy a whole tab  <br />
<br />
&lt;definetab&gt; <br />
  &lt;tabname&gt; sometab &lt;/tabname&gt;<br />
  &lt;sometext&gt; xyzzy &lt;/sometext&gt; <br />
&lt;/definetab&gt;<br />
<br />
Paste that copy into the same file...<br />
&lt;definetab&gt; <br />
  &lt;tabname&gt; sometab &lt;/tabname&gt;<br />
  &lt;sometext&gt; xyzzy &lt;/sometext&gt; <br />
&lt;/definetab&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;definetab&gt; <br />
  &lt;tabname&gt; sometab &lt;/tabname&gt;<br />
  &lt;sometext&gt; xyzzy &lt;/sometext&gt; <br />
&lt;/definetab&gt;<br />
<br />
Rename the copy of that tab to your new name. <br />
Put you text into tags that are text descriptors.<br />
<br />
&lt;definetab&gt; <br />
  &lt;tabname&gt; tinker &lt;/tabname&gt;<br />
  &lt;sometext&gt; Put you text into tags that are text descriptors.<br />
 &lt;/sometext&gt; <br />
&lt;/definetab&gt;<br />
<br />
Near the bottom of the everquest xml file is a list properties and objects associated with the window you put your tab on. You will need to add one line to tell the window to actually draw the tab you just added up above.<br />
<br />
&lt;drawactionswindow&gt;<br />
  &lt;pieces&gt; sometab &lt;/pieces&gt;<br />
  &lt;pieces&gt; tinker &lt;/pieces&gt;<br />
&lt;/drawactionswindow&gt;<br />
<br />
I am sure if you examine the smaller xml files first them move up to bigger ones you will start to understand them.<br />
Make tiny changes to the items between tags and try interperate a tag before you change it.<br />
<br />
This is all from memory and I have never messed with the actions window so don't take it totally verbatim.<br />
Good luck<br />
AB<br />

Stupidly the leading spaces that make the code pretty are taken out when posted... blah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a ton, I'll get cracking on this now.<br />
<br />
I'll have this avail for anyone to download soon.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

Alea iacta est!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wonderbiff</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a mod that puts maps into the actions tabs located at eqtoolbox .. not sure of the url but if you really want to get crazy you could add your code to this code and upload it to them. You could have others helping with the recipe effort... There are many many recipies out there that should be included some day.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
You may want to look into how the &quot;help&quot; file works it has linkable text.  You could add/replace entire pieces of the help file with recipies.  With that in mind I have not seen anyone modify the help file window.  This could be a benefit since you could possibly simply add one link to a larg set of links that all branch off to recipies.  Any time they update the help file you would simply just need to add your single link.  This could even done programatically so that they patch and you run your file fixer and blam all your recipies are still intact.  <br />
<br />
Mainly I think you should keep in mind everytime you make a huge edit to one of the xml files they could come right along and replace that window with a new version of their window and then your going to have to rebuild your window around theirs...<br />
<br />
Isn't version control fun :)<br />
AB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stregar</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried the HTML approach in the help file, but there's a problem.<br />
<br />
I was succesful in added new HTML files, but the help.html file gets patched EVERYTIME you start the game, and I was having to copy the help file over itself after I patched, everytime.<br />
<br />
Wasn't fun.<br />
<br />
Gonna add it to the action window =)<br />
<br />
Feel free to link me to other recipe's and I'll add more tabs =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wonderbiff</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking about that help file and it sucks :)<br />
<br />
Oh well.  Hows your editing coming along?<br />
AB<br />
<br />
Oh yes you could make the help file read only... not that you never want new help again but then again they will probably freak out and crash if they can't patch the help file hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stregar</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will test the read only feature when I get home from work, since I have it done already =)</div></div><hr />
