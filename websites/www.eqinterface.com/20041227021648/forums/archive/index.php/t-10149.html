<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">archeiron</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in the early stages of developing my first UI.<br />
<br />
What I want is a UI that<br />
<br />
(a) is inobtrusive<br />
(b) occupies the minimum screen real estate<br />
(c) presents all relevant information that is quickly readable<br />
(d) is attractive to look at<br />
(e) is light and fast loading<br />
(f) is targetted for 1280x1024 (my prefered resolution) but usable at smaller resolutions (hopefully down to 800x600)<br />
<br />
I have gone through several theme changes during this artistic phase, and I settled on the one that was all the fashion for signatures amongst people I know (Dolby has one like this, Sargeras, myself, a number of old Guardians of Veeshan ppl have all had them).<br />
<br />
I would appreciate some feedback and any ideas.  Thank you in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">archeiron</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Explanation:<br />
<br />
The second gauge on the target window is the casting bar.<br />
<br />
The pet window has been stripped down to have resists + xp.<br />
<br />
The player window has health + pet health.  The breath and casting would go as a one pixel gauge between the two bars.<br />
<br />
The chat windows are unfinished as I have yet to build some scroll bars that I actually like!<br />
<br />
The background on all windows is currently 50% gray.  I do not currently intend to leave this so bland.  I may make a small texture or use another color (verdict is still out on this one) to use at the background for all windows.<br />
<br />
The spells window and hotkeys I intend to build next as a single column of buttons to be attached to the left and right (respectively) of the screen.  The buff + songs window I intend to have at the top of the screen as a single row.</div></div><hr />

I might give it a try and see if i can design one around that look. I have been looking for a layout design to try making and yours looks very pimp.<br />
<br />
it looks like you designed this in photoshop  can you possibly send me the psd file from the design.  It will help making it look exactly the same.</div></div><hr />

It looks like a UI that I definaly will use.</div></div><hr />
