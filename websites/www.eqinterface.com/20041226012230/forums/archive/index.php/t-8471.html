<br />
Well, this is it.  My last update to the forry UI.  I have been forced to leave EQ, so I will not be able to make any changed to this final interface.  I hope I have taken care of most of the requests.  There is still one that I did not get done...If someone would like to help...Ellyana would like the MP3 player pulled out and put into a seperate download so that it will work with any other UI.  If someone could help her out it would be nice.  An updated screen shot can be seen at the download section, but below is a picture of the options that are available.<br />
<br />
The timers that are in my main screen shot are actually in the friends window.  I have included instruction on how to go to Arista's UI Timers Page (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp) and create your own timer using my skin.  I have also sent the needed graphics, so it may become an optional download at that site. :)   Hope everyone enjoys!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might there be a way to change the length of the timer from the target window? I figured out how to remove the timer completely, that's cake hehe. I'm fine with having some sort of timer there but i'd like it to be the length of time that is important to my character, like a mend timer of 6 minutes for instance. With my current UI (haven't decided if i wanna stick with yours yet ;)) I use Arista's timer in the pet window heh, so it's always there.<br />
Anyways, let me know if this can be done, or even give me a quick lowdown on how i can change it myself.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />
Eloora</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here it goes:<br />
<br />
** EDIT  -  This is only for the forry UI, because I moved code around from the original timer windows.<br />
<br />
How to change the timers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  1. First you need to calculate the duration for the timer.  This is done by<br />
	using the following formula:<br />
<br />
		X =  the time in minutes that you want the timer to be (then just add any seconds that you want to the answer of the X*60)<br />
<br />
		[(X * 60) / 120] * 1000<br />
<br />
	ex. I want a 6 minute timer:	6 * 60 = 360<br />
					360 / 120 = 3<br />
					3 * 1000 = 3000<br />
		so the duration = 3000<br />
<br />
  2. Now open the EQUI_Forry.xml file and search for the following: A_ForryTimerBar<br />
	(You will find two of these, #1 [top] and #2 [bottom])<br />
<br />
  3. This item will be made up of multiple &lt;Frame&gt; lines.  In these &lt;Frame&gt; lines<br />
	you will see a &lt;Duration&gt; section (ex. &lt;Duration&gt;2500&lt;/Duration&gt;)<br />
	These duration numbers must be changed to what you calculated above.<br />
<br />
	- Easiest way to do this is to do a Find/Replace and use the current setting<br />
		of the duration section for the find.<br />
		(ex. Find = &lt;Duration&gt;2500&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
		     Replace = &lt;Duration&gt;3000&lt;/Duration&gt; )<br />
<br />
   4.  Once you are done, save the file.<br />
<br />
   5.  Now open the EQUI_TargetWindow.xml file.<br />
<br />
   6.  Do a search for the following: TW_ForryTimerName0 or TW_ForryTimerName1<br />
	(0 is the top timer, 1 is the bottom)<br />
<br />
   7.  You should see something like this:<br />
<br />
		&lt;StaticText item=&quot;TW_ForryTimerName0&quot;&gt;<br />
			&lt;Location&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;10&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;5&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;Size&gt;<br />
				&lt;CX&gt;90&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
				&lt;CY&gt;10&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;Font&gt;1&lt;/Font&gt;<br />
			&lt;TextColor&gt;<br />
				&lt;R&gt;0&lt;/R&gt;<br />
				&lt;G&gt;0&lt;/G&gt;<br />
				&lt;B&gt;0&lt;/B&gt;<br />
			&lt;/TextColor&gt;<br />
			&lt;NoWrap&gt;true&lt;/NoWrap&gt;<br />
			&lt;Text&gt;5 Minutes&lt;/Text&gt;<br />
		&lt;/StaticText&gt;<br />
<br />
		&lt;StaticText item=&quot;TW_ForryTimerDuration0&quot;&gt;<br />
			&lt;Location&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;97&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;5&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;Size&gt;<br />
				&lt;CX&gt;36&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
				&lt;CY&gt;10&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;Font&gt;1&lt;/Font&gt;<br />
			&lt;TextColor&gt;<br />
				&lt;R&gt;0&lt;/R&gt;<br />
				&lt;G&gt;0&lt;/G&gt;<br />
				&lt;B&gt;0&lt;/B&gt;<br />
			&lt;/TextColor&gt;<br />
			&lt;NoWrap&gt;true&lt;/NoWrap&gt;<br />
			&lt;AlignRight&gt;true&lt;/AlignRight&gt;<br />
			&lt;Text&gt;5:00&lt;/Text&gt;<br />
		&lt;/StaticText&gt;<br />
<br />
   8.  Edit the &lt;Text&gt; item in both the TW_ForryTimerName and the<br />
	TW_ForryTimerDuration to be what you have changed the timer too<br />
		(ex. &lt;Text&gt;6 Minute Timer&lt;/Text&gt; - TW_ForryTimerName<br />
		     &lt;Text&gt;6:00&lt;/Text&gt; - TW_ForryTimerDuration       )<br />
<br />
   9.  After making the needed changes, save this file.<br />
<br />
   10.  You should be set to go!<br />
<br />
<br />
If this is confusing, I'm sorry :(   Tried to make it easy for you. ;)   Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks forry i'll have to try that with the timers. I'm gonna bug you yet again about something else hehe....is there a casting bar for the melee player window? I can't seem to see anything when i use right clickies or potions...melee still need to cast ya know ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks and take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point...I added the casting bar to the spell cast window, so I guess it won't show for the melee players.<br />
<br />
That won't be hard to fix, but don't really have time tonight.  Hopefully I can get something out by tomorrow.<br />
<br />
One way you could do this is to find the EQUI_CastingWindow.xml file and remove it from the custom folder.  That should work until I change it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weawen</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say its a very intresting layout.  I havent seen one that original in a while.  I for one love the buff icons.  Could you post a pic of it with the spell names on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a pic to give you an idea of that the buffs with names look like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Eloora.  I've been kind of strapped for time with work and everything.<br />
<br />
PS.  I will get to the visual stats screen :D   I promise!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe no problem I figured you weren't made of time (which I am :D) that's why I posted the pic. <br />
For now I'm using a couple of different stat/inventory windows but can't seem to find one that suits me. I found one for use in the pet window which has prim/sec/range/ammo + bags on the first tab, and mini-inventory on the second tab, but no stats. Then I found one for the friends window (which sucks cuz you have to keep reopening it) which has stats on one tab and my gear on the other but not all the weapon/range slots and no bags. Sigh, I wish I was good at this xml stuff since I'm so particular about it.<br />
Anyhoo, whenever you get around to updates is fine, it's your UI!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok...I have updated the zip file to a new version.<br />

if you could make a mirriored buff window with names you would rule :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koraniz</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could I request horizontal buff windows and/or a vertical spell bar? Great ui :D</div></div><hr />

I'm currently working on a skin for a friend, but will try to get something done soon.  And Yes...I will be updating the bank when the shared slots go live...just have to think how :D   Thanks for the suggestion guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nickmbb</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forry...so far on the test server, everthing works fine cept the bank slots.<br />
<br />
 BTW, out of all the UIs I have tried, Forry is the least intrusive and best looking one I have used. If you like the fancy D&amp;D look, this one isnt for you....but I like to see as much of the game as i can, and Forry does just that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm glad you like it so much.  I really do like all the eye candy, but when you're playing I would rather see the game instead...that I why I made as much as I could see through.  I will try to get the bank slots added and place it in an options folder for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways!  I was wondering if maybe there is a way to make the percent numbers in the group and player window look a little darker or bigger?  I have a hard time seeing them as they are now.  I play in 1024x768 if that makes any difference.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok...I got some things fixed up with the UI...including the shared bank slots and some new gauges.  I'm not going to post the new files just yet because I haven't tested them :p   As soon as I do, I will update the download section.<br />
<br />
Also...I'm still working on the mirrored version (and horizontal) of the buff windows and the vertical spell bar, but they will get done at some point.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  also working on making the % numbers bigger</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nickmbb</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking forward to the new updates....keep up the excellent work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just uploaded version 2.0 so the file has been placed back into the moderator's queue and will be available again when it gets approved.  I very sorry, but I didn't get a chance to finish everything yet!  Below is a list of the updates and all options are still available that were there before.<br />
<br />
Updates:<br />
<br />
   -  New shared bank slots<br />
<br />
   -  New style of guages (if they don't go over well, I can change back, but I like the new ones...just let me know)<br />
<br />
   -  When you mouse over a button, it will be a lighter color blue now (the other one was just too dark in my opinion)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I do actually have some other code started on my computer, but haven't finished any of the other requests yet...working on 2 UI's at one time just doesn't leave me much time for 1 thing :p   I am almost done with the UI for my friend and should be able to devote more time to finishing up the upgrades on this one.  Thanks for your patients!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I know I just updated to version 2.0, but I have updated again to version 2.1 :p   (I'm sure the admins are real happy with me right now, sorry guys and gals)  This should become available as soon as the admins give it the ok.<br />
<br />
This version includes all of the requested changes as options (except the larger font for the % - still working on that one)<br />
<br />
  -  Mirrored Buff windows with and without spell names<br />
<br />
  -  Horizontal Buff windows for both the top and bottom of the screen (no names with these - it just wouldn't look right)<br />
<br />
  -  Vertical spell cast window<br />
<br />
  -  Big bank window with shared slots (there may be a mistake in version 2.0 with the shared slots, so please download the updated version for the fix - sorry about that)<br />
<br />
  -  Also added a target window that has the pet health on it (for us pure pet classes - this removes the pet health from the pet window)<br />
<br />
<br />
Future changes I'm attempting to do:<br />
<br />
  -  The pet target window, but include the times<br />
<br />
  -  Enlarge the font on some % and other labels to make viewing a little easier<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is a picture of all the optional windows...Hope you like it.</div></div><hr />

I just finished pulling my map window out of my UI (could have done this real quick, but it would have ment sending about 4 or 5 different files for the download)  I have fixed it up so it is one xml file and one tga file (plus the readme).  I'm currently at work, but as soon as I get home and test it, I will zip it up and upload it to the map section.  I will make this statement right now and it is in the readme file.<br />
<br />
WARNING:  The forry map that will be in the map download section is not intended to be loaded into the forry UI.  If you do, it WILL break your UI.  The xml file was coded to only work with other UIs.  Basically....If you have the EQUI_forry.xml file in your folder, it will break it.<br />

I hope he posts this one as well. <br />

He is still has a few details to work out.. before he posts it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Achrya</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have one &quot;issue/bug&quot; with it. <br />
<br />
 The Hotbutton/right Click bank... i tend to use my mouse a lot to swap out instruments and I tend to find that the hotbutton/click bank sticks... meaning sometimes i can pick up an object out of the slot, or right click it, or even click on a hotbutton like tracking. Though it does fix itself if I grab a &quot;bag&quot; from one of my hotbuttons. <br />
<br />
 IT will like not let me click on it at all... left click right click.. nothing.. but if I grab a bag and put it back in the slot i got it from it fixes it and i can click on the buttons and items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Achrya - I believe your problem is that you have another window that is overlapping the right clickie section of your hotbutton window.  Each window is actually a rectangle, but the background has been set to invis.  If one of the invis parts is overtop of the right clickie area and that window is layered above the hotbutton window, you won't be able to click through it.  The reason it works when you grab one of the bags is because that sets the hotbutton window to be in front of that other window.  I would try shifting windows a little and see if that fixes the problem.  ;) <br />

Raidarr - You won't actually have a forry folder, but rather a forry.zip file when you download from the site.  Once you unzip that file, it should create a forry folder that has some subfolders (things like &quot;No Timers&quot;, &quot;Melee Player Window&quot;, etc)  If you just download and unzip the file, you should have a mana bar in the player windows.  If you have copied the files from the &quot;Melee Player Window&quot; folder out to the main forry folder, that will cause you not to see the mana bar.  I know this is a pain, but what I would suggest doing is keeping the original unzipped folder and making a copy of that in the UIFiles directory.  Name this copy something like forrywizard and make any changed you want to the buff bars or target window.  Then in game while playing your wizard, load the forrywizard file.  If you would happen to have a monk and what your windows to look a different way...make a new copy of the original and name it forrymonk.  Then when playing your monk load this skin :p   I think you see where I am going with this... this is the best solution I have found so far because I play multiple classes.<br />
<br />
Just kind of a side note:  My main character is a mage and the default xml files that get downloaded with the forry UI are set up for a mage (mana in playerwindow...pet control buttons...etc).  The option folders are so that other classes can use this UI also.  Things like a melee player window which removes the mana bar from the player window or buff windows with names.<br />
<br />
I do plan on updating this UI soon...I hope.  I just haven't been working on it much...actually haven't had much time to work on it.  Here is a list of things that should come with the new version:<br />
<br />
  -  The % numbers will be in larger font (this one has been requested for awhile now and is finally done!)<br />
<br />
  -  I will have an option for a non-seperated bank window (it won't have sub-labled holders)<br />
<br />
  -  Have the target/pet target window with the timers on it (questionable)<br />
<br />
  -  Have a target window that has the player's health right under the target's health (questionable)<br />
<br />
<br />
I have also not forgotten about another request that was asked of me.  I am trying to make my MP3 player window into it's own mod so that it can be downloaded seperate.  That one turned out to be a little more complex than the map window that I did, but I'm still working on it.  Hope this clears up any problems with the UI.  If not, just let me know by posting here or sending a PM. :p   Happy hunting everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just uploaded Forry 2.2 (just realized I didn't change the character select screen to 2.2, so it will still say 2.1 :rolleyes: )    This version is good to go for the July 10th patch and has also added two other items:<br />
<br />
1.  The % numbers on the player, target, group, and pet windows are in a larger font (easier to see and only added like 4 pixels more to each window)<br />
<br />
2.  An option to change the big bank window to a layout that is closer to the default layout.  The graphics are still see thur, just the position of the slots has changed.<br />
<br />
If you have any problems, just let me know.  Still working on the Music Player window as a separate download. (sorry its taking soo long!!)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Forgot that I also added a different story window.  Instead of having the titles at the top and the text on the bottom, it now has the titles listed on the left side and the text on the right side.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if you still check this thread, but I'm having trouble setting the timer to 1hr 30 min.

This is what I did: <br />
1 hr 30 min = 90 min, so [(90*60) / 120] * 1000 = 45000, right?<br />
Math isn't my forte lol, but I've done this about 5 times and came out with the same number, and the timer still moves at a rate that would put it at about 20 minutes.</div></div><hr />

You might not be aware of this, but the maximum duration per animation frame is 10 seconds (10000 ms). A frame using a duration greater than 10000 will only last for 10000, resulting in the timer moving too fast. So, if you want a 45000 duration frame, you'll need to use five separate frames together that add up to the full duration, as follows:<br />
<br />
10000<br />
10000<br />
10000<br />
10000<br />
5000<br />
<br />
In the description for this UI, Forry mentions that the timer code actually came from my web site, with some modifications to fit into this mod. Depending on how it was modified, it might be faster to just generate the code for a 1:30:00 timer at my site, then cut and paste the frame code into this mod (using search/replace as needed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info Arista.  I had no clue about the max duration on the timers...guess that's why you have the timer web site and I don't :p   Anyway, another way to do this would be to just go to the web site and make up a timer that you need using the friends window then just remove the timers from the target window.  This would probably work best but won't look right.  I will see if I can modify my code for my next version so that the timers are in the friends window and they should look the same as they do now.  I'll see what I can do and thanks again Arista.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well here it is....Forry UI version 3.0!<br />
<br />
I have updated the download section to this new version.  I've attempted to intigrate all the requests that have been received into the UI.<br />
<br />
Picture and Download (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2020) <br />
<br />
<br />
What's Included:<br />
<br />
  -  Most of the normal windows are still there<br />
<br />
  -  Compass has been changed so that the letters are stationary and the arrow moves across them (Standard compass has been included as an option)<br />
<br />
  -  Alternate bank window (Both bank windows have the shared plat slot which should be working when it goes live - currently works on test - this will NOT cause the skin to error in the live servers)<br />
<br />
  -  All buff window options are still available<br />
<br />
  -  New player window options which included AC, Attack, and HP below the gauges (per request)<br />
<br />
  -  The graphics have been darkened (I liked this much better...hope you do too!!)<br />
<br />
  I will attach an image with the different options that are available.  This image has already been attached to the first post.  <br />
<br />
I did find out that the timers in my previous versions would not work correctly for any time over 20 minutes.  I have included a graphics file and instructions on how to make your own timers at Arista's Website (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp) .  I would suggest using the friends window for these timers.<br />
<br />
<br />
** NOTE:  I will be unable to support this UI anymore because I have left EQ!!  I will still check the boards and try to help out, but I'm unable to test any code I write!!  Sorry!!  Ellyana has asked me to make my MP3 player available for other interfaces...If someone could make this happen for her it would be really nice.  **<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

So I figured I would continue to upgrade my UI.  I have just uploaded Version 3.1 which fixes all issues for LDoN and the 10/9/03 patch.<br />
<br />
I have tested and all windows should be working correctly.  Please make sure to delete your old Forry folder before installing the new version.  I have removed the Bazaar and Raid windows so that they are now being pulled from the default folder.  If you just copy over your current folder, these two windows will not be correct.<br />
<br />
The Pet Buff window has been set so that it will NOT show.  I just couldn't come up with a way to make it work very well, but will be trying to change it for the future.<br />

If you have any problems or ideas for the UI, just post in this thread.</div></div><hr />

I have a question though...I was having issues with the compass not showing the direction to the adventure dungeon...Has that been fixed?<br />

<br />
I have uploaded a new version and it is currently in moderation.<br />
<br />
 -  Added one option: Larger Target window<br />
<br />
 -  Added the ability to change back to the default options<br />
<br />
 -  Backgrounds for bags and inventory window have been updated<br />
<br />
 -  Target window con should work and target ring con included  (my own version, not default)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Woonie  -  I hate to say this, but I'm not sure if the compass works.  I have never been on an adventure yet, but I have had people tell me that it works fine. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morganpdx</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I for one am real glad that you're back!  Never posted on this site before but I&quot;ve downloaded your UI and LOVE it.  I came back because I was trying to modify the pet info window to show the pet buff icons....to no avail.  I get some fairly strange results as well, perhaps they'll clue you in to some issues?  <br />
<br />
All I did in essence was copy the pet buff window info from the originial EQ xml PetTargetInfo.xml file into your version, and tweak it around a bit.  Seemed to be working, however when I cast 1 spell on my pet, I get no buff.  When I cast a second, it appears (with both spell icons).  It was covering up my pet health %, so I tried moving the pet buff window around a bit (being mindful of the total size of the window) and now it won't show up at all.  <br />
<br />
And let me say that I'm really glad to see you back...Lookin forward to your new version!  Maybe you'll have more success than I :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad you like the UI morganpdx.  I'm also glad you brought up the pet buff thing...because its working on one of the options, but I forgot to fix the default pet window :rolleyes:   Silly Me!!!<br />
<br />
If you choose to have your target window display your pet health, the pet buff icons (about the first 7) will show up just to the left of the pet command buttons.<br />
<br />
However....I got so wrapped up in working with target cons, I forgot to transfer this change into the default pet window.  I will get this working and post here with the change.  Sorry about that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have fixed up the default pet window to now display the pet buffs.  It should show the first 7 buffs just to the left of the buttons.  I have also updated the forry32.zip file that is located in the download section of this site.<br />
<br />
For anyone that has download version 3.2 prior to 8:00pm EST on 11/7/03 and would like to have the pet buffs display, this link (http://jason.forryweb.net/ui/forry32_petbuff_fix.zip) will download a zip with the fixed up files.  Just unzip the files (an one folder) into your main forry folder.<br />
<br />
I have only tested down to the 4th buff, so if there are any problems, just post here to let me know!  ;)<br />
<br />
Side note...I have noticed that if you buff your pet (and see the icons) then do a /loadskin command, when the screen unfreezes, all your pet buffs are gone.  They are actually still on the pet, but the icons disappear.  If you just cast another buff on the pet, all icons should then reappear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morganpdx</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bet buff window looks awesome!!  great work, much better than I could ever do :-)<br />
<br />
Two unrelated things I noticed:<br />
<br />
I'm still having trouble with the target rings...I loaded the new ui onto a char, logged completely out of eq and back, no ring.  doublechecked that rings were active.  logged completely out of eq again, copied the targetindicator.ini and .tga files into the custom ui directory where I keep your ui files, and repeated the above, to no avail.  :( <br />
<br />
I also noticed what seems to be a doubling over of text on the pet buff 'stand' window button.  Might be me just seeing things tho.<br />
<br />
all in all however I love this ui and recommend it to all my friends and cohorts!:D <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well morganpdx...you picked out 2 problems that probably aren't my fault (that doesn't happen much!!! :p )<br />
<br />
3D Target Ring - this could be an issue with your graphics card.  Check out the Help Forums on this site, because there are a lot of people that are having the same problems.  You might be able to find a fix for the problem, or you might find out that you will never be able to see the ring.  Sony is aware that there is a problem and they are working on it.  So check out the Help Forums! ;) <br />
<br />
Pet Sit/Stand - You're not the only one that noticed this...it does it on mine also and a different interface that a friend of mine uses, so its not an interface error that I can see.  I've been told (havent' really looked myself), but once you cast a pet, this issue will be resolved until you camp out and come back into the game.  I have no clue what is making this happen...I assume it is because I'm using the transparent buttons when you don't have a pet.  Sorry...hope you can live with this problem. :D <br />
<br />
Once again...glad you enjoy the UI and keep the problems coming in...I'm sure there are more of them somewhere!!<br />
<br />
PS.  I know that the Done button on the bags is off center, but I've tried to correct this in the past with no luck. :(   Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morganpdx</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep I can live with the sit/stand thing.  Especially if it's not your fault!  :-)<br />
<br />
As for the 3d rings, it's funny that it's not working on mine because my girlfriend plays as well and has the same video card (Radeon 9500) and hers show up cool.  Which is why I want mine to show up, I'm jealous LOL</div></div><hr />

Let me just say that yours is the ultimate UI!!! it leaves more screen available for all to see and so nicely organized!!<br />
<br />
I use it for ALL of my characters and my 3 Accounts!!<br />
<br />
Everytime they Patch I go nuts until you take the time out of your busy schedule and post the update!!<br />
<br />
I have been spreading the news on your UI!<br />
<br />
I want you to know that I appreciate the hard work you put into it!<br />
<br />
The only gripe I had was the compass thing, but I worked it out and have labeled all the locations to the dungeons so its cool.<br />
<br />
I have not done an adventure in a while so I have not checked to see if it works, I am sure you fixed it.<br />
<br />
Once again its great to see your back in game and back in action!<br />
<br />
Maybe you should have a spot on the featured UI's. Everyone should test drive it!<br />

I uploaded an incorrect version.  The way I set up my EQUI.xml so that the UI doesn't break for patches causes it not to load in SidlWidl.  Because of this I have to modify the EQUI.xml so I can view it in SidleWidl and guess what.... I forgot to change it back before I uploaded  :rolleyes:  So if you have already downloaded ForryUI version 3.3d, please download it again and reinstall it.  The correct file is there now.</div></div><hr />

If you download the 3.3d (old version), just go into the folder and you will see the following 2 files:   EQUI.xml  and  EQUI_jmf.xml <br />
Instead of downloading the new 3.3d version, just delete the EQUI.xml file and rename the _jmf one to EQUI.xml<br />
<br />
That's really all that was updated in the new 3.3d version.   :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will you be doing a new version of your UI compatible with OOW?<br />
<br />
Thank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm working on a patch right now and hopefully have a new version out in about a week or so after that.  Not much will be changing the new version, just adding a 1 pixel black boarder to the outer edge of all the windows and making the pieces stand-alone so others can quickly put a piece from my UI into their own.  I am trying to finish the patch by sometime later today, but no promises.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martinus</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No worry Forry  :) <br />
<br />
Take the time you need bro  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">***  Forry Version 3.4 Uploaded  ***  <br />
<br />
This has all the fixes for the OoW release.  Hopefully everyone likes the way I did the cast spell window.  Hopefully within the next month or so I can get version 4.0 done and up for everyone.  Not much will be changing with the 4.0 version (as of right now) ... just some minor graphic changes and a few odds and ends.<br />
<br />
If you have any problems with the 3.4 release, please let me know either through a PM or this forum thread.  I have not actually tested the new slots, but I feel they should be working fine.</div></div><hr />
