<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daldomer</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Nvidia card the targeting circle would not work even when reverting back to the default UI.<br />
I changed the UISkin=DEFAULT to UISkin=(name of my custom UI Folder)<br />
and the targeting circle worked, only thing I can think of is some how I either didn't install the UI properly or the game never registered that I am using a custom UI, I would suggest changing that setting to the name of the custom Ui folder and see if that helps.<br />

Everything works fine after that was just posting what worked fr me In case people were concentrating  on UI files raher then a setting I personally am totally clueless when it comes to making UI skins, but this seemed to work for me.<br />
Just wanted to pass on my experience, and what fixed my problem, as there might be other that possibly didn't install thier Ui correctly.<br />
The Ui I was Using would work, but the Main INI file  still had the UISkin = default setting rather then listing my custom UI.<br />
every thing works now that I manualy set it to my custom folder.<br />
<br />
others mileage may vary.<br />
