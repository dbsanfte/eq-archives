At Courtinae's request, I have included a stats page. Having the stats page helps to protect from accidental clicking and loss of inventory items.  Thanks for the request Courtinae. I have also included the current hp with max hp labels<br />
This is not a stand alone. It's meant to replace the current hotkey design in OldCelt01 only. I have attached the zip file below.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aldeneb</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the instructions I have included in the download for both OldCelt01 and this hotkey there is a section on changing the animation. You will have to follow those instructions for both the EQUI_Hotbuttonwnd.xml file, AND do the same in the EQUI_Inventory.xml file. That will change both animations. Let me know if you have any other problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DOH ... ok iam dumb. jessh sorry &lt;hides head&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aldeneb</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah. It's a good thing you asked because the instructions didn't say anything about having to change BOTH of the animations - one in the Hot key window and the other in the Inventory window.  I checked it out after reading your post and saw that both have to be changed independently. So thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Courtinae</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank-you Thank-You =). One little tiny request though hehe. Could you add a actual hp total something like 6500/7450. You just have the max total. Something like you do with the weight. Thanks again I finally found a UI I will never change<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aldeneb</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will need to change both the inventory.xml and Hotbuttonwnd.xml files to put in your class animation. <br />
<br />
The text you will need to change in  OldCelt01 Inventory .xml is found under the &quot;SELW_ClassAnim&quot;<br />
heading. The exact text you change is: <br />
<br />
&lt;Animation&gt;A_ClassAnim06&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
<br />
-where you put in the number of your class animation. example is to change from Druid to Cleric - change 06  to 02 <br />
<br />
&lt;StaticAnimation item=&quot;SELW_ClassAnim&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;ScreenID&gt;SELW_ClassAnim&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
    &lt;Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;X&gt;376&lt;/X&gt;<br />
      &lt;Y&gt;24&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;56&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;118&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
    &lt;Animation&gt;A_ClassAnim06&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
  &lt;/StaticAnimation&gt;<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The text for the hotbutton window in OldCelt01 is headed by &quot;ClassAnim&quot; where you again change<br />
<br />
&lt;Animation&gt;A_ClassAnim06&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
<br />
to what ever number you need for the class animation. (I have a list of the numbers in the instructions)<br />
<br />
&lt;StaticAnimation item=&quot;ClassAnim&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;ScreenID&gt;ClassAnim&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
    &lt;Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;X&gt;150&lt;/X&gt;<br />
      &lt;Y&gt;59&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;42&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;80&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
    &lt;Animation&gt;A_ClassAnim06&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
  &lt;/StaticAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
This is all you have to do. Except save :)<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the fuzzy text you may have the anti-aliasing turned on or smooth font.. I forget which is which but there are posts in EQ Interface Forums that deal with the problem. I run XP and have standard font smoothing turned on with no problems, but some people have had problems and so turn it off. It's found by rightclicking the desktop go to  Properties- Appearance-Effects, and you will see &quot;use the following method to smooth edges of screen fonts&quot; you can see what you have checked (or not) uncheck it and see if that helps.</div></div><hr />
