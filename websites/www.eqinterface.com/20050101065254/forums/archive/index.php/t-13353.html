<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HoverCraaft</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to the patch, my font sizes for my player name in the Player Window and the target name in the Target Window are a constant size (seemingly size 2 according to my past experience with EQUI). <br />
<br />
The typical size of the target window name in my custom UI is 5, and the player window is 4. I have attempted to modify the details of the file as I normally would to adjust the font size, but to no avail, they do not alter. Every other font size adjustment that I have (player level, percentages, hitpoints) remains the same size as it was prior to patching or SOE modification, only the name of my character and the name of my target have been locked in this limbo state of non-conformance.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? My expertise is limited to what I have been able to modify and customize for personal use and preference, nothing major. <br />
<br />
Anyone else having this issue without results, or better yet... WITH results?<br />
