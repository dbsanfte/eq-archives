 As you may have noted, there’s been some fallout from the 01/28 patch… to quote Cairenn: What happened here is that SOE pushed through 4 different downloads. Some folks got the correct one. It made no changes to the UI. Of the wrong ones, they came in 3 different flavours… But, no matter which of those three flavours you got, you did *not* get the corresponding file (BigBank, BodyTint or CharacterCreate)… At that point, EQ said &quot;gack&quot; and died. Read about the patch explained (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6048), or go right to Cairenn’s Fix (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6012), in the Patch Fixes (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=36) forum.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">02-02-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many of the mods submitted in January never made it to the Latest Updates list.  You caught up by skipping the first half of January in most categories.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that's a big problem, unless you are checking the files for viruses or something as you go through the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">02-02-2003, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He doesnt do anything with the files excpet report them.<br />
<br />
The File moderators (and my self) download each file and check for virus's before they approve. We also check for many other things. Anyways if you ever plan on downloading anything you must have a up to date virus scanner... otherwise your no better then the people who write them imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
/e scratches head confusedly<br />
<br />
I'm pretty I've reported every upload in January, except for those in the Mix &amp; Match category - those I haven't reported on since the 01/04. Now, they're not all in this update - for example, your Tiny Buff and Song mods were reported on in the 01/16 update.<br />
<br />
Admittedly it's been a bit confused - between patches and my new work schedule, it's been more difficult to keep a regular update. I've done what I could get to, in the meantime. Right now, it takes me about 8 hours to do an update - it's usually 1-2 hours without interruption, but work tends to interrupt. ;)<br />
<br />
If you see any uploads I've missed, send me a PM, I'll make sure they get in the next update (other than Mix &amp; Match, which, as it says up top will be caught up on Monday 2/3); do check earlier updates though, please, to be sure. :)</div></div><hr />
