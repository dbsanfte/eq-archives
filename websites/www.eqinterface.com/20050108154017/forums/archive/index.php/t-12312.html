<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalamos</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if any of you knew how I can add a stone texture graphic behind the buff area of my Pet Window.  Right now it's just black space, with the stone .tga for the buttons and other parts of the window.  I'd like to eliminate that black space so it doesn't look so goofy when I don't have a pet up hehe.<br />
<br />
I know this is possible because I've seen it on other windows, I just don't know what part of the code references the buff box window.  If someone could post what part of the code this would be in and what addition I need I'd greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
/cheers</div></div><hr />

It seems to be something specific in the code of Kaori's old UI design.  I'm using a heavily modded version of the Kaori original.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what the pet window uses to create the texture behind the buffs part of the window?  Maybe it was something added to the Animations file when the pet buffs were added to the window and I missed it?<br />
<br />
This is getting frustrating hehe.<br />
<br />
HELP!</div></div><hr />

That is the only thing I can think of.  The default pet buff window uses the dark background, I think.  Maybe you could define a background graphic for it instead calling the spicific color or background you want.<br />

That should take care of the black box in your pet window entirely.<br />

Hope this works and what you are looking for. And I apologize if its not.</div></div><hr />

I copied the dark_rock.tga and llight_rock.tga files from the default folder into my custom UI folder and there was no change.  The graphic behind my chat windows and other windows changed but not the buff window within the pet window.<br />
<br />
I'll try that suggestion tonight Zant thanks.</div></div><hr />
