<br />
Is it possible to read and write to a field in the guild or raid gui by clicking on a button?<br />
<br />
The idea is that I can gather names from the raid gui, then add dkp pnts the comments field of the guild managment tool.<br />
<br />
At the momment the guild uses the comments field in the guild Gui to keep dkp points.<br />
<br />
soo the desired process will be.::<br />
0: I click a button<br />
1: it  reads all the names of players in the raid from the raid gui.<br />
2: it compares the names of the raid with the names in the guild field.<br />
3: if a name matches, get the DKP number  from the commment field from the user name and add  a pnt dkp. Then write the new dkp number into the comments field for that name.<br />
<br />
This I think is a tough one. and I am not shure if it  is possible using xml..<br />
<br />
One thing to note, I can do all the comparison's and math and changes... etc using a shell script, (if external software can be executed). The only hard bit I can see is to be able to read from the raid/guild gui and write to the guild gui..</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no way that I know of to list players in a raid, but you could have them all join a channel and list them that way.<br />
<br />
You could write an external program that would scan your log file, searching for some key phrase like &quot;AWARD DKP&quot;.  So you would get your players into a channel, say &quot;AWARD DKP START 1&quot;, then &quot;/list raidchannel&quot;, then &quot;AWARD DKP END&quot;.  Your external program would read the names from the raid channel, read some external config file with everyone's dkp totals, and update the totals in the config file.<br />
<br />
It could also scan for things like &quot;SPEND DKP Luminarium 25&quot; to track expenditures.<br />
<br />
If I were doing this, I would put all the keyword messages in a special passworded channel to avoid potential false messages.<br />
<br />
For viewing the information in game, you could have your external program add comments to your guild file or just format it in a story window file.  It's probably easier to Alt-Tab to Excel or something.</div></div><hr />
