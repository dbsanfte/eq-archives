<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaVeWaNtSyOuDeA</div><div class="date">04-03-2003, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes i read it. And, i noticed that it said to post that error tihng, but no error or anything is coming up there. Its just not working. Like I said, when i try and load it it does the same thing it would do when zoning, but when it stops its exactly the same UI. <br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">04-03-2003, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your uierror.txt file is blank (witch is a very important piece of information you left out and we needed to know) you must have two everquest directorys. Due to a poor install script with some of the expansions it will create two everquest directorys.... one under /program files/everquest  and another under  /program files/sony/....  You need to figure out witch one is the correct one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaVeWaNtSyOuDeA</div><div class="date">04-03-2003, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, your right, there was a Sony one also. I tried doing it all over again in the son part, still is not working though... go, on type in the stuff im supposed to, and it goes like its zoning, stops and everythings the same...:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Methuselah</div><div class="date">04-03-2003, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe keep the name of it as nightelf-loy.<br />

I tried it and it works fine for me.  Some UI authors make mods so that they work with what they named it and if you rename the folder it goes in, it sometimes breaks the UI.  Might not be your problem, but just a thought, because i had it happen to me before, I named the folder something besides the name it was given and it did not work.  I deleted it and put the original back in with no rename and it worked fine.  I don't remember what mods do this, but i have seen a few.  Most you can rename to whatever you want, but some just won't like it.</div></div><hr />

What I was referring to was the file that has all your UI configurations for the character (mine, for example, is UI_Renaldor_40), which is found in your base EQ directory.  In that file under the [MAIN] section, there should be a line called UISkin=.  The name you gave the folder for your UI needs to replace whatever is here if it is different.</div></div><hr />
