%'s have also gone but i will reintroduce them if they are wanted.<br />

all warning/error messages have been cleaned up so should not cause undue UIErrors.txt and the non-compatable warning!<br />
window size is now 108 by 178. (went on a minamalizing frenzy again)<br />
<br />
Please leave your comments and feedback, i apreciate to know which direction to take things!<br />

			<div><strong>BIG SMILE HERE !</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>It is so great to see you are back and playing with your mods.  Norrath without Mafoo was a much sadder place.  I cannot play EQ without your Spell Bar and Player window.  I have always appreciated the look and feel of both of them.<br />
<br />
And while I simply adore your group mod, I have but one true wish.....not that you minimize it any further as all your mods are intrinsically minimized already by design and the content to take up as little screen acreage yet give the maximum amount of information AT A GLANCE, but instead that your group window be sized the same as your player window.  That way, I can place them side by side in the middle of the display on the bottome edge with chat windows on either side.  For those that stack them, they can be placed one atop the other in a seamless column.  <br />
<br />
I know you have been minimizing the group mod, but at the risk of repeating myself, your design is already minimized because of the layout of the information.  You are trying to make something perfect better.  And that is always hard to do.  But in truth, I like the look of the Rainbow alot.  I mean a whole lot!  Great design.<br />
:p <br />
<br />
Thanks for your inspiration and hard work.</div>

		<div>I think i agree curiously, i think i will size it identical to player info and put end caps back on.<br />
and style it all to match the player info.<br />
Expect a Group Window 2.2 released sunday evening (GMT)<br />
and possibly a Player Window 2.0 as well going to experiment with rainbow bars for that</div>

			<div><strong>Re: Horizontal Version</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>The rainbow bars make this mod beautiful.  But I'm also having a hard time with the lack of percentages.  It's not just that I'm biased because I play a healer, most people I know who I've showed this to are also having the same dilemma.. 'I'd love to make this part of my ui, but I'm not sure it's going to work without some numbers.'<br />
So basically, if you make a second version with %'s for the rest of us, you'll have twice the downloads =P<br />

			<div><strong>Names Dissapearing</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>been playing around with this a bit - got a horizontal version, with function key numbers and percentages - now trying to resolve the dissapearing names issue... I read a post here somewhere that explains why the names dissapear when a group member is out of zone - its because the window uses a seperate &quot;label&quot; for the name rather than the &quot;built in&quot; text that comes with the gauge...<br />
<br />
so,<br />
<br />
my problem is this - there are so many layered gauges that I'm unsure of which one to use for the text - or if it even matters - I seem to recall reading somewhere that it needs to be the gauge thats on the &quot;top&quot; layer for the text to show, but I'm really not sure - if anyone can shed some light I can get this finished pretty quickly - otherwise I'll keep messing with it till I figure it out.</div>

		<div>but hopefully you are still following this thread. I have to admit, I'm getting old and set in my ways - I much prefer the original style of your mod, and play with a friend that is adamant that health etc be reported to him in %'s (He's why I use your mods). Any chance of getting the upgraded version with the old graphics and getting the percents back? And please don't make anything any smaller - my 51 year old eyes can't sort out the little tiny letters anymore.<br />
<br />
Other than that, your mods are perfection - I would not use anything else.</div>
