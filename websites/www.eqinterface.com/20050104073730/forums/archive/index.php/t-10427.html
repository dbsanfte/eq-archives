<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shinjjo</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Over the last few days I have noticed that Iam unable to open the right click menu on any of my windows that let me modify faded level etc. I have no idea what is causing it. It started right after I added a custom friends window that has been modified to show plane if time items. I assumed it was that to begin with (although I had no idea how the new window and the problem were related) so I changed back to a back up copy of the same UI (Soes 1.6) that I know had previously worked perfectly. It didnt help, I still have the same problem.<br />
<br />
I was hoping maybe someone had seen the same problem and had a fix for it.<br />

Thanks in advance,<br />
