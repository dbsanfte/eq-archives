<br />
I use a modified version of Drakah's Lords of Everquest UI . For some reason, when I move windows around (like the &quot;give to an NPC&quot; window or a &quot;merchant&quot; window, they won't save the location. Every time I load up the game, they are right back where they were before again. I've tried different characters and it's always the same.<br />
<br />
My initial reaction was that my client config files somehow got set to Read-Only but I have checked it and it isn't. Anyone else have any suggestions please?<br />
<br />
I posted here rather than Drakah's site because I thought it was more of a general issue rather than specific to my UI. I could be wrong though.<br />
<br />
Anyway, a minor issue but one that is getting me increasingly frustrated so any help is appreciated. Thanks.</div></div><hr />
