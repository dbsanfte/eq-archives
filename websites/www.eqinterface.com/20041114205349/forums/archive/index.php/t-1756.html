<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dariathvaz</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my new targeting window, it started out quite a while ago done totally by hand in Photoshop and has gone thru countless revisions. The current incarnation of its look was done because the photoshop version was looking too &quot;flat&quot; and 2d. It still has quite a bit of polishing and tweaking needed, as well as some memory optimization that's just gonna be a major pain but won't get done 'till I'm completely done with the graphics. BTW, it's ANIMATED =)<br />
<br />
http://www.datacore.org/dariath/preview.gif <br />
<br />
Basically I'm posting to see if anyone would be interested in me finishing it up and making it into a real mod; or, if it's too large to be used by anyone but myself.  As a cleric, I spend plenty of time looking at this gauge and I wanted to make something a bit more exciting than a red line.  This is the only version of it I actually have packaged up and ready to distribute, and is kinda old actually. <br />
<br />
By actually making it into a mod, I mean cutting down the 24 seperate frames of animation by half or so and combining them into one file, then coding all that into it.  I also have about 5 different versions I've made that I might post to get input on which one people like best.  We'll see...<br />
<br />
As of right now some people may have issues running it but it works fine on my computer so I'm looking for some input on how it works on other peoples computers.  If it doesn't work for some reason please let me know or email (dariathvaz@hotmail.com) me so I can try to fix it.<br />

Installation:<br />
<br />
Just drop these files into whatever UI directory you like, it should replace the target window with my new spiffy target window. Please read the readme.txt</div></div><hr />

As it does get tiresom looking at lil red bars. But I generaly have the mob targeted and only have the person im healing targeted when they are in need. But it is a great idea and looks pretty cool. Just wondering how big it really looks compared to full screen.<br />

<br />
I downloaded and installed your target mod. I have to say I'm VERY impressed with your work. I've been tinkering around with some mods to make the UI look more like a video game and less like Micro$oft Winblows. You, my friend, have officially accomplished that.<br />
<br />
I'd be very interested in seeing the other ones that you've done.<br />

make a whole UI like this, I beg of you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn nice looking.  The only reason I wouldn't use something such as this is it is a little cumbersome (but could depend on screen size etc so may not seem so bad.)  Also it is very futuristic looking, would be good for SWG but EQ, seems a little out of place.  I tend to prefer plain looking or fantasy looking windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it.  it's a little big (but I can adjust that in the GIMP).  Also isn't quite the deisgn I'd shoot for.  personally, I'd love to see one done like this which has an animalistic, bestial (not tiger-striped! that doesn't really represent all manner of beasts...) I would most likely integrate it into the beastlord mod I am working on.<br />
<br />
If you have one that is beastial or animalistic, I'd love to see it :)</div></div><hr />

LOL<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice mod. And I agree, you should make a whole UI based on that design :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There would be no room for the game to take place.<br />
<br />
Though don't care for the look, I'll definetly agree that it's unique.</div></div><hr />

Some tweaks (reducing the size of the image and the amount of files associated with it) and this is perfect. Until then, I'm gonna keep using this one. Good thing I play at 1600x1200</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately I haven't had time to work on this much lately but I think I might be able to leave you guys with a little something.<br />
<br />
Here is the &quot;fantasy&quot; version; seems like most wanted more of a fantasy look to it.  Currently it's unanimated, but it is tons smaller filesize wise.   Same overall layout.<br />

Yes, I realize these are huge, I play at 1600x1200 so it's not in my way, and that's all I really care about.  It's possible I could put out a shrunk version, the detail would be quite reduced tho.<br />
<br />
As soon as I get some time I'll finish up the animations on this and polish it up a bit - if I get even more time eventually I plan on making a &quot;stone&quot; version, maybe even druidish one too.<br />
<br />
Hell, maybe even a minimalist version too for all those who can't stand the gigantic bars. =P<br />
<br />
Questions? Comments? Flames? Post here or send me an email.<br />

<br />
Sorry I haven't updated these in a while; I just kinda lost focus on this in the midst of everything else I've been doing and haven't really felt like or had the time to mess with it.<br />
<br />
I've been working on a complete redo of the interface with my spare time lately, highly customized to my tastes.   Due to its ever-changing state, it most likely won't ever see public release.   Eventually, I may end up posting a pic of it on the pre-beta section to see what kind of response I get - which may or may not further inspire me to prep it for a public release.<br />
<br />
As for the target bars... well, they're pretty much in limbo.   I might get some spurt of inspiration one day and pop out another, but it's not likely at this time.   If anyone feels like resizing and recoding them, please, be my guest.   All I ask is that I'm given credit for the original artwork.<br />
<br />
-Dariath<br />
<br />
ps - kasca, please stop bumping this thread...</div></div><hr />

I love and use them both for different characters.<br />
My only wishs now is if the fantasy one look had the dynamics as the first. Perhaps the orbs on the ends glowing : )<br />
The targets name a different color then the white ...such as a blue like the bar and a bit smaller font, since some of the mob names can be long.<br />
