If ppl want to risk being banned by buying plat and such off sites, that's their prerogative.  I hardly ever use the bazaar, and if i do its for Prismatic dye or something.  If I don't earn it/find it, then i don't get it to use, this is how the game is meant to be played.  There will always be cheaters, and exploiters and those willing to support said cheaters/exploiters.  The only thing anyone can do is account for their own actions.  Is it immoral, yes; is it unethical, yes; is it wrong, yes; is there anything you alone can do about it, no.  Unless SOE, Ebay etc. set specific policies that deny people use of this venue, and actually hold people legally accountable for this type of behavior, it will continue.</div></div><hr />

As for the Bazaar Prices they are rather insane, which means people will get the pp required to purchase these items any way they can, and not many are ethical. This is one reason I run my characters solo. I have a Pally at 51, warrior at 45 and beastlord at 48. All gained their levels and EARNED their levels with skill of the game. Sure I have bought items from the Bazaar and I will continue to do do so. but my equipment has been EARNED or made. It takes TIME to accomplish all this, but Im proud of the accomplishment. When I group I know the character that I have will be the best a group can have. PL any buying extreme equipment doesn't raise ones skill and THAT is what counts.<br />
Sony could take a look at GW and make SOLO missions for those who wish to be solo artists. I have always felt accomplished after a kill knowing it was my kill, my skill, that gained whatever has dropped.<br />
Enough said: I could continue for page after page... LOL</div></div><hr />
