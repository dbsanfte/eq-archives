<br />
I had problems crashing to desktop with the LoY release as well.<br />
<br />
Win2000,Geforce2 64M,AC'97 onboard sound....<br />
<br />
Updated Windows with recommended DL's and updated video driver to newest available... problem gone.<br />
<br />
Might wanna try that first if you haven't.</div></div><hr />

LoY release. It seems that if I am in a raid, and I zone more than<br />
twice (ie die, rez, then TL) I crash to desktop every time. Usually<br />
need to do a hard reboot after that to get back in again too.<br />
I am up to date on drivers, I have XP, ti4200, AMD2100, 1G- RAM<br />
I use vert 2.5 UI with TKing spell book. Haven't tried default UI<br />
yet to see if it still does it or not that way. I guess I probably <br />
should. Juse curious if anyone else has had a similar problem.<br />
<br />
Edit:  just checked my UIerrors file and there are a bunch of<br />
warnings there. Perhaps this is/part of my problem?<br />
Here is the file if it helps:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suggested replacing that one item...the crashes may end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">03-08-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bakah99 - The skin you are using has an EQUI_Animations.xml file, right?  It isn't current.  You need to make the changes to it that are listed in the 24 Feb Patch Fixes thread, when LoY went live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yarg Soulfyre</div><div class="date">03-11-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some more information..<br />
<br />
Last night I died a LOT. And every time upon rez, I would crash<br />
back to desktop. I could take it no more, so while I awaited the<br />
cleric, I set my UI to Default instead of Vert2.5 <br />
<br />
The rez window popped up, I hit yes....<br />
And I didn't crash!!<br />
I poked around in my control panel (Alt-O) and noticed that<br />
my resolution was at 1280 x 1024 x 16 instead of 32.<br />
So I think my problem may be linked to that.<br />
<br />
It is weird, because I do not have any problem with zone crashes<br />
when I am just in an EXP group. It only happens when I am in raid<br />
<br />
If there is more information I can give to help nail this one down<br />
please let me know. I am just happy I have found a temporary<br />
solution so that I don't have to get so frustrated on raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
Yarg</div></div><hr />
