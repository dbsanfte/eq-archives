<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarelan</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A long time ago Geddine (I believe that is his name) created a great Target window that is four times as long as the normal window and contains a casting bar underneath the target's HP bar.<br />
<br />
I have been using it ever since, maintaining it myself as the new patches have happened.  I have run into a problem though.  I can't get it to work with the /con color functionality that was added on Nov 5th.<br />
<br />
I know that the targetbox graphic in targetbox.tga will need to be lengthened, but I also know that code will need to be added to the target XML file.  I just don't know what code to add.<br />
<br />
I am hoping that someone that is better at this than I, will be able to help.  I am attaching the pieces that I use for the target window in the hopes that someone would be able to modify the, or teach me what I need to do to modify them.<br />

Thanks for your help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarelan</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nevermind.  I managed to get a copy of Adobe Photoshop and some spare time.  I was able to get it working properly.<br />
<br />
I have done some more research as well.  It was known as Geddine's 4X Target Window.<br />
<br />
I have attached the working version here if anyone else is interested.  It is not perfect, but it certainly does the job for me.<br />
<br />
Basically it is a target window that is 4x the normal length.  The target name and HP percentage are centered above the HP bar.  Below the HP bar is a casting bar.  It now also does the /con color background from the Nov 5th patch.<br />
<br />
Its only partially my work, so I don't know the policy of uploading it for the Downloads section.  Moderator, if you feel that it is OK, please let me know and I will submit it properly.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
