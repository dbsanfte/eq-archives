<br />
I'm sure this has been answered a hundred times or more but I cannot find the Thread it appears in so I will ask again. I have heard that there is a possible EULA conflict with the folks who have taken the time and effort to add the Map and Tradeskill options to their UI Mods. Something to do with deleting or altering the In Game Help files to make room for the stuff was I believe the problem. Can anyone verify this for me or refute it? <br />
<br />
Several of my Guildies are looking at getting these UI Mods and I don't want to see any of them get burned for using something that might violate their EULA's<br />
<br />
Thanks much!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was the purpose of the newUI, if they take that away from us, it defeats the purpose of new user interface.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can draw out your own maps and keep them next to you while you play, so who cares if you save paper by using a digital one? I've got a map of practically every zone on paper, and I can make my own if need be, so I don't see the point to downloading a map mod.<br />
<br />
While we're on the subject, I have had a real timer sitting next to my computer, for almost as long as I've been playing, so I don't see the point to downloading a timer mod either, hehe.</div></div><hr />

And as far as i know, verant is banning anyone who is using EQw on his servers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the maps isn't against the EULA, but modifing their help files to allow recipies are, that's what was posted on the trade skills forums.<br />
<br />
You're modifing a property owned file, thus against the EULA.<br />
<br />
We are given premission to modify and do what ever we want inside the uifiles directory. But outside, VI has the final say. help.html is located outside of that directory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Inserting maps are most definitely *not* a violation of the EULA.  You can do whatever you want, as long as it stays *inside* the UIFILES directory;)</div></div><hr />

Like I said. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(Since I have to make some comment on this, I think I'm obliged to :D ) - The reality is that there is no way for Verant to know if you are changing any of these files.  You could honestly do it with the help file and they could never tell.  They can also make anything they want to against the EULA if they find it &quot;disruptive to Game Play&quot; or something like that.  However, it sounds like they're not touching that one.<br />
<br />
Besides, if they open up the GUI some more and let us use STML in a box other than the Help window, it would make it much easier.  As it is now, we'll just have different windows to put the maps in.  If you could do symbolic links in Windows, you could link the help.html file to something within the uifiles directory and bypass it altogether, but now I'm just reading off my wish list.:D</div></div><hr />

It's technically possible to do a lot of things. If Verant didn't want people doing this, they could checksum the help.html and then verify your file against the checksum when zoning or opening the Help window and if the checksum doesn't match, they could flag a warning or something.<br />
<br />
Whether they'd do it or not, who knows. But it's definitely technically possible to detect it if they were looking for it.<br />

They could NOT legally pull it off your machine to see if you modified it.   The MOST they could do is patch it back to default.  They have no way therefore, to tell if you modified it or if it was just corrupted for some other reason...  They could assume anything but from a legal standpoint which this is, they wouldnt know what you did unless they violate teh law themselves.<br />

No big brothers at Verant now tsk tsk tsk<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tipop</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for EQW, I have not heard of anyone being banned for using it.  Almost everyone I know does, and at least one person (my girlfriend) has to use it, as EQ crashes two-thirds of the time when run normally but runs flawlessly in EQW.  (It's her graphics card, I'm sure.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kungpo</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If it isnt against the EULA to edit files in the UiFiles directory and not Illegal to Use maps why not edit the friends or window selector windows to contain this info ..like a duplication of the Help window..therefor it wouldnt be illegal ..becuase your then not editing help.html<br />
<br />
just a thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weab</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">since when was it ok to do something as long as you can't be caught?<br />
<br />
there's no grey area. if it's against the rules it's against the rules.</div></div><hr />

Never went to fast in your car or smoke a cigarette before your parents thought it was okay for you to do it, or had a beer before then?   LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SO far almost every forum I seen that even begins to talk about modifications to the help file, maps in such area, or even EQW for some odd reason just seem to start taking all sorts of views BESIDES the reason of post started.<br />
<br />
This just seems to amaze me :D  <br />
<br />
So many just seem to have that perfect lifestyle and Never sway to the Dark Side, hehe.<br />
<br />
Ok, I use EQW - EQWatcher and I am a parent of 5 children. Oh, spank me now please :)<br />
<br />
:::::  :rolleyes: Looks for forum to be locked, rofl :rolleyes: :::::<br />
<br />
In the end, just stay away from modified Help files and stick to just skin directory to keep the Big brother happy.</div></div><hr />
