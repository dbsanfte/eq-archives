<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your zip needs to be under 800kb. Only include the files needed for the mod not the entire default folder. Pictures must be in jpg/gif format no larger then 1024x768.<br />
<br />
Also only 1 attachment per post. Hopefuly in vBulletin 3 there will be multiple attachments per post features.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allissiya</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I keep getting messages of I am not authorized to upload to this forum . And everytime I try to look at photo another IE window opens and tells me I am not logged in but I am logged in . So I have no clue how to get around that .<br />
<br />
Also it has ONLY the files that are changed . The UI files and the stuff pertaining to only them . I can email you the zip and maybe you can find out why it wont go . I could zip them seperately and send them that way but my file has less in it then others such as StoneAngel zip . So I should be able to upload mine.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT .... Ok I changed phot to Jpeg works fine but I cant get the zip file working am still trying to get it smaller lol <br />
<br />
Be back soon</div></div><hr />

I need to play the game so I grabbed these files for now . I will get my own artwork within my UI and post my origianl work when I am finished. ATM the only thing I used from my own was the Animations UI file and my .tga files for the marble backgrounds. <br />

Zip files will be attached for the things that are hard to find or get without DL a buncha mods and picking out the files.</div></div><hr />
