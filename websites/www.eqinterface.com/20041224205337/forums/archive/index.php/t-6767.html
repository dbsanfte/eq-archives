 The Legacy of Ykesha (http://www.legacyofykesha.com/): Release Date Feb 24, 2003<br />
Looks like all the UI-affecting announcements have been made; those would be the Extended Bank Window (http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_bank.jsp), Enhanced Looking For Group/Players Windows (http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_lfg.jsp), Conversation Journal (http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_npcjournal.jsp), Armor Dye/Body Tint Window (http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_armordyes.jsp), Guild Management Tool (http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_guildtool.jsp), Inventory Charm Slot (http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_charms.jsp), and Cartography System (http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_cartography.jsp). Many authors are ready for these changes, others are still in the works; regardless, the day of the final patch and release (currently scheduled for Monday, February 24th) will undoubtedly be a high-traffic day here at EQ Interface/EQGUI.<br />
<br />
If the author of your UI or mod has a patch or new version out already, please download and install it now; if they haven't, please be patient with them, and with us. Watch the Patch Fixes (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=36) forum for the best information, and be sure to go through the Read Me (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=44) forum carefully and completely before attempting to post. Watch this space as well; Kudane and Dolby will have specific suggestions to make Patch/Release Day goe as smoothly as possible for everyone!<br />
<br />
 Authors/Developers: Please make sure you follow the Submission Guidelines (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?threadid=6568) as detailed by Kudane and Dolby; this will make it easier for you to get your work seen, and for users to find it!<br />
