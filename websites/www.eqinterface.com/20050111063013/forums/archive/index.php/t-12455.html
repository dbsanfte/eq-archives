Sony Online Entertainment has exciting news for all EverQuest players. As the world of Norrath evolves and expands, so too does the technology powering EverQuest.  Sony Online Entertainment is making significant upgrades to the EverQuest engine which will allow SOE to provide players with the great game, but on a much more stable and efficient platform. SOE anticipates patching in the new engine sometime during the next month or two.<br />
<br />
Part of this change will result in the need for all EverQuest players to upgrade to DirectX 9 (DX9), the latest version of Microsoft's 3D software. As best as SOE can determine, a very small percentage of our current EverQuest player base (less than 1%) may find that their older video cards are not compliant with DX9. To find out if a video card is DX9 compliant, players should check with the manufacturer of their card (video drivers may need to be updated as well). Players can also consult the EverQuest tech page on Sony Online Entertainment's website, located at http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support.jsp.<br />
<br />
Sony Online Entertainment is very concerned that even a small number of our players may have issues running EverQuest. To address this, SOE has worked out a deal with NVIDIA and eVGA.com to provide current EQ players access to discounts on a number of newer video cards that are DX9 compliant. eVGA.com will be offering EQ players discounts on several PC video cards that utilize Nvidia technology, from the affordable GeForce FX 5600XT all the way up to the GeForce FX 5900 Ultra. Current EverQuest players can go to http://www.evga.com/eq/ to take advantage of this special offer.<br />
<br />
While 1% is a very low percent that equates to about 45,000 people who may have to upgrade... there are many low-cost video cards our there. and you have a month or two to save. <br />
<br />
While EVGA listed above has some top of the line cards, I posted this early last week.. (and got lots of comments)<br />
<br />
I found the GeForce FX 5200 (http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=10343936&amp;loc=220) with 128MB of Ram on Buy.com for $78.14. and free shipping. So if you have been looking to upgrade your video card, click on the name above, and check it out. It's the base model for GeForce's new FX line and and nearly over $50.00 of normal retail.<br />
<br />
<br />
If in doubt about your card, go to the address above. (or login to the test sever, it requires DX9 now)<br />
