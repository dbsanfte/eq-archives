<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knight</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone explain viewport to me?  I mean, I know how it works.  But I just don't understand what it does.  I didn't want to try it because I finally have my UI set up nice and neat and didn't want to have to back up all my files and stuff in case I end up doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
From the UI manual it just sounded to me like you were making the graphics output on your screen smaller than your screen....  and I couldn't understand why anyone would want to do that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rainstar</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fading of the various windows drove me nuts until I played with the /viewport command.  While I was working with it I realized that it does NOT change what you see of 'the world' it just makes it smaller.  I have my interface set so that all of the UI boxes stay solid (in the display fading stuff under options, put the sliders on the left all the way to the left, and the sliders on the right all the way to the right) and my 'picture' resized so that my UI boxes don't cover any of it.  (As a Bard, with the fading, I could not be certain I was actually singing when the gem box and hotkey box were faded.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did alot of playing with this function..<br />
<br />
here is what i learned<br />
<br />
1. it will not distort your view<br />
by this I mean, that if you make a view port that is 100 pix wide and 480 pix tall it will look like your looking through a crack in a fense..  it will not &quot;squish&quot; everything you woudl see at 640 pix into 100 pix<br />
<br />
2. It you keep the correct purportion you see everything<br />
640x480 800x600 1024x768 1280x1024... what ever setting you use, if you keep your view port the correct &quot;8x6&quot; ratio you will see everything, just shrunk down. anything else will crop (see above)<br />
<br />
3. Smaller Rez seems to help lag<br />
So far all test show that if you are getting horrid lag a quick view port of 500x375 will allow you to see and reduce your lag to save your butt.. again this is being tested soooo give feed back if you see this work.<br />
<br />
hope those 3 tips help.. i will work on a more comprehisive(sp) instructions including pictures<br />

But of course, it takes less work on your computer's part to draw less stuff.  If it needs to update less pixels for each frame, it will be able to draw that frame better.  This is one of my big thumbs up new features, lets my slightly slower second machine run EQ almost as smoothly as my main one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I set a view port of 500x375 while in the bazaar... i have no trouble moving around.. and can reset it to my 1024x768 when I leave =)<br />
<br />
and my selling mule account just stays at this setting...<br />
<br />
:D <br />
