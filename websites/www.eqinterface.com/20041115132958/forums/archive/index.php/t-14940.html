I ran it through sidl and it showed up like a lot of the ones I make.  I hope someone could get it to work. <br />
  I did like your Character UI nice set up in game I have played for years and never could get my ui the way I wanted it.  I liked the viewport which is the first one my 20.5 monitor has ever seen.  Nice work wished I could get it to work in game. :nana:</div></div><hr />

Happy hunting folks !</div></div><hr />

I would like to download this file you made, to patch my existing UI with, but cant seem to find where you have put it ...<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;EDIT&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Ignore, found it :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sage Blazynice</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok all updated and awaiting moderation :)  If any problems please pm me or leave a message here :)  It has been tested on beta and no errors and works perfectly fine as of 2 : 30 mst :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sage Blazynice</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have received numerous IM's PM's and the like asking me if this is designed to work with OOW the new expansion.  Yes, It is all up to date for this expansion.  I hope this clears up some confusion :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tristam29</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should update the picture to show some OoW features.  Not only are they very slick looking, but they will probably cut down on your IMs and PMs.  Also, just because I didn't have time to try at lunch, does this UI have an option for a separate Pet Window that disappears when your lose your pet?  As an enchanter, I like having my pet window disappear on a charm break.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, unfortunatly not on the pet window. I used to have mine do the same thing so I switched the format.  The attack indicator is the player window and the pet window is the player, clickies and pet window.  Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tristam29</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like your style, but if you separated the Pet information and put it back into a separate window I would LOVE your UI.  You could change the player window from just an attack indicator to what would essentially be the current pet window.  Instead of a pet tab in the upper right you could have the attack indicator.  Then the pet and player information could be up at the same time.  I think a lot of pet classes would like this.  I know I would.</div></div><hr />
