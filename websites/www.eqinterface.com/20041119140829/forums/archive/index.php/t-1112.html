I'm not familiar with the tags or anything, is there any place I can go to get a heads up about how to do this? Any help would be greatly appriciated.. thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started XML by grabbing a book and read.<br />
<br />
Then I grabbed an XML file and XMLSpy and played with it. I messed stuff up, then looked up as to why I was getting &quot;not a valid XML File&quot; error. Learned about DTDs, etc.<br />
<br />
I would suggest first understand the fundamentals of XML. It's a similar structure to HTML in that it uses &lt;&gt; style tags, but nothing more.<br />
<br />
Unlike HTML, XML doesn't have a set tag set.<br />
<br />
Think of XML files as a really fancy windows INI file. They do the complete exact same thing, but XML just displays it different, putting it all in a hierarchy, makeing it easier to read and easier to parse.<br />
<br />
That's it .. There are other things to XML, like DTD, data type definition, and Schema files. They are used to define an XML document. Make sure it's &quot;valid&quot; before a program trys to read it and die horriably cause of false formats.<br />
<br />
Next step is to play with it. Open a file, make a BIG change, like change the Length of 23 to 400. Or the size from 10x30 to 323x492 and see what happens.<br />
Change a name from 'Target' to '*(#&amp;#*#  TARGET #$($@(@' or something.   Something nice and big so you can easily spot the changes. Then you'll see. ;)<br />
<br />
Oh, also - I find printing out files seems to help as well. Easier to look at things on a hard sheet of paper then trying to grasp it on the computer screen. Some can do that, others can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah .. also, forgot to mention:<br />
<br />
When you work on the EQUI, look for the UIError.txt file located in your Everquest directory.<br />
<br />
Shortcut that!! It will be a MAJOR life saver in trouble shooting why your ui crashed EQ or why EQ reverted back to the default skin.<br />
<br />
Place the shortcut someplace that's easy to access by you.<br />
I've added it as a file in my project in XMLSpy right on the top level so I can just click it when ever I get an error.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kistanth</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks alot for the help, now I have somewhere to begin. I have another question tho.   Is there a program that you can preview how the object will look in the game? Seems like a pain to go all the way into the game to see if &quot;Target&quot; changes to &quot;&amp;%$)(Target)($%&amp;&quot; correctly.</div></div><hr />

And I guarantee, the moment it's done, it'll be all over this forum more than the 8/14 patch.  hehe  <br />
<br />
I know I'm anxious to see it (and use it).  :D<br />
