<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romia</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to modify the minimize button's function?  For instance, changing the shrunk size to be larger?  I'm working on a mod for a window that has alot of info, I want to have some info visible at the shrunk size and then all of the info visible at the full size. <br />
<br />
If modifying the existing button isn't doable, anyone know if creating a new button to do what I want is possible and how to go about it?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

This (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2267) thread is a good outline of the things the new UI can not do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is probably will be answered the same as what he asked before, but I'll ask it anyways.<br />
<br />
I wanted to make a done button in a different window.  The New &quot;Combat Skill Select Window&quot; I removed the title bar with the little close button on it, and brought over a done button like those in the Skills and Inventory Window.  I got the button to be displayed, but of course it doesn't work.  <br />
<br />
I guess I just thought that you couldn't make any &quot;New&quot; buttons as in what they could do, but an already made button that was coded for that purpose would work.<br />
<br />
So the question is: Is the done button ever going to work or should I just give up on it and wait until they allow us to add new buttons?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advanced for possibly re-answering a question.<br />

Yeah, Kinda figured that.  But I wanted to confirm before I wasted anymore time on it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for clearing that up for me :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you were to create a new window template, and the border pieces were larger, would the shrunk size change to fit the minimum size that these border pieces need to all show?<br />
<br />
For clarity, some of the border pieces expand and contract to fit the window size, and some do not.  So if your 4 border pieces that make up the right side were all 10 px tall, wouldn't the minimum size be 40px?</div></div><hr />
