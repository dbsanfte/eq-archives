<br />
I hear rumor of a program that can identify what a MoB is carrying in game BEFORE you kill it...   anyone know?<br />
<br />
It would work something like... targeting a mob and seeing its inventory.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wondering</div></div><hr />

It is a &quot;packet sniffer&quot; that reads the information going between your system and the EQ Server.  It breaks the EULA, and if Verant discovers you using it, they most definitely will lock your account from being able to be used again (happened to a friend of mine, who had to get another account (buy another copy of the game) and start again.  But ShowEQ does in fact, show what item the mob has equipped - if it is equipped on them.</div></div><hr />

SEQ can tell you one thing about the mob's &quot;loot&quot;.<br />
That is - What graphic the NPC has in hand.<br />
This is exactly what you see if you where standing 5 feet from the beast, or if it was whaling it upon your soft skin (or scaley) head.<br />
<br />
It can not tell you loot. It can not tell you what the X sword/weapon is. Loot is all server side handled and not even decided until you kill/loot the beast. This is how VI was able to implement the 'Trival Loot Code' they had a while back (and still active on the FV server).<br />
<br />
SEQ is illegal to use and VI will terminate your account w/ou warning if you're cought using it.<br />
<br />
I hope I cleared up a few things for you. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Can't ya tell. I don't like talking about this or that windowing app on public forums.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was lookin' at the website for SEQ last night... I suppose I'm more curious than anything.  I'm not wishing to risk terminating my EQ account to find out what a mob's loot is.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for your info though!</div></div><hr />
