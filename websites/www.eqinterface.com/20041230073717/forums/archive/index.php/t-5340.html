<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some extra Tips From Alan (Absor) at EverQuestLive.com (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53589) on the EQWindows...<br />
<br />
The default key command ALT-SHIFT-R  is the command to release your mouse to the desktop when you go into window mode... to return simply click inside the EQ Window.<br />
<br />
Also this command can be remapped in the option menu, (I reset mine to CNTRL-ALT-R, just familar to me.... hmmmmm wonder why)<br />
<br />
Also we hit a new record with 944 people online at one time, and 65,000 members..<br />
<br />
Let me throw this out: donations since November have totalled $35 dollars (our dedicated server is more than this each month). I realize with Christmas a lot of people had little extra cash, but now that the new year is here.. clicking the donation button is one way to asure we are here and continue improving the site.<br />

 *  Much better support than Sony/VI<br />
 *  Much better thought into nerfing bozos who post.<br />
 *  Much more educated questions and answers from posters and especially Moderators.<br />
 *  Much more solid UI's and PATCH information from Cairenn et al...<br />
<br />
Even if only HALF of the registered people did a price check and donated ONE DOLLAR to your service to this community, wouldn't that pretty much cover the cost of the server and maintenance?<br />
<br />
I for one would be ashamed to pay RL money for an Everquest Item on EBAY and not be able to justify handing over a measly SODA (ONE DOLLAR) or 2 CANDYBARS (ONE DOLLAR) to help keep www.eqgui.com and www.eqinterface.com going.<br />
<br />
C'mon you guys.  Show your support to these people.  Click the DONATE NOW icon and use pay pal to send your ONE DOLLAR.<br />

Another site that I frequent often (streaming music) held a fund drive to help pay for servers, legal fees, etc. and managed to collect 500 times the amount collected here, and they accomplished that in the three weeks before Christmas.<br />
This site is way more helpful then some music playing on your PC.<br />
So everyone that can should donate. (whats $1, doesn't even buy a coke at the machine anymore)<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow many people have donated these past 2 days!<br />
<br />
We are up around $250 now witch is enough for a server payment and a little left over to pay for next months.<br />
<br />
I'll be going through all the donation emails and marking your accounts. It may take a little time though :)</div></div><hr />

I didn't want one either, but they stuck it on there anyway.  /shrug<br />

I'm glad to see that folks are helping out, I'd hate to see this site go down.  There is so much help, support and creativity here that folks freely share ... it would be a shame to have that just disappear.  Even if I do become a cranky mod once in a while.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have only seen you get cranky after the 4th or 5th ignored post that contained the fix or link to the fix.<br />
<br />
Checked my e-mail this morning, Thanks Dolby, wasn't expecting that at all.<br />
<br />
Back to searching for that &quot;Perfect UI&quot; (No fear it will change before next week)<br />

There have been so many of you I cant keep up with the thank you letters but I plan to send every one who has donated one.<br />
<br />
We are now up to about $400 witch should support our server for about 3 months. :)</div></div><hr />
