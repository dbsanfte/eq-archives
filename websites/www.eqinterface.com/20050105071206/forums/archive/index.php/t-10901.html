<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nvsniper</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been away from eq for about a year now, and with as fast as this game changes, that's an eternity.<br />
<br />
I've been looking to get back into it, however i was wondering if SOE was planning on putting up a brand new server, one where no player could transfer or split to it from another server..<br />
Just a brand new server for a fresh start.  I figured this would make getting back into the game easier than trying to catch up to the thousands of people that are lightyears ahead of me now.<br />
Anyone know?<br />
<br />
Oh and in case you're wondering why im posting my question here, it's because my work blocks most game related sites, including castersrealm which is my fav. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Supposely the release date now is sometime in march of 2004. No characters, items, plat will be transferable from the original EQ. Plus a whole new graphics engine and mobs, zones, items, classes, and races.<br />
<br />
Tho they are good at delays...<br />
<br />
As for what I know now, there is a server that they started that can't be used to transfer from any other server, but I've totally forgot the server name, but by now, they already have lvl 65 characters on it I'm sure</div></div><hr />

And yes, within the second week of it being open, someone attained 60th level. Now the place is riddled with them.</div></div><hr />
