I see many things that affect us as players differently than the same actions affect mobs.  I think instead of giving mobs advantages over players, that players should be able to use the same tactics in a fight that mobs use against the players.</div></div><hr />

If the mob is close enough that it can hit me, I am close enough that I can hit it.</div></div><hr />

Ever since I've been playing over the course of the last two years, whenever you hit the bind wound button, you would repeatedly kneel and stand.  Last night, I was sitting, and proceeded to bind wound like i always have, when lo and behold I remained sitting.  When i stood up and hit bind wound, i would kneel; but when I sat and hit bind wound, i stayed sitting and had the opportunity to med while i bandaged myself.  Is this a new feature, a glitch, or am I just plain retarded and its always been this way?</div></div><hr />

Perhaps it's taking into consieration longer arm reach of the mob?  From past experiences, most game combat systems/mechanics have the torso as the main focus of attack.  And with a longer reach, it can hit you before you can hit it.<br />

o O ( this is just speculation on my part, and I could very well off my rocker :P )<br />

And to your question Inokis.........<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it has always been that way.</div></div><hr />

HP Regen<br />
---------------------<br />
- All characters should now regenerate HP faster when sitting.  The longer you sit, the faster you regenerate! <br />
- You will not receive increased regen while under the effects of a DOT or while feigned.<br />
- You can now bandage yourself up to 70% of your HP. Folks with the appropriate AA abilities can bandage above 70%.<br />
- You can now bandage while sitting.<br />
<br />
<br />
same time as /rewind and surname changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zonnai</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, its new, you can bind wound while sitting thought if I recall, your regen sitting regen stops while binding.  So there really is no difference between sitting and binding and standing and binding EXCEPT it used to grey out your bind if you were sitting and pressed it.</div></div><hr />

Ah, but if it can reach out with its long arms and hit me, then I can hit its hand.  Heh.</div></div><hr />

And lets not forget about NPC ability to cast OUTDOOR ONLY spells INDOOR!?!  I hate seeing mobs in LDoN and Upper/Lower Guk constantly casting sow and other buffs.  I say if PCs can't do it, NPCs shouldn't beable to either.  This has bugged me since the new GoD Leadership XP and the Spell Awareness ability.</div></div><hr />
