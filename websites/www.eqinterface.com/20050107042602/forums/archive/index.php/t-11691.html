So.... I'm gonna put it here too in hopes that someone will be able to give me some idea what to do abou it.  The window looks like this on all my computers....<br />
<br />
I am having a problem (suprise) with the new combat ability window.  The window is there, but it's all garbled.  Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.<br />
<br />
http://webpages.charter.net/warren360/combatabilitywindow.jpg<br />
<br />
I use Soes, installed clean for v1.6 and love it, but I have no clue about this XML stuff.  Thank you in advance!<br />
<br />
Ps.  The above window is the EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml file.  I have not been able to get to the EQUI_CombatSkillsSelectWindow.xml so I have no idea what it looks like.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burner Of Souls</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to copy the EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml file from the default UI directory into your custom UI directory.<br />
<br />
Then make a copy of window_pieces_06.tga and window_pieces_07.tga from the default UI and rename them to something like original_windows_pieces_06.tga etc.<br />
<br />
Then modify your EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml file by replacing all window_pieces_06.tga to original_window_pieces_06.tga and window_pieces_07.tga to original_window_pieces_07.tga.</div></div><hr />

window_pieces_06.tga and window_pieces_07.tga<br />

should be just original_window_pieces06.tga and original_window_pieces07.tga<br />

when you are doing your search &amp; replace</div></div><hr />

Less chance of getting messed up in the future when SOE changes something else ...</div></div><hr />

Yes thank you very much.  Now if I can figure out how to make that window bigger so I can see the text.  <br />
<br />
Down towards the bottom of the EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml file you'll find<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Sizable&gt;false&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt;<br />
<br />
change to:<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Sizable&gt;true&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt;<br />
<br />
It doesn't change the button sizes, but it allows for dragging the window to the desired shape. Oh, and the fix with the windows pieces worked great for me. Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />

I am using Vert along with the 2 files that were put up to fix the patch from Thursday.<br />

I also made the modifications listed on this thread.  I can resize my combat abilities window; however, the buttons remain small.<br />

Any help would be greatly appreciated, trying to get this all straight before tonight.</div></div><hr />
