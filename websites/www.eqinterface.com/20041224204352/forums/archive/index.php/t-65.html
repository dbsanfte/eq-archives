<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qandalf</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would love to see full width (across top screen) exp and aaexp bars. Wouldn't want HP, mana and stamina bars to be full width - just the exp bars. Might then be able to actually see exp move. =)<br />
<br />
I know there is one mod on site which puts all the main bars on top of screen at full width for 1600x1024 but unfortuanately I play in 1024 by 768 mode. Besides health bars and such at full width would be of little value in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

This is just an assuption(sp), haven't tested it</div></div><hr />

as site admin, former copy editor, and all around journalistic-driven loser, I hate to take an opinion on anything, but I have to agree.<br />
<br />
That full length health bar mod we host is rather useless as 1600X1024 is rather useless as a resolution until the 3 GHZ chip becomes standard.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is, nobody knows how the author did it. or at least thats what people are letting on.</div></div><hr />

This is 65ths of a yellow bubble. and 13ths of a blue bubble.  That means you are just wasting space if you make blue bubbles more than 13 pixels wide.  However, the old exp window has approx 20-pixel bubbles so if you expanded that to 26 pixels it would look a little better.</div></div><hr />

That's how the author of that big one did it. I tried just resizing the gauge in the xml, but it made no difference. It seems to size itself from the background graphic.</div></div><hr />

so a 330px wide bar would be ideal...this also for all the other stats/gauge?</div></div><hr />

I love customizing as you can see. :) Anyway here's a prototype of something I started last night, but I stopped because I didn't know in what window to stick it in. I wanted to put it in its own window, but the schema-program relationship doesn't allow new windows. I guess I can make an extra-long player window. The only problem is you can't have a window be too big or else you eat up space where you can click, like you can't click through an invisible player window.<br />

PS How did you find out that experience is updated every 1/330ths of a full level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sparr</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, if you made the bar 330px wide then the yellow pixels would be accurate but the blue would be wasted.  the yellow bar would increase 1 pixel at a time which would be 5 blue pixels.  the optimal small size would be 65 pixels wide, but any multiple of that would work for those with poor eyesight.<br />
<br />
ps:  old secret.  if its wrong then id be happy to learn otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Changing the length of bars is not overly hard but lengthy to explain.  I have only adjusted my Target bar (you can find it listed in the mods), other bars length is just fine.</div></div><hr />
