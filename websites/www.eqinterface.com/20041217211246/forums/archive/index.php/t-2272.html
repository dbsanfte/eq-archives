What is a characters status during the /LOAD or /LOADSKIN event?<br />
<br />
Clearly the computers busy and the character is in-accessible to the player.   So is this simply a really vulnerable time or is more like when you zone?  Do you leave the world and get put back?</div></div><hr />

I was on my monk in LOIO, and I had an Iksar Maruader on me.  I was swimming in the water, and it kept hitting me.  Then I did /loadskin, and the game paused for a while, then when I came back on, the Iksar Marauder came at me from in front.  I think what the game does is send out a &quot;dummy you&quot; like what happens in lag spikes during traveling, escaping, and whatnot.  So the Iksar was chasing me, then the &quot;other me&quot; disappeared and he started to come back after me, and I was behind him.  So I'm guessing it is just a big lag spike in the game, and I usually never do it where I won't be able to get help if I need it.  Hope this helps ya. :D :D :D <br />
