now, i try to get back into EQ for the first time tonight...<br />
i get past server select....<br />
i get past character selest....<br />
but when i get to the next load screen to get into the game, every time, about a minute or two in, i get that &quot;EverQuest has detected that your client may have crashed&quot; error box...<br />
what is this and what do i need to do to fix it and actually play for the first time in months?<br />
can anyone please help me out here?<br />
<br />
oh, and if this is in the wrong forum, big apologies and feel free to move...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mentalcaz</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">try deleting the .txc files in your EQ directory these are the cache file eq creates frist time you go to a zone. I was having the same problem with one my older computers i havent played on for awhile and it seem to fix it. Hope it helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raynsmajic</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm, did that.....<br />
didn't work....<br />
could it be because i have more options enabled that the game suggested?<br />
like social aminations on when they shouldn't be or texture cache on when it shouldn't be?  stuff like that?<br />
or am i gonna ahve to completely reinstall EQ?<br />
guess that shouldn't be TOO hard seeing as i have evolutions, heh</div></div><hr />

<br />
If do, go to you  UI_Chractername.servername.ini file and edit the UISkin= to UISkin=default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenney</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if your ui is old at all youll get this go in your ini file and change the ui to default then log in , you should be able to log in now .... then up date your ui ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raynsmajic</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, much thanks to you mortis...<br />
had it go with default and loaded up fine..<br />
then i tried to load my ui ingame and had client crash...<br />
is the latest sars caster UI...<br />
could it be causing me to crash because i have all the target indicator ring files in there?<br />
heh, and do you think any UI i try to load will do this?  i guess ill have to try it, heh<br />
<br />
again, thanks for the help</div></div><hr />
