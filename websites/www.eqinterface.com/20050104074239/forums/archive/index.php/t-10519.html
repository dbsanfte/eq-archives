<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BloodOmen2k1</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, heres my problem......I had got some virus or something like that(not the problem really) and i was forced to use a system restore(Am using Windows ME also) So....When i was doing that i came across an option that may save all my files or something, Lol so when i got done with system restore everquest was still there with the icon, but it wasnt installed, so..i reinstalled it and fixed everything up right, and all my old UIs were in there spot before just like last time, but just to be safe i deleted them all and redownloaded them all and put them back into the folder, well when i go into EQ and type /loadskin Bloodomen 1(Bloodomen was the name of the folder i made) it just looks like i'm loading a normal UI, but then doesnt change at all, and i also tried the UI setup from Options in game, but the folder is not on the list, and i have also tried deleted folder &quot;Bloodomen&quot; and made a new one, but still no change.  LOL i cant bear to look at that ugly spellbook and not have XP% anymore, so if anyone has had this problem...and help would be much appreciated.<br />

*EDIT* I am also having a problem with getting my new maps to show up on EQ, i imagine the problem is linked to my UI problem, because i had all my maps for all zones before i had to system restore and i have redownloaded them and put them back in correct folder and still wont show up.</div></div><hr />

You might be having the same problems that these guys were/are having...do a search on your computer for uifiles folder and see where it is on your system...this might also help you with your map problem if you are updating the wrong folders...<br />
