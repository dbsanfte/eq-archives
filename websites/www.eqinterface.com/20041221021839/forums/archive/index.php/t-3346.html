Also an inventory window like the old ui. Im really not all about the new ui's changes, i love the new features and the being able to customize it but i want the feel of old ui with it. Plus im being pushed into newui for raid grouping features with PoP. So can anyone tell me if this has been done, planned to be done, or anyone interesting in doing it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tru_Soldier99</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I got another question than, is there a spell chart of the original spell icons(oldui) out there somewhere that can be used inplace of the new icons. Second someone said that it wasn't possible to have a 6spell per page spell book, you can mod almost every aspect of the ui why is spell book untouchable? Thanks in advance to anyone :P</div></div><hr />

Dont think so... havent seen one. <br />
<br />
There are spell box mods and buff box mods that list the name of the spell next to the icon. Look around in the beta and released gallery and I'm sure you will find some.<br />

Becuase thats the way SOE made it to be. All of that is hard coded in the xml engine. <br />
<br />
Also there is a feature not released yet called MEM PAGE (xml coders know about this)... where it mems a page of spells. You wouldnt be able to do this if you only had 6 spells per page.</div></div><hr />
