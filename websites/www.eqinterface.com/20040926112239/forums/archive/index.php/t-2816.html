I did get it working in PSP 7.  I used the directions in one of the threads in this forum and it worked great.  I'd recommend looking through the messages already posted and see if you can figure it out that way...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Open the image<br />
<br />
2) To make this walkthrough as simple as possible, DELETE ALL LAYERS THAT WILL NOT BE ADDED TO THE ALPHA<br />
<br />
3) make sure that there are NO alphas already in the channels tab ( there should only be four... &quot;RGB&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, Green&quot;, Blue&quot; just like your ps7 screenshot)<br />
<br />
3) in the layers tab, hold ctrl and left click on the first layer<br />
<br />
4) still in the layers tab, hold ctrl+shift and left click onthe next layer<br />
<br />
5) repeat step 4 till you have done this to all of the layers<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, you should have a &quot;selection&quot; of all the elements in the image<br />
<br />
<br />
6) goto the channels tab<br />
<br />
7) hit the button at the bottom of the channels tab that looks like a white circle in a black rectangle (second from the left)<br />
<br />
8) &lt;in AOL guy's voice&gt; You've Got Alpha!<br />

<br />
I have started using PS7, and the rule of thumb for it is.. <br />
<br />
anything showing will show in EQ<br />
make sure you merge back down to &quot;Layer zero&quot;<br />
save in 32bit<br />
<br />
using those three things, i have had no problems with my images..<br />
<br />
if using PS 6, follow steps listed above.. they are perfect..<br />
