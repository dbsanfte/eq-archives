<br />
I tried to make a new UI tonight for a new SK I started I used the most Recent post of his Celtic UI here, and got the newest Class files as well.<br />
<br />
I made the following Changes to the UI. Kuv's new chat window, Arcane Target, Cairenn's buff and short duration buff window and her merchent window, A tking version 101 spell book with Rem no border. And changed the inventory to the new celt look, I also put in the SK inventory picture, I also used Ariania's Tribal Target ring.  All these changes worked just fine. <br />
<br />
I then installed the Class anima posted on 12/30/2003 and it crashed my UI.<br />
<br />
The main reason I use TK UI's is because of his Class Icons I love them. And now if I want to change the look of my UI it crashes them no matter what base UI I start with.<br />
<br />
This is a copy of the Error log I got when I went to log back into EQ after makeing the change to the Class Icon <br />

I take the Class Icon out and any files it put in the UI and it works just fine again. Other then getting the red text about compatable files.  I take out Kuv's new Arcane Target Window and that goes away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have updated this mod and corrected the ScreenIDs to get rid of the irritating error message. <br />
<br />
As far as the animations go, there are quite a few threads on the subject, in one of them I posted a workaround.  Here is the link. (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12316) <br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
