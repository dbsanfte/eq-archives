I'll do my best to explain the screen image below...<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=44729<br />
<br />
Starting Top Left and working around Clockwise...<br />
<br />
Lag Meter:<br />
<br />
Simpler Lag Meter, Green Good, Yellow Partial Loss, Red Drop pending...<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Stats Center:<br />
<br />
Two main bars complimented by sub highlights for Pet Health and Casting time.<br />
<br />
Perhaps placement of a yellow bar for stamina in-between the two primaries.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Spells and Effects:<br />
<br />
Using the normal small tKing G2 Spell Gems to provide a small yet visable spells and effects window.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Long Target Window<br />
<br />
Displays a long named target window<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Group Window<br />
<br />
Traditional Simple Group Window, Red for Health, Green for Pet Health.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Inventory Window:<br />
<br />
Standard Inventory window with minor offsized icons and transparencey standard.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Chat Window:<br />
<br />
Normal Chat Window (Custom Scroller)<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Bottom Command Interface:<br />
<br />
A mix of Hotkeys and the Window Selection box.  Allowing the use of several commands or windows from a simple, non-intrusive selector..<br />
<br />
Preferences<br />
Map (For LoY Users)<br />
LFG<br />
Combat Mode Toggle<br />
<br />
Hot Buttons<br />
Hot Button Menu Selector<br />
<br />
Inventory<br />
Skills<br />
?<br />
Chat Options<br />
<br />
Before anyone says anything, this design and the basic imagery is borrowed from another online game.  I feel this style of simple interface is what EQ has needed for a while over all the extremely oversized windows that are common....<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Spell Selection Window:<br />
<br />
Normal window used to cast spells.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Please give me your opinions and thoughts, I'm surely not a coder here so I'm just working up a concept I might be able to work with a coder on if any showed an interest.<br />
<br />
I'm still working on the other windows, however they are not complete and I will update this thread from time to time.</div></div><hr />

I think it's shaping up nicely, however give I'm not a coder as I said before I don't know if this will ever evolve past a massive (24 meg) Photoshop Document. ;)<br />
<br />
Who knows, when I finish the mockup maybe one of the awesome Modders around here will be interested enough to pick it up and work with me to put the design into use.</div></div><hr />

You can't put the hotkeys into the window selector window and you can't put the window selector buttons into the hotkey box.  You can achieve approximately the right visual effect by making a lot of window pieces that look nice when you set them next to each other, but you will have to have all the window selector pieces on one side or the other of the hot buttons.  Perhaps you can balance them visually by putting the actions window on the other side.</div></div><hr />

Hey there Nastix!  I sure do remember you! ;)<br />
<br />
I'll be glad to do that soon as I finish a few more of my mockups in that main screenshot...need to get a few more of the concepts implimented before it could even hope to start to be coded....<br />
<br />
Also, given the previous messages, I am going to attempt a rework on part of the bottom bar and see what I can come up with balacing out the actions and window selectors...I might just keep it that way and reassign values. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Naw, actually you wouldn't have to do that. You could just build the window selector to be really wide and have a large empty space in the middle, then when you line up the hot buttons window and the window select window properly, you'd get the illusion of one large bar with buttons on either side.</div></div><hr />

I was kinda thinking there would need to be preset locations for this just to keep the bottom bar looking right...in that effect would the dual windows still be a problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, dual windows presents two problems that are fairly major:<br />
1) the location of the window is set within the XML itself and so a seperate version of the XML file would need to be made for each resolution your UI would support.<br />
2) the window's fade amount would be a forced 50% faded, 100 percent on mouseover and would not be able to be changed by the end user (or the XML coder, these are hard coded numbers for &quot;faked&quot; windows).<br />
<br />
Although I could pull some tricks to make the window never fade, the location problem is pretty major unless you were planning on this UI only supporting one resolution.<br />
<br />
Your &quot;safest&quot; bet would be to keep the selector window buttons on one side and something else (as suggested the actions window) on the other side of the hotbuttons.<br />

I like these graphics and could make a UI out of them in probably one (or two days tops) day if I were provided with the art (I could chop up and enchnce the JPG you posted but why go through that trouble when you have the original).<br />

<br />
You do some great work. :)<br />
<br />
I'm working to see what I can do but honestly I don't see how I can convert the images to be one sided without ruining the balanced and uncluttered look of the skin idea...<br />
<br />
I had fully intended that the bar be one of those UI's which is designed to be at one spot on the screen and one spot only and given it's small size that it probably would stay Alpha 100% at all times since it doesn't really take much space at all...<br />
<br />
I supppose, though a pain initially coding versions for the resolutions would be the best bet.<br />
<br />
However, if you can think of a way to seperate the functions without a major need for positioning changes that would be something I'd gladly look into...<br />
<br />
I'm going through right now and cleaning up some of my 'Junk' which I've gathered from screenshots and other things and smoothing out the images in general to make them more useable in the long term...<br />
<br />
I'll update the screenshot in post 1 when I finish that and then (No offense to Nastix whom I've worked with in the past) I'll probably send you a PM with where I have dumped the more final image and see what we can come up with for an inital version. :)</div></div><hr />

Actually the XP part doesn't look all that bad to me, might be something to consider in two small 'lower faced' tabs with XP% and AA% on them...<br />

<br />
Just kidding. I guess I'll hide Exp and AA exp gauges under the mana bar... or something. But I'm done for tonight. midnight = sleeptime. I only have 2 classes tomorrow so I should be able to wrap up this window and do the group and target ones tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - Any other suggestions on what to hide under the mana gauge? I could always just do a breath gauge or, uhm... /drool time for bed.</div></div><hr />

Just wondering about the melee version of your playerwindow.<br />
<br />

<br />
I was doing mockups on my original source files here and I came up with a simple idea for Melee only...<br />
<br />
Replace the Mana Bar with a full sized Stamina Bar.  Same basic UI Look and Feel, greater functionality for Melee.<br />
<br />
I'm personally a Druid so I need the Mana and like to see my Stamina as well hence the small center stamina bar...</div></div><hr />

I am so excited about the way that looks in the first post. I didn't think you could skin the lag meter? I am already using Enok's skins now and think they are awesome so it's even better seeing him on this project as well! I think the playerwindow that he showed is very nice, I like it already. <br />
<br />
I kind of agree with Amitan that the less gauges the better; this is looking to be the best minimalist skin ever. I like the idea of the hotbuttons being horizontal like in the first post screenshot as well. And the simplistic chat window and custom scroller look great too. I would love to see what a pet window might look like in this style. The inventory looks great also, a little big, but great. I am just so impressed with this concept.<br />

This is great work everyone involved. Thanks for working on it, I can't wait....<br />

Please realize the inventory is default, the hotbutton window is JUST FOR TESTING. I haven't applied the pretty graphics to it yet. Compare it to the original screenshot in this thread and marvel at the similarities.<br />

May I ask if the casting window can be part of the target window? Do you have plans for a pet window to match this style? <br />
<br />
I'm currently using one of your recent themes Enok, and your work just keeps impressing me. Thanks for the screenshot! Keep up the great work!<br />

When you cast a purple bar appears over the top 4 pixels (don't worry, it's easily visible) of the mana bar.<br />

I plan on making a pet window that is the same width as the target and group windows with the buttons arranged in my personal style<br />
<br />
attack<br />
guard follow<br />
back<br />
taunt sit<br />
goaway<br />
<br />
I plan on making the compass window into a sort of second player window. The little Exp and AAXP box I tacked on to the right of the player window will be moved to this window on the left or something. It'll be the same width as the player window and be meant to sit right below it. Instead of health, stamina, mana bars, it'll go exp, breath, AAexp. I think I'll move the little chain emblem to this window and put a flashing HP warning gauge in place of it in the player window... or something.<br />

Hey Revol, just so you know as posted in the original shot the Actions/Hotkeys are going to all be intergrated into a window at the bottom so we won't have the traditional EQ boxes for those. ;)</div></div><hr />

A) Change this to the health percent<br />

E) MAX HP<br />
F) Breath Gauge<br />
G) Move the Exp chain thingy back up here<br />

Really dislike that concept Haliken, here is my drawing...<br />

The light blue is a breath indicator, the bottom includes the compass and fillers on the sides just to make it look better.</div></div><hr />

Not a bother at all.<br />

1024x768 - 1600x1200 depending upon the work it takes once the bottom control interface is done...</div></div><hr />

This UI is special in that the resolution WILL matter since the bottom window placement will be coded into the XML itself.

<br />
P.S. - Elezibeth, do you want me to organize the inventory slots exactly like they are in the picture, or do you want them organized in the traditional old EQ layout? Wasn't sure if you had specifically wanted them in the layout shown. Also, for the general inventory slots, do you want them to go:<br />

1357<br />

I just ordered them that way to try and follow through logically. ;)<br />
<br />
Work from the head down and thats how I got my layout on the Inventory...  Whichever you feel would be the most useable for people, go with that.  I'm not heartset on that if you think it'd take relearning. ;)<br />
<br />
As for my resolution, alas only 1152x864 because I had to give up my 19 inch monitor when I got my New Mac system, just didn't have room for that PC display anymore. ;)<br />

For the Boxes, I want the <br />

Sadly, of all 4 of those programs Counter-strike takes the least RAM, processing and video card power. I just run CS to play with friends, I loathe the game in actuality.

If you were to do this, it would be a prime opportunity to totally eliminate that information from the inventory window.<br />

Glad to see that you like it!<br />

I've been exercising a few possible options on the Inventory Window including doubling up on the Attributes and Resists side by side to try and shave a few pixels off it.<br />
<br />
Now that the holiday is over, I can take a look at the UI again and continue with my conceptual changes and see how they turn out...<br />
<br />
Not quite sure what you are referring to on the Options Window, I know you can't mean the Alt+O one so I'm sure sure which you are referring to.  :)<br />

To release 0.5 which is my current Dev Copy from Enok would be a very bad idea. ;)<br />
<br />
It's got a few MAJOR issues with it which would prevent it from being used by the majority of people.<br />

Trust me guys, soon as Enok gets back we'll try to get a beta put together ASAP. :)<br />

Soon(tm)  ;)<br />
<br />
Development has been slow, but you can blame Enok for that. ;)  Slacking off and taking a vacation, how shameful. ;)<br />
<br />
But serious, soon guys. :)</div></div><hr />

Big sorry to all of you following this UI, I've been distracted by real life unfortunately. Trip to Vegas, papers to write, finals. I'll send Elezibeth the hotbutton stuff late tonight.<br />

I think you'll be stunned.  It actually made Luclin graphics playable on a 450 P3 or so my Sister told me. ;)<br />

I beleive that Enok said he was going to work %'s in, not sure.  I'll have to wait for a finished version of that window to tell you. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - It runs better than the default UI so have no fear about your comp not being strong enough to handle this.<br />
<br />
P.P.S. - K, that was an exaggeration, it runs the same as the default UI, I get the same framerate of 75 when staring at the ground with both this UI and the default UI.<br />
<br />
P.P.P.S. - The group window does have percents, they show up over the player's gauge just like the percent is over the target's gauge in the screenshot.</div></div><hr />

Do away with the 'CUR&quot; in the HP Box.<br />

Perhaps make that<br />
<br />
&quot;HPS&quot; and angle it opposite of the &quot;MAX&quot; on the other side for balance.<br />
<br />
Also Enok, going to get a PM from me.  I found an idea for a Spell book I think will work great. ;)</div></div><hr />

Two 'Spell Cast Bar' sized strips running parallel to each other.<br />

Spell Icons inside those bars, names off to the right of the icon.<br />

The selector/hotbutton window is gimped right now (just got the graphics done) and like, well, not very funtional yet (only 1 button works on the selector window) and I haven't coded it so you can click correctly yet, but do you want me to send them anyways so you can check 'em out in game?<br />

<br />
Such as that Attack spells have 1 pixel red or whatever.  Good spells 1 piexl blue...<br />
<br />
It's just something to look at, not sure why but the 1 pixel in the concept just seemed smoother than the 3/5 pixel that is current.  Could just be me. :)<br />
<br />
Naah, hold off until you get things a bit more complete. ;)  Still using this to play a character so if it's too inoperative it might get to me. ;)<br />

P.S. - I have class now so I'm e-mailing you the newest version. I might suggest that you make this one be available as a beta.<br />

<br />
Just got this build from Enok and I can say, there is a slight issue with it. ;)  BUT, all around it's looking very good.<br />
<br />
One tweak and I'm going to see if I can't get it uploaded for beta.<br />
<br />
Soo Soon is Sooner than you think!  Be on the watch for a Move to the Beta Forum soon! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">archeiron</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a fantastic concept and I look forward to your beta upload.<br />
<br />
As possible variations to this when it gets further along I would suggest :<br />
<br />
(1) the hotkeys, etc bar inverted and at the top of the screen<br />
(2) spell bar available in both horizontal and vertical<br />
(3) spell effects available in both horizontal and vertical<br />
(4) squeeze the resists onto some window, on raids it is important to know if you are in bard range and song window isn't always enough to know.<br />
<br />
had a weird idea too.  what about sticking that casting gauge running along the spell window. Is this possible?</div></div><hr />

Second, I'll be blunt guys.<br />
<br />
The spellbook close button is horrific as shown in that picture. :P  I didn't want to release it with that in it but tell you what...I think I'm going to anyway after I recompress the archive and dump the read-me in it.<br />

Yeah on the topic of the spell book, I don't like the one pictured much at all, I was just planning on replacing it myself. I was going to go with on of T.Kings books, his work looks the best in my opinion. But that's just me.<br />

Well I still can't wait to try it! Great Work.<br />

This isn't actually Haliken, I'm his brother, I just have this REALLY nasty habit of stealing his online aliases. Haliken AND Enok (short for Enokhaon) are both names of his creation. My alias is unfortunately my EQ account name so I avoid using it with anything EQ related. =/ Oh well, live and learn... and steal Haliken's names...</div></div><hr />

If you can chopshop the spellbar and let me know with the new version, I'll get you the read me file which holds the credits and everything.  :)<br />

I got permission from t.King to also include his spellgems and stuff if I wanted to so I always like to give credit for that stuff too. :)<br />

<br />
You did the design and concept?<br />
<br />
I beg your pardon?  This skin came from my work and Enok's coding.<br />
<br />
As far as my comments, given nature of the talks he and I have had, I don't need someone else giving me crap over my own skin.  I don't care how popular the UI you produced is, that doesn't give you any right to come in saying stuff about mine or how it's developed.<br />
<br />
Enok and I have been working together on this since the start, he knows what I think of his work on it to date, thats what matters to me, not what others say.<br />
