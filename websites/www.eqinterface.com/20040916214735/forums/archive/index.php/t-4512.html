<br />
Read the readme file included. There is a small explanation<br />
on how to make it work<br />
<br />
Btw i just ported this from a winamp skin called MMD3. <br />
So all gredits goes to Sven Kistner (the original author).<br />
<br />
Hope you like it!<br />
<br />
The correct file is eqmmd3C.zip. Check it out in Misc section.<br />
Or click on my skins in my player profiles here :)<br />
<br />
ADDED:<br />
I've hidden the songtimer gauge in the timer display. So now you<br />
can move around in the mp3. Handy when you have 171Mb live sets <br />
playing...</div></div><hr />

When I copy the files into my drakahorig folder under UIFiles it breaks the UI and still doesnt work. I've added the lines you stated to the main ui file as well. <br />

What else am I missing? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ybom</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you need to keep the patcher from updating your directory, thereby erasing your hard work, you can go about this many ways. The best way to do it would be to copy the contents of your skin directory (I assume you're talking about default since EQ is patching that) and renaming it to something you'll remember, like your main character's name or something (and then doing the /loadskin charname 1) Another way to do it is to look up your default directory in the skins folder and set it to read only. I would do the latter if you are having space issues (but then again how are you playing EQ with HD space issues?)<br />
<br />
I'm still having an issue with the mp3 player, but I &quot;2box&quot; winamp so it doesn't matter to me.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, btw can I put a link to a shoutcast in a pls file and listen to a streaming mp3 at all through the in-game player? I never tried it...has anyone?</div></div><hr />

I think the finished update has some duplicated screen items or something.<br />
<br />
I'll take some time to try on my own but would really appreciate if you could 'recode' it so it can stand alone with no mods except the add in the EQUI file.</div></div><hr />

I have all the edits done correctly, but I can't load the player.  ALT+K doesn't seem to bring it up, ever.  Whats really disturbing is that i can load the default skin as well now and it also will not load the player... any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, so every time I try to open a custom UI piece with this MP3 Player Mod in the folder, I get the error A_MPW_bg01 has already been defined.  So I've been lazy, ignoring it and finally decided ILOVETHISFREAKINMOD but IHATETHISERROR when I'm working. (sidwidl) is my savior with this stuff.)<br />
<br />
So...finally opened all the mod xmls in CuteHTML, did a global find/replace and found only the MP3.xml has the designation...<br />
<br />
Long Story Short:  Change only the Static Animation Item Names A_MPW_bg01 and A_MPW_bg02 to A_MPW_bg01SA and A_MPW_bg02SA and Change the &lt;Pieces&gt; to same and error goes away.  <br />
<br />
am at work so can't live test the mod in EQ yet, but have a feeling this may solve some load issues with the mod.<br />

 <br />
   1)  MP3 mod in selected skin folder<br />
   2)  Open SidlWidl EQ/XML editor<br />
   3)  Select skin with mod in it.<br />
   4)  Attempt to open any xml definition - error ocurrs.<br />
<br />
Since the error basically said that something was already defined, I realized that the static animation and the UI2dAnimation names should not be the same.  This may or may not be contributing to other issues some of the respondants have mentioned.</div></div><hr />

If you have other mods, add the stuff between the comments in the EQUI.XML to your current one and all should be well.  If you are using other SonaMods, uncomment the sona xmls.<br />

Note - this version is black with blue text, not grey like the original.<br />

<br />
I was wondering if there was a way i could use this and NOT edit my EQUI.XML folder .....there is something in the readme file that looks like this <br />
<br />
&quot;You can include the code in those two files into the<br />
EQUI_MusicPlayerWnd.xml if you want. I just did this <br />
to keep my xml files clean.&quot;<br />
<br />
is there anyone that could tell me what exactly to copy to get this right i am afraid i will bork it all up if i try....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">virtualko</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like many others, I already had a skin-set loaded prior to trying to install this mod. I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out what the instuctions meant. Reading the boards didn't help much either, since I couldn't find the &quot;How to fix it&quot; posts people were telling others to go read. So I experimented. It's pretty simple to fix really. This is what you do.<br />
<br />
1) Unzip all the files into your pre-existing skin directory.<br />
2) Copy the EQUI.XML file from your \uifiles\default folder to you skin folder. (This was the missing part) <br />
3) Edit the copied EQUI.XML file to include the edits the readme.txt states. (see below)<br />
<br />
readme.txt <br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Copy paste the files into your directory. <br />
<br />
Don't forget to add the following lines in the EQUI.xml file <br />
 &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_ExtraAnimations.xml&lt;/Include&gt; <br />
 &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_ExtraTemplates.xml&lt;/Include&gt; <br />
<br />
That's it! just make sure you save the file when you are done inserting the above 2 lines.<br />
<br />
This &quot;missing&quot; step may have been obvious to most people, but it wasnt obvious for me, so I just figured I'd post it here to help others out.<br />

I use the Koari skin, and everything works now! This MP3 player is awesome. It fits right in with my minimalist UI, and is far better then the crappy one VI gave EQ. Nice mod!</div></div><hr />
