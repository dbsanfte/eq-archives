(click link above to read his letter to the users).<br />
<br />
I want to take a moment to offer my Congrats to Baelish. When SOE hires people like him or Moorgard, it shows the community that they want to bring in the quality people who know the community. <br />
<br />
I know it was a hard choice for Baelish, but he has our backing and Gemdiver who is taking over at CastersRealm is already doing some great stuff, and has some more stuff planned for the near future!<br />

Still check there everyday for news and information, even after all these years it remains one of the few really good sites.  So I wish him also the best of luck.<br />
