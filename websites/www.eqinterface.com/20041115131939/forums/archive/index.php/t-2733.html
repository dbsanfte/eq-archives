<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made another 800 x 600 interface based off Chyra's &quot;CompleteMiniMod&quot; interface. I included only the basics. I use a different version which basicly has T.King spell book, spell icons and gems, and original inventory.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the target window is &quot;stretchable&quot; to all different sizes. I'm currently looking into getting something like that made using the exp/aaxp bars instead.<br />
<br />
The pet window has only the pet commands, because the pet's health is basically the bottom half of your hp bar.<br />
<br />
The chat window is not dragable, but you can resize is to wherever you want.<br />
<br />
The spell cast window has no background. Very nice since it doesn't take up much space.<br />
<br />
The little square above the spell window is the list of which spells you have up at that time. I'd rather have it that way than have to keep using the ALT button. It uses the friends window(practically useless, I just use /friend &lt;name&gt; and /who all friends.) so you'll never have to worry about turning it back after you hit the ESC key to clear the target. Best of all, if you set its transperancy to 0 or 100%, whichever is transperant, the window behind it will dissapear but the words will still be there.<br />
<br />
The little square next to the left of the chat window is the group window. No buttons or anything, just player hp gauges, with pet hp at the bottom of it.<br />
<br />
Hotkeys and general inventory slots, from top to bottom are 1 to 10(hotkeys) and 1 to 8(inventory).<br />
<br />
There's still a lot of room left on the screen.<br />
<br />
The casting window and breath gauges I included are super compact. Only the gauges, nothing else. Still dragable though by the ends. I personally use the arcane cast window at Remelio's. (http://pub165.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31) <br />
<br />
The player info window shows all stats, player/pet hp, mana,  stamina, exp and aaxp and all percentages for hp mana stamina exp and aaxp.<br />
<br />
That's basically it. Plenty of room to maybe put another transperant window or two up top for hits and stuff.<br />
<br />
I sent it in to the complete sets section so it should be there soon. Hope you all enjoy using it!</div></div><hr />
