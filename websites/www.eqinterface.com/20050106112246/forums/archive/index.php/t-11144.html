<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mallix</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone please help.  I love the Vert mod.  I've used it for quite some time.  The problem I seem to have since LDON came out is that I can't get the little blue line to show up on the Vert Compass.<br />
<br />
I can't find my way to the LDON Adventures without a working LDON Compass.  Does anyone else have this issue?  If so, how do you fix it?  I've messed with the compass, but I'm not experienced enough.  I got to the point where all I had was an empty black box where the compass should be...<br />
<br />
I'd really like just a plain simple compass (maybe something like this one pictuered here...)  http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1826<br />
<br />
One more possible request, please...  Vert only has 10 boxes next to the hotbuttons for inventory (I know it has 2 pages)  I like to have all 8 inventory slots AS WELL AS Primary, Secondary, Ranged, Ammo.  The second tab I use for all my clickies.   IS it possible to add 2 more boxes?  (again, like the above link shows by the hotbuttons..)<br />
<br />
Thanks from a GUI Newbie!</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;~~~ clickly clicky to get it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mallix</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats pretty much want I want for the hot keys, but call me anal if you wish, I'm trying to keep the whole thing matched to the Vert theme.  I assume someone could change some code on the Vert UI to incorporate 10 boxes instead of 8...  (I HOPE...)<br />
<br />
Any luck on resolving my Compass issue?  Anyone else HAVE the LDoN compass issue?</div></div><hr />

I have the blue line that's suppose to direct you to the camp, but mine isn't taking me anywhere near the camps.  It's a real pain  =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JGC84</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the compass thing i dont know about, but as far as the vert hotbox w/ 8, post up your hotbox xml file, i'll edit it next time when i sit down to work on my v2.0 i'll do it real quick, wont take but a min :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mallix</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, Here's the Hotbutton file.<br />
<br />
I currently have it set for my 8 inventory slots, and then my Primary and Secondary.  I would love to have 2 more boxed for my Ranged and Ammo.<br />
<br />
You can see its tabbed.  IF you can make the second tab also have 10 slots that would be AWESOME.  If not, I'll make due with 8 on the second tab.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
As for the Compass, I'm going to simply try to not use the Compass files and see if it just reverts back to the default.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Go to any mod you like, and grab the &quot;window_pieces04.tga&quot; file. Rename this to &quot;compass.tga&quot;, and throw it into your Vert folder.<br />
Let it overwrite the original file.<br />
<br />
Voila! <br />
