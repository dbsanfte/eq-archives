<br />
I saw too many posts about the alpha channel and realised that not everyone can afford Photoshop, a pricey gem indeed, although WELL worth it if you are into graphics.. so I tried to start a thread here with DECENT quality free paint programs. Hope this is useful.<br />
<br />
GIMP -- a paint program that is quite powerful, despite a somewhat ugly interface coming from unix/linux/whatever.. I think it supports alpha channels by way of the transparency color (which can be any where from 0 to 255, not always easy to see)<br />
<br />
Gimp ( for Windows !! )<br />
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/<br />
<br />
Gimp for Windows WALKTHROUGH<br />
http://gimp-savvy.com/BOOK/index.html?node16.html<br />
<br />
<br />
PIXIA -- photoshop like paint program, seems to have all the basic stuff, I DONT KNOW if it supports alpha channels but it says it supports transparency<br />
<br />
http://www.ab.wakwak.com/~knight/index.html<br />
<br />
project dogwaffle -- another one I didn't try but on the pageit says it supports alpha channel, and even better, actually PAINTING in that channel (if the program won't let you see it it's pretty hard to work on it I guess)<br />
<br />
You need to be able to see and paint in  the range of grays in the alpha channels to create smoothed out borders and drop shadow effects..<br />

<br />
<br />
IRFANVIEW -- a good viewer / browser very useful to select and drag images into your paint program, very similar to ACDSee<br />

I haven't been able to do anything since. :(  Can't even open a TGA file.  But it'll be quite some time before I can afford the $100+ for the software.  I would really love to get it, but just can't see inveseting that kind of money right now for something that's not going to earn me anything in return (Except a little fun I suppose).<br />
<br />
Sooo... I will hafta check out your links.  Are they all fully XP compatible?</div></div><hr />

gonna get flamed for this, but go check out  http://astalavista.box.sk  and run a search for your paint shop program (probably  paint shop 7.04)  and I bet you can find a crack for it to get it back running</div></div><hr />

I went through some tutorials on their website and eventually got the hang of it. I saved the picture they were using in the tutorial and loaded it up on pixia and went through the steps. Here is the pic they had.<br />

This is their finished picture.<br />

<br />
Splitz!, a good program to split apart images such as needs be done for making skins for spellbooks.<br />
<br />
Except:<br />
<br />
Splitz! allows you to split any image into rectangular parts and<br />
export the resulting images along with the HTML table that puts them<br />
back together. This allows webmaster to create for creating mouseover<br />
effects and offers an alternative to imagemaps. It supports many<br />
images formats and includes smart JPEG compression as well as basic<br />
color balancing filters.<br />
 <br />
Latest Version: 1.42 (minor bugfixes, option to add splitlines<br />
numerically)<br />
