I do however know what I would like. I need a UI that has a timer for for mend and spawn times. It needs to be able to go on a widescreen laptop (currently running on 1680x1050 in EQ and out of it). A way to switch weapons from my bag to in hand would be ideal. And enough hotkeys so that I can have my skills up. No fancy graphics needed, but need it big enough so easy on the eyes at that size (ATM chatfontsize 5 is good enough but the hotkeys are so small). Health percentages also nice features. Any info would be great, like I said I really dont know anything about this stuff.<br />

Also they arent gaudy and over colorful but have an appealing color scheme. May have to find fix for the new OoW items but if you do search for pearl necklace there is one post that tells you exactly how and what to edit to get the items to show.</div></div><hr />
