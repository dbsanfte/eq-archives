<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karto</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the Dischord patch, my UI won't load...prior to it, I always got the &quot;Your XML files blah blah, please load Default&quot;, but everything worked fine. Now when I tried to load it, screen hangs for a good 10-12 seconds &amp; then the default loads. I tried reading Cariens posts &amp; stuff, but I just cannot make sense of this XML stuff, so I zipped the folder up &amp; I'm hoping that someone doesn't mind taking a peek and see if it can be fixed. It isn't one particular author or theme, just a hodge podge I slapped together. <br />

here is link to zipfile:<br />

I don't think anyone would want to touch it at the state it's in currently, hehe. I only looked at one file, but it's the most important one for the start of patchwork. The animations file is so scrambled it would take someone with great patience to line it up properly for editing. It's a jumbled mess atm :(<br />

Please keep in mind that I am at work and do not  have the ability to load and test this, however all should work fine.<br />
<br />
What I would do is unzip this into a new custom UI folder then load that from in-game to make sure that all works.  If you still get errors, then post your uierrors.txt file.  <br />
<br />
Download it from my server<br />

Post your UIError.txt log file in the Help forum, and someone can help you get rid of those errors.</div></div><hr />
