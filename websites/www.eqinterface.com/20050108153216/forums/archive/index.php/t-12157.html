<br />
The perfect owlbear pelt I have had the greatest sucess farming in the owlbear caves in Hollowshade.  More from the density of the mobs than from any individual type.<br />
<br />
The sonic wolf pelts I have gotten were from killing sonic wolves in Tenebrous Mountains while farming skulls.</div></div><hr />

I got quite a few of many different pelts from doing the war stuff in Hollowshade.</div></div><hr />
