<br />
I'm using PSP 7.0 (trial version).  I recently figured out how to get a TGA file working correctly by setting up an alpha channel as transparent (or whatever the heck I did!)<br />
<br />
But... I want to really understand this stuff so I can do it in the future without reference to a length &quot;process&quot; on how to do this.<br />
<br />
Can you guys tell me:<br />
<br />
1) What is an Alpha channel?  (What does it MEAN?  In laman's terms, please)<br />
<br />
2) What is a MASK?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are other questions that will come up.. but I couldn't find very good definitions for either of these in the PSP help files.  Can you guys help me out? :P</div></div><hr />

I did it recently, and actually got it to look exacly like I wanted in SidlWidl, but when I logged into the game, things were very messed up.  =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">think of a mask as the masking tape and paper you would use to keep from painting a certain part of a car. That's the best way to describe it... I personally don't use masks, but instead use my pen tool paths that I saved to make the selection. Masks are mainly useful when you have alot of intricate work that you don't want to paint over.<br />
<br />
Alpha 1 is the channel that gets added to the info in the TGA (or other format) that EQ uses to tell what should be showing and what shouldn't. Say, for example, that I want to have just a circle showing in a background image... if I don't set the Alpha 1 channel, it will add in all the stuff around a circle that I dont want. If I select the circle in my image editor and save that selection as &quot;Alpha 1&quot; then EQ will basically only recognize what's inside the selection.</div></div><hr />
