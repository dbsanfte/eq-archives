<br />
I decided to use a new buff window:<br />
Geddine's Buff Window (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=50)<br />
<br />
And now whenever I try to load the UI I get a client crash.<br />
I have tried the making a folder for the buff window alone to test it and i get the same crash. Once I removed all the parts of the new buff window my UI loaded without any errors.<br />
<br />
Here is my Error Log:<br />

From my understanding these are the usual warnings when using any custom UI files. <br />
<br />
<br />
Any Ideas??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would think that there is a piece in the buff window that uses the same name as a piece in another window.<br />
<br />
It could also be a graphic being called for that is not present.  Most of my crashes are caused by this, but being that this is an old mod and has worked in the past I doubt this is it.<br />
<br />
Sometimes there is an errant piece of extra code somewhere that causes crashes too.<br />
<br />
Brings me back to wishing that I had an xml validator designed for the equi schema.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm not sure how to check if its a code issue. I have done some recoding but it was really basic...changing inventory slots, font color, and window size. <br />
<br />
If any could test this window and let me know that would be great.</div></div><hr />
