<br />
If you want to see more info on the sections click the link &quot;Show All&quot; this will include descriptions of the sections, how many are in there, and should show you when new files are uploaded<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/images/download/pic.gif This Icon is what you will click to see a Screen Shot of the Mod that you are considering.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/images/download/download.gif This Icon is what you use to Download the file once you have chosen your mod.  <br />
<br />
I realize both of those may be very obvious to most of us, but just in case I wanted to point them out..<br />
<br />
Also you will notice More Sections, including our Featured Skins Section where Remelio and t.king will be show off thier items. This will included a variety of things, soo you will want to check there often once they start uploading stuff. <br />
<br />
I am checking on a regular basis for new submissions through out the day. So as they mods get added, you will see them..<br />
