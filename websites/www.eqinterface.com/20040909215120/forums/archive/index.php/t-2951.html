<br />
Character Select window would be modified so that instead of having text buttons on the left hand side,  it woul have a series of 8 pictures grouped around the screen - one for each character.  The idea was to have different pictures for each mouse event (button pressed, mouseover aka flyby, etc).   I had really wanted to do animations for each but that just  is too much for me at the moment.<br />
<br />
This code is UNTESTED as of 10/15/02.  I am not sure if I'll be testing it or not.<br />
<br />
some question i'm not sure about is if mods are loaded per character - <br />
1) how will it know to load mod until it loads first character?<br />
2) will this somehow have strange effects when switching between characters?<br />
<br />
zip file includes mods for the EQUI_Animations.xml and EQUI_CharacterSelect.xml as well as adding new TGA.  There is also a readme.txt and a concept image named csw.gif.</div></div><hr />

There is a setting which tells the client which UI to load when the game first starts. Therefore, if you set this to the custom UI containing the character select mod... that mod will load when EQ loads.<br />
