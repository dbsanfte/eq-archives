<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xecros</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's one thing to edit the xml files, start EQ and see if your changes worked, but i'd like to be able to see if my changes look right withour having to load up EQ and test it.<br />
<br />
Is this possible?  Is there an XML editor that will do this??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">UniDyne</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) The XML that VI is using for the skins isn't very kosher. There is no DTD defining the language. They appear to be using a namespace that is defined from within their program.<br />
<br />
2) VI has already stated that this is a Beta. This means that whatever editor anyone writes right now, might not work with next week's version of SIDL.<br />
<br />
3) IMHO, I think that VI should have simply used the skin language that was incorporated for the patch program. Read those files - they make sense.<br />
<br />
I would be more than happy to code up a UI editor at some point, but before I do, I'd really like to see where VI is going with this and how much functionality is being added. Furthermore, I'd like to see DTDs implemented and a better documentation of how the client interfaces with these files (ie, what values does the client look for and what values can we get from the client)<br />
<br />
At any rate, I suspect that the net will be flooded with editors in the near future, assuming more users are curious enough to tinker with their interface! ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you could even run it with EQW, allowing you to have even more freedom.<br />
<br />
I'd be tempted to try this myself, since I only have one phoneline at my house and like to keep it open during the day. I'm not worried about it though, because I know someone is making a spiffy editor even as I type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tedar</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm a few thoughts in my head , I'm sure you could do a good deal of this in maybe javascript and php ? I don't think that it would be too hard for the more basic stuff like positioning the bars and such ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah but you'll have to get it to read the TGA files the same way EQ does to properly display transparency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tedar</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure I could write a piece of code in php on a linux server that would do the trick.<br />
<br />
targa -&gt; gif or png would be quite easy to make..<br />
<br />
<br />
maybe even a flash interface with drag'n'drop could be an idea ..just brainstorming :)</div></div><hr />
