<br />
Incase some of yall didn't see, this is what it looks like:<br />
<br />
http://www.gpcentre.net/images/evercrack/gui/fullplayerwindow.gif<br />
Window how it looks in EQ (w/out all them labels) (http://www.gpcentre.net/images/evercrack/gui/fullplayerwindow-nl.gif)<br />
<br />
<br />
And the Archive (http://www.gpcentre.net/evercrack/gui/gpplyr.zip)<br />
<br />
The archive contains 8 file. 6 Custom XML files, EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml and a ReadMe.html file. Read the ReadMe for details of the files.<br />
<br />
The window is built to be modular, main focus was to make it so if I had to shift X items down, I only have to modify 3 or 4 items, instead of 50+. You know how it is if you need to move your window elements down 2 pixles. It just sucks.<br />
<br />
PetHP is still located in the PlayerWindow itself, but aligned just right to work with your HP bar like normal. No way around this, might as well work with it.<br />
<br />
Everything else is pretty basic and self explanitory. If you're curious of the windows here, check out this pict (http://www.gpcentre.net/images/evercrack/gui/fullplayerwindow-borders.gif) with all the window borders turned on.<br />
Ignore the odd Pet bar placement. Turning on the borders actually shifts the window elements a bit.<br />
<br />
Any questions? Feel free to post them or email me directly.<br />
<br />
Btw - if you refer anybody to this mod, please direct them to my website (http://www.gpcentre.net/), and follow the links in the Menu: eqgui mods -&gt; Player/Pet<br />
Feel free to link to Player/Pet (http://www.gpcentre.net/evercrack/gui/player-pet.html) page directly if you like, although linking the eqgui mods (http://www.gpcentre.net/evercrack/gui/) page might be better.</div></div><hr />
