I downloaded it and its very quick when playing the samples of songs. I havent purchased any songs yet as I'm not sure what format they are in. I would only try it if they are normal mp3 files that my mp3 CD player can play in my car. Any one buy any songs from iTunes yet?<br />

I haven't checked it out myself yet, kinda waiting for what any Windows user thinks of it and what it has to offer before I go dabbling in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on a serious note, I think all the purchased music is in AAC (apples new codec) it is a good format though..  I would replace my MP3 collection with AAC if I wasn't allready converting to OGG :cool:</div></div><hr />

No, they are not MP3.  They are ACC.  A encoded secure file that can only be played on your computer (and up to 5 others).<br />
<br />
However, you can burn them to CD and convert them to MP3.  I find the quality of ACC superior to MP3.  So I'm waiting for a ACC decoder for my empeg.</div></div><hr />

Didn’t notice until this morning but after I installed iTunes (did a custom install and told it not to be the default player for any files) QuickTime was assigned as the default program for all my photoshop PSD files. lol. Easley fixed but kind of weird.</div></div><hr />
