<br />
I play a magician and i have recently come back after a long hiatus from EQ, i really like the new pet window as it saves me the slots in the hotbuttons.  But I find one thing annoying, the new /pet get lost ( i think its labeled 'go away'), it is far too close to other frequently used buttons in the pet window for comfort and i have already had an accident do to hitting that by mistake at the wrong time.  But when needed (chaiing pets, its a god send).<br />
<br />
Anyone seen a mod of the pet window that has this button either not on the pet window (in which case i can just make a separate hotbutton), or better yet somehow separated very far from the other buttons?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Also, I prefer to have most of my info (cast buttons etc, on the right side of the screen any good mods that incorporate a nice gem bar for the right side, prefereably in a group window?)<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
