<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Foxeous</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what I did.<br />
<br />
I downloaded xym_32.zip and extracted it into xym folder in my uifiles.  Then I extracted the contents of xym_23_1024.zip into my xym folder and overwrote the necessary files.<br />
<br />
I took the ui_basic_00 and renamed it to my characters and posted it into the main directory.<br />
<br />
I then loaded up EQ, /loadskin xym and everything looked great except I realized the rendering area was the full 1024x768.  The one thing that made me love this UI over any other was the fact that the ui panes weren't in the way of the world view.<br />
<br />
Have I missed something or is the xym_32_1024 purposely without smaller rendering area?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, I was messing around with it both ways.  You can switch back and forth easily in game with the /viewport command.  To get the proper window in 1024x768 mode, type this command in game:<br />
<br />
/viewport 80 0 864 568<br />
<br />
At 1280x1024, use: /viewport 80 0 1120 840<br />
<br />
At 1600x1200, use: /viewport 100 0 1400 990<br />
<br />
The format is &quot;/viewport x y width height&quot; where (x,y) is the distance from the upper left corner of the screen to the upper left corner of the viewport.</div></div><hr />

It should work as it is.  There is a one pixel wide border on the sides and bottom of the chat window.  If you can't grab it, try clicking on the center of the chat window to bring it in front of the adjacent UI elements.<br />
<br />
If you absolutely can't grab the sides, try swapping in some other chat window, or rename the file so that you get the default, long enough to adjust it as you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wish for 2 things:<br />
<br />
1: make it for a screen like 800x600 (i usually 2 box and its hard to click the small buttons for spells)<br />
I haven't tried loading my UI into an 800x600 window.  I don't think it would work.  The 1024x768 window is already overcrowded and dominated by window elements with very little rendering room.  If you want to run on a window that small, you will need to use a UI that was designed from the beginning to be as slim as possible.  Mine is not.<br />
<br />
2: make a spell book icon on the botton of the casting bar (this helps out with sitting on a horse and again since i am usually 2 boxing its hard to toggle witht he ctrl-b)<br />
I have already provided such a mod, but not for your desired resolution.  I agree that Ctrl-B is an awkward key binding for the spell book.  I would suggest you rebind it to a better key.  I use &quot;.&quot; on the numeric keypad.  Numeric keypad bindings have the advantage that you can use them while your chat line is active.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't believe that you should be using the /loadskin feature to use Xym's UI.  You should be unzipping the files into a directory called xym and then renaming the character .ini file to your character and server and then moving into your main EQ directory.  The .ini file that Xym created, targets the xym directory that the UI files are in.  Also important is that you must make sure that you have placed the xym directory in the EQ UI directory.  If you changed the xym directory name  to Xym, you will have problems, since the .ini file is looking for the lowercase xym.<br />
<br />
Within the files you extracted, there is a very detailed set of instructions on how to install.  You should most definitely read it.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

Load the default UI, you can then move the breath bar anywhere you want, reload this most excellent of UIs and the breath bar will now be where you moved it to.</div></div><hr />

How do I add that back or add the labels to the original window?<br />
Well, there are a few basic options.<br />
<br />
1) I could kludge together something that looks like a proper left hand panel that has spell gems, labels, inventory and all the proper decorations, but it would be messy to maintain and would not lend itself as nicely to things like resizing for different resolutions or swapping left and right.<br />
<br />
2) The inventory slots could be added below the floating spell bar just as they are in my default version, but they would be kindof strange looking glassy things hovering in mid air.  I don't know if this would be satisfying.<br />
<br />
3) Some other window, such as friends, could be used for the mini inventory, but it would not form a nice looking left panel with the spell gems.<br />
<br />
if you want to place it exactly (pixel by pixel), you will have to reload the UIs a lot of times to see if its really there where you want it. plus, I dont know if its just me, but when I load my custom UI it will take about 10-20 seconds till its loaded.<br />
Swapping UIs is pretty slow for me as well.  I would say 10-20 seconds is about right.<br />
<br />
If you want to place the breath bubbles, the easiest way is probably to give it a border before you log in (with &lt;Style_Border&gt;true&lt;/Style_Border&gt;), drag it into place, and then turn off the border next time you log out.  When I create a new character, I copy over the UI_*.ini file from an existing character so that I don't have to drag everything around and set chat filters again.<br />
<br />
Next time I update the UI, I will replace the breath bubbles with my own simple breath bar in the default.  Breath bubbles are available as a separate download already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are both correct.  Simply delete the EQUI_Inventory.xml file and you will get the default.  Hopefully that should work for any window in the UI.<br />
<br />
In general, if you want to try something like that, create a backup directory and move the files into that instead of deleting them.  It's a lot easier to backtrack if you still have the files.<br />
<br />
2) How can I revert back to the normal cursor? I am not sure what files to delete and if I need to edit anything in the animation folder.<br />
<br />
You need to edit the EQUI_Animations.xml file.  Find the definition of A_DefaultCursor and replace it with the version in the default UI:<br />
	&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DefaultCursor&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
		&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
			&lt;Texture&gt;window_pieces01.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
			&lt;Location&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;230&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;40&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;Size&gt;<br />
				&lt;CX&gt;22&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
				&lt;CY&gt;22&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;4&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;1&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
			&lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
If you want to replace it with some other cursor, there are many examples in the Mouse Pointers (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?op=showfiles&amp;catid=50)  UI category.</div></div><hr />

But if you want a good timer for mend check out Arista's UI timer (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp), and the thread about it here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3162).<br />

How would I go about getting the melee pet window to fit in a smaller resolution, preferably with a mend timer in it as well?<br />
<br />
Eloora is right about the timers.  If you want a general timer, check out Arista's.  It is possible to incorporate a timer into another window, but I think she hasn't gotten around to making variable width timers and her timers are too wide for my side panels.<br />
<br />
You could make a mend timer with my existing timer graphics.  Copy the example of the timer in the basic EQUI_PetInfoWindow, but change the animation durations to 1/10th and 1/60th of mend cycle time instead of 6 seconds and 1 second.  (I think that would be one minute and ten seconds, respectively, although I don't know if mend time varies with AAs or skill.)<br />
<br />
As for the resolution issue, that's an annoying one.  The height of the side windows at 1024x768 is 116x395.  At 1280x1024, they are 116x617.  A quick partial fix would be to set the height of the EQUI_PetInfoWindow to 395.  That will cut off the bottom third of the slots, so you would have to use the regular inventory to access them, but it will make the panel fit without overlapping.<br />
<br />
A more complete solution would be to shrink all the inventory slots down to 30x30 or 25x25 and rearrange them.  Unfortunately, RL has me very busy right now, so I probably won't have time for that in the next month.  The inventory and pet windows have been stable enough that I don't think it would be a waste to build all of the various resolution melée versions.<br />
<br />
Now, if someone starts asking for a left handed melée version at 1152x864, I might get fussy. ;)</div></div><hr />

Any help would be loved. Thanks<br />

Your pet's health bar will appear at the bottom of the group health window.  I use socials and the hot key box for pet commands, so the buttons in the pet window are useless clutter.<br />
<br />
If you want the regular pet info window instead of the tick timer, delete or rename the EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml file and you will get the default pet window.<br />
<br />
can you teach me how to make quick bag window and main / off hands slotI am not sure what you are asking for.  I think your problem might be solved by downloading a mod that puts clickies in some otherwise unused window, like the Friends window, or by a mod that adds primary and secondary slots to containers.</div></div><hr />

If you are using a viewport, the network status will move with the viewport.  Even with the recommended viewport (/viewport 80 0 1120 840), the network status will still overlap the upper left panel a little bit.<br />

I love the filigree you've done in this UI, it is gorgeous!Thank you. :)  I have worked very hard to integrate my artwork (and yours) into a functional and pleasing UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erathran</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I attempted to create a set of timers using that site you always link to when people talk about custum timers. I initially tried to have them placed in the friends window. This did not seem to affect anything, since I couldn't get it to show no matter what (toggled via hotkey repeatedly, no windows appeared or disappeared.<br />
<br />
I then decided I'd forgo the handy little generic timer, and so tried to put it in the pet window. This made all the various UI elements load the default versions of themselves, and didn't even have the decency to load my timers window :P<br />
<br />
While the latter attempt generated lots of msgs in the UIErrors.txt, the former didn't. While I'd prefer to make the former method work, getting the latter to work would also be acceptable. Anybody able to hit this UI-mod newbie w/ a clue-by-four?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just tested the timers in my friends window and they worked fine.  Both Alt-F and the friends button on the selector window brought up the timers, as expected.  Make sure you have both the .xml and .tga files downloaded and correctly named.  I believe they should be EQUI_FriendsWnd.xml and Friends_Timer.tga, respectively.<br />
<br />
If you have further troubles with the timer, please direct them to Arista, since I don't know much about her code.<br />
<br />
When you have an error log, it can be useful to post just the one or two lines of the UIErrors.txt file that contain the word &quot;Error&quot;.  The lines that start out &quot;Warning&quot; are mostly useless.</div></div><hr />

Thanks. The update looks even more awesome than usual. Love the mixed bubbles and percent. <br />

Only think that is inconvenient now is that missing range and ammo slots. Have to open the inventory window to make my mount. Hehe.. I am lazy.</div></div><hr />

That's another oops on my part.  I was testing Arista's timers, since someone said they were having trouble using them with my UI.  I never use the friends window, so I didn't realize it was still in there.<br />
<br />
I have updated the zip file.  If you already have the new version, remove the EQUI_FriendsWnd.xml file to get the default.<br />
<br />
Only think that is inconvenient now is that missing range and ammo slots.<br />
I had to remove them to make room for the spell book icon, which is now needed to access the spell set functions.  Would it be better to include more equipment slots and fewer general inventory slots?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I must say I absolutely love the new bars. Especially the little warning flashing bubbles. That would prob be great for a cleric.. but as a chanter.. I like it because it reminds me to tell the dolts pulling that I am LOM and won't be able to mezz the train they are pulling.<br />
<br />
Yes.. we use it.. heh.. I would not be as good a chanter without it, the timer lets me count mezz ticks so easily, it is very very rare that a mezz ever wears out because I have timed it wrong.<br />

Great Job.. hope you keep it up.</div></div><hr />

My preference is to dim the *entire* UI down to like 40% and have the viewport cover the whole screen.  (see attached picture of version_32 for example)<br />

Luckily all I had to do was edit the .ini to revert this back to the way I like it.  Other than that, I *really* enjoy this UI.  I've used it longer than any other I've found.<br />

Maybe it is just me or I am doing something wrong which is why I am posting here.  I unzipped all the files to my custom UI folder as normal and have no problems loading the custom UI.  I don't get &quot;Your XML files are imcompatible&quot; and everything is ok.<br />

Here is my problem/question.  I now have this black U-shaped border on my screen.  If I was to remove all my boxes such as hotkeys, buffs, player info, etc. that black border is still there.  If I zone the black border is there when my UI fades out until I zone back in.  I am not sure what this is as I never had this before.  Any idea of how to get rid of it?

<br />
I've found afew quirks in the 3.3 UI, I've been watching this thread to see if it is just me or if anyone else has run across these yet.<br />
When I hit the &quot;I&quot; key in game for bringing up my inventory, It invites whoever I have targeted into my group as well as bringing up my inventory. I've checked to make sure my control key isn't stuck, even changed keyboards..<br />
Also, I can't grab my backpacks and move them or drag them around anymore.<br />
And on the top right of the UI, where the Invite/Disband buttons are, I can't seem to click on them either. But the stand/sit buttons on the left work fine. <br />
Everything else seems ok so far.... <br />
I don't know if I got a corrupted file when I downloaded 3.3 or if some xml code has a bug. here are the errors listed in the UUIErrors log;<br />

I'll keep checking at this end, and redownload/reinstall the UI and addons ( textstats/1024 resolution/xymcursors/Odakupet ) <br />
<br />
Even with these minor quirks, still the only UI my friends or I use !<br />
It's the best.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bugs there are the result of the older version of the 1024 resolution.  I've been slowly getting all the versions updated.  Tonight I uploaded the 1024 resolution version and the version with the old style gauges.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry it is taking so long.  I've been offline for a couple of months, so everything is a mess.  I'll get the remaning resolutions up in the next day or two, I hope.<br />
<br />
When I hit the &quot;I&quot; key in game for bringing up my inventory, It invites whoever I have targeted into my group as well as bringing up my inventory.<br />
Check your key bindings and make sure &quot;i&quot; isn't bound to invite.  I don't think that's something that could be caused by my UI, since those bindings are stored in your eqclient.ini file, not in a UI_*.ini file.<br />
<br />
Also, I can't grab my backpacks and move them or drag them around anymore.<br />
That's a feature. ;)  I made the bags nearly impossible to move, because 99% of the time, I want them to stay put.  To move them, you need to grab them along the top two pixels of the border near the sides.  I'll put up a non-sticky version of the containers for those who want them.<br />
<br />
And on the top right of the UI, where the Invite/Disband buttons are, I can't seem to click on them either.<br />
Hm, I don't click buttons, so I don't know if they actually work.  I'll try to remember to test it next time I am online.  When you have this problem, make sure the buttons aren't covered up by the transparent part of some other window.<br />

Could not find child StandButton in window PetInfoWindow.<br />
That message is coming from your pet mod, of course.</div></div><hr />

I have bugged that because I thought it was them and not the UI. I eventually figure out there is a VERY small clickable area. Now that I know about it, I love it..  I hate accidentally moving my bags around and this helps alot during tradeskilling when I am moving stuff out of my bags into the kiln or whatever.<br />
<br />
Thanks for yet another innovation I would not have thought of.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I didn't think of it either.  Initially I made my bags with no borders, so they were completely unmovable.  You had to switch to default just to move the bags around.  This was annoying and I thought they looked ugly.<br />
<br />
Now that the sticky bags have made their way into my full UI, I should credit Enok.  He worked out the code to make virtually unmovable windows with borders.  I should also warn folks about them in the readme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I have updated the blurb for my UI to credit Enok for the container code and added a description of the sticky containers to the Readme.txt file.  (Does anyone read that?)<br />
<br />
I have also uploaded a version of the containers that is somewhat easier to move.  It awaits moderation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bruceslog</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're Awesome ! Thank You ! <br />
The quirks I had were mostly the 1024 resolution, Thank you for updating that so fast ! ( I'm at the point where I am lost without your UI, when it is broken, my odds of getting killed while hunting increase proportionately )  <br />
The &quot;I&quot; invientory button that was inviting people was indeed a changed setting in the keyboard. Must have been a ghost. Thanks for pointing out the obvious place to start looking to troubleshoot that one.. *embarassed* Got it fixed. <br />
And yes, I knew the backpacks had a very small border to move them around with.. I shoulda mentioned that I've been using your UI since 3.0 ish, About 6 months now. I don't move them often myself, but sometimes, like in bazaar, there just isn't enough screen space to see everything I need to see. Turned out I couldn't move my backpacks because of a mouse cursor I was trying out which had me edit the EQUI Annimations file and changed the cursor size, location and hotspot along with the default cursor name. Between the mouse size and the backpacks 2 pixel grab border, my chances for grabbing and moving a backpack were atomic, it seems. Anyway, installed on of your cursors and all is well now.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for all your fast attention to updates and bugs ! <br />
I recommend this UI to everyone, and most say they are gonna use it when I describe it to them !<br />

     I liked the smaller swirly gauges myself, with the wider player window. <br />
____________________________________________________<br />
quote: <br />
Before I updated today, I had pretty swirley progress bars. Now, after changing to the new Xym UI, I have the fat bars, and my grouping window (or target window, it does both) is all shrunk and leaving a gap. <br />
____________________________________________________<br />
I personally use the wider gem gauges instead of the swirly gauges, so I decided to make that the default. I will try to get patches out for the other versions tomorrow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you all for the compliments. I had been wondering if anyone was actually using my UI any more. I guess it is worth continuing to update it. <br />
____________________________________________________<br />
<br />
In case you were wondering if more than one person liked the lager window with the smaller gauges.<br />
I've been looking at and comparing the Player Window xml pages, and I see the differences, but I&quot;m not sure if I can make the changes or just replace the 3.3 version Player Window xml file with the 3.2 version, along with it's associated tga files. Especially since one of the versions is remarked that it also requires a Deco xml file and the other doesn't remark this. I don't want to break anything :) Anyway, another vote for the Bigger PlayerWindow and smaller swiry gauges here :)<br />
<br />
If you want to walk me through it, I can make the changes and send them your way to check if I got it right ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have put up a patch for the swirly gauges for 1280x1024.  The only window that is changed substantially is the player window.  In all other windows, the change is a simple string substitution of &quot;A_SwirlGauge&quot; for &quot;FiveGauge&quot; in every window that has gauges.<br />
<br />
You can find the patch that gives you the old swirly gauges here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1357).  The player window should work ok for all resolutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">loveicy</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">first off, THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! I have had all 7 of my chars with different UI's for each becuae I could never find that universal one. I had looked at your UI before and found it too overwhelming becuase it took up all my sceen, but that was before I became viewport swavy :D . I have now uploaded all my chars with your UI. It is so simple and easy to read and get used to. It feels as if I have always used it.<br />
<br />
Anyways enough of the brownie points. I uploaded it with the following alterations:<br />
<br />
1. T.Kings book for each different caster, V2 all of them.<br />
2. Swirly gauges for all<br />
3. Switched to text stats<br />
4. Moved some insta clickies, did the numbers only, like a prior post on page 10 suggested.<br />
<br />
Now I get the following whenever I first load the UI:<br />

These errors are from the map viewer window, EQUI_MapViewWnd.xml, which is not a part of my UI.  You must have downloaded someone else's map viewer mod.  I'm not sure how they could have forgotten so many buttons though.  It should be safe to delete the file entirely.<br />

I use the melee version since I am a Level 65 Warrior (for 2 days now :D ).  The only problem that I have seen in the UI is in the middle section for the group.  Their is no Health % listed for the other group members.  Personally I like to see the health of others in my group in %'s so I may monitor the health of say the glass jawed Enchanter in my group.  Is their possible for you to make a modification for me to get a % health for the other group members in the group window.  Also, if you could put F2 thru F6 labels next to each of them.<br />

Hm, I took those out to reduce clutter in the group window for pure melée characters.  You can get them back trivially by using the regular version of the player window.  It will also have two extraneous &quot;0&quot;s, one for mana and one for pet health.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can uncomment them from the EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml file.  The missing elements are all defined in the file, but I have commented them out in the melée version.  At the end of the file, replace these lines:<br />
		&lt;!-- &lt;Pieces&gt;PW_Group1_Pct&lt;/Pieces&gt; --&gt;<br />
		&lt;!-- &lt;Pieces&gt;PW_Group2_Pct&lt;/Pieces&gt; --&gt;<br />

		&lt;!-- &lt;Pieces&gt;PW_Group4_Pct&lt;/Pieces&gt; --&gt;<br />
		&lt;!-- &lt;Pieces&gt;PW_Group5_Pct&lt;/Pieces&gt; --&gt;<br />
<br />
		&lt;!-- &lt;Pieces&gt;PW_F2&lt;/Pieces&gt; --&gt;<br />
		&lt;!-- &lt;Pieces&gt;PW_F3&lt;/Pieces&gt; --&gt;<br />
		&lt;!-- &lt;Pieces&gt;PW_F4&lt;/Pieces&gt; --&gt;<br />
		&lt;!-- &lt;Pieces&gt;PW_F5&lt;/Pieces&gt; --&gt;<br />
		&lt;!-- &lt;Pieces&gt;PW_F6&lt;/Pieces&gt; --&gt;with these lines:		&lt;Pieces&gt;PW_Group1_Pct&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;PW_Group2_Pct&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;PW_Group3_Pct&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;PW_Group4_Pct&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;PW_Group5_Pct&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;PW_F2&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;PW_F3&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;PW_F4&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;PW_F5&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
		&lt;Pieces&gt;PW_F6&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />

Im new at understanding all of this, so I hope I understand you.  If you right click on a window, you will get window options.  Amongst those options is a &quot;lock&quot; feature.  If there is an askterisk by &quot;lock&quot; it can not be moved, however if you left click on &quot;lock&quot; you will have a moveable window again.  That goes for most of the windows, if not all.  Let me know if I'm on the right track.  Goodluck and goodday!</div></div><hr />

That happens to me too.  I /bugged it, but I haven't heard more about it.  For now, I would suggest you make your hot keys from the inventory window.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, there are still primary, secondary and eight inventory slots on the left under the spell gems.  I had to remove range and ammo to make room for the spell book so that we can use the new spell sets.<br />

First, I love this UI.  I know you hear that all the time, but I honestly do.  I use many modifications, different inventory window, different mp3 player, some of the modifications from this thread.<br />
<br />
But I have two questions, one that was asked earlier and I couldn't find an answer and a new one.<br />
<br />
1) Can you add the lastname (surname) to the experience window?  I am not sure why it doesn't show, is very strange, but maybe you can answer this why question and if possible a how to fix it.<br />
<br />
2) Can you add the LFG button to the group window.  Now of course I don't know where to add it.  since I love the group window with the functin key's and the %'s listed next to each member.  But if it can be done in a nice way..even small..that would be great.<br />
<br />
Thank you.  And again.  Awesome UI for a caster.  absolutely awesome.<br />

Hm, my last name appears in that window properly.  Are you sure you are using the current UI version?  Are you testing with a character that has a last name?<br />
<br />

The group window is in use as the upper right corner panel.  The panel with all the group health bars is actually the player window.  The button cannot be moved from the group window, so it will have to remain in the upper right corner.</div></div><hr />

I dont have a screen shot or anything but I noticed when I had used your 1024 verison their was a problem in the buff window.  It was somewhere in the 10 to 15 (I cant remember exactly what buff slot it was) the name would be not allighned probertly.  It had like 10 spaces before the first letter of the buff name.  I am not sure if anyone else noticed that.  Just wanted to let you know.</div></div><hr />

The easiest solution is: /load default 1<br />
 Move bags<br />
 /load xym 1Alternatively you can edit your UI_charname_##.ini file to set the positions explicitly.  This is what I do to set things up nicely.<br />

Thanks, I will check that out.  I only tried that resolution with a low level character, so I doubt she ever had more than three buffs. ;)<br />

I too am one of those who have to have a moveable chat box, Drives me crazy if all my windows do not move.<br />
<br />
I renamed the UI file you included in your zips to match my Monk but it put all the windows one right on top of the other and can not move them. <br />
<br />
I first tried the 3.3 UI with the patch for 1024 Reso, and things moved, I came and did some reading on the boards and saw that if you play a Melee you should patch the Melee 3.3 I did this and again renamed the file, now none of the windows move.<br />

Thank you so much in advance for any help you can send my way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the windows are locked in place.  To unlock a window, right click on it and uncheck the Lock tag.  The chat windows are not locked, but they have very thin borders on the sides and bottom.  Inventory containers are also not locked, but they have very small active areas for moving them.<br />
<br />
If you have context menus turned off, you will have to turn them on in the Options window before you can unlock anything.<br />
<br />
I don't have a 1024 resolution melee window setup, so that ini file won't do you any good.  You'll also find that the left hand inventory window doesn't fit in the space allotted to it at that resolution, since it was designed for the 1280 resolution.<br />
<br />
Most of the windows end up pretty close to the right position if you do a plain &quot;/load xym&quot;.  You can use the options window to fix the opacity of all windows at once.</div></div><hr />

   Dunno if anyone else is experiencing this problem, or if it's specific to me, but since installing the latest version of the Xym UI (would have been 3.3a), the &quot;shuffle&quot; button on the Mp3 player no longer works!<br />
   With the exception of this very minor problem, I haven't had ANY conflicts with your UI since it's original posting so long ago.  :)   I really do appreciate all the hard work that you put into creating and keeping this UI current.  I suggest it to any/all players looking for a truly exceptional UI!  Thanks Xymarra!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">since installing the latest version of the Xym UI (would have been 3.3a), the &quot;shuffle&quot; button on the Mp3 player no longer works! I just tested it and it works fine for me.  I have not changed that file in months.  You might try loading default for a moment (/load default 1) to see if the problem stems from the UI or something else.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I do not.  When I tried to check it on test center, the shared plat slot wasn't working.  I'll try to get it done after work tonight.<br />
<br />
For now, if you want to use the shared plat slot, just delete the EQUI_BigBankWindow.xml file from your xym directory.  I don't think any of the other changes will be a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yyandros</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello again<br />
<br />
   I did some testing today on the Mp3 player problem I'm having, and apologize for not doing so before.  I'll start by clarifying the problem a bit as well, since I was rather vague in my earlier post (lack of sleep will do that to you :p ) and the Random button does actually do something when pressed.  It starts playing the songs from top order down, and never actually randomizes them.  <br />
   Using the default skin, the Random Button works fine.  I installed the 33 version of your UI and the Random Button works fine there as well.  Did a clean install of UI version 33a, and no luck.  If I use the 33a version of your UI and remove the EQUI_MusicPlayerWnd.xml file, the Random Button works.  I did notice a difference in file size between the EQUI_MusicPlayerWnd.xml in the 33 and 33a versions, especially a difference in the XML where the Random Button is concerned, but upon examination I couldn't glean anything more since I'm XML challenged  :(   I do apologize for bothering you with this problem, but am trying to help iron out any bugs I find (of which this is the only I've found, I might add :) ).  Thanks for your time and I hope some of this nonsense I've typed helps.  Take care!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I think I found the problem with the random button, so I put that file in the patch.  Unfortunately, servers are down, so I can't test it.  I did test the bank box and I got no errors with this UI version.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeriena</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya. Thanks for this awesome skin! I love it, it's nearly perfectly what I want. That said there is only one thing I would change and my version of Sidl Widl is not working anymore for some reason. I have nearly 0 knowledge of doing it in notepad so I was hoping someone here could give me a hand or point me to where Sidl Widl is downloadable (all I can find are broken links).<br />
 The skin I was using had spell labels for the castspellwindow similar to the mod here except the labels were in thin air. Meaning they were to the right of the spell gems with no background of their own. Just white letters on the main screen. <br />
 I got a little lazy using that skin and it was nice being able to see the names of the spells I had at a glance cuz those gem icons are just too small no matter what. <br />
 I tried using the mod here for that but then I lose the inventory slots and the spell book icon to quick mem my spell sets. :(<br />
 Can someone give me a hand altering the castspellwindow to do what I want?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

Can you help? You have to use the options menu to move them over.  Right click on the border of the window where you want the pet hits and misses.  Follow Filters to Pet Hits and Pet Misses.  You will have to do this separately for each.  If you don't get a context menu, make sure you haven't disabled them in the options window.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed this because when the UI was broken with the new update, these problems went away.<br />
<br />
When levitated of any type, I fall like a stone with the UI up. Without it, it functions like it always has. Everything was great until the update where the fillagree disappeared.<br />
<br />
The other bug is that I outrun the zoneout. Instead of hitting that magical point, I end up running right through it and off the world if I am not careful. This is most evident zoning out of neth lair into DSP or MS.<br />
<br />
No problems with either if I do not have the UI.<br />

I go through serious withdrawels when I have to use the default.  Good grief!   I have slightly modified yours by adding 4 additional chat windows right above the main chat windows.  I use these for melee and spell damage.  At any rate, I was sooooo happy when I checked tonight and saw a patch was available.  Thanks again, Xym!  Best UI in EQ!</div></div><hr />

I also found two bugs in the UI while playing tonight and uploaded fixes for both.   Group member health percentages were cut off and I couldn't see the normal cash slots in the bank.  If you are having either of those problems, try downloading 3.4 again.<br />
<br />
In this version, I took advantage of a recent bug fix to reorganize several of the windows so that maintaining the various resolutions should be much easier.  This means that the guts of several files changed quite a bit.   If you are having trouble patching an earlier version, please get 3.4.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I think it was dexterity that was missing.  I noticed it late last night but I was too tired to fix it.  I will try to get it patched tonight.<br />
<br />
Had a problem with the trade window. It doesn't come up. I bet what is happening is that it is coming up off the screen.  You have three options to fix this:<br />
<br />
1) Try doing a &quot;/load xym&quot; without a 1 to make all the windows move to default positions.  You will have to arrange things a bit to make it look nice again, but it should all be visible.<br />
<br />
2) Use the .ini file included with the UI version you are using.  I think the trade windows should be in reasonable positions in all of them, since I think I did a &quot;/load xym&quot; for each.<br />
<br />
3) Edit your .ini file and put the window in a reasonable place at your resolution.  0,0 will be the upper left corner.  From there you can move it with your mouse to a nice place.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the latest version 34 and i cannot find the normal (regular) coin slots in the abnk window, only the shared pp slot. That is a bug I fixed last night.  Try downloading 3.4 again.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure if you noticed or not but when you do the Melee and the 1024 version of your UI the Pet window (Clicks) covers up about  the top quarter of the hotkey window.  Is their a way to change that so it fits better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trivially you can change that window to have the same height as the buffs window for 1024 (CY = 395).  You will lose the bottom clickies, but the window will fit.</div></div><hr />

Xym34a has a new ini file that doesn't put the loot window off the screen (yes, that was my fault).<br />
<br />
If you are using a resolution other than 1280x1024, you will have to re-download the basic 3.4a patch as well as the 3.4a patch for your resolution to get the update.  The melee patch should be ok as it is since it only changes the pet window.</div></div><hr />

I running into a few problems.  I dont know if it is the old files that I add to the new 34 version.  Or if they changed how the xml files work.

I tried to just edit the shortduration and buffwindows files and change the wdt to left or right like you told me to do before but that does not work either.

<br />
I've installed version 3.4a, and the 1600x1200 patch. Everything works fine, except the group window (EQUI_PlayerWindow) is too narrow to take up the space between the two chat windows.<br />
<br />
I've tried changing this myself, but so far have only been able to adjust the width of the controls on the window, not the window itself. It means I've getting target names and pet health bars running off the edge of the window. <br />

I'm missing something somewhere... but can't find it. :(</div></div><hr />

I switched my default health bars from the old swirly gauges to gem gauges with flashing gems below 40%.  Previously, the 1600 resolution version was using the older gauges, which were set in a wider player window.<br />
<br />
You can fix the immediate problem by resizing your chat windows to fill the gaps.  Some day when I have time I will get the old style windows upgraded to the new UI framework.<br />
<br />
If you want to get a head start on me, you can look at the previous swirly gauge patch (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1357).</div></div><hr />

What I plan to do is move the tick timer to the friends window and make a real pet window to display the pet buff icons.  The new default UI and melee version should be available late tonight.<br />

In the meantime, I think the only windows from my UI that were changed were the Actions window and the Pet window.  If you delete or rename those two files, the UI should load.</div></div><hr />

Okay thanks.  Curiously I was wonderiing what was diffrent in your loot window then the default one.  For the link function to show up I just deleted your loot window from the xym folder.</div></div><hr />

It is a limitation in the UI that the pet box can only be resized horizontally.  You can give it a different vertical size by editing your .ini file with a text editor.<br />
<br />
Also, is there anyway that you can add the option of the pet buttons? <br />
I'm still playing around with the pet window to figure out what I like.<br />
<br />
For certain I will create an optional standalone pet window with health bar, buffs and command buttons to replace my existing standalone pet window.<br />
<br />
I don't like using the friends window for the tick timer because it goes away when I hit escape.  So what I am currently playing with is a pet window that is just the tick timer with the pet icons floating in the air to the side of it.  I like the look of it, but for some reason, after I add the pet buffs, I can't move it with the mouse any more. :P<br />
<br />
Are you going to come out with a 1024x768 melee window by chance?<br />
That is something I resist doing.  Every different version I create adds one more mod I have to update when things change.<br />
<br />
A partial solution is to download the existing melee mod and change its size to fit.  It only changes one file, EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml.  Edit that file.  Near the end of the file, change the size of the window from:<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
  &lt;CX&gt;116&lt;/CX&gt; <br />
  &lt;CY&gt;617&lt;/CY&gt; <br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
to<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
  &lt;CX&gt;116&lt;/CX&gt; <br />
  &lt;CY&gt;395&lt;/CY&gt; <br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
Some of the inventory will be cut off, but the window will form a clean left side to the UI.  A true 1024x768 melee mod would require that I lay out the full inventory in the smaller space.</div></div><hr />

That was perfect. Resized the pet window to 50 (same size as songs window) and place on the left side of options bar. The spell icons get placed horizontally and looks great. Thanks for you prompt help as always :)<br />

You can give it a different vertical size by editing your .ini file with a text editor. <br />
<br />
<br />
That was perfect. Resized the pet window to 50 (same size as songs window) and place on the left side of options bar. The spell icons get placed horizontally and looks great. Thanks for you prompt help as always<br />
<br />
Darkspell (or anyone who can help),<br />
<br />
I am not too familiar with editing the files needed to do this.  But I know that if someone could explain how to edit the pet window file and which areas to edit to make the pet window the same size as the songs window, I would be very much appreciative.  The big window keeps getting in the way for me and I would rather have a window that I can resize down to a small box since my pet never has a lot of buffs on him anyway.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help you can throw my way.<br />

I had to swap the Target and Player windows to get the highlight in the right place.  Currently the target highlight is a large oval around the target health bar.  It will be changing some day (when I have time) to a more attractive highlight.<br />

Everytime the melee patch is unzipped it returns to default.  Also been having the same default trouble when trying to run the 1024 X 768 resolution patch with the new version 3.5.  All steps in downloading, installing, and running the interface were followed correctly.  On my current laptop I am unable to turn my screen resolution higher than 1024X768, so I am unable to use the interface with the intended higher resolution.  <br />

Love the interface design, just wish I could use it.  :-)  Any help or news on this problem would be much appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

What I did to get it to work correctly is for the Melee version it needs to be in a folder named xymm.  That is if you use the UI_xymarra_eci.ini file that comes with the download.  Most likely you just changed the name of that ini file to UI_charactername_server.ini.  If you did that you will get default since in the ini file is looking for a folder named xymm in the UIfiles folder.  Hope what I typed is very clear hehe.<br />
<br />
If you do what I did to get it up and running you will need to move 2 windows to the proper areas.  I had to move the window with the Group Information from the bottum right to the center under neath the target window, and the stats window from bottum center to bottum right.</div></div><hr />

Was a bit of a hassle since I have timer gauges and a diff cursor.. but Xym works great and it was worth the little bit of work.<br />

The right-left swap mod will require a new player window instead of target window, since I switched the roles of those panels.<br />

The various high resolution mods will need to use the default corner panels for now, but the buff and spell cast side panels should still be ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Went into the uifiles folder and created a folder called &quot;Xym&quot;.<br />
2.  Opened winzip with your latest GUI, And pressed EXTRACT, and extracted to the &quot;Xym&quot; folder.<br />
3.  Opened the 1024x768 mod and Extracted all the files into the &quot;Xym&quot; folder, pressing YES TO ALL to overwrite ALL files (Note:  Including the .ini file)<br />
4.  Renamed the ini file to UI_AnarchyAo_65    (65 is my server code for Luclin).<br />
5.  Copied the ini file and pasted into the main Everquest directory, and then deleted the older ini file of mine (UI_AnarchyAo_Luclin)<br />
6.  Loaded Everquest, typed /load Xym<br />
<br />
<br />
Then the default EQ GUI changed to black with gold border, I got the new cursor, and the spell icons were different looking, but that is it, the GUI didnt install properly.<br />

why are you not using T.King g2 icons already? <br />
A couple reasons.  First, I don't like the stat buff icons.  They are dominated by the arm and all look extremely similar when small.  When he has finalized the set, I will have to draw new icons for sta, agi and dex.  Second, there are some errors, particularly with the resist icons.  In May he claimed they would be fixed soon.  I will switch when he fixes those errors.</div></div><hr />

   Quick question.  What am I doin wrong.  I am trying to use the ui in 1024 res with melee patch.  Everything seems to be working except that the inventory window that should go on the left hand side seems to be still in the larger res and spans almost the whole left side of the screen.  Is there a way to shrink it down.  Or did I just apply the patches in the wrong order.  <br />
<br />
I : <br />
1) unzipped the ui in a new folder<br />
2) unzipped the 1024 patch<br />
3) unzipped the melee patch<br />
4) unzipped the black color patch<br />
5) copied the xym file over and renamed for my char( I used the UI_Xym1024_ file.<br />
<br />
Should I load the 1024 patch last?<br />
<br />
I am gonna try to reload that one and see what happens<br />

The main problem is that the 1024 patch and the melee patch don't quite work together.  You can make the melee pet window fit the screen by setting it's size to 395 pixels tall.<br />
<br />
Edit the file EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml in any text editor.  Notepad should work.  Near the bottom, change the size of the window to:<br />
<br />
&lt;Size&gt;&lt;CX&gt;114&lt;/CX&gt;&lt;CY&gt;395&lt;/CY&gt;&lt;/Size&gt;<br />

<br />
Maybe as another solution for the 1024 reso version for a melee version is if you can move the gloves the boots clickie from their present possition (under Range/Ammo).  Move the gloves and boots above the inventory bag slots.  Also move the Primary, Secondary. Range, Ammo above the inventory.  That way then you can leave say 4 inventory bag slots visible to help those..  I am not sure how hard it would be to change that code or if people would even want that.<br />
<br />
Just an idea.</div></div><hr />

You can regain the original backgrounds for the spell icons by copying the definitions for RedIconBackground and BlueIconBackground from the default in the EQUI_Animations.xml file.</div></div><hr />

I think you need to click the icon and not the label part of the buff button.  The labels are actually completely separate entities from the buff icons.  If that is what you are doing and the spells still refuse to be unclicked, please let me know which resolution you are using and any other modifications to the UI.<br />
<br />
How can I keep a box such as the storyline box from disappearing when I hit ESC?<br />
I am afraid we don't have any control over this.  The game designers have chosen which UI elements are closed with the escape button and which remain open and which windows remain open from one playing session to the next or across zones.  Almost every window that remains open when you hit ESC or zone is used as an integral part of my UI.</div></div><hr />

I checked out my UI on test a couple weeks ago and fixed the issues with the combat abilities window.  The window_pieces07.tga file was missing from EQUI_Animations.xml.  That is included in the main download now.<br />
<br />
The stamina bar is the thin yellow bar under your health and mana bars.  It shouldn't need any patches to work properly.<br />
<br />
I haven't managed to log in since the patch, so I don't know if anything else is broken.  I plan to have the combat indicator animation and any other xml errors fixed this weekend.  I will be gone for two weeks after that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's obvious that alot of attention went into the fit and trim.<br />
<br />
My only beef is that I just cant make out the spell gems -- I think its a double whammy of being the tking gems, which look great, but I am not used to seeing and them being small and surrounded by the philals (sp).<br />
<br />
I saw the mod to show the spell names below, but wondered if there was a way graphically to make the gems easier to discern?<br />
<br />
I am playign an enchanter, and I have a ton of spells to move in and out.<br />
<br />
Some ideas would be to have a less ornate spell bar, or perhaps the option of using the simpler and more familiar (but admittedly ugiler) standard small spell icons?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any tips.</div></div><hr />

The tking icons look so much cooler though, its a tough choice.<br />
<br />
I am trying the &quot;words at bottom&quot; bar right now, and it does help, howeverI am looking at this big bar, and both length wise and width wise there is a lot of extra space that is not &quot;info&quot; ie the icons themselves.<br />

   I don't know if you are aware, but the 11th buff down in the window, has a problem with its text label, it seems to start the name on the second line and if the buff has 2 lines it overlaps the 12th buff name.

However, I have one question.  When I enstalled my mod, I replaced the .ini file in the eq directory as instructed.  But then I got kind of worried that, if for any reason I needed to turn the mod off, will my window be messed up?  If so, did I completely screw up, or is there some way to get the old one back?  At least I'll make a copy of it so I can have it on hand if necessary.  Thanks, and great work!:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly what the ini file does is set the UI window sizes and locations.  It also changes the colors of class names in the raid window and sets the global fade options.<br />
<br />
At the worst, when you went back to your old UI, you would have to drag the windows back where you want them and change the class name colors around.<br />
<br />
If you have spent a lot of time laying out your UI and setting those options, it would probably be wise to backup your ini file before you overwrite it.</div></div><hr />

I haven't fixed my pet window mod since the buffs were added.  It would certainly give xml errors and might even crash the game if you tried it, so I would not recommend it.  I will put fixing that window on my to-do list.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, you can delete the EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml file to get the default or download any standalone pet window mod.  There should be no problem with any of them.  If you have any trouble using the default pet window, please post about it and I will check it out.<br />

Try removing the lines that specify the size in your ini file.<br />
<br />
Look for the section headed [PetInfoWindow].  In that section remove the lines of the form: <br />
<br />
Width1280x1024=###<br />
Height1280x1024=###<br />
<br />
This will cause the pet window to use its default dimensions, which should show all the buttons.</div></div><hr />
