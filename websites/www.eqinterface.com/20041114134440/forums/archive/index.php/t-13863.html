http://home.comcast.net/~hawkreneq/TargetRing.gif<br />
<br />
It has matching assist and mark rings.. Those are what I need help testing and snapshots of..<br />
<br />
The only ring that spins is the target ring.. All other rings are static.. There is also a static target ring included in the zip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the look of the ring. I downloaded the zip file and loaded it to my UI. <br />
<br />
I'll post screenshots ASAP after the first raid I'm on so I can get all of the shots you need</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">plexx</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was wondering....how did you get that to spin, i finaly got my own made and was wanting to get it to spin, but whenever i try and adjust the twistspeed its one big high speed mess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plexx:<br />
Download it and look at it. It's a 4-frame animation. I don't use the twistspeed at all. The duration controls how fast it turns.  The lower the duration the faster it turns..<br />
<br />
Edit: Also TargetIndicator04.tga doesn't belong in there.. I forgot to delete it before zipping it up..<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone:<br />
I'm still waiting for confirmation that the mark rings work correctly and some screenshots would be cool. Then, I can upload it to the downloads section..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizak</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just tested the Mark, im sorry i dont have a screen shot for you, so ill try to explain.<br />
<br />
It had the same size and color as &quot;Assist&quot;, and in it was written &quot;Mark 2&quot;.<br />
<br />
It was like this both with and with out Delegate MA.<br />
<br />
It dident work well with Delegate MA, as they had same size. And FYI, i only have Mark 1 :)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps you, keep up the good work on those rings, they rock !<br />
<br />
Lizak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback Lizak..<br />
<br />
I just uploaded a new version based on that feed back.. The mark rings should now appear in order 1,2,3.. <br />
<br />
I changed the color of the mark rings to purple and the assist ring to cyan.. The assist ring should appear on top of the mark rings now.. Let me know what you guys think :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizak</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok i have tested these new changes.<br />
<br />
The Mark ring says &quot;Mark 4&quot; now, when i use my Mark 1. <br />
<br />
When i have MA and Mark 1 on the same target, they &quot;stack&quot; so to speak.. same as before.<br />
However it makes a White ring when combined, i guess Purple and Cyan = White /shrug.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is an idea, push the Mark text 90 degree, that way when MA and Mark is on same target, it will still be shown easy.<br />
<br />
I liked the Red MA better, but Purple would perhaps be even better. Please make the MA the Purple one, or change it back to Red :)<br />
<br />
I have 4 leader points saved, was going to max my Mana, but if you get Mark 1 fixed, ill train Mark 2, and see if it works with that as well.<br />
<br />
Again nice work Talyns, soon everyone would (or should) use these rings !<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizak</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been playing a few hours with the Cyan MA, it works fine :)<br />
<br />
Lizak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm.... Mark 4 Damn... Ok I think I fixed it this time.. Don't know why they have definitions for 4 mark rings if only 3 will ever be used..<br />
<br />
I rotated the assist ring about 90 degrees..<br />
<br />
I made the MA Ring the brighter so that when the mark is targeted it will light up with the cyan..  Now, The &quot;Assist&quot; (on the ring) should show up in purple if its a mark and normal if not..<br />
<br />
Uploaded a new version check it out..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizak</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dident see any change :(<br />
<br />
Lizak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only real visible change should be the mark ring numbering</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizak</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I installed the changes 2 times, restartet EQ, loaded new skin several times as well, i dident see any changes.<br />
<br />
Mark 1, is still &quot;Mark 4&quot;<br />
<br />
When Delegate MA and Mark is on same mob, same effect as described above.<br />
<br />
Ill take some Screen Shots and Email them to you, i dont have any web space to upload too :(<br />
<br />
Lizak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm.. When I tried downloading the attachment from the first post.. It downloaded the old version of the file &quot;Beta 2&quot;..  Should be beta3.<br />
<br />
Not sure, but, that could be the cause you aren't seeing any changes.. Are you sure got Tablets_3dRing_Beta3?<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm gonna reattach it to this post.. Please try it again and see if there are any changes.. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizak</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok i tested the new rings...... perfect!<br />
<br />
Mark 1 says Mark 1, when both Mark and MA on same target, you can make out both text.<br />
<br />
Im gonna try to get a picture uploaded, and post it, hopefully with Mark 2 as well :)<br />
<br />
Lizak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool.. If Mark 1 is right all the rest should be right :)<br />
<br />
Pictures would be awesome.. I need pictures of the new color Assist, Any one the mark rings, and a Mark Ring with the Assist Ring over it. That way I can include a picture of every ring with the upload..<br />
<br />
I sent you an email.. You can send them there if it is easier..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I uploaded the 4th version of these rings..  I think they are pretty much done.. I need to know if it all looks right.. I would like an in-game screenshot of the assist ring over the mark ring. You shouldn't be able to see the mark ring through the Assist.<br />
<br />
I tweaked the graphics some and I made the assist ring blink.<br />
<br />
there's now 3 mods included:<br />
all static - No Blinking Assist or Turning Target<br />
Target Static - Assist Blink<br />
Target Spinning - Assist Static<br />
<br />
Download Beta4 Here:<br />
