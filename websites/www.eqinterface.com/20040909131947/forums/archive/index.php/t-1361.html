Actualy the READTME.txt file tells you exactly how to change them, they are very simple. for instance find where it says<br />
<br />
A_MiniInvWrist<br />
change that to<br />
A_MiniInvLegs<br />
<br />
Then look at where it says <br />
EQTYPE 9 or 10 (9 is left wrist 10 is right wrist)<br />
change it to<br />
EQTYPE 18<br />

I really like the mods for this UI, however I would like to use a different inventory and spellbook (prefer the old fashioned look for those) I overwrite the xml files, but the UI screws up and I have broken windows. How do I incorporate parts of Verts UI with other mods?<br />
<br />
Is it possible to also have remove the border from some of the chat windows so that when I lock a few together, it does not look too bulky or can you only have one type of chat window..?<br />

Unfortunately no.<br />
Verant has never given us a way to see other people's mana. And probably never will. There are no packets being sent that include your mana to anyone, so there is no way to include it in your UI. Keep asking for mana... :(</div></div><hr />

Yes, if you know XML find the Location of the spellgems, and move them closer together. Unfortunetly you can't use the VERT background if you do this. (For the spell gems)<br />

You know how there is the &quot; - 100% + &quot; thing in the AA options window that allows you to allocate the amount of xp goin to AA points?  Well is there anyway to code that into the Player Info window?  Horizontal or Vertical?<br />

  100%  (with the - and + centered on the percentage)<br />

I am looking for the vertical one on the right side  of the window or the horizontal one on the very bottom under my little Str, AC and Hp icons ( I use the Original Vert style with some mods ).<br />

I think this would be a neat mod for those that like to switch the amount of AA xp depending on the con of the mob or the amount of ppl in the group ( for those that arent 60 yet ).<br />

Can you take the Vert Spell Gems and add the spell names to the right and the number of the slot to the left. One last request would be to put the ammo slot for horse bridals next to the spell book.<br />
<br />
Would look like this:<br />
<br />
1-Spell Gem-Spell Name<br />
2-Spell Gem-Spell Name<br />
3-Spell Gem-Spell Name<br />
4-Spell Gem-Spell Name<br />
5-Spell Gem-Spell Name<br />
6-Spell Gem-Spell Name<br />
7-Spell Gem-Spell Name<br />
8-Spell Gem-Spell Name<br />
Spell Book X Ammo Slot X<br />
<br />
Fargus<br />
<br />
Edited: Boggle....thinking about to many mods at once.</div></div><hr />

THe spellbook background textures are loaded in the EQUI_Animations.xml.<br />
Vert uses a smaller spellbook and edited the aforementioned file to load his smaller textures. Thus, when you overwrite his EQUI_SpellbookWnd.xml with another it uses the textures loaded with size information for Verts Spellbook  --&gt; crappy spellbook!<br />

I've been toying with this idea myself.  I might try that tonight and see if I can swap the vert spellbook out for one of those fancy ones.  The theory on doing it is making your own animations file and including that in the spellbook xml file.  Shouldn't be difficult.  If I don't screw it up, I'll post it here =)</div></div><hr />

I might try that tonight and see if I can swap the vert spellbook out for one of those fancy ones. The theory on doing it is making your own animations file and including that in the spellbook xml file. Shouldn't be difficult. If I don't screw it up, I'll post it here =) <br />

Already did that, check out Vert Add-Ons thread (http://139.81.52.39/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1360) <br />

Note the full name of the group member doesn't completely show up, but unless I make the box wider (which I do not want to do)<br />
or make it Taller and add the member name above the stats. (again for the compactness I do not want to do) Or make the name smaller font (Which not sure I want to do :P )<br />
we must live with it. Now if you want it tweaked abit I will make the changes, but over all I'm happy.</div></div><hr />

i love verts vision of a UI, but it seems a bit melee oriented. here goes. hehe, i currently use the drakah UI great layout for a caster. i was wondering if verts UI can be modified to sit in a layout like drakah's. :)<br />
<br />
what i like about drakah's layout is it has the spell icons vertical and numbered to the left, next to that it has horizontally placed hot button row ontop off an inventory row, both of these are below a chat window. next to these are a set of right clice items blow the grp and player info windows. then to the right of that there is another chat window.<br />
<br />
whats esp nice about this layout is the finished look of one solid foot print. is it possible to have verts UI arranged in this fashion? i supposse i could place the items in this arrangment but it lacks that finished look? here is a SS of my set up, maybe someone could help me cause i am codeless(clueless) ;) hehe<br />

Here's what im gonna try to do fer you guys by the end of the night cause i gotta take off fer the long weekend.<br />
<br />
-  I figured out why vert mod slows down for only casters. with the spellgems, the system resourses are too full. people with slow computers will get super lag. as i did on my 2nd computer.<br />
So Updating spell gems as we speak and the problem is fixed..<br />
<br />
- Pet line bar properly working in Player Window<br />
<br />
- Gonna see how fast i can make the Blue Crystal Meth mod for all those crazy blue lovers... No promises thoa.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I appologize for releasing a wee bit too early.. especailly to Kudane / Dolby. as this might cause more traffic later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Howerver, If anyone has time and loves to mod mods heres the following Ive love to see changed :)<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Spell casting bar smaller has those borders on it and it makes it far to big.<br />
<br />
2) Menu bar  -   Making it like the default one but compatiable with verts mods...i tried using the default one but it just doesnt work.<br />
<br />
3) Pet Controls.   Wheres back off gone? :) - Pet runs off how to call it back button isnt there anymore.<br />
<br />
4) Removing the bar at the top of the group window totaly...which would then remove the invite / join buttons etc. So move them to left bar.<br />
<br />
5) Add a spelll book icon to memed spells bar.  I personally perfer the book to be in the middle of the 8 icons ....splitting then 4 by 4.... my own mod does this but doesnt look quite right with verts lol.<br />
<br />
6) Move the done button...or add another (which would be cooler) to the spell book on the opposite site :)<br />
<br />
7) I was getting STA and STR bolded on the &quot;pet window&quot; and none of the other stats showing bold just normal...is that right?<br />
<br />
<br />
If these cant be done...just take them as feedback vert :)<br />
<br />
<br />
btw...Has almost everyone changed the colours of the HP bar back to red? I know i did :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again for an amazing mod <br />
<br />

<br />
I have no idea how to edit .tga files or anything like that and really would rather not mess it up.<br />
<br />
I have only installed specific peices of this UI and I have other parts done differently. What this means is that I currently have a Ragebringer Cursor :(<br />
<br />
Is there a copy of window_pieces01.tga file that has the default cursor in it that I could possible get a hold of? This is the only file that I think needs to be updated for me to get back my old cursor.<br />
<br />
If someone could post it or send me an email at : Marten_V@hotmail.com it would be greatly Appreciated.</div></div><hr />

HB page Selector<br />
HB1 HB2 HB3 HB4 HB5 HB6 HB7 HB8 HB9 HB0 RANGE  INV1<br />

<br />
Could you setup one like that maybe also do the same as the hot bar 2x10 with 10 hot buttons uptop with page selector and inventory below with page selector.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I'm looking for a Vert mod with the default spell gems, or one to work with t.king's spell gems. Thanks in advanced for anyone that can do this for me.</div></div><hr />

I want to have a set of tabes, and have each tab linked to an HTML file. I want to use this for my Trade Skill mod I'm working on and I've been having some problems getting it to work. And yes, the HTML files are not online files, they are just a set of HTML files I have written for the UI, similar to the PNP files used in EQToolboxes Map mod.</div></div><hr />

Secondly, I am currently running vert 2.1 dozen roses because it's the closest thing I can find to purple.  The one mod I miss most from my 1.1vert is the horizontal hotkey mod that Sokol made.  Please let me know if anyone has converted this or can.  Would be extremely appreciated.  Thank you in advance!<br />

I've been using Vert mod 1.1 and seem to like it better than 2.0, but have a small request. I have been trying to get the inventory window from Abattoirv1's mod (listed on 2nd page of the Released thread) to integrate with the vert 1.1 mod but haven't the first clue on how to do the animation code. Anyone able to lend a hand and upload a .zip file with the animation changes por favor? Would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.<br />
