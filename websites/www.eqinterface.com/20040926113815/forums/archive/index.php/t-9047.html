<br />
I fancy myself as almost an amatuer 3d artist. After looking at some of the excellent work done on UI mods in this forum, I too think I would like to dabble in the arcane arts of the UI MOD. So here is my question, I have a particular work that I would like to incorporate into the center picture of my Inventory Screen. Since the work is finished (Something I threw together for my guild) how do I proceed..I have PhotoShop at my disposal..Are there size requirements? Is it as simple as pasting the pic on a transparent layer in PS? Your help would be most appreciated. I have attatched the little pic for your opinions on suitablility.<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

<br />
also when saving the tga, make sure and set the canvast side to 128x256, since the texture files for the ui, need to be in specific sizes.<br />
<br />
I added  a zip with the default inventory that shows you what you need to add to your inventory to get your image to work, i cropped and resized your image a bit so it would fit.</div></div><hr />
