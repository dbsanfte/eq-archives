<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceBlast</div><div class="date">03-09-2003, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The IceBlastUI-4.3 series files have just been uploaded and are awaiting moderation.  IceBlastUI-4.3 comes is now in all the colors of the current Vert Mod (Cannabis, Neptune, Ocean Spray, Nexium, Pepto).<br />
<br />
***Note: You need to edit a line in the UI_Icetope_45.ini file which I had forgotten to do myself.  Please find in the file where it says UISkin=IceBlastUI-OceanSpray and change the words 'IceBlastUI-OceanSpray' to the name of whatever version of the UI you are using for that particular character, unless of course OceanSpray is the color you are using.***</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanys.Neoconker</div><div class="date">03-09-2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What resolution is this based on?  It looks like the picture wasn't &quot;shrunken&quot; at all, so I would be safe to guess 1024x784?  Just let me know as this is a good UI, but I really hate going below 1280x1024.  My main UI is on that resolution, but when doing something big and need viewport, I switch to 1900x1400 and use Kao's UI.  Just lemme know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceBlast</div><div class="date">03-09-2003, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">UI meant for 1024x768 but really since the text boxes are stretchable it really shouldn't matter if you use a higher resolution.  If you use a resolution higher then 1024x768 just don't use the character .ini file.  I would use it with a higher resolution if I could but I'm using a pretty crappy video card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xelot Bloodseer</div><div class="date">03-09-2003, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if I got a magnet in my pocket or it's just my magnetic personality, but in the v4.0 of Iceblast, the compass is ~45 degrees off. I don't remember which direction, but when facing in an absolute direction (N, S, E, W) the pointer lands in between. My sense heading is capped, btw...<br />
<br />
I also noticed that the new compass is now centered in it's &quot;mount&quot;... Is there a painless way that I could swap it out for a /loc compass? (Without buggering things up, I hope...)<br />
<br />
It is a great UI overall... I use it on all my characters. Thanks for the updates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceBlast</div><div class="date">03-10-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just replace with window_pieces04.tga file.<br />
Also if you have a program like Adobe Photoshop and can view .tga files open up that file from the default ui folder and then the one from mine......the N,E,S,W is in the same place as the default one.</div></div><hr />
