<br />
THIS IS PERFECT !!!!   <br />
the casting bar  is translucent, so i can see all the text UNDER It  :) <br />
<br />
AMAZING and  ALMOST as good as a FRESH CUP OF COFFEE !!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I updated the entire UI today, should be downloadable this afternoon I hope...  please note, the player window and breath window have been removed...  the player window will be redundant and can be closed by pressing ALT Y, if you wish to close it.<br />
<br />
once I get around to it, here is a list of windows that will be killed in my UI..<br />
<br />
 Guild window..................|crashed on me last night, we are not on speaking terms|<br />
 Friends window...............|does anyone ever use this?|<br />
 Petition window..............|SOE really doesn't care about my class, why should I care about their system|<br />
 both Journal windows.......|again another window I don't use, though probably should|<br />
 Map window....................|made the game to easy|<br />
 Map Toolbar window..........|pointless without the map|<br />
 Compass window...............|made the game to easy|<br />
<br />
<br />
Scrapped list, no longer mad at above windows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the Selector (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=2258) window was finalized today..  however the main UI will not be updated till I fix my new pet and buff windows  :) <br />
<br />
the above list still applys but I am less mad at a few of the windows listed  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Complete finalization is in progress..  Proof_Of_Concept attached<br />
<br />
just trying to figure out what else I can compress to make it even smaller..  ok enough from me, going back to my corner now  :nana:<br />
<br />
currently the final version has no options..  I'm taking suggestions now.. will put in as many as I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Avalon nor the next UI will survive the OoW expansion..  I'd recommend Mortis UI (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=1589) as a replacement.<br />
<br />
sorry... goodbye</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">is anyone having trouble loading the final version?  I heard from a druid I know that she is having trouble..  Come on I know at least 3 people who like the UI, surely there is a 4th out there who has tested it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok fixed the errors..  the inital error was a extra &lt;include&gt; line in the EQUI.xml that I had in their when I tryed to make a animated background.<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Steppin's suggestions for the AYA rounded map to be included with the Avalon UI has been accepted and placed in the mod..<br />
<br />
I'm still taking suggestions or changes requests..  post up people :-)<br />
<br />
this brick wall isn't going to like all my jabber for much longer<br />
<br />
I'd much like not to post a &quot;Bithker&quot; thread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a patch for the Avalon UI can be found on the first post in this thread<br />
First Post (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showpost.php?p=73675&amp;postcount=1)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did a bit of rework and shrunk some code in the UI today.<br />
  Fixed a longtime plauging problem with all version of Lunix, that when you press ALT Y to open the player window it would crash you to desktop.<br />
  The solution was to allow the default player window to load, seeing as how this window is unused in Lunix 3 press ALT Y to close it, unless of course, you perfer the window open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Original Concept (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=3538) <br />
Latest Final (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/showthumbs.php?id=2277) <br />
<br />
well least you can't say I didn't make some improvments :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fayleen Da`Nokf</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been using the UI more now that my comp is steady. Love it. Its made it so much easier for me. The organization on the bank slots is great * if only i didnt have so much crap!!!* and i like not having to scroll for the merchants. Raided with this UI and its made it soooooo much easier. <br />
My new shamanistic duties as *gasp* healer ( that so sucks) was made easier by the changing colors on the target as the HP's go down. <br />
I like how the cast bar is intergrated, much larger to see. <br />
The map feature is awsome, and the compass is easier to navigate with. <br />
Thanks Vum its helped tons.</div></div><hr />
