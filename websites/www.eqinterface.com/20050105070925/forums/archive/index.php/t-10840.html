<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bappen</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently recieved Lazereth's latest version of his UI and was notified that he quit EQ...I had requested a small modification to the UI...that a mana bar and % be added to the player window or the stamina removed and the mana bar inserted in it's place.  I have no clue how to do this on my own...so any help with be greatly appreciated.  Will try to post the version of the UI that Lazereth sent me.</div></div><hr />

Post it with the graphics so that I can see is and I'll try to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See how it's also missing the percent sign on the bottom gauge. I tryed compairing it to the default player window, but since I know nothing about the code I couldn't make head or tails out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See if this one suits your fancy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treage</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Works perfectly, thanks a ton!!<br />
<br />
I'm going to link your fix to the original Lazereth thread so others who download it can use it with their casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treage</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to ask for more help, but would you know how I can make the chat boxes sizable, or where to adjust it's current size? I want to put a horizontal combat abilities bar below the melee spam box(under where it says Askr the Lost) so that everything is nice and neat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A work-around to resize the chat window would be to load the deafult UI using the current ini.  The chat window is sizeable by default, and once the default UI is loaded you can easily grab a border and adjust it.<br />
Just make sure that is is not &quot;Locked&quot; by right clicking the title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treage</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks so much! That did the trick.<br />
<br />
Now this UI is exactly what I was hoping for since my old one stopped working. I'm going to edit my original post and link this thread since it answers a few people's questions.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately it appears to be the same color as the mark that is made to find an LDoN camp, and I have been stuck asking for a /loc.<br />
<br />
The compass window houses not only the compass, but the me vs them hit point meters as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treage</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tryed it, and the gold background is really nice, but the camp marker still isn't showing. I'm not sure if there is an underlay covering it up or something else keeping it from showing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would not have anything to do with the file that I edited.  I just changed the graphics file.  Except for the new colors the window should work exactly the same as before.  <br />
Are you sure that the line was showing before?<br />
<br />
I'll look at the xml of the window and see if there is an obvious fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A quick look at the code and it appears that the compass strips have been moved under a screen in the window.  The LDoN marker is hardcoded to appear on the compass window, and cannot be moved.<br />
Once I finish cleaning up the code, I will load it up in game and see if I can fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treage</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks alot for all your help!</div></div><hr />

I cleaned up the code, well really I re-coded the whole thing from scratch.<br />
I also edited the graphics files.<br />
<br />
Let me know if this works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treage</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry I took so long to get back to you, but I haven't played any LDoN in the last week or so. I tryed it out today, and unfortunately it isn't working still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cannot see any reason why this does not work for LDON.  The compass part itself is identical to the coding that I use on my compasses for two different UIs and they both work.<br />
<br />
I'd like someone else to test this and see if there might be a comflict on your machine somewhere.  I'll try to find some play time and while I'm waiting for everyone to buff and med before we go in I'll load it up and see what I can see.<br />
<br />
I wish there was an easier way to test it...sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treage</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A friend of mine loaded it up yesterday, and I can run 2 instances on this box long enough to see if it works for him in Everfrost. If he's on tonight I'll get him to check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I did a couple adventures last night and loaded this up to test it.  The ldon line showed up fine.<br />
<br />
Here is the zip with the files that I used.  I'll make a second post that shows the pic with it working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the screenshot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treage</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it didn't work for me so I assume there is a conflict elsewhere. I copied all my old UI to another spot then deleted the contents of the Laz folder. I then re-downloaded his original file and put your 2 fixes in it. <br />
<br />
It would appear to be working for you, so is there anyway you can make a .zip file of yours so I can try that?<br />
<br />
Once again, Thank You for taking the time to work on this for me. I truly like the simplisitc and informative lay-out he came up with, and would really like to use it. <br />
<br />
On a side note, college withstanding, is there a program that I could use to figure these things out for myself? I tryed SidWidl back when the custom UI's became available and it kept crashing on me. Also, there wasn't a good way to check my files without having to be online at the same time. Is there a simulator type program that I could use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check my post two above yours.  That one has in it the exact files that I tested it with last night.  <br />
<br />
I do not use the whole UI.  I only grabbed the parts I needed to modify the compass.<br />
<br />
It is possible that the zip I posted prior to yesterday was not working.  I did look throught the coding, and may have made some kind of modification.  <br />
<br />
Everything that I know I have muddled through on my own.  Mostly by hacking into the xml and then seeing what I made it do.  Xml isn't as scary looking in grid view.<br />
<br />
I use SidlWidl when I need to view a window and don't feel like loading up EQ.  It doesn't crash for me very often, and I tend to only recieve errors because of duplicate nameing and autostretch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skater121100</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This UI is pretty nice! ;)<br />
<br />
Would someone go in and update it to have a target of target health bar? So that, when you look at this picture (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=2572) , there will be the target's target next to where it says Askr the Lost. I'd do it myself, but do not know how to start.. since I've never modified a UI before, hehe.<br />
<br />
Also, when I first got this UI... looking at the actions window, and I think the group window as well, there was a white border.. basically covering up the xp/ap name and their percentages. It also did this when clicking a different section of the actions window.. the white area would become larger - only being allowed to see the clickies of actions (hope that made sense).<br />
<br />
Thanks if anyone would be kind enough to do this :) This has really been the only UI that's really stuck out to me and I'd want to keep.</div></div><hr />

Anyone out there interested in fixing this UI up? hehe :/</div></div><hr />
