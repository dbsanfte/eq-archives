<br />
Right now, I'm using the default UI, tried a couple skins, couldn't really find one I really liked.  So, going to my old UI, that I'm attaching, I added a couple comments of what I would like to see customized.  <br />
<br />
If you know anyone who is willing to help me out, let me know, please.<br />
<br />
One thing... yes, I like having that many windows :D .  I pretty much want the same layout, just a couple tweaks to my UI. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">might i suggest Vert 2.2 (in any color...) it has everything you want (cept the horozontal buffs) but you can add that one piece..<br />
<br />
takea look at this screen shot.<br />
<br />
 Screenshot (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=681)<br />
<br />
you will notice the stats window on the right side (lower right) buffs do have names and are not that far stuck out.. <br />
<br />
and there are lots of pre-built tweaks to this in the vert section<br />
<br />
<br />
you can find the blue version (pictured) here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=681)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lansydyr</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, this UI is just about perfect for what I like, was able to customize layout pretty good, messed up the hotkeys a little, but I've used the same ones for so long it didn't really matter, just had to rename them.  (They reverted to numbers for some reason).<br />
<br />
I know it's on the &quot;things you can't do&quot; list, but on monkly-business, someone showed a picture of the pet window being turned into a timer.  Is there actually a way to do that? or to have a clock in the upper right corner (digital), cause I think I saw that somewhere also.<br />
<br />
Thanks for directing me to the UI, though :D</div></div><hr />

Mannhec's UI Page (http://mannhec.home.insightbb.com/) <br />
UI's here made by a friend of mine. Pretty nice and customizable and comes with quite a few of the features that you wanted.<br />
<br />
I've got a UI mod that converts the Pets Window into a window that list all stats. I'll attach it, there's a pic of it inside the zip file.</div></div><hr />
