I shrunk one of t.king's inventories to 256x256 and it looks quite nice but I can't seem to make the fonts smaller so they fit in the window. I went through the xml file by hand and painstakingly changed every single &lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt; to &lt;Font&gt;1&lt;/Font&gt; but it didn't change anything as far as I can tell :( anyone know why? attaching the xml file in text format so you can look at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">10-14-2002, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as font sizes go, you have a range of 0 to 5, 0 being the smallest of course. However, the only things effected by font size in that UI file are &lt;Label&gt;'s and &lt;Button&gt;'s, and only them assuming that there is text which goes along with either. All of the letters and words which might appear on the individual Inventory buttons are actually done in the graphic itself, therefore you'd have to edit the graphic file if you wanted to change the text there. But, if you are wanting to change the text such as the stats, or on the buttons such as the 'Skills' button, then what you're trying is correct. Try going to a 0 (this would be quite small for most people) and see if that helps.</div></div><hr />
