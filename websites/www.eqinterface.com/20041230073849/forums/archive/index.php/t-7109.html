<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sithos</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking for a good wizzie UI that is up to date with LoY expansion. VERY new to this UI business so any help would be appreciatted.<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for is:<br />
<br />
VERY easy to install complete package..IE Download it unzip it to uifiles and I'm basically gtg. Either that or newbie step by step instructions on how to set it up.<br />
<br />
Player Window showing %'s for mana/health/xp/axp<br />
<br />
Hotbutton panel with inventory slots in one<br />
<br />
1 chat screen<br />
<br />
Inventory with charm slot<br />
<br />
Prefer to run in 640X480..yes I'm old and blind :)<br />
<br />
Effects Area with buff icons and names<br />
<br />
Group Area showing % health for group members<br />
<br />
Easy to move panels etc<br />
<br />
Spellbar I prefer circular<br />
<br />
That's about all I'm seeking ATM until I'm used to this. Not overly worried about new spellbook's/casting bar,Icons etc unless they come as part of 1 complete package.<br />
<br />
So if anyone is able to help out either e-mail me or post a direct link as to where I might find it.I have tried many many of the complete packages here but I always get the good old xml error and it loads default.<br />
<br />
Thanks again to anyone who may be able to help<br />

I would love everything you have listed with a few exceptions:  i just need 800x600, T.King icons, a spell bar that is possibly a 2x4, and a T.King spell book.<br />
<br />
I am not skilled/knowledgable with cutting and pasting the updated xml files and would be afraid that I would delete something and really screw things up.<br />
<br />
If you find one or anyone else does pls send me a pm or post it here so that I can download it.</div></div><hr />
