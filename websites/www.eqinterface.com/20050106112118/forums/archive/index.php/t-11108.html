<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rellix</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried playing around with it and haven't been able to succeed, but is there a way to make the health bar color the same as the con color? Or what is the variable called that determines the con color for TargetBox.tga?  I know that it takes:<br />
<br />
&lt;R&gt;x&lt;/R&gt;<br />
&lt;G&gt;x&lt;/G&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;x&lt;/B&gt;<br />
<br />
but maybe it's still possible? Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notdedyet</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked in EQUI.xml, EQUI_Animations.xml, and EQUI_TargetWindow.xml and did not find any reference to TargetIndicator.ini in any of them. My thoughts on this is that TargetIndicator.ini is called by the EQ client itself, not by EQUI_TargetWindow.xml, so the coloring of the background based on the /con of the target cannot transferred to the health bar as it is something that is hardcoded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nwinn</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you made your target hp bar white, then made a target indicator animation to lay over that... it might look funny as target health goes down but, I think you could rig up something that'd look decent at least... with some playing around :|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowblazer</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is exactly the effect I was trying for when attempting to work the con color into my own UI.  I was unable to come up with a version that was suitable to my tastes though.  The problem I had seems to be a z-order one.  I could not, no matter how I arranged the pieces, get the target color overlay to show up on top of the target HP gauge.  The gauge always seems to want to show up on top.  <br />
<br />
It's still possible to achieve this look though, just not &quot;perfectly.&quot;  I was able to create a new gauge graphic with a semi-transparent alpha channel and then modify the mask on TargetBox.tga to be colored only where the target's health gauge is.  Then I set the target gauge to this new graphic, removed its background and set the fill color to white.  This worked, to a point.  I was able to get the filled gauge to look exactly how I wanted but, as nwinn said, it looks funny as the target's health goes down.  <br />
<br />
I also tried making the portion of TargetBox.tga that's used look like a gauge background.  This also worked to a point, but I couldn't get the unfilled and filled coloring to be different enough to be able to see how much of the gauge was filled at a glance.<br />
<br />
All these problems, plus the fact that a white gauge (for even cons) looks kinda ugly (not to mention the fact that I overlay the target's name over their hp gauge to minimize space, and it's hard to find a color for the text that's visible on green, cyan, blue, white, yellow and red) made me drop the idea and just go for a nice outer glow effect around the gauge.<br />
<br />
So in short, you can do this, but it's not gonna be perfect.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

It has basically what you said, where the gauge is transparent. It is a little weird looking, but look at mine before you give up the idea. I REALLY LIKE how mine turned out.<br />
