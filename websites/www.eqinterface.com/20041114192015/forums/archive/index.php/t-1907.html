<br />
You can take a look at a SS from it at my homepage:<br />

What do you think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The inventory window especially is very sharp -- I never imagined it would fit into a column like that.  But doesn't it open and close itself automatically when you are banking, looting, or hitting the escape key to clear target?<br />
<br />
I also like the way you integrated your own hp/mana bars with the target (and group) window -- an important addition with the player window way up in the corner.  But the group/target windows appear to be slightly off-center in the viewport... that would bother me.<br />
<br />
Oh.. have you tried it at 640x480?  That bears little similarity to 1024x768.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">herbapou</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the target window, the tin pink line is the casting gauge.<br />
<br />
In the group window on the player F1 section, you have HP then 2 tin gauge:  mana and pet hp.<br />
<br />
In the player window, again the pink line is the casting gauge (i was casting a spell).  When not casting, the mana gauge is full blue.<br />
<br />
Anyone noticed that empty gauge are shown?<br />
<br />
The inventory window will close when you zone or with the escape key.  That is why I will add a player window w/ inventory.  Only problem is the skill/aa/destroy buttons dont work when put in the player window.<br />
<br />
Has for the target window beeing not perfectly center above the group window, all windows are moveable, so it can be adjust. This is NOT a resolution dependent UI, everything can be move around.<br />
<br />
I have test the windows in 640x480 and with various /view settings and it looks great.  I will post SS later on my homepage<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps:  <br />
<br />
I am having trouble with the containers window and chat window.  If anyone can make the chatbox line between the chat and the input moveable, plz tell me.  <br />
<br />
Also I tried to reduce the containers icons but I am having troubles with the done and combine buttons alignements and the total variable height of the containers (depending of the kind of bags, ...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">09-10-2002, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The container window resizes itself based on the location of objects in the window.  But objects that are autostretch instead of at a fixed location don't count.  So you can switch the done and combine buttons to autostretch to have more control.  Make them a certain distance above the bottom of the window, similar to how the chat input window in the chat window works.<br />
<br />
I've put a few container mods up here, you might want to look at them.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you mean by the chatbox line.  If you mean the border around the chat input line there is no way to turn it off.  But you can make a new window draw template that doesn't have a border.  Then change the chat input box from type WDT_Inner to your new one.  I've posted a modified chat window that does that, you could look for mine.<br />
<br />
If you mean sizable , such as to make the chat input window taller, I don't think that is possible.  The chat input is only a single line of text.</div></div><hr />
