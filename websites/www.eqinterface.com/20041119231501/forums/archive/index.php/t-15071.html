<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aramil Dannodel</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, before I explain them, I'm going to recommend that before you ask about EQTypes, to check out the sticky post for EQTypes. (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=8276)  That post has been updated with a good bit of fervor, and the newer stuff can always be found near the bottom.<br />
<br />
Originally, the EQTypes for the buff slots (1 through 15) were 45 through 59, but due to the new buff slots, SOE decided to bunch all the EQTypes for them together to make it easier to edit.  The new numbers for buff slots 1 through 20 are 500 to 519.  Now, at this time, the EQTypes 45 to 59 still work for the original fifteen spots, but I highly recommend changing them to the new EQTypes assigned to them, as I've very little doubt that SOE will make them exclusive to the original 15 spots in the future through UI changes.  In other words, it's much easier to just change them to the new ones now and save a hassle later.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this helps a little bit.<br />

<br />
Good clean code example from link below, I stole the code from Turlo and added the new buff slots (And made it smaller, which is better heh)<br />
