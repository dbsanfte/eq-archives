Any information on how to change that over?</div></div><hr />

The blinking red around the player window is hard-coded. So, the only way to get that around the &quot;target window&quot; is to turn the player window into the target window. To do this, you can reposition all existing player window content off the screen and put in a new gauge with EQType 6, which is target HP I think.<br />
<br />
If you want, you can then go about adding your player window stuff into your previous target window and make it the player window I guess. You'd lose some functionality I believe. You may not be able to click your health bar to target yourself and the pet health wouldn't automatically pop up I don't think. But again, I've never tried, so I'm not sure how much you'd lose.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps you somewhat.<br />
