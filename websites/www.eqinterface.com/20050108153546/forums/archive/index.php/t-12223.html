<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scaevola</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that Soes mod has color changing hp bars and I've looked at the code in his/her UI and I've tried integrating it with the UI I'm working on.  But It won't seem to work.  And I've been looking around but there seems to be no great tutorial or explanation of how to integrate into one's UI.  <br />
<br />
So I'm asking.  If someone could post or contact me and could tell me how to integrate color changing hp bars into my UI(preferred) or do it for me.  If someone could tell me or explain how I'd be glad to write up a faq or tutorial on how to do it.  As numerous people have been contacting me about this code.  I'm not sure if the origninal author (I believe its Enokhaon) still plays.<br />
<br />
So if anyone could modify my UI or tell me how to(preferred) I'd be much obliged.  You can pm me here or email scaevola16@hotmail.com<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance I hope.</div></div><hr />

make a bar with its color-changing<br />
i think it hard coaded so y axis cnat be &lt; 15 though so make one abot<br />
108,15 <br />
and add caps and lines and ud have a gague that would change color.<br />
<br />
set the xml to use the the bar u just made to &quot;gague fill&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
u could also make a semi transpareent fill what would go over the original afore menchioned bar(the one at the top of this reply) so it would change color as it moved over.<br />
<br />
<br />
if ur talking about a constantly changing one  i have no idea.  maybe a gif like thing<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
edit**** i forgot,  all gagues will be like this.  unless ne1 knows a way to use more that 1 gauge pleze tell.</div></div><hr />

Let me look back through my notes and I will attempt to help you understand how it works and how you go about making it work for yourself.<br />

Also in response the the other reply.  Yes you can make it so that every gauge in your UI is completely different.</div></div><hr />

But I've finally gotten around to this having some free time to update and improve the UI that's been in development since like Novem.  First the holidays(56k from ethernet wahh!) {plus sharing 1 phone line for voice/internet w/ 5 ppl). ...Then loads of work...Been working up a storm...Just finished my 2nd Aid Grimel Earing so basically = Have a lot more free time!!<br />
<br />
I was hoping to get some help transfering group heal bars to color changing dependent on health.  I've looked at Selos code and I still have questions..if anyone that replies still visits this or knows indepth of how to modify code.  PM or post here.  If someone can teach me, I'll post an indepth tutorial on how to do it.  With step by step code examples(depending on how complex this really is). <br />
<br />
Or <br />
Make a webpage and post it on how to change the default mod to adding in color changing bars or something.  It seems that the posts that I've seen today more people are interested in adding this set up.<br />
<br />
Sorry to bump this -but I've been away forever ..hoping to get some time to work on it next week(midterms) or after that.<br />
<br />
Most updated copy is posted..the one i've been working on i t ried to combine  Soe's but I have had no luck just lots of errors.</div></div><hr />

I disagree its not.  If you like I'll post you my attempt to convert and I get horrendous amounts of errors.  I have fairly good programming back ground and html(less though html wise) been programing in C,C++, Java for going on 5 years now.  And I can't get it work.  And I've asked Soes and s/he told me that someone else modified it FOR her.  That's why I was asking for help.  I'll post my modified xml file this afternoon.  I have spent few days trying get it work recently with no luck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not saying seos code isn't good but trying to integrate it into another skin is not as easy.  <br />
<br />
Why I suggested if someone could show me how.  to make up a walk thru add hp color changing colors to the basic default ui</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyste</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked at the code in the Soes stuff that does the color changing yesterday...<br />
<br />
13 years of C / C++ coding, and I'm gonna tell ya... whoever wrote that was VERY good, and a little twisted ;)<br />
<br />
I could tell you what it does, it's pulling some tricks by creating different color bars that are bigger than they really are, then overlapping them in sections so as one empties out, the next color becomes visible. <br />
<br />
What I can't tell you is WHY it works. Talk about twisted... creating a bar that's 10000 pixels long, then offsetting by 8000 ( + some wierd value ) and overlapping the visible bar background... and each sucessive bar color is both shorter, and offset by a different amount... WHY in the world that displays at all, never mind does exactly what he wants, is beyond me :p <br />
<br />
Your best bet with that code would be, copy and paste the entire chunk of color changing gauge code, then copy the window_pieces TGA file and rename it to something unique. Change the reference in the gauge code to the new filename, and you can ignore everything else in the TGA file. <br />
<br />
That SHOULD give you a new color changing gauge. You'll have to do that either in the window file you want to change, or in your Animations file ( if you're already using a custom one ).<br />
<br />
You'll be stuck with the look of the Soes gauges, which could be a problem if your UI looks significantly different. And the size too, although if you're REALLY careful about updating sizes you should be able to change the gauge size without distorting it... I think.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried it yet... but I know I wouldn't change that TGA file, even to try and paste the gauge graphics into my own. Not without understanding what the wierd offsets do and why they work...<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scaevola</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did that a month or two ago ..printed 50+ pages of xml and started drawing lines and editing and all I got was errors.  The UI i'm working on is the one I updated but I was trying to expand it -- It is not as different as black and white.  But its not the same either.  I'm trying to integrate hp bars into the default since NO One seems to know how explain this to anyone.  <br />
<br />
<br />
This is why I think a faq need to be written.  This post already got 500+ views.  so apparently somePeople probably are curious about this as well.  <br />
<br />
If no one wishes to explain I can try if someone can tell me how.  Or modify my original group.xml file( the delta 2.3 one) and send it back and i'll go back and look at what you did and try to convey that to the rest.  That's the reason  I was posting in the first place.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows one more quick question are the bars related to .tga files in soes mods? or can you just integrate using the default?  I know its coded in the .xml for different colors related to different precent of life etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The TGA files are not anything more than a gray bar.  The colors are not defined by the TGA file.  The colors are define by the XML code.  If I completely understood how Enok did it I would help.  But he explained it to me and it was a trick with the math and the way that XML code deals with the math.<br />
<br />
For the most part he just took the actual size of the bars and multiply them by 1000 I think.  more or less it wound up that the number I had in place were right they were just shifted left 3 places.  I am not completely sure about that number by I seem to remember that number from when her helped me get my bars working.  I played around with it and with different sizes to get the hang of it,  that was 6 months ago.  So I am trying to go back through all my code and figure out what I was doing at the time.<br />
<br />
I am sorry I have been gone for a month now.  Real life interrupted me for a little while.  I will get back into my code this weekend and will hopefully be able to explain it by monday morning.  I will update this message at that time to let you know how it is done to the best of my ability.  It you want you can attach your group code here and I will add the code in to make your bars work and outline the section I change and how they were changed so that you can make up the hot to doc since I am not all that good at righting documents to explain things.</div></div><hr />

been trying for the past week or two to reverse engineer it and fit it into my vert windows with no luck. :(<br />
<br />
well, back to the grindstone... if i have any luck piecing this out, i'll post my findings on how/why this works, and how to make it work with other ui's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Turlo</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, a friend of mine told me about this UI and decided to give it a look.  Unfortunately, I am at work right now, but what I see so far looks incredible.  I can't wait to try to decypher it.<br />
<br />
So, when I figure it out (at least I like to think &quot;when&quot; and not &quot;if&quot;), I will post what I discover.<br />
<br />
The gauntlet has been thrown down!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, Folks here is what I have been albe to decipher from the talks that Enok and I had to originally get this to work.  This is going to be a long post so get some coffee or Coke and have a seat.  Also not sure if this will all fit in a single post either so I may have to have multiple posts to get this all in.<br />
<br />
First let me say the gauge that this is being used for this is of the following size in the UI itself:<br />
<br />
&lt;CX&gt;123&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;50&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
<br />
That being said I will attempt to explain each part as I go along  with the code to review for reference.<br />
<br />
The first thing you will need to do is re-calculate your gauge size for the X part (horizontally).  In this case, and this is my suggestion so as to make the math easier on yourselves, I used a multiplier of 100 so the size now becomes:<br />
<br />
&lt;CX&gt;12300&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;50&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
<br />
The reason for this is so that later when we actually place the gauge in the UI it will more or less adjust with in the actually gauge size to make that color appear when we want it to.<br />
<br />
The gause will actually be made up of three parts for the three colors I used.  Red, Green and Yellow<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
The following are the three gauge parts.  I will explain each part as I go.<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;SAL_LGaugeBackground_Enok_x100&quot;&gt;<br />
     &lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
     &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;Texture&gt;window_pieces051.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
     &lt;Location&gt;<br />
          &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
          &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
     &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
     &lt;Size&gt;<br />
          &lt;CX&gt;12300&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
          &lt;CY&gt;50&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
     &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
     &lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
          &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
          &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
     &lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
     &lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
     &lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
This is the section that defines the primary/Full Health color section of the Gauge.  As you can see the gauge size is 100x larger than the gauge will actually be.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
Here is the second gauge section for the yellow/warning section of the gauge.<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;SAL_LGaugeFill_Enok3&quot;&gt;<br />
	&lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
	&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;Texture&gt;window_pieces051.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
	&lt;Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;X&gt;-6150&lt;/X&gt;<br />
		&lt;Y&gt;58&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
	&lt;Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;CX&gt;12300&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
		&lt;CY&gt;50&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
	&lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
		&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
		&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
	&lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
This section defines the point at which the gauge changes to Yellow/warning color.  As you can see the offset has been adjusted to -6150.  The reason for this is so as to deal with the percentage I wanted to be at when the gauge changed color, in this case at 50% the gauge will change from Green to Yellow.  You get this value by finding 50% of 12300 which is the Horizontal length of the Gauge.  Then you offset to the negative so that it shows up as the gauge empties.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
Here is the Thrid section for the Gauge for the Red/Critical part of the Gauge.<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;SAL_LGaugeFill_Enok1&quot;&gt;<br />
	&lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
	&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;Texture&gt;window_pieces051.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
	&lt;Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;X&gt;-4059&lt;/X&gt;<br />
		&lt;Y&gt;58&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
	&lt;Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;CX&gt;12300&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
		&lt;CY&gt;50&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
	&lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
		&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
		&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
	&lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
This section defines the point at which the gauge changes to Red/Critical color.  As you can see the offset has been adjusted to -4059.  The reason for this is so as to deal with the percentage I wanted to be at when the gauge changed color, in this case at 33% the gauge will change from Yellow to Red.  You get this value by finding 33% of 12300 which is the Horizontal length of the Gauge.  Then you offset to the negative so that it shows up as the gauge empties.<br />
<br />
Ok that takes care of the Gauge Fill definition information.  The next section I will explain presenting this info on the UI so that it works correctly.<br />
<br />
I hope this has made at least some sense so far.  If not it may make a little more sense when you add the next senction to the mix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok folks,  Here is where things may get a little confusing.  In order to actually make your gauge there are 5 total parts that have to be placed on the UI.  One for the Background/Least Health gauge in this Case the Red for almost dead and two for each of the other colors that I used in this case Yellow for lower than half health and Green for full health.  Now just to preface this I am not entirely sure nor was I able to get the full valid reason from Enok on why the partial gauge fills needed two sections each but I have my guesses as I will try to explain them as we go along.<br />
<br />
Also as I stated before I am not entirely sure why this works or how but I am mearly giving my interpretation from my talks with Enok on the whole subject since there does not seem to be anyone else out there right now.  But I do know that I have been able to replicate the process for all the UI's I have worked on regardless of the size or shape of the Gauge in question.  So I know my understanding does work.<br />
<br />
Also, as I go along in this installment notice in the code the references for which piece of the Definition codes from the last installment are being called for, for each section of the gauge.<br />
<br />
First we have the background color of the Least Health Gauge part.  This is the only part of the Gauge that is actually made like your original gauge.  In fact in this case this is the Gauge as it was before Enok and I started work on getting it to change color.  So as most of you already have the gauge for the full health the way you want it that will be this part.  The only difference between this gauge part and your original gauge is that this is that last part of the gauge you want the user to see.  So in my case since the last part before death on my gauge is red, this gauge part will be red.<br />
<br />
&lt;Gauge item = &quot;Target_PlayerHP&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;ScreenID&gt;TargetHP&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
&lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt;<br />
&lt;TextColor&gt;<br />
&lt;R&gt;240&lt;/R&gt;<br />
&lt;G&gt;240&lt;/G&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;240&lt;/B&gt;<br />
&lt;/TextColor&gt;<br />
&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
&lt;Location&gt;<br />
&lt;X&gt;104&lt;/X&gt;<br />
&lt;Y&gt;30&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
&lt;CX&gt;123&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;50&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
&lt;GaugeOffsetY&gt;0&lt;/GaugeOffsetY&gt;<br />
&lt;TextOffsetX&gt;-300&lt;/TextOffsetX&gt;<br />
&lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />
&lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt;<br />
&lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
&lt;TooltipReference/&gt;<br />
&lt;FillTint&gt;<br />
&lt;R&gt;240&lt;/R&gt;<br />
&lt;G&gt;0&lt;/G&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;0&lt;/B&gt;<br />
&lt;/FillTint&gt;<br />
&lt;DrawLinesFill&gt;false&lt;/DrawLinesFill&gt;<br />
&lt;EQType&gt;1&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
&lt;GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
&lt;Background&gt;A_GaugeBackground&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
&lt;Fill&gt;A_GaugeFill&lt;/Fill&gt;<br />
&lt;/GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
&lt;/Gauge&gt;<br />
<br />
As you can see in this code the Gauge size is the original size of 123 x 50 and the color has been set to Red.  But because of the rest of the gauge parts this part of the gauge is not actually seen until the health gets to 33% or less.  Prior to that one of the other sections of the Gauge is visible.  Also notice that the GaugeOffset is set to 0 in this section of the gauge.  This will be important later on.  Other than the color of this gauge there is no difference (or at least there shouldn't be any difference) from your original Gauge.  Notice the Background and Fill tags are the original gauge tags.  I had gotten rid of the End caps and lines so that in my case it was just the bacground and fill parts.  You may or may not be using those other parts of the gauges but I did not.  If you are though you will have already taken that in to account with your offsets for example: if you used the end caps then your code should already be accounting for the fact that the end caps take up a certain amount of space in the gauge.  So as to make this easier to explain I have removed those parts of the gauge so as not to confuse anyone even more than this may already be doing.<br />
<br />
What this all means is that if you did not have the follow two sets of gauge parts the gauge would be red all the time.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
Here is the code for the Yellow section of the Gauge.  Now for some reason as I stated earlier there are actually two parts to this gauge piece.  My guess is that one is for the gauge start percentage and the other is for the point at which the gauge stops.  What I do know is that both parts are needed for this to work right.<br />
<br />
&lt;Gauge item = &quot;Target_PlayerHP_Enok1&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt;<br />
&lt;TextColor&gt;<br />
&lt;R&gt;240&lt;/R&gt;<br />
&lt;G&gt;240&lt;/G&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;240&lt;/B&gt;<br />
&lt;/TextColor&gt;<br />
&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
&lt;Location&gt;<br />
&lt;X&gt;104&lt;/X&gt;<br />
&lt;Y&gt;30&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
&lt;CX&gt;40&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;50&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
&lt;GaugeOffsetX&gt;-4059&lt;/GaugeOffsetX&gt;<br />

&lt;Fill&gt;A_GaugeFill&lt;/Fill&gt;<br />
&lt;/GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
&lt;/Gauge&gt;<br />
<br />
I have highlighted the sections to take note of.  Notice in the First part of the Code Piece the size of the Gauge part.  In this case the Gauge piece is 40 in size which is 33% of the total gauge size. This is also the point at which the gauge changes from Red to yellow, which I will explain shortly.  Also in the first part the GaugeOffsetX is the -4059 from the definition section explained in the last installment.<br />
<br />
Notice in the second part of this code that the Location the gauge is to start at is now 144.  This is over 40 from what the original part was and what the first part of this section of code was which was 104.  This is to account for the Start of the Yellow part of the Code which is 33%.  The size in the second part of this section of Code is 83 which is the rest of the fill pattern.  You will notice that all of the code sections contain in some fashion the whole gauge.  But since the only part of the gauge that is visible at the time is the correct color it does not matter.  But the parts must add up to the whole.  Now for theGaugeOffsetx for the second part of this section.  The GaugeOffsetX is -40 which is the 33% mark.<br />
<br />
What all this means so far is that if you did not have the next set of code pairs the gauge would start out yellow at full health and once the health got to 33% the gauge will change to Red.  But because of the offsets and the placements of the pieces it works.<br />
<br />
Also of note is that this last part of the code uses the same regular Background and fill parts that the original part used, the same as the Red piece did.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
This Next installment will explain the Green section of the Gauge.</div></div><hr />

At least as best I can explain it anyway.  Iam sure there are others out there that can do a far better job than I and perhaps after reading this will be able to.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
Here is the final set of Pieces.  This is the set of pieces that shows the Green section of the Gauge.  Again I have highlighted the parts to take note of.<br />
<br />
&lt;Gauge item = &quot;Target_PlayerHP_Enok3&quot;&gt;<br />

&lt;Fill&gt;SAL_LGaugeFill_Enok3&lt;/Fill&gt;<br />
&lt;/GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
&lt;/Gauge&gt;<br />

&lt;Y&gt;30&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
&lt;CX&gt;61&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;50&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
&lt;GaugeOffsetX&gt;-62&lt;/GaugeOffsetX&gt;<br />
&lt;GaugeOffsetY&gt;0&lt;/GaugeOffsetY&gt;<br />
&lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />

&lt;GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
&lt;Background&gt;SAL_LGaugeBackground&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
&lt;Fill&gt;SAL_LGaugeFill&lt;/Fill&gt;<br />
&lt;/GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
&lt;/Gauge&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Since this is the top level section it is the green section for when your health is 50% or higher.<br />
<br />
Notice in the first part of this section of code that the Gauge location is back to the 104 which is where it should be.  Also the Size of this first part is 62 which is the 50% point for the gauge.  Again that will be more significant in the second section of this part of the code.  Also of note if the GaugeOffsetX of -6150 which is the value from before for the 50% mark of the 100X version of the gauge.<br />
<br />
Notice in the second section of this code that the location is now 166 which is the original 104 plus 62 for the Gauge offset for the 50% mark.  this is because the Green runs from 50% to 100%.  Also the size of this part of this section is 61 which is the size of the green bar from 50% to the end at 123.<br />
<br />
What all this means now that all three parts of the Full gauge have been define is that the Red gauge is the full par but is only seen from 33% down.  The Yellow is the length from 33% to full but is only seen until 50% is hit and the Green is the length from 50% to 100%.  So as the health goes down each of the different section will come into play as the section above them is no loger visible.  <br />
<br />
The last part of the entire process is the order in which the Pieces are placed in the Screen Item section of the code (which is the last section of the XML file where you list all the pieces in the order you want them placed.  For this gauge to work correctly you have to make sure you place the pieces in the right order.  In this case since the Red is the last part seen and therefore the bottom piece it goes first and then the yellow and finally the Green on top.  The followin gis the listing from the Screen Item section of this window XML file in the correct order.<br />
<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;Target_PlayerHP&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;Target_PlayerHP_Enok1&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;Target_PlayerHP_Enok2&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;Target_PlayerHP_Enok3&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;Target_PlayerHP_Enok4&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
As I stated in the first installment of this explaination this may or may not be exactly how Enok would have explained it, but since he is not around anymore I have explained it as best I could from all the talks that Enok and I had getting this code to work.  As I said I have used this code in all the personal UI's I have created as well as in a couple UI's I created and placed in the download section many months ago.  So I know the code works and I know my math works because I have used different sizes for the gauges as well.  Some I used custom gauge graphics others I used the default graphics with the custom fill pattern I created here.  If any one has a specific question on any part of this code I will be happy to answer it.<br />
<br />
Also if anyone has a gauge graphic and they fell that this is above their head and would like I would be more than happy to give you a hand with the code for you gauge graphic to make is work for you.<br />
<br />
I am sorry it has taken me so long to get this up but as you can see there was a lot of typing and code to go through to make sure I didn't leave anything out and that I made sure that it was understandable at least on some level.<br />
<br />
And for those out there that might be wondering I am a math wiz and have been programming in many lagualges and styles for well over 20 years now.  So while this makes sense to me and I have tried to explain it as best I could I know that at times I can be very high level in my explainations so don't hesitate to ask me a question I will be more than happy to try and explain it another way that might make more sense to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have tried this and it worked then let me know.  I did try it out before I wrote this up just to make sure I had it all right so I know it works.  But I know my writing and I am looking to make sure I didn't leave anything out that might make it not work.  Or if I did not explain a part well enough or clearly enough.<br />

<br />
The reason you use 2 gauges per color (except for the final color which is basically a normal gauge) is because one gauge covers up the &quot;final color gauge&quot; while the other actually slowly moves down like a normal gauge. In other words, one gauge for yellow covers up from 0% to 33% while the other goes from 33% to 100%.<br />
<br />
The reason there are huge gauges (the yellow gauge that covers from 0% to 33%) is you only want a 1% cross-section of a gauge to actually cover that distance (from 0% to 33%), so that when that percent is passed, the whole thing vanishes at once and the gauge underneath is revealed.<br />
<br />
Ask questions, I'd be happy to answer them, and if what I just explained wasn't clear, say so. I'll try to come up with a different perspective of explanation.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna go stop by Elezibeth's threads to say hello and apologize for having been gone so long. I'm considering writing a follow-up guide to this one to explain how I use the default gauge graphics in a color changing gauge; if anyone would want that, leave something saying so.<br />

Tried it out with the default target window...all I get is the red bar which does not change color. Also getting 3 copies of the target's name side-by-side. Could you take a look and tell me what I'm doing wrong?<br />
Thanks,<br />
Feebb<br />
<br />
P.S. I know some of the sizes, locations, and offsets may be wrong but they should be close (uses the default window_pieces01.tga file).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried this with my own gauges, but it doesn't quite work.<br />
I also changed the %'s at which it changed color.  I did all my math twice over to be sure it was correct.<br />
<br />
The gauge shows normally for above 90%, which is my first changing spot.   Lower than 90% however, shows an empty guage and a white block at 90%.<br />
My other change is at 50%, but i don't see any change since its messing up before there.<br />
<br />
I've defined my custom gauge graphics normally, since it works for me before i tried to make it color-changing.  <br />
<br />
My gauge background is A_GaugeBG_GW, and Fill is A_GaugeF_GW<br />
I added in A_GaugeBG_100x, A_GaugeF_90, and A_GaugeF_50 for the respective pieces, Just as you explained, only I changed my numbers.  My gauges are 107 in length, so 90% is 9630, and 50% is 5350.  <br />
<br />
I sat down with your explanation and made notes to adjust for the differences in our sizes and percents, being sure to use 90% for mine, where you used 50%, and 50% where you used 33%.  I also made sure i did the math right where i had to make the other gauge part fill the last of the bar.<br />
<br />
If you have any ideas what might be wrong, I'd greatly apreciate it.  If you want, I can post my actual code also, or email it.  Thank You</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyste</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just about given up on this... but one thing I did find while going through the color chaging code in the Soes UI is this:<br />
<br />
Chronwaas starts her bar locations in window_pieces051.tga at 0,0 ( top left corner of the file ).<br />
<br />
Soes starts his bar locations at 110, 0 ( top edge, 110 pixels in )<br />
<br />
If you start your bar locations at a non-zero location, you must offset the fill gauges by the same amount. For example, <br />
<br />
If your background fill looks like:<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;SAL_LGaugeBackground_Enok_x100&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
  &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
    &lt;Texture&gt;window_pieces051.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
    &lt;Location&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;110&lt;/X&gt; &lt;!-- 110 offset --&gt; <br />
        &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
        &lt;CX&gt;12300&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
        &lt;CY&gt;50&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
    &lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
    &lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Then you must change the Fill Gauges to look like:<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;SAL_LGaugeFill_Enok3&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
  &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
    &lt;Texture&gt;window_pieces051.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
    &lt;Location&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;-6040&lt;/X&gt; &lt;!-- 6150 + 110 --&gt; <br />
        &lt;Y&gt;58&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
        &lt;CX&gt;12300&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
        &lt;CY&gt;50&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
    &lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
    &lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
( You have to change all gauges, not just one, by the same amount )<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this is an example, using 110. Your milage may differ ;)<br />
<br />
My background happens to be located at 110, 20 ... and I haven't gotten the thing to work either. But at this point I'm not sure if it's my math, or the 20 pixel offset that's messing me up... for all I know, I may need to offset by another 20... or 20 * 100 ... or who knows :p<br />
<br />
Gonna give it maybe one more go, then bag the whole thing.<br />
<br />

My wife and I use a mix 'n matched set of stuff from T. King and Remelio for most of our UI's... Once I get done with a couple of other mods, I may try to build this color-change into them... Glad I've got that writeup to give me some pointers.... XML makes my head hurt, but code-diving is still fun :)</div></div><hr />

If you have anything in other files related to the Animations or anything then include those XML files in the zip file.  Then just post the zip file here and I will take a look.<br />

[QUOTE=Fyste]I've just about given up on this... but one thing I did find while going through the color chaging code in the Soes UI is this:<br />

Great Write up Chronwaas!<br />
<br />
I tried this with my own gauges, but it doesn't quite work.<br />
I also changed the %'s at which it changed color.  I did all my math twice over to be sure it was correct.<br />

If you have any ideas what might be wrong, I'd greatly apreciate it.  If you want, I can post my actual code also, or email it.  Thank You</div></div><hr />

Ok, Iknow there are some location/size errors here but NOTHING is happening with the gauge...if it was changing even if the graphic callouts were wrong I should see SOMETHING happening :(<br />

I've included my .tga file, group, and player windows.  Right now I'm only trying to get it to work in the player window, but since i will add it to my group windows, I defined all my ui2danimations in the group window.<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch</div></div><hr />

Ok, ATM I'm just trying to get a color change bar with the default UI target window. Eventually I hope to be able to make a target of target window for Zeremus' UI. Anyway, here are the default tga and my modded xml.<br />

Thanks,<br />

Thanks for looking at it, don't put too much energy into it though. Much as I appreciate it, it's not a huge thing for me.<br />

Thanks for checking it though!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crackmaster</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I got the colors to change, except I get strange lines in parts of the gauge that aren't supposed to be there.  I'm assuming that it's my background image getting messed up, so I'll mess with it some more, but at least I got it to work.  I used the player window, too, because I made the target window bar about two times as large and didn't wanna mess with really big numbers and mess up :)  Great instructions, especially when one thinks about the way it works and can figure out the correct order of the colors.. and I also did Green, Orange, Yellow, and then Red, similar to the celtic percentage gauges, which I also added into my Kaori UI hehe.  In conclusion, you can get it to work if you mess with it enough :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thong3320</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The gauge shows normally for above 90%, which is my first changing spot.   Lower than 90% however, shows an empty guage and a white block at 90%.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm adding player hp bar to my target bar and I'm having the same trouble.<br />
It's coded correctly as a one-color bar (just like my target bar). When I make it a color-changing bar, if I disable the two overlays on the left (green and yellow), I'm left with a tri-color bar that works fine, it just shows all 3 colors at once. <br />
<br />
When I set it up to work like it shold, like Kailayla, when it gets to 50% (my first change) the entire bar goes black...just showing the background.<br />
<br />
I also had my background showing up in the bar two or three times in the left half of the bar (where the overalys are). I got it to look right by setting the x100 background to sample an area that was blacked out on the alpha channel<br />
<br />
I was getting two or 3 versions of player name on the bar, but I set the text offset to X=-500 to get them off the screen.<br />
<br />
help?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The blackout problem was because the background I was using for the x100 overlay actually had graphics to it, so that's what I was seeing. made that a transparent background (changed coordinates in my .tga and blacked out that part in the mask) and I started seeing things. All I had to do was finetune the offset and I was running. Still have a problem with the overlay bar only coming in halfway then filling up as my hitpoints rise. Think it's because I'm using a gauge that's 250 wide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vrath</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a color changing guage Enok made for me way back. After he sent it to me I spent literally months trying to figure it out. I read the post several times and looked over the code he sent and alot of it seemed to make sence and I thought ok I'll try this one more time.<br />
<br />
Heres what I tried to make (same set up as Enok's guage he sent me but I wanted to change the size to fit another UI I now use)<br />
	&lt;!-- 0  to 10  Flashing Red --&gt;<br />
	&lt;!-- 10 to 25  Red --&gt;<br />
	&lt;!-- 25 to 50  Orange --&gt;<br />
	&lt;!-- 50 to 75  Yellow --&gt;<br />
	&lt;!-- 75 to 100 Green --&gt;<br />
<br />
After 5 hours I ended up with what looks like 1 guage that is: 0 - 25% blank, 25% - 50% orange, 50% - 75% yellow and 75% to 100% green (Hehe at least they are at the 25% markers where I wanted them)<br />
<br />
My guage is x = 128  y = 16<br />
<br />
I feel like I am so close to understanding this, and any help you guys could give me would rock.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailayla</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've managed to get this to work for the most part.  I have 2 places where the bars change.  One at 50%, and the other at 80%.  So that the bar is green when full, orange when &gt;50, but &lt;80, and red at &lt;50.  <br />
<br />
Now my problem occurs in the space where the guage is orange for the player.  That space between 50 and 80%, even when full, shows orange.  So i have a green bar with that orange section showing through over the green bar, but only at that section.  Since nothing shows through the rest of the green bar, i assume its a problem with the last half of the orange, or maybe the last half of the orange and the first piece of the green combined.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  BTW, here are my files atm if anyone can look at it and shed some light on this for me.  Once i get this to work correctly i can make my own how-to guide since this seems to becoming much more popular lately.<br />
<br />
Note with the files, my group window is where the texture and ui2danimations are, but the player hp bar in my player_window is where i am currently getting this to work.</div></div><hr />

I'll look at yours to see what's up. Here's the one I finally got to work pretty flawlessly.</div></div><hr />
