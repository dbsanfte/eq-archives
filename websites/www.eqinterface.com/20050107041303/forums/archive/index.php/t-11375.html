<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quichon</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I play a monk.  Usually, this means I am on pull duty.  To do this, I need to see what I am doing and have noticed that my screen is being cluttered with windows (battlespam window and buff window mostly).  It is destroying my perephial vision so to speak.<br />
<br />
So what I need is a UI that is all at the bottom or top of the screen to give maximum viewability from side to side, so I might see that mob in the corner when I am pulling.  Cool graphics for spell buffs is a plus, 3d target ring is very necessary.  I absolutly need a seperate window for hits/misses/spells from my chat/guildchat since I am an officer and if I get a tell about guild business I need to make sure I get it and not have it lost in battlespam. A clicky window would be awsome.  Compass is good so I don't loose my way.  Con color is good so I know right away how strong a baddy is.<br />
So I need something that shuts up and gets out of the way mostly, but what is there looks cool.  I work in 1024 X 768 so I need something that will work with this resolution.  <br />
<br />
Any suggestions or ideas?</div></div><hr />

I got the usual suspects, nice solid bright static target ring (the gnomish gear one atm) a bag mod, taget and hps windows with percents, a hotbutton mod with two tabs on the right for inv/clickies...and all except my chat and hitsmode windows pretty much fade out except when I mouseover.  Makes for good visibility.<br />
<br />
Plus the benefit over complex unified UIs in that it doesn't break every patch.  I avoid anything that messes with EQUI_Animations.xml</div></div><hr />

<br />
FYI, that is not the current font that I use.  The one in the picture is Morpheus, I am currently using Palatino Linotype.<br />
<br />
Also, I set the viewport to 0 0 1024 536.<br />
<br />
If you like it I can release a beta version.</div></div><hr />
