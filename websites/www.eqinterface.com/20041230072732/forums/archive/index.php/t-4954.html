For those who are not aware, we've been wanting to add a second Effects window that would hold selected short-duration beneficial effects, most notably many bard songs.  Initially, for tuning, the new effects area will allow six additional songs to be placed upon your character.   <br />

I would expect to see UI's needing to be patched when this goes live. it will be yet another box to work with for buffs.<br />
<br />
keep your eyes open for the announcement that this and the &quot;window mode&quot; coming to the live server<br />

There are other changes too, but not posting anything until it actually goes &quot;live&quot; in case they make changes.<br />
<br />
(Although, thinking about it, for those that play on test all the time, I suppose I should be posting changes made on test as well ... hrm, need to think on the best way to do this ...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My personal preference is to stay away from TEST as development environment.  TEST exists for the benefit of SOE, not the players.  I think having a seperate forum (as now exists) should be sufficient.  However, I think it will only take a few instances of getting &quot;burnt&quot; by having SOE change the code from TEST to LIVE to realize that its not worth the publishing effort.<br />
<br />
I think DENMOM from eqtraders summed it up quite well.  http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=12<br />
<br />
And I realize that recipes, etc.. are a bit different from the interface itself, but in some respects the issues are the same.</div></div><hr />
