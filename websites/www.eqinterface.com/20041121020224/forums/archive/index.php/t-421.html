<br />
i don't mind the &quot;chat edit&quot; box in the main chat window.  one is fine.  however, on the other chat windows i spawn, i'd like them to be without the &quot;edit box&quot; (the one where you type stuff in at), and without a slider bar in some instances.<br />
<br />
in the .xml, i think the element<br />
<br />
&lt;TopAnchorOffset&gt;21&lt;/TopAnchorOffset&gt;<br />
<br />
could be set to 0 to basically make it dissappear, but this would do it for all windows and not just the extra ones.<br />
<br />
i've examined the UI_Char.ini files, and have found the instances describing the spawned windows.  but there is no variable to enable or disable edit boxes and slider bars independently per window.<br />
<br />
if anyone can think of a hack around this, i'd love to hear it.  i'm all about saving screen real estate, and this would help out a lot.</div></div><hr />

For each chat box, it draws the same box described by the .xml.  Either they all have one or they all don't, until VI decides to code something special about that.<br />
<br />
This is something I personally would also love to see.</div></div><hr />

As of now, I don't think you can define a box individually without having both elements.  I'm not sure the client would allow you to define (no) boxes with input element either.</div></div><hr />

That you could set Always Chat Here on your main text box and all others wouldn't have the Chat input on them ever.<br />
<br />
Here's to hoping.<br />

<br />
Move the text input box to another window.<br />
<br />
This way all the chat windows will be output only, and the input window could be seperate from them.  Of course you would have to find a good window for that..</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 separate XMLs to define chat boxes; one defining the original chat box (EQUI_ChatWindow.xml); the second defining spawned chat boxes (EQUI_SpawnedChatWindow.xml).</div></div><hr />
