<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eidolonfaer</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm an Enchanter.  I liked some of the UI ideas for a minimalist pet window.  No sit/stand, no taunt/notaunt, etc...<br />
<br />
However, I also use the /pet who leader command to alert my group or raid that I have had to Charm something.<br />
<br />
And I use the /pet report health command fairly frequently to check what spells are on my pet.<br />
<br />
I have not been able to find a comprehensive list of hardcoded button functionality.  Any ideas on how to go about adding these buttons to the pet window?</div></div><hr />

Skinners can move stuff around and pretty it up, but we can't change core functions.  So if the button you want isn't there - then you're out of luck.</div></div><hr />

Im really not sure if this'll work, Ive never tried it, but it seems to be the only way to customize buttons...kinda.</div></div><hr />
