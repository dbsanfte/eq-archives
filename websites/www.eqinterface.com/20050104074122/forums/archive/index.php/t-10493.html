I hope you good UI makers come up with something wierd and unusual soon cause everything else seems to be the same, and boring at that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note from Admin:<br />
Please do not slam someone elses work .<br />
I find it very distasteful that in the same post ask people to keep making UIs, you decided to slam someone else creation. <br />
<br />
I understand we are not all creative enough to create UIs.  But posting a slam on someone else work when you have not created any yourself is just hypocritcal..<br />
