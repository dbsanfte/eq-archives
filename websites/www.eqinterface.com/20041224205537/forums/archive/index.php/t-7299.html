I'm not a very frequent reader of the forum, normally popping by every time SOE upgrades/breaks the interface, so if this has been covered already my apologise.<br />
<br />
It would appear to me that one of the primary requirements of an interface for melee orientated characters, whether pure or hybrid, is visibility... these are very active characters, running about lots, looking about lots.<br />
<br />
Now, it would also seem to me that the best way to free up as much of the central view of the screen is to move the interface elements to the corners of the screen... is anybody aware of an interface that has done this?</div></div><hr />

The viewspace of it is very much like the default view space, but it has alot more things packed in there. ;) <br />
