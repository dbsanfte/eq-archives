<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We need a variant of the target name (eqtype 28) that simply prints in the colour of the 'consider'. And yes, that would be excactly like in DAOC and that would be for the better.<br />
<br />
I'm SO tired of clicking a target and hitting 'C'..<br />
<br />
If any dev reads this you also need to print the blue cons in a slightly brighter tone because dark blue won't be easy to read on a dark background (it is already quite difficult to read dark blue con messages in the chat window).<br />
<br />
So if anyone likes the idea just say so and maybe this will reach a dev ear sometime ?....<br />
<br />
PS: that would also make my warrior 's pulling job soooo much nicer :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've wanted something similar for long time.  <br />
I'm also sick of having to perform 2 actions (target, then consider with keyboard) or (right click consider, then target).  <br />
<br />
I could easily see the con message being made into an EQType, but I think the coloring would have to be hardcoded (I doubt they will allow players to customize their color of cons).</div></div><hr />

This is by far my single biggest complaint with the EQ UI.  Why should I have to perform two separate actions to target and consider something?  Make the target window display the 'con' colour - please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drylar</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried and dislike DAoC. I DID like this feature, and it would only take approx 10 lines of code, and a toggle in the options window. Would save hundreds to thousands of fingerpresses an hour, and ease alot of pullers jobs considerably. Leaving the toggle, and the &quot;old skoolers&quot; that are so set in their ways they think bronze is great, and open a spellbook to med, can leave it the old way where they are all 1 color.</div></div><hr />
