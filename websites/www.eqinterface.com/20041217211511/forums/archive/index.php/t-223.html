<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hugh Jass</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things I was trying with the new UI which don't seem possible:<br />
<br />
1.  Eliminate the &quot;Player&quot; window.  Instead, create a combined &quot;Player/Group&quot; window, such as:<br />
<br />
GrpMember1 ______________ <br />
GrpMember2 ______________ <br />
GrpMember3 ______________<br />
GrpMember4 ______________<br />
GrpMember5 ______________<br />
You        ______________<br />
Your Mana  ______________<br />
Your Stam  ______________<br />
Your Exp   ______________<br />
<br />
If ungrouped or less than a six person group, GrpMember1 thru 5 would collapse appropriately, and you'd only see your stats.<br />
<br />
I tried to modify both the Player and Group Windows to accommodate these, but failed in each case.  I'm thinking they don't have access to one another's objects?  Hmm..<br />
<br />
2.  Of particular importance to melee chars, are one's weapon skills, (especially when young and desperately trying to raise).  I wanted to move the weapon skill statistics to the Player window I've seen others do with player statistics, (str, sta, saves, etc).  However, these don't seem to be itemizable - they all reside in a table that (at least the UI) cannot individually reference a specific item.  ;(<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you can not do is remove the elements from the one you are retiring. The most you can do is make them of size 0.<br />
<br />

I was working on redoing the entire UI so I had extra windows till a Alliance member redid his UI and posted it. Now I am using his.<br />

Props again Statix.. <br />

<br />
Any ideas on how to move weapon skills (H2H, 1hB, 1hS, P, 2hB, 2hS) to the front?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
