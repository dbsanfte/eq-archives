<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haerdalisz</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a really cool UI and i lost it.. I thought it was a Vert one.. had a Vert style but the main diffence was in the Group box  and Target Box.. There were color icons.. Green Yellow and Red and they would change according the the Hps of the Target or player.. <br />
