Most of the time this works just fine for me , However I find it annoying to have to continue to go to the Inventory screen to access Coin . <br />
<br />
Would it be possible to add the Coin to bottom of this ? <br />
<br />
Thanks  ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mind not having the coins on there, but was wondering how complicated it would be to change the secondary weapon slot to the leg slot - I have no effect on secondary and rarely swap it out, but do use my legs' effect very often.<br />
<br />
Also, if someone checks the code for it...  why are there lots of &quot;spell gem&quot; entries in the mod, even though they don't appear anywhere?<br />
<br />
BTW, just do a search for the text &quot;Blades of Wrath&quot; in the file and change it to your guild (or whatever).  BoW is a great Torv guild and kudos on this mod - it rocks!  :)</div></div><hr />

Hotbutton, inv slot, and spell gem items are defined, and the client decides which to put where based on what you have chosen to put into your hotkeys.<br />
<br />
Secondary to leg should be as simple as changing the EQType.  Look up what the right one is in the thread here in the info vault.<br />
<br />
As for the original poster asking about coins, no that isn't possible.  At this point, coins is one of the things like auto equip or destroy button that is referenced only by ScreenID, to get it to work the client is hard coded to look in that (inventory) window for that ScreenID.  Can't move it across windows.  Hopefully VI is moving all these types of things to EQTypes before they take the UI out of beta.</div></div><hr />
