<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Temvarien</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shown here is my UI setup, I will take no credit for any of the artwork, it is mainly mixed and matched from stuff off of this website and others. As you can see in the Screenshot, I have implemented the EQAtlas map mod to the help window. I don't know about everyone else, but I get lost very often around Norrath, so this helps a lot more than that help menu they started us off with lol. I also have a modified spell book from Thangor, along with his vertical spell bar. I have yet to implement t.king's spell icons, once I get around to doing the xml coding since a lot of mix and match have a problem with the animations xml file. The bags are modded so that you don't have to open your inventory every time you want to switch out weps for instruments, this mod was done by Cairenn.  The player window mod was done by Minka, and looks really nice in my opinion. I also have an anorexic inventory window now since I rarely need to open it up since I got the hotbutton mod done by Cairenn again.<br />
That is the main features of this UI, if you have any requests for me to post this as a zipped file, just leave a post here. I also apologize if I have not given credit for your work.<br />

If you have something in mind as to what kinds of things you would like to see... let me know. I'm always open to suggestions. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice UI. A bit too high resolution for me though :( I seem to lag more and more the higher resolution I go.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, just curious. What level are you? :)<br />
<br />
One more question. Is that the eqatlas maps thing? I tried using that but it seems I could only use it with the default UI, instead of one I made myself. How did you do it differently..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Temvarien</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, here is the url where I posted the zipped file of the UI I set up.<br />

As for the maps problem, what I did to get rid of that was that I based this on a default UI to keep the menu bar at the top, and I added everything to that base. This required minor .xml coding, but it still works. Thangor, I love the spellbook and spellbar, even though I don't even use the tick timer on it, it just looks cool lol. Here is another screenie that shows the spellbook and inventory window. This one's kinda blurred since I had to lower the resolution manually. I can also modify this UI to fit certain types of players. But on the bard side, I added in t.king's spell icons, and the Reed's Bard Song calculator chart. So now when you type /feedback (With the proper xml file set up) You can see exactly what your bard songs do. You really don't have to run this at a higher resolution, but I recommend it if you are at all like me and need a lot of screen to know what you're doing =P. The only thing I couldn't post here were the maps since Muse asked me not to, but you can go to the EQAtlas site and download only the ones you need, took me an hour at best to download em all. Thanks for the positive remarks guys. I'm gonna start making my own UI mods soon =D.<br />
For the record Kaenil, I keep switching back and forth between level 50 and 51, but hoping to stay in 51 now lol. And for Thangor, would you mind if I modded your spellbook to make it look a bit more bardlike? =)</div></div><hr />

They got a really nice set up for it too, just a bit harder to use if you have all the maps like I do.</div></div><hr />
