<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fourfists</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since this new patch (feb 6) some of my UI windows are out of place when I log on.  I move them back to the proper spaces they should be in but when I log out and log back in they're out of place again.  It refuses to save the window locations where I want them now.  I updated the 2 files that downloaded today and I use a Vert mod (forget which version)<br />
<br />
Anyone else getting this or know why it's doing this?  I'm pulling the hair out of my head!</div></div><hr />

For ex.. Mine is UI_Hawkren_91.ini..<br />
<br />
I would open my everquest folder look for that file and right click it.. Then click properties.. Where it says attributes: make sure read-only is not checked.. <br />
<br />
That's all I can think of to cause this..<br />

When i zone, some Pieces (Buff/Hotbuttons/Guildchat - all aranged on the left side) move towards outside the screen. I zoned 3 Times and lost half of the Windowsurfaces, its ridiculous.<br />
I have no idea. I dont use complicated Mods, just a few simple Things (Vertical Hotbuttons for example).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fraethir</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I (was) using the Quartz 1.5(ish) mod. Whenever I zoned, some of the components would be pushed out of place (towards the middle of the screen). The components this seemed to affect MIGHT have been overlapping the edges of the interface (ex. one box had its bottom edge slightly below the bottom edge of the interface).<br />
<br />
Worse, though. My buffwindow, which had been halfway up the left edge of the screen, crawled left after every zone, until it disappeared. Since I've been using a buffwindow with no title bar or other place to grab, I couldn't slide it back before it went away on me (and currently plan to reset the ui.ini file every so often to get it back in place, or just put title bar true on that window even if it's ugly).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed an additional problem, which might be related.  The IconOffset and GaugeOffset settings aren't working.<br />
<br />
This causes my 80slot merchant window to be unusable, because the icons are drawn in the wrong places.  It causes the little triangles on the sliding-timer mod I downloaded to look wrong.  It causes my player-hitpoints gauge to be shifted about 20 pixels to the left.  In short, it's messing up all sorts of things.<br />
<br />
It's possible that the windows are moving over by the width of the border each time you zone.  (even if the window has borders turned off).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildaar</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if any part of the window is off the screen it will try to move it.  <br />
<br />
Solution is to make sure there are no parts hanging off the screen and the movement stops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xTSx</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's what I figured as well Wildaar, however I'm not sure what code is making it do that.  It's trying to force every window onto the visible area, so that no parts are off screen.  I don't see why though.  I have my chat boxes slightly below the bottom and my buff windows slightly off the right side, so as to leave no gaps along the outter edges and just to make it smoother overall.<br />
<br />
Has anyone figured out what new code they put in this patch to make the windows be forced &quot;on screen&quot; yet?  I'd like to keep my windows right on the edge, or partially off the screen, but haven't found a way yet as of this morning.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kerupt</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wildaar is right, if you move your ui around so that its not close to the edge of the screen then it will NOT move when you zone/log in.  It really annoying to have a border around your UI but its the only fix i think atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">02-06-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What pain indeed.<br />
<br />
They changed something so that the interface now forces windows back into the viewable area if they extend out of it at all.<br />
<br />
Also, as mentioned earlier, they also changed some things with the way gauge offsets seem to work. I was unpleasantly suprised to find the gauges in the player window of my mod a total mess. :(<br />
<br />
I did further editing to make the gauges compatible with this change, and they align properly now.  There appears no way to bypass the 'push back on screen' feature/bug(?) though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use Viewport.<br />
Create a viewported border around your screen.  Then it wont care where your windows are...<br />
Mine: /viewport 2 90 1276 700<br />
<br />
 /viewport 2 2 (Xresolution -4) (Yresolution-4)<br />
<br />
You get the picture...</div></div><hr />

I'm using 1280x1024 res, and want my windows to be right along the edges so there's no space.  are the first two numbers how far you want your viewport to move to?  I don't quite follow that.  The default is 1280x1024, which is my res.  Why would I want my viewport to be 1276x1020, wouldn't that make it smaller than my full screen?<br />

<br />
what good is setting my viewport all the way back to the same size as my resolution and hiding most of the viewable area?  i think not.  Sony needs to address this ASAP and fix it immediately.  I don't care if the servers go down for a 3 hour update to get it fixed.  I am not going to use their pos UI config nor am I gonna mess around with having to realign everything everytime i zone or log.<br />

<br />
Once I finally got my spell effects window and hotbuttons window back on screen, placing them within my screen view and off the edges completely kept them there. I tested it several times and they now stay put.<br />

 I lose the buffs and effects bar I have located down the left side of the screen. Quickest way I've found to get it back so far, is to go to a lower res untill the bar appears. I accept that res , then use alt-b to close the bar. I go back to my original res,accept that res, then use alt-b to bring the bar back up.<br />

 Worked for me, when reloading skin  or zoning, or dragging buff bar into middle of the screen didn't work.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, SOE needs to make up their minds.  Either they DO support custom UIs or they DO NOT support custom UIs.  They do a patch, the UI gets bugged, they tell you to switch to default to make the problem go away.  This is NOT acceptable.  They allow for custom UIs, hell they even changed things around to make it EASY to have custom UIs, but then don't want to hear it when they screw them up.<br />
<br />
Possibly if they would make a default UI that was half worth looking at, things wouldn't be so bad.</div></div><hr />
