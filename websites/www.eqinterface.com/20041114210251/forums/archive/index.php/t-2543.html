The 1280X1024 version is posted to the Mix and Match section of downloads or will be hopefully after they review or moderate whatever.  It is also posted at my site as:<br />
<br />
druidui.zip (http://www.my-spiritwalker.com/UIFiles/druidui.zip) <br />
<br />
Here is a screencap of the latest update:</div></div><hr />

If the link isnt working let me know that too but i have downloaded it on 4 different machines and had no trouble.  If the UI isnt working for you Make sure you follow the READMEFIRST.txt file in the zip or it will never work.</div></div><hr />

I have been wanting someone to come up with it for EQ since the new UI came out :)  my only problem is I can only play in 1024X768 :eek:   Once you get that version out I will love to play with this UI.  Great work!! to me this is prolly the most visually stunning UI there is to date.  Being a halfling we like greenery.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah it works okay but you have to replace the options window with the new one from default.  If you dont you'll get a warning and you wont be able to change things like chatfont colors etc... That is the only issue if found<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mechy</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah bro , this new Druid UI is great. Very nice work indeed. The only thing I have a problem with is the size of the fonts in chat. I'm kinda old and reading this makes my eyes strain. Not sure how to make the font any larger cause I looked in the UI file and from what I can tell. ITs maxed at 4 already with the reso at 1280 x 1024. If there was someway to come up with a 800 x 600 version and if it was fairly easy to do I would be glad to try it. Also , I can make new windows but cant seem to close them when I need to. I do understand that you have one window cause its your ui but I would like to split my windows up as I get tells constantly and I need to have tells in its own window. I also need a seperate window for GUILD , GROUP , SAY , and Chat Channels. This is purely a request. I'm currently thinking of making some skins myself but I need the correct programs for it and then maybe I will get this stuff on my own if you dont have the time bro. Anyhow thanks for the new UI. It is solid , just I'm old LOL.............<br />

<br />
I don't seem to have the same equipment, so all of the &quot;clicky&quot; item hotspots are just regular items, how can I change what shows up there so I can use, lets say Woven Grass Bracelet on my right wrist??<br />
<br />
Email me if its too long to post.   Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As to the group window last player item.  I will look at that right now.  I guess i haven't been in full groups since i started using it hehehe.  Course I havent even been playing much cause i been working on other resolutuions for this UI.  I will be posting AGAIN on the mix and match board because I had to strip down the UI to get it to fit.  <br />
<br />
As to the right clickies well it is designed for druids those are the most common right clicky items for druids.  To change this you will have to go into the EQUI_htbtn.xml file and change the inventory items to a different slot.  This is a very long discussion, however there are threads on this web site that may help you with that.  Feel free to mosify it to fit you.<br />
<br />
As to the fontsizes in chat.  You will have to do a /chatfontsize and set it to what you want.  You can also change the colors etc.  The stuff in the hitsmode window I would not change since it is sized like that to fit the interface.  Obviously if you make it real big its gonna be screwed up because the UI doesnt adgjust to fontsizes.  But your main chat window and the spell/fight spam window should size nicely.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

My wife and I both use this mod, but our computers are networked to share the same connection. Anyway I get a lot of excess lag from so high a reso, so ta hear you're working on 1024x768 calls fer a big ol WOOT!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulivin</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok the only thing that truely bugged me about this UI, after useing it for a while, its the hitsmode thing, id get hit a bunch, then an hour later something else would start hitting me and it would take to long to relize something new was attacking, was kinda hard to tell. If there is a way to make the hits vanish slowly, clear or something (i dono if there is or isnt) then ill start using it again... i normaly filter a bunch of stuff to hits window to spam it out but cant do that on this one because its a pet window. Playing a druid, without sound and having a disability to knowing theres a 2nd elysian skelly hitting you in the back and you have no clue.... sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fezzig</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG.. This is a beautiful Mod. Great work on getting such a nice theme together. :nana: :nana: :nana: <br />
<br />
Couple questions...<br />
<br />
1) Wolf Casting timer.. Could that be made to be movable? I could find the file that contains it's location settings, but would be nice to be able to drag it around.<br />
<br />
2) Loot window was default (not sure about merchant)... Could that be made to match the same skin as the containers? That would be cool :p <br />
<br />
Other than those little things.. I hope this stays stable for a while.. Keep up the good work :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">narwael</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For  ur first question : Just Cast something how take a long time and move it like any window, it s really simple :D</div></div><hr />
