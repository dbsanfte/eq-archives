<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gramp</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.  I use Maees' &quot;Crisp Targetting Ring.&quot;  Prior to the last patch, the delegate MA ring, which is white, would pulse within the targetting ring, making it fairly easy to see even on even cons.  Now, there appears to be no animation whatsoever, and it overlays right over the targetting ring.  On even cons it is impossible to see.  Anybody have a fix to this?  Even if I could just change its color that would be cool (although I would like it animate the way it did).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maedieeq</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the pulsing Delagated ring that you saw was the buggy version.  The new, static Delegated ring is the way it was meant to be.  <br />
<br />
It's very easy to change the color of the Delegate ring.  I've changed mine to a purple-pink color, which shows up very well against all con-colors of mobs.  Follow these directions which I originally posted to the concert hall and eqdruids forums: <br />
<br />
the default assist and Mark circles are not supposed to look like spastically flashing, undecorated concentric rings. This is a bug that happens if you are using a custom target circle which hasn't been updated to include the new definitions that SoE introduced with GoD. They actually have a runic device, and are non-animated. If yours is flashing, then you need to edit the TargetIndicator.cfg file in your custom folder to include the new xml definitions for the Assist and Mark rings. :)   <br />
<br />
To fix this, you need to copy the files &quot;assist.tga&quot; and the files &quot;mark1.tga&quot; to &quot;mark6.tga&quot;. (7 files total) from the default UI folder into your custom UI folder.<br />
<br />
Then open both the TargetIndicator.cfg files in your default folder and your custom folder, and compare them.<br />
<br />
Stuff that is different in the two files include 5 new definitions for &quot;AssistMarker&quot; and &quot;Marker0&quot; to &quot;Marker3&quot;.<br />
<br />
Copy that section of the code from the Default file into the custom file.<br />
<br />
Also note that each &quot;Marker#&quot; has its own opacity and height settings, so a few edits are needed if your custom circle has file definitions at the top that SoE went and customized in the Mark/Assist area of the file. (in my case, i had to remove the following from the top of the file:<br />
FadeStart=0.0<br />
FadeEnd=2.0<br />
OpaqueStart=0.0<br />
OpaqueEnd=0.1<br />
InitialLength=1<br />
GrowSpeed=1<br />
FloorOffset=0.0<br />
<br />
and paste it into EACH con-color definition that follows it, &quot;VeryEasy&quot; to &quot;Deadly&quot;.  In your case, the number of definitions you need to copy down may be different.)<br />
 <br />
<br />
Important: if you edit the file in the Default folder and leave it there, the patcher will just overwrite it next time EQ starts up.<br />
<br />
After you do that, you just need to restart EQ, and the flashing should be fixed.  <br />
<br />
While editing the file, I found it helpful to also edit the color of the assist ring to some other color than white (255,255,255) so that the ring showed up better against even-con mobs.  I changed my assist ring to pink (Red=255, Green=102, Blue=255).  That helped a lot.  You can also change the color for each of the Mark rings too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gramp</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here's what I want.  I want the assist ring to completely cover the con ring.  I want it to look identical, just be a different color (pink, for instance).  The con rings are crisp, and almost solid color, for example:<br />
<br />

<br />
I want the assist ring to look IDENTICAL to that, just be a different color.  I have them both using the same .tga.  Works great on blue mobs, but turns green cons white, and white cons has no effect at all (haven't tested other colors.  I tried fudging with flooroffset on the assist part to have it be &quot;higher&quot; than the main ring, but that had no effect.  Any pointers?  BTW this is my targetindicator.ini up to the assist ring part:<br />
