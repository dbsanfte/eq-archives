<br />
I use a mod now that adds spell name to the left of the buff icon, as well as a blueis background for buff, and redish for &quot;negative&quot; buffs.<br />
<br />
But.. i am really annoyed that the bufficons\textbox is not transparent, only the actual buffbox itself (vertical with 15 numbered &quot;slots&quot;) <br />
I would really like the icons to be transparent, so that it is possible to see something behind it when not in use.. <br />
<br />
Any tips? (Link to a mod that has transparent bufficons)<br />

That's in the GUI itself.  It is possiable to, to make them semi trans in the tga files. Just involves copying them, making a new layer. Turning up the transparency of that layer and saving it back again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well.. as far as i can see (and have tested).. the Transparent Tag only makes the background totally gone.. Ie. You wont have the fade effect occur on the &quot;wnd_bg_light_rock.tga&quot; picture..<br />
<br />
So.. It does seem like the transparency of the bufficons is hardcoded in this window.. Wich kinda makes some sence, cos after thinking about it a couple of seconds, when the buff is FADING, it is doing just that.. so if it was to be faded already, it might impose a problem.. But that VI should do is perhaps make it pulse the same way, but make it pulse to a non-transparent icon, and back to transparent (reverse it) when the buff is fading (leaving) <br />
<br />
Oh.. well.. guess unless i poke out my hex editor and really mess things up, this is not doable in a good manner...<br />
