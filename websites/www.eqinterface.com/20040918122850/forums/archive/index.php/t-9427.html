If you are looking for suggestions, the only two that I can really think of are the following:<br />
<br />
 Hot Swap slots added to your containers for switching weapons and arrows (for those Endless Quiver types who use different types of arrows) in and out.<br />
 The Hotkeys look nice and clean; but, the silver color does not seem to fit the rest of the skin.  Maybe a light brown to match the wood? <br />
I have been thinking about a Ranger twink.  If I do this, I will DEFINITELY use this skin.  Nice work! <br />

<br />
<br />
If you go to the UI home page and click on the &quot;Features&quot; link, you will notice in the picture that the Friends window has been converted to an inventory+weapons+ranged slot window, exactly made for swapping.  I just went into the options window (Alt+O) and bound the friends window to the &quot;F&quot; key.  Now, whenever I hit F, I get the weapon swapping window.  I have it positioned sort of in the middle of my screen, since that is where the mouse tends to gravitate to.<br />
<br />
Give it a go!</div></div><hr />

There is a new version up with some colored hotbuttons.  I'll get a screenshot up this morning.  Thanks for the idea: you were right, it does look better.  Still tinkering with the exact color.</div></div><hr />

You don't have an animations file and just putting the buff xml's in my current ui (Tablets) didn't work.</div></div><hr />

Keep an eye out :)</div></div><hr />
