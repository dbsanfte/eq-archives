<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About 2 weeks ago I emailed Absor about the error when using the /loadskin menu.  <br />
Not sure if you are aware, but the menu that comes up with /loadskin is still not functioning.. I am kudane from EQInterface.com and we still get many people every week trying to use that menu and it will not load any UI's the error log shows double &quot;//&quot; hash marks as if it simply got an error in the code to load.. if you would like to visit eqinterface.com and surf some of the help topics you will see where everyone who has tried to use this menu has not had luck.. I hope someone had already told ya... but since Hammerfel didn't know when i talked to him.. i thought I should send in a message. <br />

Got this reply today<br />
Thanks for the heads up.  It seems we did not know about this issue.  It has been fixed and should be patched on Thursday.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
So now we know at least one thing that will be in the 10 hour patch on Thurs. <br />
<br />
Expect the new bard buff box, and window-able EQ to go in too. <br />

DOH!<br />
<br />
Well, way to go, Kudane! It's about time they got it fixed - thanks for taking that on and getting it done!</div></div><hr />

Glad to know I wasn't the only one having this problem. Now if we can let em know about the server filter that's not filtering lol. :p</div></div><hr />

I played with the test client and I must say that I prefer EQW's handling of switching windows and mouse control.</div></div><hr />

And cant wait for the bard window ...It would be nice if the mobs buffs will go in that window :D <br />

  Do you think they added that Loot Slot 30 on purpose or just blew it?  Maybe a quick email to Abs would prevent that one from slipping by and causing all sorts of chaos with debuggin a bunch of the complete sets (just to have it patched later and then we have to backtrack all the changes again.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abraxxass</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">now if only they would fix the /serverfilter...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cravin</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my vote is for /camp Desktop to work again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slak</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/camp desktop will work if your spellbook is open... not exactly sure why though. :) <br />
<br />
and I believe /serverfilter would help more people than the /camp desktop bug... but rumor is they intentionally disabled /serverfilter to cut down on the work the servers do... INSTEAD of upgrading the servers :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelfric</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally sent in half a dozen bug reports about the loadskin issue over the course of the last few months.  I've also bugged the /camp desktop problem as well.</div></div><hr />

Man I WISH!!! I sent this in using the &quot;submit comment&quot; in the Dev forum on the eqlive site.. personally I think i just got very lucky.. <br />
<br />
One of the things I would like to see finished are the newbie armor quest for Trolls/Ogres/Iksar/Vah Shir/ and Good aligned Eurdites.  I know these dont really effect anyone whos main is over 10.. but its fun to take a break for a weekend and be a newbie and go make your own armor.. and then later tell begging newbies about it so they feel a sense of acomplishment and ending the begging :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">harvyst</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There actually are newbie armour quests for the vah shir.<br />
<br />
There's a guy in shadeweavers who wants assorted junk, in exchange he'll give you a complete suit. The problem is to get the tunic and the legs, you have to hunt things on the other side of the tunnels, where everything is kos and red and nasty. By the time you can hunt there, you wouldn't want that armour.<br />
<br />
Sad.<br />
<br />
You can also get a whole set of clubs by turning in hopper talons of various forms, and a 6 slot wr bag by collecting chittik poop.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the cloak quests plus the blessed champions' cape.... there are plenty of things for baby vah shir to do.</div></div><hr />

Beastlords and Rogues have low level armor, but shamans don't... not sure about warriors... but it's a large reason I deleted my barb shaman - I could have more fun with a race/class that HAD quests to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
these are not true &quot;newbie armor&quot; quest.. yes you can do them at low level but they dont fit within the scheme of the other newbie armors..<br />
<br />
and the Vah Shir guy in shadeweaver is not really newbie armor.. cuz as pointed out.. by the time you could finish.. your nearly 20..<br />
<br />
no idea if they will ever reply to that one... I hope they finish them, and if they do... maybe I will be 2 for 50 (50 things emailed about, 2 fixed. heheheh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Honeydu</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well barbarians do have armor quest, turning in pelts to the lady that has patterns..  also the bl bararains have even a better amor quest..   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
AGAIN, these are NOT the &quot;newbie armor quest&quot; that we are talking about these are older quest...</div></div><hr />
