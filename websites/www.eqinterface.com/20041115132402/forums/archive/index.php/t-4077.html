I'll attach a picture of my plans, and keep updating as I go. Not sure if I can make this though, it'll be pretty hard. ;)<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think. The picture itself is 800 x 600 but I'm guessing it's going to be in 1024 x 768 because I don't know if I can get it all in their in 800 x 600. BTW, suggestions would be nice. ;)</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking of going to a lower resolution myself because I'm running out of ideas for how to use all the space I've freed up.</div></div><hr />

I can try though. :) Another thing is the chat windows. I can probably get them like that by using /chatfontsize and making the font smaller, but the text for some reason becomes blocky-er. :( Gonna try though. I have the player/group/stats+exp gauges just about done. I'd have to make it a lot smaller to conserve space though. I actually downloaded someone elses, then modified it, so now I have to modify it again. :nana:</div></div><hr />
