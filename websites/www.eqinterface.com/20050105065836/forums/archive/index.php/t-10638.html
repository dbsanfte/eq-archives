Some of it is the file in question. For instance when you extract it it makes &quot;SomestoryFolder&quot; but their file refrences &quot;StoryFolderBlahBlahBlah&quot;<br />
So it looks for the link ect and finds nothing there.<br />
<br />
I also notice a lot of bad html and simple misspellings that can throw it out of wack.<br />
Now mind you I am just learn about the StoryLine folder But I have fixed some of them... <br />
Or i could be an idiot and fix it but misunderstand how I fixed it...<br />
Just so you know I'm not claiming to be any better or smarter then the author of the files....<br />
(BTW I do appreciate and salute all the work that goes into these and don't want to come off as being too critical of certain attempts.)<br />
