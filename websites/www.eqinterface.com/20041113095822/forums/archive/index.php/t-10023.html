(inventory, spellbook and i may create myown spell icons).. with a copy and paste from sub-directories, you can change from a &quot;Good&quot; to &quot;Evil&quot; kinda feel.<br />
<br />
Gem in the middle of the wings displays Target Name and Health % as the gem wears down.  Ring around the Gem is your casting bar.<br />

clickies (sigh) I have no clickies.. wish i did.. I have some space at the bottom of the player window for a few.. what inv.slots would be the most popular?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i am not sure of the most popular but you can just pick a few then in the read me give directions on how players can edit the xml  themselves I have seen a few UI's do it that way...makes it eaiser on the coder if they let the player make those decisions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, if you don't have any don't add slots. Just tell people they have to hotkey inventory slots (like they should). I have a 10-slot pack full of right-click items and am wearing 3. They eat up hotkeys, but then again, there are keyboard shortcuts for most actions anyways. Most people waste their hotkey slots.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you're a class with a lot of abilities + AA abilities you need hotkeys (rangers, druids, monks) but most classes don't really. Hotkeying things like autoattack, spellbook and sit (and camp, ug) are rather silly since they have their own shortcuts. And spells, who needs to hotkey a spell other than a bard?<br />
<br />
As a mage I only NEED /pet hold, /pet report health, 3 right click items, and Pet Lay Hands (and I have an /assist button). My other 3 hotkeys are just any other random thing to waste the extra slots.<br />
<br />
Forage, Sneak and Hide eat up hotkeys, but that still leaves you with 7. And Range Attack I can understand needing to hotkey.<br />
<br />
If anyone can give me a list of 10 hotkeys they use (that don't have any wasted on things that already have a keyboard shortcut) that makes them not have enough room to hotkey items, then I'll change my opinion on this matter.<br />

Ragin' Mage... in.<br />

P.S. - Not sure what set me off about this thread. Guess I just hate &quot;clicky&quot; slots.<br />
<br />
P.P.S. - Really really nice looking UI. Don't change a thing. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starshelle</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Primary, secondary, chest, and leggings.  I think are probably the more common ones. As a druid I also have a clickie bracer, necklace, and  I use an ammo slot for my drogmor's drum. I know some rings can have clickies on them too. It's very easy for people to customize clickie slots for their liking. I've noticed a number of mods include instructions for people for people about how to do that. <br />
<br />
Hehe to echo Enok above, you don't HAVE to make clickies slots, however I personally find them useful. If a mod I like doesn't include clickies, I just code it in myself. Love your artwork too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for the clickies... i'd recommend you &quot;steal&quot; shamelessly the vertebrae's hotbuttons with ccake... with just some custom artwork that should just fit fine :D<br />
<br />
ask sokol and kudane for that, of course ;)</div></div><hr />

And as an answer to your main question.. I would chose GOOD side.. Keep working on it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is very nice, except that you misspelled experience under the bar =P.  Other than that, I just wish that the compass could be encorporated to make it more streamlined, there seems to be soom room possible in the spellgem area.  Just a thought.  Oh and if it's possible, I think the nubmers on the hot gems should be removes, just make a custom hotbutton graphic the same color or something and solidify it /shrug.  I really don't know a way to do it but other people seem to have found a way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metrosnowblind</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any update on this?</div></div><hr />
