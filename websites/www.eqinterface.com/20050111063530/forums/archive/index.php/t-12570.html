Here is what I did.  I started from scratch.  Deleted old vert files.  Created copy of default.  Renamed it vert.  Ran 2.6E zip file.  then ran the patches for  10/9, 11/5, 12/18, then the latest patch.  Just wondering if anyone else is having this message and knows why.<br />
<br />
Also, I noticed that SpellCastWindow was modified in the Vert patch, but that window was not modified by EQ.  I use the Sokol Horizontal SpellCastWindow and was wondering if I could still use it or if that file needed to be first modified in some way.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />
<br />
Edit:  by the way, the UI seems perfectly functional, though I have yet to try to make a hotbutton from my skills window.  It also seems functional with the old Horizontal SpellCastWindow mod.</div></div><hr />

NO NO NO NO NO!  <br />

The only thing that should go into your mod directory is the MOD.  Adding in all the files from the default  UI is just going to disguise anything that is wrong, and make locating any real problems very difficult. <br />
<br />
Start over.  Just install the vert stuff into the vert folder.</div></div><hr />

I had to laugh when I read that.  I knew exactly why.<br />
<br />
I like to help people. but I have to admit there is a point where I loose patience for people that do not try to help themselves first.<br />
All over the palce it says to not copy your default folder, never.<br />
I've gotten to the point where often I don't even bother to try to help someone that has done this, just for the simple fact that they did not bother to read the FAQ's READ ME FIRST thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archus</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried to do it without copying the files, but I have NEVER gotten the vert UI to work that way.  I have always done it this way and I have always had the UI work FINE with NO ERRORS.  I do NOT know why I can't get custom UI's to work the way every else seems to be able to by just copying the MOD, but I CAN NOT.  If there is someone out there that can help me with my problem as it stands, then I would appreciate it.  If not, then I will eventually figure it out on my own.<br />
<br />
By the way,  HERE is what the FAQ says.<br />
<br />
(But a reminder ... do NOT copy your entire default folder over into your custom folder. If you do that, you guarantee that every single time VI changes something, you will have a UI that does not work. The only thing that should be in your custom folder are the files that have actually been customized!)<br />
<br />
It says NOTHING about having UI errors by doing it the MY way.  As long as I copy all the new files to vert and run a clean install of Vert, then it will be the SAME as doing it YOUR way (which, as I said before DOES NOT WORK FOR ME).  Also, I did delete the skills window as directed by the Feb 10 patch.<br />
<br />
Mortis, you seem to believe that the simple act of copying your default folder will cause UI errors.  However, by MY interpretation of the FAQ, you are advised not to copy the default folder because it will force you to update every file that is modified with every UI patch even if those files are not modified by your UI.  I understand that, and I make those modifications every time.  As I said before, I have done it this way for over a year through many UI patches and have had NO problems.  Just because you don't have the answer to a problem does NOT mean the poster didn't read the FAQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you advise it, I will go ahead and try to get my mod working the 'right' way, but so far, its still working error-free the 'wrong' way.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
