I have been playing with it on a mod to mod basis trying to figure out what VI has changed. Anyone experiencing the same issue, or am I just completely crazy? :)<br />

<br />
Are they your skins? Someone elses skins? If they are public skins, which ones? Have you looked for a newer version from the person who made it? <br />
<br />
It's easier to help when you are more specific. The patch last week changed a couple small things and most mod makers responded quickly with updated versions.<br />

<br />
as explained in several threads, several files are now &quot;cached&quot; during start up... they load these from the folder listed in the eqclient.ini file under<br />
<br />
UISkin=Default<br />
<br />
If you change this setting to the folder that has the images you want (say you downloaded the purple to a folder called Senwiz) you would change it to<br />
<br />
UISkin=Senwiz<br />
<br />
then it would cache the images in the Senwiz folder.<br />
<br />
Remember:<br />
You can NOT change objects in the default folder<br />
You HAVE to remake your custom skins folders from the new default to fix the bazaar file, and chat windows. (otherwise you crash to desktop when you type /bazaar)<br />
You only have to do the /loadskin command once. after than anything you put in the folder loads with the character <br />
<br />
expect further changes to the UI since it still in &quot;beta 2&quot; and have to remakes skins a few times... <br />
<br />
hope that helps<br />

These are mods and some color graphics change stuff<br />

<br />
The only way to TEMP fix them is to do the UISkin=Default change mentioned above.<br />
<br />
This is only a TEMP. Side effect: If you happen to modify your skin, and something broke, there's a very good chance you'll crash every time you try to log on.</div></div><hr />

I just made the graphics i changed in their own file, and referenced that file for the appropriate pieces in EQUI_Animations .  Seems like a permanent fix to me.  Plus I ended up with an ~4k instead of ~25k file in my dist.</div></div><hr />
