<br />
Take a look at my work in progress,<br />
<br />
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~tle/myui.jpg<br />
<br />
It's currently at 800x600.<br />
<br />
One thing that annoyed me about the new UI, is that<br />
while the buff icon box shows the buffs nice and neat,<br />
the hotbox pictures, and spell gem pictures are crappy<br />
and choppy looking, Same with the inventory/bag pictures.<br />
<br />
Is there any way for me to fix this?<br />
<br />
I'd really like to be able to get the other graphics to be displayed<br />
as sharply and smoothly as the buff icon box, so i can move up to 1024 and add some more functionality to the interface.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

Ok i did some more testing and stuff.<br />
<br />
Basicly it comes down to this.<br />
<br />
Buff Icons are 40x40.<br />
<br />
Spell Gem Icons are 24x24 (hotkey spells and spell gems, the 8 gems).<br />
<br />
The issue i have is that 24x24, even at 800x600 resolution is way too small to see cleanly, and its worse at 1024x768.<br />
<br />
Looking at the equi_animation.xml and also by knowing which<br />
tga files are there,<br />
<br />
The Buff Icons are 40x40 and taken from 5 files,<br />
spells01.tga -spells05.tga which are 256 x256.<br />
<br />
The Spell Gem Icons are 24x24 and taken from 2 files<br />
gemicons01-02.tga which are 256x256.<br />
<br />
I tried to change how equi_animations.xml grabbed the files<br />
but i could only manage to crash to desktop.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had any success changing the SIZE of the gemicons?<br />
<br />
If you have let me know please, that seems to be the key here,<br />
getting them from 24x24 to 40x40.<br />
<br />
I'd really love to be able to choose the size, even higher then 40x40 perhaps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the buff window, look for the &lt;DecalSize&gt; tag.  You can change this and it will scale the icons to whatever size you want.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you are resizing the icons you'll need to reposition everything as well.</div></div><hr />
