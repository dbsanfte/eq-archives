You can find the Skin in the Complete UI folder.<br />

Let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />

Tried this right sided mod but it wont load for me.</div></div><hr />

Hey Yelara,  What is the problem that you are having? <br />
<br />
I downloaded the new version (I had an older version) and spent the day yesterday playing with it. It's working perfectly (or was before the patch anyway. I have yet to log on to see if it's still working)<br />
<br />
I have several mods installed to my basic Quartz and wanted to move them over to the right sided version as well. By the time I called it a night last night everything was looking pretty good. <br />
<br />
For cosmetic purposes, I use a combination of windows pieces from Vert's 2.2 Blue and the Icey Blue skin. I also replaced the T.King spellbook and icons with the Vert and Icey Blue versions. I just like the nice clean look of them. They're easier on these tired old eyes.<br />
<br />
I've added the EQTradeskill Recipes to the Friends window, the EQTradskills Location Guide to the BugReport window. EQAtlas to my Help window and the EQ Location mod to the Feedback window. <br />
<br />
In order to use the EQAtlas you need to be able to toggle the Help window, so I moved the Help button back to upper corner of the Selection window, along with the Friends and Actions buttons.<br />
<br />
Playing a Shammy, Cleric and Druid I have a few additional right clickie items (Legs, BP, earring and bracer) so I added those items to the Selection window. <br />
<br />
I resized and moved the inventory slots in both the HotButtons and Selector windows around a bit to make them more convenient for me. I also put the Hotbuttons back to the same layout as the orignal Quartz. <br />
<br />
And last but not least, I resized the SpellGem window to allow me to put the compass underneath and tweaked the locations of the buttons on the PetInfo window. <br />
<br />
Except for the horizontal buff bar that I have sitting above the main chat window, it all fits nice and neatly now within a 1280 750 viewport. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the work you put into this great mod. The Quartz skin is a great foundation and you did a great job with the changes you made. I for one an in your debt. Much as I loved the  original I was feeling like I was working backwards :P<br />
<br />
Thanks again!!</div></div><hr />

Would you mind uploading a Screeenshot of your mods so I can see how it looks.  You have some interesting changes in there that might go nicely all around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will as soon as I can get back in game and take a few shots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I have updated my complete skin.  The updated file should be on the complete set download page soon.  You will know it is the updated skin because I have stated in the message with it that it is updated as of 10/16/02.  Believe it or not that only file that had to be updated to work with the new patch was the Animation file.  Once I got all the updates added to that file everything started wotking just fine.  Let me know if you are having any problems with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, heres a screenshot of the mods I've done to the work Chronwaas has done. As noted the main changes are in my prior post. I've also shown the container mods I use. <br />
<br />
If theres any interest I can zip it all up and load it to the Complete Sets or Mix and Match sections for download.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dr. Skins</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:nana:  Yelara  :nana: <br />
<br />
If you would please zip and upload the entire package if you would be so kind, also keep the Cleric Epic pointer in the UI(something for my cleric to stare at everyday and shoot for :P)<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:D  :nana:  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The file was also uploaded to the MixAndMatch section as Quartz_Right_Mod_V1.ZIP<br />
<br />
It includes all of the mods I;m currently using (Credits and discription in the Read_Me file and upload description.<br />
<br />
It's tested and fully functional after the 10/16 patch</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can anyone see the file? I attached it but it's not showing to me for some reason :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope dont see any attachment.</div></div><hr />

Hey Yelara,  I cant find your upload in the Downloads section either.  Was it suppose to go in the Mix and Match area? <br />
<br />
Yup. I uploaded it 2 days ago. Just redid it again this morning. <br />
<br />
I think the zip file is too latge for the server or the upload script. I'm going to rezip it and upload it to my own web space then post the link here for download. Hopefully that will work :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Yelara,  How are you trying to attach the file.  As far as I know you can only attach one file to a message.  You should be using the Attach file: option at the bottom of your Message create window.  That is the thing that I use to attach files and it usually works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oops,  Second file just came up in the second post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fraethir</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Include 1280x1024 or larger as well. Didn't realize your version (and mods) were only for 1024x768, and even when I pull it out to the edges, I'm having massive problems resizing the chat windows (that I didn't have with the original quartz skin). I'm working on tracking down WHY I can't resize them, presumably a switch in the UI.ini for the character, or something in the chatwindow definition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure your chat window size lock is turned off.  If that does not work you may need to look in the chatwindow ZML to make sure that the Style_Sizable entry is set to &quot;true&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cant resize the chatwiindow that was included with your zip either. I was too lazy to look at the XML for it though so I just used the one from the original Quartz</div></div><hr />
