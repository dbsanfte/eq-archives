<br />
HOWEVER WOW... I am able to load up a second account on my same machine... small problem... <br />
<br />
How do I make the window smaller than almost full screen so I can see both windows at once, instead of having them both over laid on each other?<br />
<br />
I'd like to put them side by side so I can see the action from both perspectives at once.  Does changing the screen resolution allow you to make the actual window smaller?  I noticed when I spawn both clients they start out nice and small, but when they get to Character Select mode, they go almost full screen.<br />
<br />
or.. any one know of a cheap way to have a second monitor hung off the same computer sharing the same desktop space.. i've seen it done here at work with the contractors, but the equipment they have is expensive to do that.</div></div><hr />

You do NOT want to two box on one PC<br />
<br />
even with the 3.0 gig system I have played on trying to run two instances of EQ causes horrid lag in both. As both try to read and write to the Hard-Drive at the same time.. this works to exchange items, but you can not switch between them fast enough to effectively play two characters and 99 time out of 100 one or both of them will die in a fight.. (due to Lag, or not able to swap)... (remember if one dies it will lockup the mouse so you can't move the other till first one returns to bind)<br />
<br />

<br />
This is what I use.<br />
<br />
I can roll it up beside when I need to bring in more than one character, I use a 40$ Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard so I can move it on to the desk by my main keyboard. And when I dont need two characters, I roll it back up against the wall (and put mouse and keyboard back). You zip-tie a powerstrip to the frame and then the only cords are the network cord, and extension cord (I have mine zip-tied togehter).<br />

Let me offer you an additional solution.  I use a Belkin KVM Switch.  This is a simple box that allows you to hook multiple computers up to a single Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse.  It's a simple little box that will switch between the  PC's without having to need two monitors, keyboards and mice.  I use a two switch version of this, but have seen them for sale with 4 switches.  They may come with more, but I have not personally seen one.  I have also knowticed that the same switches are now sold with sound switches too so your able to hear only the PC you are currently looking at.  It's as easy as a press of a button.  The only disadvantage of this that you still can only see one screen at a time and interact with the one PC at a time, but you would have to be very talented to be using two PC's at the same time IMHO :) <br />

I have something similar to that, one of my computers shares a monitor however the monitor had a build in secondary port, quite handy for the space contraints actually.  If you can wing it and the monitor toggle isn't too annoying...its a great solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">even with the 3.0 gig system I have played on trying to run two instances of EQ causes horrid lag in both.

Create a second EQ directory, preferably on a second HD.  Launch one instance of EQ from each directory.<br />
this works to exchange items, but you can not switch between them fast enough to effectively play two characters and 99 time out of 100 one or both of them will die in a fight.. (due to Lag, or not able to swap)<br />
To restore ALT+TAB functionality with EQ download the Windows Application Compatibility Toolkit.  This is approved by SOE, see: http://help.station.sony.com/esupport/esupport/consumer/esupport.asp?id=GUID45185938%5F3647%5F11d8%5Fa6e6%5F080020fb302c&amp;resource=&amp;number=0&amp;isExternal=0&amp;nShowFacts=&amp;nShowCause=&amp;nShowChange=&amp;nShowAddInfo=&amp;activepage=statement.asp&amp;bForceMatch=&amp;strCurrentSymptom=&amp;searchtype=normal&amp;searchclass=&amp;bnewsession=false&amp;selecttype=match<br />
remember if one dies it will lockup the mouse so you can't move the other till first one returns to bind<br />
I have never had this happen that I know.  It may be resolved with the ALT+TAB fix.  However, I do use my keyboard primarily and have gone for a number of hours without a mouse before and have not ran two instances of EQ on my machine many times with the EQ windowed mode (see later).<br />
<br />
Some other things to note:<br />
Always be sure that both windows are located in exactly the same spot on your desktop.  The way that I did this was to set up everything on one instance before setting up my second EQ directory.  Every setting in both directories are identical that way.<br />
Turn off all Options.  i.e. Luclin models, socials, dynamic lighting, use low textures, and most importantly sound.  Be sure that your computer is set up for Best Performance, especially your graphics card.<br />
<br />
Now, I mentioned earlier that I do not use the EQ windowed mode.  What do I use?  It is an application that has been around since before running EQ in windowed mode was approved called EQWindows (http://www.eqwindows.com/)**.  I find that it runs moch more stable than the windowed mode that EQ uses.  <br />
My only complaint is that you cannot restore fullscreen with it.  Since I run EQ at a lower resolution than Windows, this is annoying at times.  I usually ahve to know when I was to box on one computer so that I can change my desktop resolution to the same resolution that I run EQ in so that I can have pseudo-fullscreen.<br />
<br />
Now for EULA.  There has never been to my knowledge any official word as to the legality of using this program.  Unofficially it is legal to use this program since it does not alter anything ... etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
My guild &lt;Arma Viresque&gt; is 90% boxers.  We have a couple people that quad-box regularly, and one of them does it on 2 computers that I knoew.  There is another member that plays his own 6-person group on 4 machines.  We have discussed boxing on single machines regularly.<br />
<br />
** This program is STILL against the EULA and can cause you to be banned even now, they reversed banning on it before, but they did NOT say it was ok to use it... use at your own risk --- Admin</div></div><hr />

It ran fine as a cleric and warrior, I was leveling myself up.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem was UI selection. I just ended up creating a custom UI for when I two box on my one PC. It works, and the lag wasn't game breaking or unbearable. I leveled my warrior from 40 to 45 without a problem.<br />

I think I also changed the shortcut for releasing the mouse from ctrl+shft+r to something a bit easier.</div></div><hr />

1) Make 2 Everquest Directories 1 for normal/1 for 2boxing<br />
2) Make As many eqw directories as accts u will be playing at once.<br />
3) Download MiniVert2box (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2931)<br />
4) Unzip UI into your EQ/Uifiles/Mini Directory<br />
5) Play EQ and Enjoy<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otosan Ameotoko</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well... <br />
I am a twoboxer, have been for a while, and it isnt really that hard you just have to get used to it.<br />
<br />
Right now I can run up to 3 instances of EQ on my computer:<br />
3.0ghz AMD athlon<br />
512DDR <br />
GeForce FX 5900 ultra<br />
and **2** 80gig seagate HDs. <br />
<br />
EQ is a memory and a HD hog, period.<br />
<br />
All you need to do (this is what i did) is create a partition just for EQ on one drive and then put the other in your main partition (most people with 2 harddrives squish them together so they dont lose stuff)  Install EQ on your main drive partition then copy all the files (minus the character files i.e. bobtheshaman_bristle.ini) to your &quot;EQ partition&quot;  <br />
<br />
Some people recommend using EQWindows, which i frown upon, especially since EQ is Alt tab-able now.  And some recommend turning the sound completely off in your client.ini file (i recommend this for at least one of your instances).  Zoning can be slow, and you NEVER want to have EQ windows side by side, not even 64bit highend systems can run stuff like that, DirectX just goes insane and explodes.  Overlay one window over the other with a little bit of both window able to show when you are active in the other and youre fine.<br />
<br />
ps. Load one version of EQ, get chars in same zone or whatever, THEN load the other character, have 2 characters loading zones at the same time is almost a garaunteed crash unless you have a lot of ram 1gig+</div></div><hr />

I use EQWindows as well since it seems to lag less then if both EQs are windowed without it. I have every extra feature possbile turned to off on one character. Including having the clip plane all the way down and 3dsky off. And in most cases with my caster hes looking down the whole time. <br />
<br />
The key to it all for me was to make a whole set of macros for the caster specifically for my other character for duoing. I havent done it too much in groups but since I'm not doing every job like in duoing I dont need such elaborate macros. I hardly ever play them both at the same time though unless I need just little bit more exp or an item. otherwise it feels like work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It states quit clearly that you may not use ANY program that BYPASSES the Everquest frontend. They have banned accounts for the use of this program (I know 2 people personally). Though they DID un-ban those accounts to give people a second chance.. please know you use this program at your own risk.  I won't say not to use it or you should use it. but any mention of it needs to have a footnote that it does break the EULA..<br />

<br />
I seem to recall them unbanning the accounts and saying nothing else.<br />
<br />
This was done at the time they added windows mode and said nothing about &quot;a second chance&quot;.<br />
<br />
As a part of this change, the account bans related to the use of third-party EverQuest windowing applications have already been reversed.<br />
(I found the quote (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53400))<br />
<br />
Personally, I think SOE has no viable grounds for banning you for using an application that has proven to perform better than thier own internal system's version. EQW is nothing more than EQ in a window. It's exactly the same thing you get when you hit 'Alt-Enter', but it's (much) more stable.<br />
<br />
EQW happens to be a great way to two box on 1 system. I know plenty of people that 4 box using this method (two systems with two accounts on each). I just two box, but I do have two computers to allow me to do so (But, I do use EQW on my alt box to allow me to search/research while playing).<br />
<br />
Sorry to bring it up. I just think it would be outright childish of SOE if they decided to start banning accounts cause of the use of EQW again. After all they said it themselves -- Cause of the new EQ Window mode they are lifting all bans from using EQW (Third party apps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. You will not get banned. Like said before EQWindows does exactly what EQ can already do but better.<br />
<br />
2. They unbanned the accounts when they came out with the feature for EQ and stated that no more people will be banned for using &quot;third party software that puts everquest in a window&quot;</div></div><hr />

But a FYI, for simple PLing of an alt, if both characters are in the same zone, I had absolutley no problem 2 boxing on one machine, with each instance in a 1024x768 window, with minimal reduction in framerates. This was on a Slot A Athlon 850Mhz with 512 MB PC100. I personally could not believe it worked. I wouldnt recommend it for raiding or anything that strenuous however. Oh and I was not using the EVIL (=p) EQW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OneDeadlyBum</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I successfully 'two-box' on one PC, and these are my specs:<br />
<br />
1.6 GHZ P4 Processor<br />
512 MB of SDRAM<br />
ATI Radeon 9600 PRO (running in 4x AGP mode, quality texture settings, no AA/AF)<br />
<br />
I've only got one hard-drive, but heres some things to point out about 'two-boxing' on one PC:<br />
<br />
1) Turning off ALL Luclin models is a MUST, unless you happen to have a horse, in the case turn on ONLY the luclin models you need (your race, and only your gender, + horse/elemental models)<br />
<br />
2) Turning off sound is HIGHLY suggested, unless you want to put up with echoing, and if your processor isn't that good you'll get plenty of slow-down.<br />
<br />
3) Low-resolutions and UIs with little screen clutter are your friend. Make special hotkeys that you can press, and quickly alt-tab to another character while the other does his thing. (generally only works with casters, but i imagine with some creative positioning and hotkeys it could work with any class)<br />
<br />
4) Get your characters/UIs/etc setup just right, and then if you currently use luclin models OR want different settings when your not playing two characters, make a copy of your EQ directory. While this will eat up more disk space, you'll save a significant amount of time (no luclin models = uber fast loading), and if you don't have to cache your textures every other time you play, its less waiting time and less RAM/processing cycles wasted.<br />
<br />
5) Make sure that your EQ windows are directly on top of each other. This is a MUST, otherwise you'll get garbage performance. Yes, it'd be nice to have both windows next to each other, but that just isn't gonna happen unless you have a super-computer (or sony changed a few things since last i checked and it performs good that way now)<br />
<br />
That covers...just about all the basics. Don't forget to group with other people every now and then :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and never go to POK either heh, I can do bazaar ten times better than POK for some reason when 2 windowing EQ, not sure why, considering bazaar lags ten times worse when I have one copy going.</div></div><hr />
