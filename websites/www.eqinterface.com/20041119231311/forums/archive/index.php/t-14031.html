<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you know, I think Nexus portals and PoK books have spoiled you most of the players...  I still like to take the boat (when they work)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jethal</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the people who've joined the EQ community in the last year or so want it fast fast fast.<br />
<br />
I still remember maxing my Sence Heading on the boat from Freeport to Butcherblock.. now there's no reason to do either.<br />
<br />
What used to take 20 minutes, now only 1 minute.<br />
Honestly, I long for the old days sometimes where you could take your time.. in many ways, the game was so much more fun then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qinadwen</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Talesin and Jethal - it has taken some of the old charm out of the game with all these portals and stones, and not to mention, removed the need for wizard and druid ports. The new PoK stone to Gunthak will not help this. I think I will also try to take the boats more - although it is tempting to use the gnomes, as they are up all the time on my server.<br />
And after using some 14 days trying to get my Sense Heading up from 1 (at lvl 45, which is very hard) just to see all get it at 200 as a default bummed me a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done it the hard way too; I remember hitting sense heading non stop, I was lvl 40 when i got it to 200 and was stoked.  I also played for a year with just basic eq before i got any expansions.  I just think it would be nice to have a magi port.  No sense in running across 5 zones if you could just go there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also agree. Iam so tired of hear peaple say it to hard. Dam i ran a 3 lvl rog from kelethin to halas. Didnt know right where the zone connection where. Why shuld this game be real easy. Whats wrong with runing to guntark. Crip it just sooo had ..:nana: <br />
<br />
Think it be nice to see real fixs not just crap for the children who play. Make them WORK for there lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm far from a child...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Camar</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I still remember taking my Lvl 1 (at the time) Ogre SK from Ogguk to Thurgadin, and then around to Kael.  I did the entire run on foot, no SoW, no porting, no invis item/potion.  Damn that was one scary-ass trip!<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you need to get to PoK fast from an LDoN camp it's not THAT far to hit a book.  From the BB camp there is one in zone, and 2 in the zone next to it.  From EC it's just a short jog over to Freeport.  When in Everfrost, yet again a book in the same zone.  If you can't put in enough effort to run around a bit and see the countryside....find a druid or wizard :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yasoldat</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have any idea how many times my ranger died on the qeynos to freeport run and that was back when SoW was still 39 for rangers?<br />
<br />
And after I reached 39, what happens, SoW is reduced to 30 for rangers. :(</div></div><hr />
