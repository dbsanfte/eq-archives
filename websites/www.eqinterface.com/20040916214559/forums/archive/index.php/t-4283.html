I play on a fairly high screen resolution but still loved having almost my entire screen available without windows blocking.  I have tried to contact the original author without results, so it would take me a bit to reconstruct the mod, but would be glad to invest all the effort if I get any kind of interest from people here....   <br />
I am an XML newb, but have never turned away from a challenge and it seems not many people like the spartan look for melee types.<br />
<br />
In particular, I am looking at combining a few mods to make the look complete, but the  mini is where I'll start.   <br />
<br />
I'll be looking over the next 24 hours or so to see if anyone cares before I delve into xml coding to update what was my favorite melee based UI.<br />
<br />
rest assured that the expanded target window would be a part oft this.  :) <br />
<br />
Sleep calls,  searched over 100 UI's today and decided it was time to make the ONE I could be happy with for my warrior.</div></div><hr />
