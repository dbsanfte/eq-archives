<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chinghis</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I'm stumped. I found a nice BigBankWindow that I like - one with different labels for Quest items, Tradeskills, etc., so you can organize your bank. But... there's a button labelled &quot;Change.&quot; I click it, and nothing in particular seems to happen. I've seen other references to the Change button, but can't figure out what it does. Is this somehow related to the fact that there's not a shared platinum slot, either?!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chinghis</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's it?  So... if I have a few hundred coppers, couple hundred silvers, etc., and click that button, it will make them into the appropriate number of plat and gold?  I always just do that manually....<br />
<br />
Hm, thanks. Going to have to change the window anyway, since there doesn't seem to be a shared slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now if I could just get it to move all ym coins out of inventory and into the bank too.  8)</div></div><hr />

Click it once, and you should have all plat, basically, and less than 10 each of gold, silver, and copper.  It's very cool, and it works not only on the coins in your bank but also the coins in your inventory.</div></div><hr />

But since reading this post, I tried it and was pleasantly surprised at its effectiveness in quick coin change. Thanks for instilling me to use it! :D</div></div><hr />
