<br />
A while back, I posted this idea in the Wishlist forum, hoping that maybe it would someday find it's way into EQ's UI system.  So far it hasn't so I'll pitch the idea in a more active forum. :)<br />
<br />
If you LIKE this idea, please go in-game and /feedback your supoprt by requesting that this be added at some point.  I can see it as being nothing but beneficial, especially to buffer classes.<br />
<br />
There should be an EQType for Groupmembers' Classes and levels, so in the Groupwindow beside the name, that information can be shown.  For example:<br />
<br />
Effa       65/ENC<br />
=============== 100%<br />
<br />
Leezard    64/SHM<br />
===========     64%<br />
Etc......<br />
<br />
This would be a benefit to us buffers, since as it is now, I'll LFG, get a group, join them and say &quot;Classes?&quot; or &quot;Melee aye for haste&quot; etc... It's information that should be readily known (the same info is available in raid window), and shouldn't need /whotarget macros just to find out.<br />
<br />
It should be simple enough. Just the addition of some EQTypes to handle the new items.  If enough people /feedback the idea in-game, I'd hope that it will be added so that we can use it in our UIs.<br />

The request was moved to Wishlist. lol.... mods you can delete this post I guess, since the Wishlist forum moves rather slowly and if you look down a few threads, my old post is right there. :)<br />
<br />
Tried to delete, but won't let me. More than likely since it was moved by a mod.<br />
