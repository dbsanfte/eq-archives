<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay, I have finally finished most of the .xml files for the UI to be placed and fucntion as I desire.  Now I want to get down to re-skinning the UI.<br />
<br />
Some of the stuff I want to do I would assume I just edit the windows_pieces tga's.  can I directly edit them (load up in photoshop and paint new look over top) or do I have to creat from scratch?<br />
<br />
Also, how do you determine what piece is what?  I have looked at the &quot;key&quot; presented in the info vault, but it doesn't really seem to make sense to me as much as saying with text what pieces are for what.  The key is good, just some instances of the color coding don't seem to match up (of course, I'm tired, so it may just be me).<br />
<br />
An example for what I want to do is make the HP bar into an arrow (the kind you launch).  basically leave the red and green parts alone, but instead of just a bar, it has a head and fletchings.  Would I need to make a special file for that or just edit it in Windows_Pieces_01?<br />
<br />
thanks for any answers :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not realy HP bar spacific, but if you wanted to create a new tga file, you can place your HP bar into there and basically create a whole new bar template just for the HP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so then I could just &quot;draw&quot; over top of the bar section to make the graphic i wanted, save it, then all would function wonderfully?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In theory, yes.<br />
<br />
Just keep the image the same size as the current bars, and make sure you save it with a new alpha channel.<br />
<br />
Then, it'll work. :)</div></div><hr />
