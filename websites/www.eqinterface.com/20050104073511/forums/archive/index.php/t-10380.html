<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dyermaker</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had been using a UI mod for the Group window which has started having problems. I have looked for something that melds the playerinfo and group windows as well for some time, but to no avail. I do not recall where I ob<br />

Some additional modifications that would be even better for me:<br />
<br />
- HP, Mana and STA bars the same size. Has always looked awkward to me the way it is.<br />
<br />
- I have seen an F2-F6 identifier for group members for easier targetting. I like that, but only if it could be added just before the player name and be the same color.<br />
<br />
- Needs the button for the LFG tool. That appears to be one of the things the UI is choking on. Which is unfortunate, because I always use the /lfg command instead of the button anyway.<br />
<br />
As you can tell, I like uniformity. Please no extra colors. I like the white text unless an attribute is adjusted (red debuff, green buff). The less attention the window attacts, the better.<br />
<br />
And I would like to thank everyone in advance for any assistance they might be able and willing to provide. So many of the UIs are amazing, that I could very easily spend all my time playing with them all day. I have the greatest respect for all your XML skills.</div></div><hr />
