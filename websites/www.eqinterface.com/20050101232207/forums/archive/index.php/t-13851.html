So, if one wants to use EQW we have to use an old version on some of the Everquest files.<br />
<br />
With the latest patch (5/26) it would seem that the problem was fixed.  They added a toggle button for Full Screen / Windowed mode.  I attempted to load up two instances of EQ and the first one came up fine.  The second one (on a different drive) loaded and patched fine also.  But, when you go in and switch it to windowed mode, if you try to minimize and switch to the other (main) screen again, it appears to be black.  You can hear sound, cast spells, ETC, but you cannot see anything going on.  At least, that is my experience.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else attempted to do what I have done with the new patches?  Run two instances of Everquest on the same PC, and if so...what results did you get?  I mean, I pay for two accounts... I bought two hard drives, pay for 3.0mb DSL so I can play the accounts together, and so far I can't.  *weeps*<br />
<br />
If anyone has any suggestions / fixes for this issue, please feel free to post them here.  I hope I am not the only one.  =)<br />
<br />
Thank you all...<br />
