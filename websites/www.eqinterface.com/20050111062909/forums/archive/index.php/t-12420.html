<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's done by editing offline.  Much like adding symbols to chat-hotkeys.  <br />
<br />
It's hokey, it's not nice, and I will not explain how to do it in more detail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well said Lothay! That's just another way to scam individuals to buy a worthless item by making it look like its a great deal, but in reality, more expensive than what its really worth.<br />
<br />
This kind of scam is up there with the casino's and the casters of the RoMT (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17041). Pure and utter annoyances.</div></div><hr />

I just wanted it to screw around with my friends and be like HEY look at my SUPER DUPER SWORD ... and... yeah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt neither Zantaklawz nor Lothay felt you had intentionally malicious aims towards learning this ability. <br />
<br />
The sad fact is that this ability was discovered BECAUSE some people were trying to develop a way to maliciously scam unattentive EQ players.  So more honest players in the know tend to have rather hot opinions on the practice, regardless of intent.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with harmless fun between friends, but the potential for abuse is there, regardless of a person's best intentions.  Please don't take it personally.  :D<br />

<br />
I just didn't feel the need to explain this hack in a public forum.   See, if I tell two friends, and they tell two friends... pretty soon it's on every Hax0r EQ web-site. <br />
<br />
So, no, I wasn't angry at you or anything, I just don't think it's a good idea to teach people to do something naughty. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, nor was I. Its fine to mess around with friends that way. Its just the melicious individuals out there trying to ruin the game for others by taking advantage of a hack (as benign as it is) that irk me with this stuff.</div></div><hr />
