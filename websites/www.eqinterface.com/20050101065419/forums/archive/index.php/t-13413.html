<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nerakas</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, I downloaded a few files that go in the storywindow..(faction, tradeskillall-in-one v2, storyresearchplus, storyresearch, storyepicguides, storylevel, and foofyspells) for in game stuff.<br />
<br />
Here's my problem:<br />
<br />
First, I downloaded storylevel and put it in my custom ui folder (correct path) and when I pulled up alt+n, it wasnt there, so I downloaded foofyspells instead, thinking I could probably only have 1 at a time, Foofy works. So I got to thinking (great for a newb lemme tell ya) that maybe you can have more than 1 at a time, so I went back to the downloads and saw in some peoples pics that they had theirs plus Foofy's (hence why I d/led so many) now my problem is that only Foofy's comes up, none of the others do. No errors (rest of UI works fine) I just cannot get the other storywindow stuff to come up...any help would be appriciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nerakas</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, I've unziped the files to everquest\storyline\ and still having the same issues...foofy is comming up, but none of the others....do I need to delete the ones SoE put in there or does that matter? &lt;--complete noob to EQUI's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kernan</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any storyline that shows up in the story window has a file in the /storyline folder whose title looks like this:<br />
<br />
storyTitle.txt<br />
<br />
(may just have the title storyTitle if you have the viewing of file extensions turned off)<br />
<br />
Also make sure to scroll down in the story window... some mods have a modified or created date which is older than the SOE storylines and so will appear much farther down the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kernan</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took a look at the storyLevel mod and when I open up the .zip file, the mod is down inside another folder named 'storylevel'.<br />
<br />
You should look inside the /storylevel folder in your own /storyline folder and move the file named 'storylevel' and the folder named /levels to the /storyline folder so the structure is like this:<br />
<br />
/storyline<br />
...storylevel.txt<br />
.../levels<br />
<br />
not like this:<br />
<br />
/storyline<br />
.../storylevel<br />
......storylevel.txt<br />
....../levels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nerakas</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, thank you both Kernan and Jentraal for all of your help. <br />
<br />
Now, I have Foofy's working along with StoryLevels, but the Epics, Research, and Faction arent working...for epics, in my folder (this is going to be long post) the structur is <br />
<br />
EverQuest\Storyline*\Epic**<br />
<br />
(note * has the main StoryEpic.txt file and ** has the .txt files with the classes, ie: StoryBard.txt)<br />
<br />
Research- <br />
<br />
EverQuest\Storyline*\Research**<br />
<br />
(note same as above..* signifies StoryResearch.txt location and ** signifies the StoryNecromancer (and classes) .txt files)<br />
<br />
Faction <br />
<br />
EverQuest\Storyline*\Faction**\a-z<br />
<br />
(note this one is different because of the multipul factions. StoryFaction.txt is in EverQuest\Storyline\ and then when opening folder named &quot;Faction&quot; there are .txt files labled a-z, now, you have subfolders labeled a-z so it looks like this path<br />
<br />
EverQuest\Storyline\Faction\A <br />
EverQuest\Storyline\Faction\B <br />
<br />
And so on. Within those subfolders are names of faction types ((ie. banker, brownies, bloodgills, etc etc)) which to me would seem correct)<br />
<br />
Those are the other 3 storylines I have that I downloaded from eqinterface.com that are not showing up on my Story Window in game. Hope this helps guys.<br />
