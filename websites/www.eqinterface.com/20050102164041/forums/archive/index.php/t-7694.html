<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swagg</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well... ive gone through the 7 steps listed in the sticky, ive followed the FAQ, ive tried everything suggested in the Readme, and ive tried several other UIs... i have had NO luck and this is driving me crazy.<br />
the following are responses to the 4 questions in the readme of the help section<br />
1. the ui im trying to use is Quartz1_6 and is found here http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=183<br />
2. i downloaded the file, the proceded to unzip them into the UI folder into a folder.  i checked and made sure that they were not located in a subfolder.  i then ran eq and tried to use /loadskin Quartz true.  this gave me the response of the screen freezing for a moment, then returning to my normal interface.  after this i checked my eqclient file for the two lines, which were missing.  i added them, check if things were working...still no luck.  i then proceded to try EVERY possible explination listed and searched the forums, and STILL no luck.<br />
3. only error listed is UIErrorLog created at Tue Feb 04 22:41:00 2003<br />
4. i have no idea what i am doing wrong, but i feel like there must be some stupid mistake that is causing me to be unsuccessful with this. any ideas are apreciated.<br />

I have seen people have multiple Everquest folders becuase sony made a mistake in their install scripts. Some people have a /program files/everquest and a /program files/sony/everquest/. Right click on your Everquest Icon and choose &quot;properties&quot; then look at the path.<br />

At the very least you should be getting errors in the uierrors.txt that say its using default xml. Just typeing /loadskin blahblah should put some text into the uierrors file.</div></div><hr />
