The cursor is very well done and drawn, no doubt...I just like simple arrow pointers though.  Any help is appreciated, and I love your UI. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katn</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure I can make it, that it doesn't use the bst curser..I'll post the download for you tomorrow..running late :(  gotta go to work (work 3rd shift) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katn</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe its np ;)<br />
<br />
Just copy and paste the xml files here that I give you to the UI folder ;)  <br />
<br />
Let me know if it works..this should get rid of the bst pointer and use the default pointer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lazaru5</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if this is still only available in 1152x864, or will you be re-releasing it for the other resolutions in the forseeable future?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeon</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, first off love the ui. Just have one request not sure how doable it is but is there anyway you can make the spell cast bar horizontal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katn</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes on both!  hehe<br />
<br />
I'm working on some graphical errors that I saw, which hopefully won't take me to long..then I'm going to be making it for resolutions 1024 by 768, 1152 by 864, and 1280 by 1024...maybe others going to see how it goes with those reso's first since those seem to be the most used ;)<br />
<br />
Then I have thought about making a horizontal spell bar ...and that if everything goes to plan should come up soon also ;)<br />
<br />
Also planned some things for the spell bar which I am going to try to do, is add a spell book icon that is animated..I have been having, slightly a hard time doing that..but I'm hoping to get that working also.<br />
<br />
<br />
So expect some updates soon hehe ;)</div></div><hr />

Thanks and keep up the good work.:D</div></div><hr />
