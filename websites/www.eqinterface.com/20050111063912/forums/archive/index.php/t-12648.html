<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simonz</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the GoD patch, my current UI has issues with the tradeskill containers and stuff...  the UI isn't super special.. just the default UI with a different player window (includes HP/Mana/XP percentages at the right side and current/max HP at the bottom) which is only slightly larger than the default player window.  Also, it has the old spell gems for druids...<br />
  Even though I tried to put in a directory just the player window and the spell gem graphic files, and assume it will grab the rest off the default UI, it still does not seem to want to work.  Player window is okay, the spell gems defaults to the default ones.<br />
  Just a request if anyone can help me with this and has an updated Druid old spell gem UI... the one I was using is either from 2002 or 2003 in the spell gems section.   Thanks in advance if anyone is able to create/update this simplistic UI...  :D</div></div><hr />
