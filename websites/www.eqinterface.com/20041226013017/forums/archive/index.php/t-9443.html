I love the idea and look.<br />
<br />
Would be neat to see the buff bar and hottbuttons evolve and soon ( hint hint )<br />
<br />
<br />
I am using a classic UI by taryn ( tablets guy ) so this would be a totally new ui for me.<br />

Can't wait to see more.</div></div><hr />

ALso any other stats going to be part of it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

LOOKS SWEET<br />

Wouldn't mind an email to help beta test it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teannas</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was just thinking maybe instead of the spellbar obviously for melee<br />
<br />
you could add all of your cots from inventory, so bags are there etc.<br />
<br />
That would rock<br />
<br />
and possibly some more stats such as STR STA AND HP</div></div><hr />

Good point, never thought about melee hehe.. I did put in HP just underneath the player window in top left corner.. as for other stats I'm not sure.. Maybe have a double window with stats/spells..</div></div><hr />

I especially like the personalized pic next to the hp/mana bar, very true to WoW.  And that map is off the hook.  The gauges for the group window are awesome too.  Very nice job guys, I can't wait for this one.</div></div><hr />

I think it could be scaled down a bit, looks out of place.  Other than that it is perfect!</div></div><hr />

The CHP/MHP looks a little out of place and hard to see on the player window. what about adding a   3rd &quot; blank bar&quot; and placing the hp atk ac on it, and maybe a thin stamina/casting  bar between the hp mana bars??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kthist</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe scale the buff windows down a little, and add numbers... make it easy to change the portrait ;). Stats would be nice too... maybe scale the spell gems down a tid bit and put the stats there or a clicky item spot. wooo sexy ui :)</div></div><hr />

Drakah's started working on it, I sent him off the latest graphics, but he's working getting level 65 atm too.. give the man a break! :D<br />

Oh that wasn't Halls of Honor, that was Temple of Marr (Halls of Honor part B), you get access to it by completing 3 trials in HOH. The mob was Lord Mithaniel Marr :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kedrin027</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the UI man but i would like you to make some things different in some ways if you dont like my thoughs it is ok it is your UI :P<br />
<br />
1) IMO the heath and mana bard are too small for the Warcraft look it would be cool to make the heath bar the same size as the groups heath. and make the mana bar a little smaller<br />
<br />
2) im a ranger and and melee knows that the stamina bar helps and is needed. so can you please add this it there some were. it would be cool to see <br />
<br />
HEALTH<br />
MANA<br />
STAMINA<br />
<br />
with health being the biggest then mana would get a little big smaller, then stamina would be a bit smaller then that<br />
<br />
3) it would be cool if you but the target window under the groups window.. you can try to make them look better by putting a circle nect the the targen window and have the Color code thing to be inside it so it help people know by color and by % and by bar how much health the target has<br />
<br />
4) i would love to see STATS in there some were i see the Saves but no stats would be cool to some how put them in there<br />
<br />
for me it is easy to see it like this<br />
<br />
STR        WIS         AC<br />
STA        INT          ATK<br />
AGI        CHA<br />
DEX<br />
<br />
and not all in one line<br />
<br />
5) #'s on the buffs<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks for reading my thoughts. GOOD WORK</div></div><hr />

But, either way I cant wait for this UI to be out... /droooooooooooooooooooooool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The player window is pretty much finished and working great, you can even put in a custom portrait of your char :D We'll probably include a bunch of default portraits for people who don't have Photoshop.<br />
<br />
He also said the group window is just about finished. After that the rest of the UI should go smoothly (except maybe the map window)<br />
<br />
And for the guy who was concerned, I'm fairly certain this UI will be out before WoW comes out :p</div></div><hr />

Drakah,<br />
<br />
I know you are getting inundated over this UI by now... so, rather then PM you over this, I'll just post this message here and if you get a chance to read it or respond, great! Otherwise, keep up the amazing work.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to my point... I love the UI, what I have seen of it so far, but know I may not be able to use it because I play Mac EQ not PC EQ. With that said... when you are completed, or even before then, I would be more then willing to help in making a slightly downgraded version of this fantastic project that would work for us on the Mac side and some of those who are still only playing earlier expansion of EQ (not that there are many).<br />
<br />
So, if there is anything I can do to help in bringing this to fruition, please do not hesitate to call on me.<br />
<br />
Caio!</div></div><hr />

Actually, all I would need shrunk would be the strip along the bottom.  Everything else is a little large but I can certainly live with it.<br />

<br />
Go into the Portraits folder and copy the half elf male/female file to the Warcraft folder. Then delete or rename current Player_Picture file and rename the half elf file to Player_Picture.<br />
<br />
Or check the readme file with the UI :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightDiver</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cant find a way to toggle the display in game yet, but through some experimenting I found out how to at least change it before loading EQ.  <br />
<br />
If you look in your Warcraft ui folder, you'll find 3 files: EQUI_HotbuttonWnd, AAXP of EQUI_HotbuttonWnd, and EXP version of EQUI_HotbuttonWnd.  By deleting the basic file and copying the EXP version, I was able to switch the display to EXP after renaming the copy and removing the 'copy of EXP version of' part of the file name so that it was simply called EQUI_HotbuttonWnd.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, and if someone knows a better way of doing this, please let me know. Just having the EXP showing is great for my alts that dont have AA yet, but it would be nice to be able to toggle for my main depending on which Im concentrating on at the moment without having to close the game, change the files, and then restart the game.</div></div><hr />

However, I find that I'm going to have to switch back to another UI because of the lack of toggle between AA and EXP.  Yes, I know you can change files before loading EQ, but that really does nothing for me.  I like to toggle or see both bars so that I can tell where I am and/or switching to different alts I'd have to quit EQ and change files every single time.  Even if there could be a number value on the exp meter in the inventory menu it would help a bit.  I've used many many of the UIs and tested them for people.  I wouldn't call this a flaw, but a missed opportunity.  Is there anyone out there that can help to mod this with Drak's permission?  It would be fantastic to be able to toggle it but brainstorm and see what other options there are.<br />

I have a couple of problems and since im not a UI expert I am hoping some one here can walk me through.<br />
<br />
1.  When I try to change the display reaolution I get a window asking if I want to keep this resolution.  This is great but there is no buttons to click on.  I get the same thing when trying to loot no drop items.  I get the box asking if I want to loot that item but no boxes to click on.  <br />
<br />
2.  I have no gauges in the map and the map is really small.  Is that just the way it was made?<br />
<br />
Please let me know how I can solve the button problem  Ive already lost out on some loot that I couldnt pick up.</div></div><hr />
