<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phyxius</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, I've been working on a new UI for a few days now, It's not a complete set, the UI is currently based on:<br />
<br />
EQUI_GroupWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_TargetWindow.xml<br />
<br />
And all of the Spellbook-graphics I've barrowed from the NoTears UI (With permission from the author).<br />
<br />
The UI mostly focuses on four main colors:<br />
Green, black, orange and blue - I went for The Matrix kinda style.<br />
<br />
It can be downloaded and used here: http://stx.fobie.net/eq/phyxgui/index.php <br />
Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />

Nice mix.  Just so that you know, and maybe you do but didn't mention it, both the spell book and spell bar, are orignal t.king artworks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krylosis</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that the link should have been removed till credit given properly, but I think that the poster should also go to those  he got this from and make sure they are crediting this work properly.  I don't think that either did this on purpose, but it does need to be properly credited. :)  Thomas... love your work!  keep it up!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No worries I'm already over it, I was initially vexed but then I realized that I don't really enforce or expect people to give me credit all the time, I merely request that people do, I want people to have a good experience with my art, not feel like I am going to police it or litigate everytime &quot;t.king&quot; is removed from a piece of art, as long as money isn't involved with my art I don't mind, so if you want to restore the link go ahead it doesn't bother me, but I can't speak for Vert.<br />
<br />
*Update*<br />
<br />
I did speak with the person from that site and they have fixed it and apologized, they indended that page for their guild only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phyxius</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there.<br />
<br />
First off, I'd like to apologise for all this, fact is that I sent an email to the author of which I _thought_ was the real author of the artwork and code, considering he did'nt give any credits - so how would I know? - The issue has been fixed, I've given tking credits for his nice work on my site.<br />
<br />
Hope this clears it all up.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />

Anyways, I hope to see this UI you made soon, I didn't see it before it was yanked :)<br />
