Please Note:  No fear that it has a blue background, it is actually transparent, I just happened to be facing a somewhat blue coloured wall.Note: No fear that it has a blue background, it is actually transparent, I just happened to be facing a somewhat blue coloured wall.</div></div><hr />

The first buff is placed correctly with the name below, but the 2nd buff icon pops up below the 1st covering the writing of the 1st and then the name is sent to the side. Strange..oh well, lemme know if ya have a fix fer this. Thx</div></div><hr />

Thanks Remelio.  I wonder who I get my inspiration from?  :)<br />
<br />
There are actually supposed to be small borders around the icons.  I see that the blue isn't showing up.  I haven't yet had a chance to actually play EQ since I modified this, to discover if the red ones will show or not.  If the red ones do show up, I'll run with it the way it is.  If they don't, however, I'll try to figure out why not and see if I can figure out the coding so that they do.</div></div><hr />

Noid86, did you check the two settings I suggested?</div></div><hr />

It was there, just off the screen.  I have a &quot;bakup&quot; folder I always use when I change a file.  I /loadskin bakup 1 then moved my buff window to the middle of my screen.  Then I reloaded the directory with the new mod /loadskin druid 1 and the buff window showed up.  It didn't turn out working for me, doesn't seem compatible with the Sokol/Vert stuff.   But that is how I got it to show up at least.</div></div><hr />

The problem I was running into when I tried to make it three lines long is simply a case of spacing.  In order to make the name three lines long, I have to make the entire window a bit longer, which leads to needing to make the buff &quot;icon&quot; larger to prevent them from &quot;stacking&quot; on the screen (see the problem referred to in the second post on the thread, by Blacklord_sith).  It can be done, but it's a lot of futzing around, and for most spells, two lines is sufficient.  If you want, I'll try to do it, but it won't be quick, unfortunately.<br />

<br />
There are two ways you can go about this.<br />
<br />
The first is to open up the EQUI_BuffWindow.xml file in your custom directory.  Scroll to the bottom of the document and find the line that says:<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Transparent&gt;true&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
<br />
Change it to:<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
<br />
It will now use the background that you have on the rest of your windows (like chat windows, etc), and you can set the alpha channels (normal and faded) where you want them.<br />
<br />
The second option is the optional one I've just made, that has the buff background colour (red or blue) behind the text:<br />

<br />
Not too good with coding myself, but i encoutered something with some buff windows. They attatch the words to a side of the window. Was wondering you may be able to attach the words to the bottom of the window, and make the window adjustable to fix the the size probs. Course i might be completely off base and all this is meaningless ramble for all i know though :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remelio</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow I like :)<br />
<br />
So much in fact I couldn't help but fiddle :)<br />
<br />
First thing I noticed was.. I couldn't figure out where the heck the window was!  So I added a top border to the window to use to move it around.<br />
<br />
Next I pulled up the bottom edge a little bit and then pushed everything 5 pixels to the left to make it just the right size.<br />
<br />
Also the last 3 buffs (14,13,12) were off by a few pixels, I fixed this up too :)<br />
<br />
:nana:Enjoy!:nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remelio</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All the complaints of &quot;now I have no buff window&quot; - here is what happened:<br />
<br />
the first few buffs are on the RIGHT side of the window (which is pretty long) if you had your buff window over on the right side of the screen, its now way off screen (hence why I made a mod to put the border on top so you can move it around)<br />
<br />
Simply move the window where you want the upper left part of it to be first, and then load her mod, or just load up my version of her mod :)</div></div><hr />

Big icons and text to go with it at the top of the screen.  Now there's no excuse to have a buff drop since you can't miss it blinking.  right on<br />
<br />
I'm voting for 3 lines of text to be worked in to call it perfect.  EIther way, I'm gonna use it; hehe.  Thanx for your work</div></div><hr />

After seeing most of my buffs were like<br />
Symbol<br />

I decided to squeeze that third line in there ;)<br />

Enjoy!  Its only about 10 pixels taller than the last version.</div></div><hr />

He has added a very small (like 5 pixel) line across the top of it so that it doesn't get &quot;lost&quot;, and figured out how to make it fit three lines of text instead of only two the way I originally had it.<br />
<br />
Try grabbing it, if you didn't already, from Page 2 of this thread (about 4 posts above your original one, if I remember correctly).<br />
<br />
The lag in game ... I don't know.  I know lots of folks have been having problems with them, but darned if I can figure it out, sorry.</div></div><hr />
