Is this the place I've been looking for ? If all they say is true I'll drop EQ in a heart beat.</div></div><hr />

Just because EQ was first doesn't mean you have to label Guild Wars as a remake or bash it before you've even played it.  I've only played EQ for 9 months.  It wouldn't be hard to pick up and move to another game; but since quild wars will be free, i won't have to.  Can play both.  I'm sure guild wars will be a refreshing change to the mmporg scene.</div></div><hr />
