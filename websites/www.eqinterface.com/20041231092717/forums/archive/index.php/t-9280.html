<br />
But for the future the other Featured Artist will help, and here are the things we will be looking for.<br />
<br />
1. Original Work If all the artwork in your UI is orginal to you, then this is one of the big things. Coding can only be &quot;so&quot; creative, so having an orginal look is number one. Some Artist work specifically with an Artist (such as tking) and as long as your work is dedicated to that artist and they are ok with it, then its good for us.<br />
<br />
2. Quick Patches Being able to patch your mods quickly after a server patch is another big boon. <br />
<br />
3. Helpful All of our featured artist not only help with thier mods, but you will find them answering questions for other mods, or just questions in general. this is the last item that we looked for in our first featured artist.<br />
<br />
Soooooo What do they get for thier work?<br />
<br />
An email address at EQInterface.com or EQGui (thier choice)<br />
<br />
A dedicated forum that only they can see, that allows them to discuss things privately before bringing it to the public (P.S. they should read this more often heheheheh)<br />
<br />
A dedicated section in the Download Library.<br />
<br />
Our undying gratituded. <br />
<br />
So, if you want to be looked at as a future* Featured Artist, then look at the above info, and talk to some of the current Artist. and when we start looking again, maybe you can get in!<br />
<br />
* We are not actively recruiting Featured Artist at the moment, but will soon <br />
