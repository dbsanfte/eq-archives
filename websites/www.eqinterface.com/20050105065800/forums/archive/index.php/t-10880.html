<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raidr</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded Kronas' ui named Shaman24feb.zip <br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/download.php?s=&amp;id=1433<br />
<br />
I saved the .zip file to my desktop, then extracted all the files to a folder named ShamanUI in my uifiles folder.<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest Trilogy\uilfiles\ShamanUI<br />
<br />
I logged on my Shaman and typed /loadskin.  I got the message to use either the default or ShamanUI.  I chose ShamanUI and the screen freezes, like it should.  Use .INI was also clicked.  But when the screen comes back to life, I still have the default UI.<br />
<br />
I get no error messages at all.  I have tried this with my Shaman and Ranger and the same thing happens with both.  I have nothing in my UI Errors log.  I have searched the forums and this seems to be the only problem listed with this UI, so I guess I am special.  Where am I making my mistake?  <br />

<br />
if you didn't here are some tips to at least get errors to show up.<br />
<br />
1.  delete the UIerrors.txt all together and let it write a new one.<br />
<br />
2. open your UI_Character_01.ini file and change the UI skin you see in there to the ShamanUI..<br />
<br />
3. open your EQClient.ini and change the same setting in there.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll try and think of other tips..  but try those :-)</div></div><hr />

I triple checked the folders to make sure I only had one folder in the UIFiles folder.  Hope that your other ideas help out.  Correct me if I am wrong, but if I change the Ui settings in EQClient, won't that make this the default UI for all my chars?<br />
<br />
Will post back in a min or two with results.<br />

It just reset to the default UI.  I tried to /loadskin and then check ShamanUI again, but didn't work.  And no error messages.<br />

That is one I will always disagree with.  If there is a problem with a specific UI skin, having it be the default skin for EQ means that (sometimes) folks won't even be able to get logged in to any character.  If they leave this set at Default (as per my recommendations in my Things To Check First (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5231) thread), they can at least get in to their character select screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raidr</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, none of these things seem to work.  I checked my UIError.txt log and there is nothing there.  I would have liked to have this UI, but I don't want all this hassle.  Found another one that works for me, but still would have liked this one instead.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was absolutely nothing in your UIError.txt log file?  Not even a line with the creation date?  That makes no sense whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Are you sure you don't have two EQ directories and you might have been getting the UIError.txt log file from the other one?</div></div><hr />

but I am afraid I don't have the time today to do a total fix.<br />

just overwrite your existing XML files with the ones in this zip and it should run ok</div></div><hr />

Thing is, I downloaded and used the UI last night.  The UI runs fine and this log was created this morning when I was logged on.<br />
<br />
I have checked and I only have one EQ directory.  Thanks Taleisin for the update.  I will wait until you get the time to update it.  I have time.  lol<br />
