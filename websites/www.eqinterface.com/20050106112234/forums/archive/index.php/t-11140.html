None seem to work.  When I load the UI skin I alway get booted back to default skins.<br />
<br />
I searched this forum, and found some advice suggesting that I should test each skin before trying to mix anything.  All works well before putting everything in the same directory.<br />

Thanks,<br />

Up untill now the pet window has been fine since I never kept a pet long enough to worry about buffs.  No with DC I find I am constantly letting the buffs wear off my pet or am on the buff window when I need to get it to back off.  I already have all 10 hotkeys on the page I use filled so dont want to make two new ones for pet commands.  I have found other pet window downloads that have the commands - buffs - pet health in % ( very nice also ) when I try to add them to my current vert the EQ client crashes. This is the one I am currently trying to mix into &lt;&lt;Vert26e-Cannabis &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;BL_PetWindow_with_Percentage.zip&gt;&gt;<br />

Thank you.<br />

Unfortunatly this crashed my client when I tried it.  I usually use &amp; love Ocean Spray, but as a Mage, having to click off the action windows to see the buffs is a real pain.  Any chance to get this to work, preferably for Ocean Spray?<br />
