I am a total goof when it comes to working with the ui files, and here is the problem.<br />
I downloaded several different ui things, like spellbook, targetbars, petwindows, inventory´s all that kinda things, and i wanted to make a ui with all of those for my favorite own made ui to use (you know, unpack all in the same new ui folder).<br />
But it won´t work.<br />
I read the info text files, with changing certain keychains like different mouse.tga etc, but some don´t contain txt files.<br />
I unpacked my favorites in a new folder and loaded it, it didn´t work, also tried that with adding the files from default ui map (or even from working ui´s) so that i have my favorites, and other files that aren´t there but are in the default map, i copy´d them, also didn´t work...i really don´t know what to do or how to make it work so that i have my own favorite ui (with spellbar, spellbook, inventory, target window, pet window, hotbuttons, mousepointer and playerinfo.<br />
please some explain to me in the most simple english how to make it work, or send me an email at kittybramsasha@hotmail.com.<br />
I am dutch, and I understand english really well, but somehow when it comes to ui editing etc, I get lost.<br />
<br />
Would be greatfull for any usefull help.<br />

<br />
There is also a forum area on here that gives you a ton of info about UI's, etc. <br />
<br />
When UI's first came to be, I stalked that forum for help and knowledge :D</div></div><hr />

Really sorry, but this is my last hope to get an answer to my problem.<br />

<br />
Open each UI step by step.  Don't smash them all in one folder.  Make a folder for each piece.  Make sure each piece works on it's own.<br />
<br />
After you are sure that all the UIs work, start putting them together.  Start with 2, then add the third after you are sure the first two don't conflict.<br />
<br />
What I'm guessing... <br />
1.  You have one or more UIs that aren't working by themselves due to changes in the code<br />
2.  You have one or more UIs that are conflicting.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know it's long and cumbersome, welcome to the world of custom UIs.  And when Sony patches a major patch, expect your UI to &quot;break&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I had some issues as to exactly which UI skin was causing my UI not to load, I simply emptied out my UI custom folder and added a new piece (i.e., inventory UI skin) one at a time. Then I would loadskin'd it. If it worked then I Loadskin'd default, added another skin piece and repeated the process until I found the culprit that was causing my UI not to load. It takes a while, but now with the advent of EQ being able to become a window this process is much faster now. Just my take.</div></div><hr />

Thank you 2 for the help :)<br />
