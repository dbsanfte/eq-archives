<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">infinity9</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like this version.  Very clean with great graphics.  A vert-tking mix.  Came out nice.  Great job!<br />
<br />
:cool: i9</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dedara put the original pieces together based on work by me and Remelio, and I've since replaced &quot;everything&quot; with my original artwork, if there are any Vert components -- I am totally unaware of them and would like to know what they are, in revision ( 3c ) can you tell me if there is anything derived from Vert? I'd just like to know out of curiosity, I took a look at all of the Vert UI's and I couldn't find any connections, but I haven't really followed the development of that UI so I could have missed something.<br />
<br />
When I first saw the way Dedara combined a clean UI with my graphics, I felt that the modern looking art needed to be replaced with my art to make everything blend together better, and some of the filigree had lost its clarity, so I went through and kept the concept of square titles and buttons since they totally matched the G2 square celtic spellbar -- I stylized the rest of the UI by replacing every last piece of art with my own originals to match, the result was a clean fantasy style UI.<br />
<br />
I'd like to add that Vert is an awesome UI, very clean and nicely layed out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. you need to update the screenshot though with all the revisions it looks strickingly different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/nod -- I did request a SS update, but that SS I posted is already outdated, I've been making so many changes lately.<br />
<br />
Thanks, this is what I believe to be an excellent blend of clean + functional controls and windows, with a nice fantasy feel that works well for both casters and melees, it fits a fantasy game very well.</div></div><hr />

i really liked the chatborder, that's why i used it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahhh that makes sense, by my revision 3c everything in that file had been replaced or redone, it was a basic skin-over default to begin with, I simply did the same thing but used my art.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Not that I'm an expert or anything, but I would bet that if you read the boards that the reason this UI has not been uploaded is because you chose &quot;complete sets&quot;.  To post a new UI under that category it needs to be 90% your own work I do believe.  If you would upload it under &quot;mix n match&quot; I bet it shows up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pending approval in the mix-n-match category</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agaroo</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">VERY nice work.<br />
<br />
Only 'issue' I noticed was in the hot buttons window.  Spells seem to be offset a bit ( to the left and up, ) where they overlap their colored border a little.<br />
<br />
I didn't play with the UI long, or I would have tried to track down the problem further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Parasite</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Besides the Issue with the Spellgems in the hotbuttons Window i also noticed that the Color Selection is a bit messed up... all colors have a blueish tint in them when i try to modify armor or window colors..<br />
<br />
But really great work all in all! First time i now finally use T.king and go away from Vert! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i noticed the tint window is a bit fubared, and checked on original skin as well, and it too has a brownish tint to it..<br />
<br />
can't figure it out, any help and i can update the zip files. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Parasite</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your hint that the original UI has a brownish tint gave the answer:<br />
the Problem is not in any XML file but in the TGA file itself!<br />
<br />
Here i made a red circle around the pixels which actually need to stay white so you get the proper colors on the colorselector:<br />
http://wishbringer.bei.t-online.de/parasite/window_pieces01.jpg<br />
<br />
This has to stay white then everything is ok with dyeing. :)<br />
<br />
Didnt look into the spellgem issue though because im an XML newb~ :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agaroo</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two lines are missing from each spellgem definition in the EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml file:<br />

    &lt;SpellIconOffsetX&gt;2&lt;/SpellIconOffsetX&gt;<br />
    &lt;SpellIconOffsetY&gt;2&lt;/SpellIconOffsetY&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can't mod the file and get it uploaded somewhere today, unless someone beats me to it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Change this definition in the EQUI_Animations.xml file:<br />
	&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_WhitePixel&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
			&lt;Texture&gt;window_pieces01.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
			&lt;Location&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;90&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;90&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;Size&gt;<br />
				&lt;CX&gt;1&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
				&lt;CY&gt;1&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It needs to point to a white pixel..<br />
<br />
Hope that helps..</div></div><hr />

<br />
very nicely done..<br />
<br />
Ver, you can upload a replacement version with the icon offset in the hotbutton windows and the color picker updates ontop of the current one (you will see &quot;update this file&quot;) and it will drop back into the que, (of course It wil get approved now that its in the correct category)<br />
<br />
my room-mate likes it..<br />
<br />
and as the current &quot;lead&quot; on vert with Sokol if there is anything left of vert, it would only be the modular looking borders.. but even thats a stretch... :)</div></div><hr />
