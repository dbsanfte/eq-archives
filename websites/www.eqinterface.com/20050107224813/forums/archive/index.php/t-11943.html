I recently installed a new hard drive and have everything working, but my hotkeys look like this. It reminds me of the combat abilities window needing the window pieces. Would the fix for it be similar?<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

The file they used to make graphics may have been overridden by the game with recent changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treage</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is an older Gena one, but it was working fine up until I did the reinstall the other day. One of the reasons I like this one so much is that its virtually patch proof. Other than when the combat abilities window was added, I haven't had any problems with it. Here's a link to where I got it from. I guess I could look around for another hotkey window.<br />

Patch proof?!?  How the heck can you refer to it as that?<br />
<br />
EQUI_Animations is modified.  That causes a crash during most UI patches.  Then, it is using window_pieces for the names of some of its files.  At the time the file was made, those names were not used by EQ, but now they are.  I think that is where your problem is.  The whole Mod will need to be redone, IMO.<br />

Sorry, wish I had better news.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I meant by virtually patch proof was that I haven't had an issue with it since before PoP came out. Every other UI I used before that would break almost every patch.</div></div><hr />
