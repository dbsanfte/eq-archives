<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mafoo</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After over a year i have returned! i have now release version 1.2 this is mainly a bug fix release to cope with interface changes.<br />
This thread is for the comments on this release as the old thread got archived.<br />
<br />
Please see the text file included in the mod for instructions, but i know i am asking to much so for the benifit of the 20 or so people that send me pm's saying how do i install/use it what does it do etc.<br />
<br />
Open the zip file and either read the zipfile comments or the included text file<br />
<br />
i will however include the version history here<br />
<br />
Version 1.3<br />
<br />
Added Mana and Stamina numbers!<br />
<br />
Version 1.2 <br />
<br />
added mafoo_playerwindow.tga to facilitate SOE's new attack highlight around the player info window<br />
window size is now 118 by 208 <br />
the background on the cast bar is now gone if you want it back goto line 737 and remove the coments &quot;&lt;!--&quot; and &quot;--&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
I seem to be missing the version 1.1 files (they included the playername in the player info window) if anyone has them i would apreciate a pm so we can arrange a transfer i will not give out my email address on a open forum (i hate spam)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mafoo</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i recived a few PM's asking when i will be looking at my Spell window and group window to update to 1.2.<br />
If i get a pm from someone that has the v1.1's as the ones i uploaded orginally are the 1.0's.<br />
I will update them to stop EQ complaining that they are out of date or incorrect. i think that i will also make the spell window have the book showing by default as i have now learnt that right clicking hte spell book lets you use spell sets (remember folks i have been away from game for over a year so i did not know when this feature came in.)</div></div><hr />

Is this what you are looking for?  I think it may be your 1.1 version.  I know I had edited one of your EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml files for personal use at one point, but I think this MAY be the original 1.1 version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zildjiann</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you considered adding AA Available / AA Spent to your Player Info Window?  I for one would love to have that summary info along with all the other goodness you have packed into here... sure that info is only a &quot;V&quot; keystroke away, but it would be so much better to see which Ping you were on at a glance from the main UI!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mafoo</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i choose not to put non battle related stats in it.<br />
i did consider removing the AA and exp bars</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akalee</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the UI Mafoos.  Been using your ui for like maybe 3yrs back now or more.  I love it.  One thing I noticed was that the red bar is not there anymore when attack is on.  I'm too used to not having that and it really affected my play.  Anyway you can add that back to your ui? Please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mafoo</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a look it seems to work on my own computer, please check you unpacked the tga file into the same directory!<br />
btw Version 1.3 is now out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akalee</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm still dont have the red circle from 1.3  My old one had the red circle but that was old one with no mana bar number.  I also have someone else on the same server that uses it and she's missing the red circle attack.  Version 1.3 only had 1 file to copy and paste to my custom.  I don't see any TGA file on version 1.3  Anyone can help please? or can attach what i'm mission so I can dl it so that I'm able to have the red attack bar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kagura</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also noticed that the attack indicator was missing.  I downloaded the zip file and unloaded it into the designated ui folder. I read your FAQ about the attack window indicator.  There is no mafoo_playerwindow.tga included in the 1.3 zip.  Other people probably see it because they had 1.2 and still have the tga file unfortunately i don't see it in the new zip.  This came up because my hard was wiped and i looked for a new UI.  I was using 1.2 but when eq got wiped i just put in 1.3.<br />
<br />
Would post the tga file but i cant figgure out how to upload...<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mafoo</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry i accedently missed the image file out, i have corrected this and uploaded version 1.3a (includeing the image</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sska</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have a question if your still around please say yes i upgraded to 1.3 and now the whole window flashes, anyway to just get the border to flash again the whole window flashing is for causing seziures thanks man</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mafoo</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just reemove the testure file will probably do what you wish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaltek</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I edited yer Spellwindow Mafoo if you want to go over it and make sure it looks good. Only problem is those without the new spellgem will see unknown eqtype133 in the 9th spell gem. I haven't tested this on live yet but it did work on beta.</div></div><hr />
