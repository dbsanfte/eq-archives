Had a few emails saying that they were having trouble logging in.  First let me suggest that you check to make sure you have cookies enabled.. If you register and don't get a confirmation email.. please email Us at activation@eqgui.com to get manually confirmed. Please email Us from the same email you put in your registration. Also include the name you used to register with.<br />
<br />
We have no found any specific error with the login proccess, sometimes it just  hiccups. thank you for the emails, if you get an error message. send that with your email to us.<br />
<br />
Also Announced that the Level Cap will be raised to 65 when PoP comes out in about 6 weeks (Oct 22, 2002 is current release date) read more about it HERE (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/articles.jsp?id=51678)<br />
