<br />
The researchers have harnessed what happens to water when it is pumped through tiny channels. <br />
<br />
&quot;What we have achieved so far is to show that electrical power can be directly generated from flowing liquids in microchannels,&quot; said Professor Larry Kostiuk from University of Alberta. <br />
<br />
The team says its &quot;electrokinetic&quot; battery could be further developed to provide a clean, non-polluting power source that could eventually drive small devices such as mobile phones. <br />
<br />
But some experts in the field have cast doubt over its potential as a useful source of power.<br />
