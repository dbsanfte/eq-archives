<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakonn</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here's my situation.  I was using Sean (FoH) 's UI, basically modded up myself (I'm no expert but I got it working).  It's been fine other than around patch times, until today's patch.<br />
<br />
First I logged in and found default UI was on.  Went to default UI directory, and copied the &quot;new&quot; (Not updated) files into my custom directory.  Reloaded skin, nothing happened (still default).<br />
<br />
I keep a backup of my last working UI, so I copied it back over the current one and reloaded (to copy the files 1 by 1 to find which was causing the bug)... upon hitting reload, EQ client crashed.<br />
<br />
Since that point, I can't even log into the default UI.  I've tried deleting default and repatching, that didn't help.  Tried logging alts (crashes after char select) to see if it was the zone files, they didnt work either.  I tried for 2 straight hours to find a way around it, or find a solution posted on the net, and I can't find one...<br />
<br />
Anyone know what will fix this? =/  (I'd prefer not to have to do a complete re-install, so checking first, but if that's the only option I guess I'll have to).<br />
<br />
P.S. I think I'll start using a regularly patched UI instead to solve this BS =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd already changed the one in Default, but didn't realise there was another UI entry in the charname_servername.ini file.<br />
<br />
Seems to be working now I think, at least I'll be able to catch the 2nd half of a time clearing lol.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!<br />
