<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orientis</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just installed Delta4 - like it, but as with many other UI's I've tried, it's just too damn big at 1024 x 768, and too damn small at 1280 x 1024.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons I downloaded it was because it had 1152 x 864 compatability, but I can't force the game to load it at that resolution.<br />
<br />
Tried: <br />
<br />
Setting it in options: Video ingame (but it isn't an option)<br />
Setting it in Options pre-login (but it isn't an option)<br />
Editing EQclient file from:<br />
<br />
[VideoMode]<br />
Width=1280<br />
Height=1024<br />
RefreshRate=72<br />
BitsPerPixel=32<br />
<br />
to<br />
<br />
[VideoMode]<br />
Width=1152<br />
Height=864<br />
RefreshRate=72<br />
BitsPerPixel=32<br />
<br />
..but once it loads the game, it has already reset it to 1280 x 1024. Is there any way I can suppress the Options setting changing the resolution from what I've saved in the eqclient file?<br />
<br />
Hepl em plz kkthnx etc.<br />
<br />
Computer specs:<br />
<br />
P4 2.53 Ghz<br />
768 MB RAM<br />
17inch LCD monitor<br />
3d Prophet 8500 Radeon card<br />
Windows XP (O how I hate it)<br />
<br />
Changing any hardware (or even xp, I just can't be bothered) isn't really an option.<br />
<br />
EDIT: been trying to fiddle around with windows resolutions, and no matter what I try, 1152 x 864 doesn't come up as an option with this monitor/card. Then again, 1280 x 1024 doesn't come up as an option either, but the game seems to manage that fine.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
useless info:<br />
The monitor driver tells windows what resolutions and refresh rates your monitor can handle. This driver is normaly stored on an eprom in your monitor and given to windows automaticly (PnP) when you plug in your monitor. However in the device manager you should be able to load a default driver that should allow you to try that resolution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suspect you're right. Messed around with drivers and the eqclient file a bit more last night, and actually got the 1152 resolution to stick, but it screwed up both EQ and my desktop since the game didn't recognise the edges of the screen.<br />
<br />
Will trawl through drivers to see if I can find one that works. Does anyone use a Samsung SyncMaster 570VTFT LCD monitor and know if this is possible?</div></div><hr />
