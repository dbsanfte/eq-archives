Last night it was brought to my attention by a non-eq player, i know this is hard to phatom but please stay with me, Everquest was brought up in last nights NYPD blue.  This even though i can't find a transcript would have to make it one of the top 10 shows on right now.  Mind you it was about rape and the guy said he was playing Everquest instead of doing a foul deed.  GO EVERQUEST its really not as horrible as they would like to make it.  Is this a tv station war?</div></div><hr />

I missed NYPD Blue the other night, because I was watching The West Wing or something. But from what i've heard, I would have gotten a huge kick out of that part of the episode, and I still find it hilarious. It goes to show how far EverQuest has intergrated into our society already, that it would be used for something like this--especially for something as humerous as an alabi for a TV murder. I don't think it was being bashed at all; in fact, people of lesser cognition might take the reference to mean that Everquest, in fact, stops people from commiting murder! Woo. Oi...it's late. :nana:</div></div><hr />

By the tv station war i simply meant that CBS basically bashed EQ.  While Nypd BLue (ABC) basically said we disagree with CBS its good to keep kids and adults (gotta include us in this) out of trouble.  Instead of being out on the roads, streets, and what not we are at home usually drinking and playing EQ.  That is what i meant by that as far as the &quot;war&quot; goes.  AND Keigh i wish it was 5 o'clock i got that crummy shift 2:30 -11pm.</div></div><hr />
