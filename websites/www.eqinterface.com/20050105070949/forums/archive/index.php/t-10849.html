<br />
What was whoever thinking when they created this messed up book? <br />
Im not talking about the spell book, who cares what that looks like - and its easy enough to download a replacement spell book.<br />
<br />
But the regular game book, for reading ingredient books etc, its messed up to all hell. If you download another 1 or whatever it just makes things worse, no matter what I do this annoying blue swirly box thing is on the top left and you cannot read text over it without needing eye surgery afterwards. I have looked around in the XML files etc but im a total n00b to the UI world and no matter what i've tried I have not been able to fix it myself. Please someone release a new version, a patch, a fix, for gods sake do something - or just tell me how to edit and fix this thing myself. Im sure im not the only 1 that is having trouble reading in-game books with this UI...<br />
<br />
Oh 1 small gripe as well, a bunch of the game icons have been screwed by the last few versions of this UI, the new augment icons do not show up (At least most of them dont) and for whatever reason the new satchel looks like a pearl necklace...</div></div><hr />

Best UI of all time, then they throw something like this in. I can't even begin to think how that spell book ever made it in.</div></div><hr />

For your first issue, open the file EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml in a text editor such as Notepad or Wordpad. <br />
<br />
Find the piece of code at the very top that reads <br />
<br />
	&lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;A_SpellBook_bg&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
		&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
		&lt;Texture&gt;spellbook_bg.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
			&lt;Location&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;Size&gt;<br />
				&lt;CX&gt;400&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
				&lt;CY&gt;300&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
			&lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;	<br />
<br />
This is where the background for the spell book is defined (red text emphasis is mine).   You can replace the image with something else, or you can replace the whole spell book file. <br />
For your second issue, the background used for regular books is defined in the EQUI_Animations.xml file, and you'll need to make changes to that to change the background used by regular books. <br />
<br />
<br />
For your third issue, you're missing at least 2 patches, because the additional dragitem_xx.tga files were released with LDoN and the patches to make them work are in the Patch Help forum. <br />
