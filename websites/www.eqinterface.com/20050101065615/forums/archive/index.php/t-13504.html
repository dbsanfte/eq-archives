<br />
I made a new folder in the uifiles folder of EQ.  After a few attempts doing it the way I had in the past on my own computer, I simply duplicated the default folder into my custom folder and tried to load the new folder... It still would not register that there was anything other then a defualt skin to load.  With or without changes, and using different names in the file folder, full set or mix and match...  <br />
<br />
Is this a new error introduced, or have I simply lost it?<br />

My girlfriend had the same problem and I was stumped until I noticed that there was an Everquest directory AND a Sony\Everquest directory. <br />
<br />
The only explaination of the multiple directories was due to expansions, as I had never loaded EQW onto that computer. Once I placed the new folder into the Sony directory, everything was hunky-dorie once again.<br />
<br />
If you cannot get it to work in that folder, all I can suggest is a complete re-install &lt;cringe&gt; of EQ, patches and all. I did this on another system with the same problem to fix it.<br />
