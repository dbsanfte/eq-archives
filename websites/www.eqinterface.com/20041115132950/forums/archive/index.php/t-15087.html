<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">narrwin</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally did it, i put together a almost complete interface of all the bests mods based upon how lil room it takes up on screen as well as functionality. I have added in slightly reworked versions of my horizontal hotbutton dashboard and spellbar (including room for the 9th spell gem). I also changed some of the colors for the borders (a new thing for me) as well as other lil tweaks to existing ui pieces. I give much thanks to soes diablo interface, which got me started in making my own interface. Through the course of making this interface i used alot of other peoples ui pieces and have slopply missplaced my list for due credit, If you see something that is your work i thank you greatly. This interface works well with 1024x768. Please post all comments and suggestions.<br />
