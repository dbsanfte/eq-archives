  I just came back to game after 2 years away...go figure..Some addictions are incureable ;) Anyway... Is there a specific server where there are at least a few &quot;noobs&quot; around? On Tunare I have a new lvl 5 warrior and almost never anyone in old hunt zones...am I in Wrong spots or just wrong server? Really do not care if group people are Twinked or not..I am not..just lookin to have a more &quot;social&quot; game experience.<br />
Thanks for Any help<br />
<br />
Been in Innithule,Freeport area and Butcherblock ..STILL not good at finding my way around now that game has grown so Large :D<br />
<br />
BTW ..I have also looked up a few guilds ..ugh..Doesn't ANY guild want people to join unless they are lvl 40-50 anymore?:( My OLD acct (yes I have Two now) has a 38 Cleric and 16 Druid but never saw much of the world when old guild died..So I could 2 box I guess ,just have not been able to figure it out very well..besides grouping with myself is not much fun LOL</div></div><hr />

There are still many guilds on Tunare that do not have level requirements, though do not see them actively recruiting very often (key word being actively as they still accept new members.) Good luck in your choice of servers and I am sure you will find a guild again.</div></div><hr />
