I think they switched or upgraded servers so maybe thier IP changed and DNS info changed and your ISP is slow in updating it from the master list servers? <br />
<br />
Incase you have cached the old dns you may want to try... <br />
If your on a windows box open up a command prompt and try flushing your dns cache with ipconfig (just type ipconfig -help and it will tell you how).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not quite sure what the deal is.  <br />
<br />
Atleast now I know it's working.  Thanks for confirming that.<br />

<br />
I've tried several computers, /flushdns, just about every browser made and even called a friend of mine in Illinois and none of us can get to casters realm.<br />
<br />
So can anyone else get to eq.crgaming.com?<br />
Make sure you're not surfing your own cache or browsing offline.</div></div><hr />
