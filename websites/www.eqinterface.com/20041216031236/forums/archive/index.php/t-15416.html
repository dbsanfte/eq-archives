<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">soran</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soran UI started life as the famed Ortin UI. When Ortin left, I started tinkering around with it, and over time it has grown into an almost entirely new beast, or perhaps a distant cousin.  If I had to describe it, I would say its a left hand minimalist version of Ortin.  I streamlined and added many new features.<br />
<br />
http://12.221.82.7/soran1152-2.jpg <br />
<br />
- Main Windows are fused together<br />
- Right-Side small buff icons, with background for easier reading<br />
- Horizontal player window with large hp/mana numbers<br />
- Transparent LARGE target window that is easy to read<br />
- Transparent Chat windows make it easier on the eyes <br />
- All stats and inventory slots are accessible from the main window<br />
- Compass now has a home in the upper left corner<br />
- In the group section, the pet gauge is moved to the right of the player gauges to prevent accidentally clicking pet instead of player (Can't tell you how annoying that is)<br />
- Pet gauges also change color as pet gets low on health.<br />
- Fully updated for OOW (As far as I can tell LOL)<br />
- Clicky slots for epic 1/2, and mount.<br />
I still consider this to still be a Beta version of the UI, but I'm putting it out there now to get some feedback before I proceed forward with some of the other things I have in mind. <br />
<br />
<br />
I currently have versions for:<br />
       -1024x768 <br />
       -1152x864<br />
       -1280x1024<br />
I would like to give Credit to:<br />
1. Ortin UI for many textures and windows<br />
2. Sars and T.King for code ideas reguarding buff icon background<br />
and the gauges that change colors.<br />
3. I also used Etasi's spell icons <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />

<br />
Have a question for you though, have you received any feedback regarding adding the maximum hitpoints and mana as opposed to just the number you have now and the %'age?<br />
<br />
I can get the max HP's from the inventory, but cannot seem to locate max mana.<br />
<br />
Is this something that is added easily, even if the max mana number is just in the inventory window?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time and efforts!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">soran</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No plans on adding max mana to the main window, but I'll add it to the inventory window.  I usually just go by the percentage anyway, since max mana number rarely changes.<br />

Might seem strange to folks but I like my group/target/character lifepts windows on the left side above my hot keys and the buff/song/spell gems along the right side above my Actions window.   I like the bottom of my screen for chat windows (small ones) so that I can see between them for easier targeting of mobs if I have happen to be standing on top of 4 of the fool things.  Mind you this all the orginal EQ UI windows.<br />
<br />
Everything I have seen  posted lately has all the windows at the bottom and I am just not comfortable with that placement.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">soran</div><div class="date">12-13-2004, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Jadell, the way I have it set up everything is pretty much locked in place the way you see it on the screenshot.  However, I designed the UI with the expectation that you resize the viewport(I have instructions on doing that in the readme file). This way, you can still have all the interface stuff and chat windows and very little of the screen is actually being blocked.<br />
So you are still able to see the full screen.<br />
<br />
I hope that makes sense.. if not play around with the /viewport command and you'll see what I mean. It won't break anything.. try this command.<br />
<br />
/viewport 0 0 640 480<br />
<br />
then<br />
/viewport reset  <br />
<br />
to set it back to its default size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">soran</div><div class="date">12-13-2004, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amanda... I'll have to look into it. Not sure what could cause that. Hopefully I'll have my epic 1.5 soon and I'll be able to track it down. <br />
<br />
I am going to be putting in an extra click slot for 1.5 this week. Check the website Wedensday and it should be up.<br />
<br />
Is your epic in inventory, or do you have it equipped?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amandakaye</div><div class="date">12-13-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its equipped, only way to use it... and i click it from my hotkey pad..<br />
<br />
