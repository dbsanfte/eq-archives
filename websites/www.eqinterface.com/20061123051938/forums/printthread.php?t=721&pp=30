		<div>Hmm.. we can make animations, Right?  <br />
<br />
Has anyone explored this much? <br />
<br />
If we can make animations and include them in our mods, what is there to keep someone from making a little animated timer that either Graphically of Phisically counts the time in say 15minute increments?<br />
<br />
Would this get annoying having it run on yer screen? or maybe put it on a window that is not always up. <br />
<br />
If we can make animations of unlimited size, why not make an hour timer?  <br />
<br />
You couldnt make a Start button or a Start button, but you could reference the time a spawn is killed and go from there. <br />
<br />
I'm sure there would be uses for this. Now if only we could get a graffix guru to make the dern thing. :p <br />
<br />
someone take this idea and run with it!!</div>

		<div>Better yet, I wouldn't mind a timer that displays Norrath time in the game.  IE, a 24-hour clock based on game time.  There are some things that rely on game time, and it would be nice to have a sense of time while on Luclin, in dungeons, etc, without having to type /time (which you can't do on Luclin.)<br />

		<div>hmm.. as nice as a 24 hour clock would be, once again, this could just be a graphic which would restart whenever your UI changed, and most likely whenever you zone. <br />
<br />
Also, I could just see all the frames needed in a 24hour animation.<br />
<br />
However, I still believe an hour timer or a 15 minute timer would be doable.<br />
<br />
Mind you, these timers would be continously rotating.<br />
These timers would not be able to be reset... <br />
<br />
WAIT!!!!  OMG!! These timers could Probably be RESET!! I'm sure the animations reset when you reset your UI via the /loadskin &lt;whatever&gt; 1    OMG!! Verant may have given us the ability for timers!! <br />
<br />
Someone has got to make this animation!! I know it would take ALOT of frames to do, but imagine the uses for this!!</div>

		<div>Actually, this wouldn't take many frames at all. I don't know how exactly the animated tga display code works, but i'm fairly sure it's similar to the gif file since some of the class icons, (the cleric one i know for sure) has a long pause between each animation, about 5 seconds or more. This means that the animation is coded to play through frames x to x normally, but when it cycles back to the first frame it is coded (in the animations xml i'm pretty sure) to wait so many seconds (hundreths of a second, actually) before it plays again. We should be able to do the same thing here. Say you wanted a 15 minute timer, you get a tga that has 15 &quot;frames&quot;, each image with one more picture representing a minute--heck, even frames with the numbers 1 through 15-- with each coded in the xml to change frames every 60 seconds, or 60,000 hundreths of a second. Therefor you have a simple 15 minute timer, with a small file, that is very accurate and useful. If /loadskin does indeed reset these animations, you could do this every time you wanted to reset it and Viola, your own personal chronograph. By the way, does /loadskin still restore to the default window positions anymore, or does it load the ones for the character? that's all, ponder on this, or try it out! good luck.</div>

		<div>OK.<br />
<br />
How bout this.<br />
<br />
An animation that increments from 0 to lets say 1 hour, in 30 sec increments.<br />
<br />
That would be 120 frames.<br />
<br />
Animation starts via activation of selected window (ie friends) and runs till you close it or zone (maybe).<br />
<br />
I dont know at this point, whether the animation would reset upon zone or not, but I'm guessing it does.<br />
<br />
The total timer length could be adjusted with less or more frames.<br />
<br />
I dont have the ability to do any of this, but maybe someone can take the ideas and run with it..</div>

		<div>LOL! Thats exactely why I put this out on the table.. I know someone can do this, but my graphix skills end with still pictures.. when it comes to making them move, I'm lost..<br />
<br />
We all know how much this feature is talked about, and how many people could get use from it. Someone who can make said animation needs to get with an XML guru and get this done. I think MAYBE with alot of time, if I were able to get the graphic, I think I know how to get this done.. But I couldnt gaurentee anything.. :confused: <br />

ANYTHING TIMER!!<br />

I'm telling you, this would have SO many uses in game.. If someone would make me a working TGA file with all the Times layed out for a... hmm... 15 minute timer (I know that this would be time consuming making all the frames needed) I would be willing to give it a shot.. <br />
<br />
I'm home from work now, I will look into how this could be done a little more.. <br />
<br />
<br />

Once again, XML doesnt scare me, BUT I can see this being pretty challenging and any help would be usefull..</div>

Each 'page' to the graphic turn is timed with a delay in miliseconds, from the looks of it. Didn't play that much attention to it. <br />
I just remember turning it up a bit for my gerbil animation. It was spining too fast and started to get ME dizzy.<br />

It would be possiable, I think. But tricky to implement.<br />

Ttiming on open or closed window? Does it run in the background? Is there even a cap to the delay in the Animations definition tags?</div>

That would be a total of 50 frames, and only one tga file. I could probably do this myself.<br />
<br />
Heck, it might even be fun to play with font styles to make a cool lookin timer. Now I just need to figure out a good place to put it, meaning I'll have to make space for it in a window somewhere.</div>

		<div>When making this, don't forget that we don't have the option to create new windows.<br />
<br />
If you make a timer, you're forced to place it on a currently used window. Not everybody will be keened to that.<br />
<br />
Frames required will be anywhere from 2-100, depending on how often and how you want your timer to 'tick'.<br />
<br />
Every 30 mins, or 15 mins will take minimal. But when you're talking down to a minute for an hors time, you're getting quite extensive. A case like that I would just suggest getting a small stopwatch to keep next to your computers. ;)<br />
<br />
Storing down to a mintue for 30 or 15 minute cycles can be doable, but again implimentation will be tricky.<br />
Also note that spawns aren't on &quot;set timers&quot;<br />
I've timed some at 34:30 others at 27:25 or even just plain 15:00.<br />
<br />
But then again, maybe I'm just getting too detailed in this. I'm the kind of guy that plays too close attention to the details. I guess that's why I'm a programmer. :)</div>

<br />
10000 (ms, ten seconds) seems to be the longest duration for an animation frame.  The minutes clearly does not work, it's in fact changed every ten seconds.<br />
I went to put in a blinking colon like a &quot;real&quot; digital clock and it didn't work but bah whatever<br />
The graphics are crap.  Shoot me, I am a coder not a graphics guy :)<br />
<br />
This is about 15 mins worth of work thrown together.  Yes, it does reset when you /loadskin.  No, it does not reset when you open/close the window.  And it woldn't be worth working with resetting if the timer can only be a minute long.  Anyway, addy in my sig, look in timerWindow directory.  Have a blast.<br />

		<div>ok, i might be wrong, and feel free to tell me i am, But i was looking at this Coding on the timer, we could do Minutes IF we make new Graphics, with the graphics having 2 digits...IE <br />
<br />
every Delay 1000 rotate Seconds<br />
Every Delay 10000 rotate 10 seconds<br />
when you reach 6th line of code find graphic 1:0<br />
when you reach 7th line at 10000 find graphic 1:1<br />
......<br />
when you readh 12th line find Graphic 2:0<br />
when you reach 13th line find graphic 2:1<br />
etc etc etc<br />
<br />
if some one was serious interested in creating an in game timer it could be posible but your looking at coding for EVERY 10 seconds of the timer..so on a 15 minute timer your looking at 10 lines for the Seconds counter...5 lines for the first Minute, and then 84 more entries for the remaining 10 second increments, thats 99 Frames, and the Graphics in file youd need 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
1:0, 1:1,1:2,1:3,1:4,1:5<br />
2:0,2:1,2:2,2:3,2:4,2:5<br />
......<br />
14:1,14:2,14:3,14:4,14:5<br />
15:0<br />
<br />
Larger Clock is Possible but i think id get Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Typing that many lines of code just so i can time 15 mins, i just thought id bring it up how it is possible to work with 10 second incrament cap on Graphics<br />
<br />
Good Luck With this , if someones got the Willingness to do this, i wont lie..ill use it lol, and im in works starting Graphics for a 5 Minute timer, just to test my theory</div>

		<div>OK, DONE!! <br />
<br />
working 15 minute timer.. <br />
<br />
REALLY Crappy Graphix, MANY MANY FRAMES, but it WORKS<br />
<br />
This timer counts down in 15 second intervals.. 15:00, 14:45, 14:30, 14:15, 14:00... etc etc etc... <br />
<br />
The way it works is it frames to the new image every 15000ms..<br />
<br />
It is extremely beta, and doesnt look all that hot, but hey, I figured that it was my idea, so I should be the first to make a working 15 minute timer.. = )  <br />
<br />
heres an image, will be reposting in the Beta thread as well..<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=3317" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
Told ya it looked crappy, but at least you'll see how it was done..</div>

		<div>Great stuff, I hope we'll get to see the xml for that soon.<br />
<br />
For those interested in resetting the timer, I'd like to point out that there's one animation that works different than all the others.  A_ClassAnim01 is used by the inventory window in a proprietary way.<br />
<br />
If you put a statinanimation using A_ClassAnim01 in a different window, it will reset each time the inventory window is opened and will stop moving each time the inventory window is closed.<br />
<br />
I don't know if that's useful -- opening and closing the inventory window is a silly way to control it unless it's in the inventory window itself.  But maybe it'll lead to a better discovery.</div>

		<div>ok i coded it and it took me for floggin ever but i have a working 20 min timer, actually 19:59, the .TGA file is 1.5 MB containing all the digits from 00:0, to 19:5 and 0-9, what my XML does is every 10 seconds cycles to the next 00:0, 10 seconds 00:1, 00:2, etc til it gets to 01:0 etc adds on the single digit second constant cycle<br />
<br />
so one graphics is 00:0 combines with seconds graphic to form <br />
<br />
00:00 to 19:59 then resets back to 00:00<br />
<br />
i dont know how i can get my TGA file posted being so Big so til i find out i cant post it...on my machine i plan to continue coding...now that i have working model its nothing but cut/paste and edit location to continue to 59:59<br />
<br />
the .tga will be huge but hey itll work for me lol, any sugestions, mybe i can upload it as a .jpg and you can convert it to .tga..ill have to look into it its 512X1024 size</div>

		<div>i tried to pst my TGA file here as a JPG but board denied it said to keep it 1024X768 or less mine 512X1024 so it is too high to add as an attachment, maybe the board admins can set the file size to 1024 either way so we can have high JPG/TGA instead of wide i listed mind in sequential order so i could easily code it by change in nothing but the Y coordinat as every one of the X coor stay the same all the way down the list Except the single digit for the seconds counter<br />

EDIT:<br />

note ignore the typos i dont feel like changing em, i got enuf to change after i run EQ and error loading &quot;Timer&quot; attempting to load defaul comes up, lol me and my fat fingers</div>

<br />
In a way .. The way the animation calls for the graphics are setup, they require the name of the file to &quot;cut&quot; from each time.<br />
<br />
So, you can create your line of graphics calls and at the &quot;5 mins point&quot; change the file.<br />
<br />
Do note, there is no way to tell EQ it's 5 mins, it will only go through all your graphic calls and at your set point, it will switch over cause the next call will require the next graphic.</div>
