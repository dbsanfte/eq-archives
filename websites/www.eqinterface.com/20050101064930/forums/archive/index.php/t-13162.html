<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XxMarlokxX</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">alright, i'm having a problem i just recently encountered after i reformated my computer. I'm unable to load any of the UI files that i download. I'm doing exactly what i used to do to, so i dont know what is different.<br />
<br />
What i did to install them was save it to one of my folders, then unzipped it to my Everquest/UI files/ New UI folder<br />
one of them was in a subfolder so i took copied them and erased the subfolder. The two UI's i tried to use were: <br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=687<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=544<br />
<br />
i have a lot of errors in my ini, so i attached it in the file<br />
<br />
Also, i dont know if this helps, or even why they look like this, but the new files i downloaded are now red with a &lt;x&gt; icon on them.. i have no idea what this is, i've never seen it before<br />
Thanks for any help</div></div><hr />

If so then windows is not seeing them as valid file types (ie the file is corrupted.) try deleting the files you downloaded (both the zip and the extracted files.) Then re-download and re-extract the UI pieces you want. That would be my first guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the uierrors log it says the interface name its trying to load is just New not New UI. Not sure thats what your folder name is make sure the name of the folder is just uifiles/new no capital letters no spaces and try again.<br />
<br />
Your uierrors.txt had no &quot;errors&quot; only &quot;warnings&quot; warnings do not stop your UI from loading they are informational only.</div></div><hr />

Like i said, i didn't see these anytime before, then after i reformated my computer with the restore cd, and downloaded the UI- i got those. <br />
I'm gonna check to see if i do have the wrong name of the file, thanks for the help :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok in this the new folder &quot;New UI&quot; has a space in it. I have found that couses problems with a UI. Instead try  &quot;NewUI&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I too just recently formatted my hard drive and now my skins wont load either.<br />
<br />
I unzipped my skins, have it looking like this;<br />
<br />
c:\programfiles\everquest\uifiles\myskins\skin1<br />
<br />
and they wont load. When I open the uiskins in the game, it only shows the default folder and the myskins folder and nothing else.<br />
<br />
I have the spelling correct, the pathing correct, but cant seem to get them to load.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XxMarlokxX</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, i thought it might have something to do with the windows explorer, because i downloaded Mozilla and set it as default browser for the first time- i figured maybe Mozilla couldn't read the xml files. But even after i set Internet Explorer as default again, and downloaded the files through it. The files are still i guess, corrupt. <br />
I also changed the folder name to just &quot;new&quot; and deleted all of the old files, and zip, before i downloaded it again. <br />
Even now, after doing all that, they are still red with the &lt;x&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
My path is fine actually. It reads as such<br />
<br />
c:\programfiles\everquest\uifiles\myskins\skin1<br />
<br />
Where &quot;skin1&quot; is, its the files I have downloaded. They are skin1, skin2, skin3 and so on.<br />
<br />
c:\programfiles\everquest (folder)\uifiles (folder)\myskins (folder)\skin1 (files)<br />
<br />
This is the correct path right?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xxdragonxxx</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im not sure that you have that right. Try to cut down on having any extra folders, for EQ will not load the files if there is too many.<br />
 <br />
This is the exact path to my UI's that work perfectly everytime<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\EverQuest\uifiles\MonkUI<br />
Once you get into the &quot;uifiles&quot; section of the path you can only have one more folder or else EQ won't read form it and your UI will not load. Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
