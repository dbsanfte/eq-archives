If You do like the mixed match of this UI between, Tom King and Drakah with enough of you I can upload this UI for downloading or I am sure someone else can. This is just an idea of mix and match, so enjoy.) I can be reached at this E-mail address. (Gurusoul@sbcglobal.net)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canorne</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason I think it is best not to upload this UI is that it will not get posted for downloading. I have tried in the past to send several UIs in the mixed and match section they were denied, plus none of the UIs I have posted for uploading did not have any of my original work involved. Besides, anyone can mix and match together on these UIs and I am just giving an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">More then likely it was denied was because you included files that were not modified in the zip. You should only put those files that are required into the zip. Everquest will automatically look in the default folder for any other XML/TGA’s that you didn’t modify. The reason for this is when sony releases a major patch your interface has a better chance of not being broken. It also saves on our bandwidth.<br />
<br />
Now we get so many submissions I cant be for sure this is the reason but it’s the most common reason for not to approve a interface.</div></div><hr />

I want the default icons .. yes the King ones are beautiful, but I like the simple clean lines of the default, and it's what I am use to<br />
 I MUST have the windows with min max avail.. so quartz is out I did download the Kaoric 4, but it's just not quite the essence of a paladin.. yet. <br />
and again the icons... I tried to copy from the default folder, but it just didn't go through</div></div><hr />
