However now with the new ui i Have to click on the HP bar to target myself.  I know it can be done with f1  and all but was wondering if its possible to make it when ya clik the player window *anywhere*  or even the sta/mana bars it would target yourself?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Put everything in the window you want. Add the player hps last in the file. Make the tile the size of the whole window. Use the offset for the gauge and name to put it where you want. <br />
<br />
It seems the files use the graphics as they get them. Meaning whats last will be ontop. If the piece you put in the window is the same size as the window everywhere you click will select it. Play with it and you will get the effect you want.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think he means the size.  The hp bar is usually set to be around 108 by 40.  If you make it size 150 by 200 it'll still look the same -- all the rest of the space will be just transparent so the other bars will still show through.  If 150 by 200 is the full size of your player window, then you'll click on the hp bar no matter where in the player window you click.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do I understand correctly that they only way to target yourself (or party member 1-5, pet 1-5) is via the gauge bar?<br />
<br />
Is there any other way to do it?  I'm making a window that doesn't have any gauges at all, just the percentages, so needing the gauge to target is kinda hard.<br />
<br />
Suggestions?</div></div><hr />

F1 - Target yourself<br />
F2 - Target Second in Group<br />
F3 - Target Third in Group<br />
F4 - Target Fourth in Group<br />
F5 - Target Fifth in Group<br />

I know that. :p <br />
<br />
What I am referring to is the ability to click on (previously) the HP bar of whomever (self, party member, pet, party member pet) and it would target them.<br />
<br />
Trying to find out if the only way to do that is through the use of the HP gauges or if there is some other work-around (that includes clicking mouse on a spot on your screen).</div></div><hr />
