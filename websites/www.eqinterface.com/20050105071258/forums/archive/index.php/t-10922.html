<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nostradomas</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to see the xml problems of Neptune fixed and Neptune updated to be compatible with LDoN.  As a hybred I really enjoy this UI over any other due to the staggered spell icons for fast casting and less miscasts.  I love the spell buffs across the top and labeled and especially like the spell gems this UI uses.  I know this wasnt a hughly popular UI but with modifications to update it and fixing the XML errors I think this could become very popular.  I believe there is a problem with the compass on this UI as well.  Over all this is they type of UI I am looking for.  It is very funtional for Hybreds since the spell bar can be placed right next to the hot buttons keys and spells, hot buttons and equipment can be instantly accessed.  Maybe it would be possible to update this older UI with ghestas wc3gems.zip.   <br />

I guess I am mostly just asking for Neptune to be updated and fixed but those features of that UI could be integrated into a new UI that I would most cerainly use also.  The important thing is to have the spell gems located close and staggered or large in size for fast movements for casting.  Hybreds keep their mouses moving when tanking and the less movement the better.  Some UI's are totally unusable if we have to move the mouse pointer clear across the screen to hit the spell icon for fd then on a failed fd back across the screen to hit hot buttons for stand.  The customizable keys also make it possible for me to have my Unholy steed right next to each other for fast moving get aways and sit really close as well for those times I fd then stand and hit my cos really fast.  The pet button is able to be located right above my hot keys and spell gems for fast control of my pet as well.  This makes this UI particularly useful for lightning fast responses and quick reactions.  This imo is a hybred/pet caster friendly UI.  I would like to see it updated or remade with another style.<br />
<br />
Edit: The Neptune Mix N Match.zip UI is located under Complete UI's &gt; Mix &amp; Match on page 9 currently.  <br />

<br />
There are lots of optional items for Vert, including alternate sell-casting windows, inventory windows, and hot-button replacements.  Give them a look.</div></div><hr />
