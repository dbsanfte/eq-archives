My custom UI windows will be there, but no one shows up in my guild window or pulldown menus in the bazaar window are blank.  After /loadskin &lt;folder&gt; 1, it all works fine again.  Anyone else having this problem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you using an alternate Font?  Some fonts are not compatable with EQ.<br />
<br />
Try changing back to Arial and see if it still happens.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I would guess that it is a problem in one of your .ini files.<br />
<br />
Try removing them (save them for backup) and see if that fixes it.</div></div><hr />

Also, no fonts are listed in the pull down list in the options window even if I reload it. This bug is across all my characters whether using default UI or my custom one.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any ideas that can help!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You said that no fonts are listed in your drop-down?  That is really really odd to me.  If you open a word processor, do you get a font listing there and if you do, does it actually change the font?<br />
<br />
I know that sometimes the Fonts folder gets retarded in windows.  TweakUI (http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp) has a utility in it to fix it.<br />
<br />
I'm just throwing out ideas.  8)</div></div><hr />
