<br />
what's your longest non rez fight against a single mob... I'm trying to figure out by comparision using time as a delimiter what the toughest mob is to kill<br />
<br />
AoW used to be fairly tough, but it drops now fairly quickly... I know most people don't &quot;time&quot; the actual combat, but an approximation on how long it takes to drop would suffice<br />
<br />
Vindicator in Kael took about 2 minutes to drop last time I was on a raid to kill him</div></div><hr />

But of course that was when the bandit were bugged and had 8,000 hit points. Talk about a battle. Weeeeee what fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mogur</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:p Ain't bragging about this at all considering it was a &quot;green&quot; mob but my guild went around to several cities killing the PoDs just to get a little mob control practice in. When we got to Oggok we saw a mob whose name I believe was &quot;Glurg the Exterminator&quot;. We knew nothing about him but he was near the PoD so we decided to do him first. Lol! Big mistake! We had 2 full groups and a third partial group. We beat and nuked on this guy for...no lie now...an hour and a half!!! He didn't hit hard and no one died or even lost much health, but he's got about a million hp.<br />
A 1000 pt nuke didn't even budge his health bar! I'm a mage and I went through about 5 &quot;Rage of Zomm&quot; pets on him. I don't know why. It's not that he was killing them. It seemed like they would just get tired after about 15 min. and say &quot;ferget this&quot;! It's possible they have a built in time limit on them or something I don't know. There were several times during this fight that guildies wanted to give up and move on just from boredom but we stuck it out. It was good practice in moving a mob around during combat. Of course, as you can guess, when we finally got him down he dropped nothing much.</div></div><hr />

Nothing like 1.5 hours but its a mob that's has tons of HP, and drops loot.  Take a while to kill him and is a boring fight &lt;yawn&gt;.  But thats what you asked for so there it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We wiped on the first try due to the main tank popping through a wall into the hallway outside. *shrug*<br />
<br />
The second try, we did it with no deaths, even though he agroed on me and a couple of other clerics right off. It took more than an hour to kill him. A good bit of the time was spent killing adds during the fight while the main tank kept Seru agroed though.<br />
<br />
I have been in fights with the emperor in Ssra that lasted over 45 min, and some of the fights in Vex Thall used to be stupid long.</div></div><hr />

They make those hard to kill because when you kill them, people can't do the turn-ins for their quests. =\<br />
<br />
Try the first giant you come to when you enter Kael from Eastern Wastes. He's also a green con with 9843327983 hp. =P</div></div><hr />
