The problem with that is the last tradeskill modification I have came from EQ Tradeskill Companion and has not been updated since LAST DECEMBER! And what was there then wasn't even a complete set of recipes! Anyone out there who can help me out? I am really stupid when it comes to creating and modifying the UI stuff, but I would be really grateful to anyone who has a mod set up for the tradeskills if it could be posted on the site. I would be even more grateful to anyone who wouldn't mind making a new one that replaces either the feedbck, gems, bug or help windows! Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
