<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antics</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I would just say hi and introduce myself to the forum.  I've been on a few forums, and most are quite particular about this sort of thing.  I'm Antics and I play on the Saryrn server.  I just starting picking around the UI files after months of thinking about it, so I'm not very knowledgeable at all about the subject just yet.  I'm sure that your tutorials will be very helpful in what I want to do with my UIs.  If there are any &quot;rules&quot; here that differ greatly from other forums, let me know so I don't annoy or agitate anyone with my posts.<br />

<br />
Don't be shay asking questions almost get answered with in a few hours...sometimes sooner if there are a lot of people cruising the boards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings and well met Antics! This board and its cruisers and admin's do a great job at helping everyone with any problems. And don't think that your question(s) will be stupid. Just remember, the only stupid question is the one that isn't asked. Feel free to come here for all you UI needs and help!<br />
<br />
Journey well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antics</div><div class="date">09-19-2003, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really appreciate the support =)  I'm glad that this forum is newbie friendly.  Most forums try to run off newbies so a certain group of people can have control of the boards =)  The only thing is I'm not sure you should have given me free reign of asking questions....if I run into problems with a ui I'm working on, you probably won't be able to shut me up =P  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The more problems you have the more you challenge us to learn more about UI.<br />
<br />
Perfection teaches nothing. Errors teach us everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antics</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I guess I'll get started....my first question is in the graphic modification section =P  Its really frustrating me ;\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd probably get quicker responses if you post your questions in the Help (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=16) forum section. Not saying that this forum won't be that helpful, but the Help section gets more cruising for UI problem related issues. Good luck!</div></div><hr />
