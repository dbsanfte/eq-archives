<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tallin</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have currently the horizontal hot boxes and the horizontal spell bar but they dont match up very well.  Was wondering if anyone has made one that puts the 2 together one on top of the other lined up so one box is above one spell icon on the bar.  I would like to see this as I frequently cast a spell like SLOW and then hit a hot key to announce it to the raid channel.  Having them set in this fashion would ease the process greatly.<br />
<br />
Would like to see the box with the hot keys a little smaller and the spell icons a little bigger (kinda the same size but I dont want huge spell icons like the hot keys are now).<br />
<br />
Another variation that might be cool to see would be to have just 4 Hot keys on top....4 spell icons below them....4 spell icons below those...4 Hotkeys below those.  They would all match up and would have the spellbook opener and the 2 remaining Hot Keys off to the right (to place click items like my JBB and Epic in)<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated as I am baffled about making these mods until an editor comes out that is understandable by a person who knows little about computers.<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton<br />
