Virtual Currency Pioneers to Join Forces<br />
Thursday January 22, 11:12 am ET<br />
Internet Gaming Entertainment Ltd. Acquires Yantis Enterprises, Inc<br />
<br />
BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 22, 2004--Internet Gaming Entertainment, Ltd. (&quot;IGE&quot;) (www.ige.com), the worldwide leader in the market for buying and selling virtual property used in multiplayer online games, announced today that it has agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of Yantis Enterprises, Inc. (www.mysupersales.com).<br />
<br />
The deal involves both cash and equity in IGE's parent company, IGE U.S. LLC (&quot;IGE U.S.&quot;), headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, according to Randy Maslow, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of IGE U.S.<br />
<br />
Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (&quot;MMORPGs&quot;) like EverQuest and Ultima Online are filled with virtual property -- things like magic weapons, houses, in-game currency, and characters that are bought and sold on auction exchanges, with thousands of dollars trading hands every day. The total trade volume for virtual property is estimated by Professor Edward Castronova, professor of economics at Cal-State Fullerton, to exceed $400m annually, with an undetermined portion of that amount annually captured in real-world dollars by dealers in virtual currency and goods.<br />
<br />
With more than 80 employees and thousands of suppliers, IGE is the largest provider in the world of virtual currency exchange and game-enhancement services to players of MMORPGs. The company provides 24x7x365 customer service and tech support from its state of the art operations center in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jonathan Yantis is an entrepreneur who blazed the trail in creating a market for the exchange of virtual currency and property,&quot; said Brock Pierce, CEO of IGE U.S. &quot;This acquisition is a big step for both us and the virtual currency exchange market as a whole, and solidifies our position as the largest player in this market by far.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Yantis will be joining IGE U.S. as Chief Operating Officer and a member of the company's Board of Managers. The other members of the Board include Mr. Pierce, Mr. Maslow and Alan Debonneville, President of the IGE subsidiary in Hong Kong.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a marriage of the two pioneers in this industry,&quot; said Jonathan Yantis. &quot;I'm excited to be joining IGE and look forward to our future successes together.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the above is truely going to be gossip worthy news, We here at EQInterface.com are not in anyway effected by this, our contract with IGE stands as it is. <br />
<br />
One of the things we ask though is that no &quot;debates&quot; or &quot;discussions&quot; take place about the Pro's and Con's of the event. It is not fair to the parties envolved since the dominate company advertises on this site.<br />
<br />
We have left the post, because it is public news and people will want to know about it. <br />
<br />
We all hope this will mean great things for IGE, and for anyone who use the services they provide.  beyond that, EQInterface.com is not envolved, and as such any post/threads bringing up any part of the issue will have to be removed.<br />
<br />
I hope you all understand.<br />
