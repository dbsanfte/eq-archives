<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twizz76</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked at some other mods and decided to make my own. Started by trying to add percentage to my experiance bar in the inventory file. I get no errors in the uierrors file but the percentage value doesn't show up.<br />
<br />
Would be great if someone could tell me what is wrong with the following code section.<br />
<br />
- &lt;Label item=&quot;Exppercentage&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;ScreenID&gt;Exppercentage&lt;/ScreenID&gt; <br />
  &lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt; <br />
  &lt;Relativeposition&gt;True&lt;/Relativeposition&gt; <br />
- &lt;location&gt;<br />
  &lt;x&gt;118&lt;/x&gt; <br />
  &lt;y&gt;112&lt;/y&gt; <br />
  &lt;/location&gt;<br />
- &lt;size&gt;<br />
  &lt;cx&gt;30&lt;/cx&gt; <br />
  &lt;cy&gt;15&lt;/cy&gt; <br />
  &lt;/size&gt;<br />
  &lt;EQType&gt;27&lt;/EQType&gt; <br />
- &lt;TextColor&gt;<br />
  &lt;R&gt;255&lt;/R&gt; <br />
  &lt;G&gt;255&lt;/G&gt; <br />
  &lt;B&gt;255&lt;/B&gt; <br />
  &lt;/TextColor&gt;<br />
  &lt;NoWrap&gt;True&lt;/NoWrap&gt; <br />
  &lt;AlignCenter&gt;True&lt;/AlignCenter&gt; <br />
  &lt;AlignRight&gt;False&lt;/AlignRight&gt; <br />
  &lt;AlignLeft&gt;False&lt;/AlignLeft&gt; <br />
  &lt;/Label&gt;<br />
<br />
I put this between the exp bar and the STR section in the inventory file. Nothing else is changed from the default.<br />
<br />
Also added &lt;pieces&gt; Exppercentage &lt;/pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me why this isn't working. I loaded it by editing the ini file for the char I used to test it.<br />
<br />
I have tried other eqtypes I found to see if I could get any value to list but nothing happens. File seem to load with no errors though, just a lot of warnings about all the other missing files in the error file.<br />
<br />
Also I would like to know if there is any good place to find a listing of the eqtypes and other information (it is probebly in the eqfolder hehe)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you done the /load command just to make sure?<br />
<br />
how about changing the Font to 5, temperarly. This will make it nice and big, incase it's hidden behind something.<br />
<br />
I would also suggest place the &lt;Pieces&gt; item at the very end of the list.<br />
<br />
And that's about all I can think of. Everything else looks golden.</div></div><hr />

Still now value next to exp bar though :(<br />
<br />
The pieces tags are at the end of file among the other.<br />
<br />
I have changed the fontsize tried to move it to the left of the exp bar. Also tried to insert a ext instead of the eqtype line but still nothing ::(</div></div><hr />
