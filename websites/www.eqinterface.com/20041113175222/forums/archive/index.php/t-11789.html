<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AloneStarwalker</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you might want a spell gem bar in there somewhere, and a mana gauge.. hehe<br />
<br />
i kinda noticed you a cleric... and figured you need that hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually this will be pure melee ;)<br />
<br />
i am a cleric, but my bf is a rogue. and im making it for him ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
well that makes things easier hehe, was playing around with the sizes of the windows in that mockup, and couldnt get all the gauges to fit hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AloneStarwalker</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this is what i have so far, mostly used graphics from your mockup screenshot... <br />
<br />
But i am betting with real nice textures it would look alot better.<br />
<br />
I also need to make rounded edges for the target window, hehe. but thats coming later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
good work, can't wait to try to live version :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well you're in luck... had a friend log in and help me out and managed to get it done, i think ;)<br />
<br />
watch 'my skins' , its pending approval :)</div></div><hr />

I love what you've done with the combat abilities.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like that :)<br />
clean... i'll give it a try as soon as we finally get that patch on the UBI server :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gerloff, I might consider adding some, since my boyfriend has a few clickies he uses. I will just have to try and do it soon.<br />

And nice looking ui</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ryoujikaji</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wonderin, on the screenshot you have where you download your ui what font are you using in everquest? it looks awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">catmatik</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being also, a warrior, I like to see my hp (the numbers) and the hp gauge bar in larger format.  It is hard switching from a big target window to a small little window that all I see is my hp %.  I rarely use that :p   Any chance of you adding the hp numbers to this ui?  If you could, thank you very much in advance!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok finally made it to work on the localized server :p<br />
<br />
my thoughts :<br />
- need clickies<br />
- scrollbar does not have the same loog as the  chat windows<br />
- need hp (raw number) and stats (at least hp, ac, sta, dex, agi since it's a melee UI)<br />
- need big self hp bar within the target window<br />
<br />
besides that : the nok_bg template is nice, but having to change all the other non-modded is a pain :)<br />
kunis = lazy :p<br />
<br />
otherwise : really nice UI :D</div></div><hr />

Hey Veirna were did you get that cool looking pic of your char?<br />
And nice looking ui  <br />
<br />
i made it with photoshop and Poser 4 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by ryoujikaji <br />
I was wonderin, on the screenshot you have where you download your ui what font are you using in everquest? it looks awesome.  <br />
<br />
If you're referring to the neon green text, its Warcraft's font, called &quot;FrizQuadrata BT&quot;<br />
<br />
if you're talking about the other very small font, its called &quot;Photoshop Small&quot;, a font that is in the photoshop directory. If you copy it to c:\%SYSTEMROOT%\fonts You'll end up with &quot;Photoshop Small&quot; useable in any app that lets you change fonts ;)<br />
<br />
any other font would be Arial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding all other requests,<br />
<br />
I will have to find another window to hack and slash to stick resists/stats/clicks etc in it.<br />
<br />
As for buffs, i simply downloaded a minibuff set here and put those to use in the UI ( tedious work for something already done )<br />
<br />
Clickies will probably end up below the inventory/options/map window<br />
<br />
and hp/ac will go under the XP bars.<br />
<br />
I made this UI to be minimal and inobtrusive, and mostly, for my boyfriend. If he doesn't like it, it won't be done, pretty much. And he's not a jazzy dings and whistles kinda guy. Efficient.<br />
<br />
I do plan to fix those nasty up/down arrows though. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leegar</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok this ui is great. I love it, but I am a hybrid and really need a mana bar. While I did load the skin and the default reloads the mana bar for me it is a little right and underneath the endurance bar. I know this is a pain but wondering if you could make a seperate player zip for casters... I don't need to watch the endurance bar as much as my mana. Thanks in advance... and if that is not in the cards... oh well... you have talent and maybe you will create something I might use later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jillia</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I adore your design, Veirna . It's the best I've seen so far. Very clean. Not cluttered with messing looking, obtrusive, stat and inventory windows. I've been waiting for something like this.<br />
<br />
I hope you feel inclined to make a caster version in the future. If there was one, I would certainly use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok ok :) caster player window inc. but be warned, if you like to view the netstat it will overlap if you use the setup i have in the screenshot. if not well.. then... everything will be peachy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check my skins folder very soon, as i've uploaded a caster version for you guys.</div></div><hr />

so the font that your name in game above you is using is the warcraft one and the text of the buffs is the photoshop small? how do you get eq to use the 2 different fonts at the same time?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkasDusk</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great UI. I've been contemplating putting one together, but haven't had the creative motivation to really dig into it yet :)<br />
<br />
This is approaching perfect from my perspective. I'm a warrior, and the only thing I think is lacking is the clickies/stats window.<br />
<br />
I don't expect you to steer from your stated purpose though. Seems like your boyfriend and I have similar ideals in a UI though :)<br />
<br />
BTW, I play on maelin as well.<br />

<br />
In your target window, you have two of the same UiD2Anim items with the stam name.<br />
<br />
A_TargetBoxBG - loaded it up ingame and it crashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veirna</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">odd ok. i will check it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shemazar</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seem to have left the modified compass window out of the latest .zip compiles for your UI...:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nytekat</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love your UI but had to change a few thing for easier use.  I used A spell bar that had the names to the side and a easier to see cast bar(I hope you don't put the cast bar in with the target or make 2 versions if you can)<br />
<br />
I put in a pet box that was easier to use for a bst.. one without tabs so I can see the health, buffs, and buttons all at once (would be cool if you could make one a tad bit smaller).  One thing I am looking for is pet health on the players health bar.  It's hard to see if my pet is in danger if I'm not looking at the pet box.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to put a stat box together in the friends box... the stat box is from EmilUI2melee but it used the target window which is rough to replace.  I'm having a bit of trouble with it cause I'm getting an error but it don't crash the UI...  just says it's not up to date.  I started a post here.. http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?threadid=11992 if you can help me it would be great cause it compliments your UI very well since it's so slender (if only it was transparent like the rest) but if you don't have the time that's ok too.<br />
<br />
But I have to congrat you on a few things... the hotbuttons are nice and easy to see (not all clumped together like everyone else is doing.  The buff windows and Icons are superb and the target and overall look is awsome... I love the transparent look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyrssi</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the font in your chat boxes on the caster UI screenie?
