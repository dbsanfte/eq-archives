<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiyaz.  Well Kudane contacted me and said no in fact I wasnt losing my mind and I did post the wc3nightelf mod but it got corrupted somehow so I tried again and it corrupted again...  So I re packed it in a new zip and now its posted cleanly I hope at least the posting process wen all the way through this time and brought me back to complete sets section where i posted it.  <br />
<br />
So the MOD is in Complete Sets of downloads once Kudane can move it there.  Might be a day or so so give him a break he is likely dealing with 1000s of these things to my piddly little 4 hehehe.  My sympathies bro :O  Anyway its posted as wc3nighteyes and is a replacement and serious upgrade the druidui which was my first shot at a UI.  Look for some nice new gauges that follow the WC3 standards closely and it is now cross class compatible.  Meaning any class can use it as with the other three in the series wc3human, wc3undead, and wc3orcish.  I even put in a nice druid friendly track window for us TREEHUGGERS, may Tanure look favorably upon my barky ass.  If you are a Ranja and you want the full tracking window just go into the wc3nightelf directory and delete the EQUI_TrackWindow.xml file and you will get the full MONTY.  Anyway keep the comments and suggestions coming in.  In the works is 1024x768 releases of all 4 mods as well as 800x600 attempts but the 800x600 ones will very likely be much stripped down as I have basically half the space to work with.  I will try my best though I realize there are folks out there with accessiblity issues and those like me who are just tired of looking at teeny tiny things on a monitor that already aggravates my eyes heheh.  <br />

Enjoy<br />

Keep up the nice UI work.  I was sad to see the wolf cast icon go away, but i love the new skin too.  You managed to work elements of my 2nd favorite game into my favorite one.  <br />
I am now deleting most of my old skins and using all 4 of these for my characters.  Thanks again for you hard work and dedication,we all appreaciate it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
find it Here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=572)<br />
<br />
enjoy<br />
<br />
a couple of notes to sylverpaw,<br />
<br />
1. inventory causes horrid lag when open, I fixed it by using an inventory that used an image.. (is this one suppose too?)<br />
<br />
2. any chance of getting a red bar for HPs instead of the 3D man? as an add-on<br />
<br />
3. one last add on... could you make the hotbuttons 2 down and 5 across, and put a chat box below the hot buttons i could use one more chat box.. =)<br />
<br />
if not no biggy.. just a request =)</div></div><hr />

I am sure it takes alot of work to change the rez of them but have you any rough idea of when you might  have them finished.<br />
<br />
Cheers for the excellent work and I look forward to using your UI's asap</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just an FYI. I also wanted to scroll up the spam chat boxes. I dunno xml so I simply unlocked the graphic frame and moved it. Then adjusted the respective chat boxes alpha normal to 100 and tint black.<br />
<br />
Great job on the UI. I've used it since the 1st version, but stopped when it was broken by a patch, then waited for this new version. Did the 19 Nov patch break this? I hope not. I'll see when I log in later.<br />
<br />
Oh and a suggestion for a  good-to-have but not really important feature:<br />
Perhaps the empty inventory boxes could be converted into auto-drop area?<br />
<br />
:nana: It's a beeeoootiful UI :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The latest patch did not break this.  Spiritwalker seems pretty adept at keeping his mods non-breakable.  Eventually it happens, but I have had less of a problem with his mods than any others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhentor</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">still waiting for a smaller version =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">platphoenix</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tyrnt, before I forget your name, here's the fix to your problem with the chat boxes;<br />
<br />
1) Unlock the left box (with the exp bars, called the Main box herein) and move it elsewhere<br />
2) Unlock and move the chat box the above covered. Make sure you set the Normal and Fade transparency both to 100% (temporarily)<br />
3) Find the second chat box. If none exists (none did for me on initial install) then make one. Move that one as well, also making transparencies 100%<br />
4) Move the main box (exp box) back into place and lock it<br />
5) Move the first chat box into it's spot, enlarging it just enough so the chat bar on the bottom, scroll bar on the side, and the lines on the edge are outside the window on the main box. Lock it, make the transparencies 0%. It should be, for all intents and purposes, invisible<br />
6) Repeat #5 with the second chat box. Now, set what messages go where. I suggest the main chat to be important messages, top left others spells/attacks, damage shields, etc and bottom left for raid/group<br />
<br />
BTW, I LOVE this UI! Not only did it hold up to the patch, but it puts all the chats where I want them, in the importance I want them, as well as everything else. I hope you remake the Undead UI to something closer to this. I'm recommending this like mad to people on the Solusek Ro server<br />
<br />
-d'Arnaxx<br />
<br />
P.S.; As of the 19th, the ONLY autodrop area available is in the Inventory. I don't make mods, but I did catch this info passing by one of the patch notices somewhere. No can do on the empty slot drop box thing :(</div></div><hr />

I noticed you where mentioning a 1024x768 version!  Any ETA on this?  I am cursed with a small monitor and have tried, in vain mind you, to get it to work.... which as you can image, failed.  If you need help with it, please feel free to hollar.  Thank you much!</div></div><hr />
