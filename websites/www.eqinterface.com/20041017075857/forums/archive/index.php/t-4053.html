FYI, 1.4 has a terrible history of not being compatible with 1.3 apps.  It's very unfortunate.:(</div></div><hr />

Just a note that I'm not planning on fighting the 1.4 battle until I see some positive information about it's stability and compatibility with 1.3 from Sun.  <br />
<br />
Since you got an out of memory error, I would bet you were still accessing 1.4 (that is the only jvm I've seen to cause this).<br />
<br />
On another note;  I've posted a new version that fixes some issues with graphic selection, and fixes a bunch of small bugs.  It also has gamma correction as a menu item.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">techb0t</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me, the program would get out of memory errors if I had 12 or more UI folders.  Once I dropped below 12 it started up fine.  The 12 dirs. are using just over 95 MB.<br />
<br />
Also the program found some minor things with my crystal folder and vert.  Each one had a file with the following above the xml version line.<br />
<br />
&lt;!-- VERT's PLAYER WINDOW--&gt;<br />
<br />
The XML declaration may only appear at the very beginning of the document.<br />
<br />
Removing the vert code cleared up all errors.<br />
<br />
Just a few things I noted.  I will mess around with the prog this weekend some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, the machine I tried it with 1.3 running never had Java installed until this morning.  I was still running off Microsoft's discontinued Virtual Machine (meaning I've managed to keep that system stable enough to not reinstall in the past year).  Using just the Virtual Machine it wouldn't run, so I DLed and installed 1.3.<br />
<br />
granted, your program made it further on that particular machine than my others, but still the OOM message.  Might just be my luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously, the graphics are eating up memory.  I noticed that my way of updating graphics after gamma correction may be contributing to this.  I'll continue to experiment to find solutions to oom.  <br />

Thanks for all the info.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ambros</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes there is a memory hog at work here.  Some of it is because of swing (the gui components), some is my quick and dirty programming, but a major part seems to come from JDOM the xml parser I'm using.  At www.jdom.org there seems to be a number of discussions about the memory overhead associated with this system.<br />
<br />
For the next release I'm going to try to conserve as much memory as possible.  I think I can cut some overhead by only reading in the uilfiles for a folder when you ask for them, being a bit more conscious about variable declarations and object references, and MAYBE using xalan directly instead of JDOM (big maybe here because jdom is so easy to use).<br />
<br />
Hang in there!  I know the memory problems are annoying, bu I'm working hard on it!<br />

Your post follows the situations I have seen also.  Thanks for the comment.  Just an update on 0.7.1;  I am working on fixing a new property editor (almost done) and I want to add a palette of controls that can be added to a screen (and the ability to remove them).

0.2.9 is SIDL WIDL not SIDL Fiddle. Different program altogether</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, yeah, I just realized that today. I would blame lack of sleep and a generally high frustration level on the mixup, but I gota face up to the fact that I'm just a tard. =x<br />
<br />
Ok, so now that we have established that I am a tard, on to my continuing problem. I moved the ummm...17 extra foulders of UIs and graphics, over 100 megs of stuff, and have only 2 custom UIs in my uifiles directory now. I launch SIDL Fiddle and it loads fine, but when I load a screen, it shows everything in greyscale, mostly I just am looking at white rectangles and such showing the where stuff is. I'll mess with it some more, or maybe even read any available instructions....<br />
<br />
Hopefully when/if I manage to overcome my massive level of ignorance, I'll figure it out. It would be nice if this program turns out to be better than SidlWidl. =)</div></div><hr />

2) As for the bank not showing up.  You can try a couple of things.  First, open the xml with internet explorer and see if it parses the file correctly (to rule out syntax errors).  Next you can check the DOS window of SIDL Fiddle for any error messages.  Thirdly, wait until the end of the week and try it when I release 0.7.1.  Lastly, if nothing else helps you can email me the xml file and I'll try to figure out what it's doing.<br />

Do these steps to open a file:<br />
<br />
1.  You need to select the file you wish to open.<br />
2.  Select the screen in the elements box (screens are bold in the list).<br />
3.  Click open screen.<br />
<br />
If you do not have a screen selected the action will do nothing; unfortunately that includes not providing any feedback.<br />

Ok, 1.4 is still problematic.  Make sure you have the extended jvm parameters setup (see the download page).  If that doesn't work it may be something with memory limitations on your machine.  I got it running with 1.4 on winnt with 512mb of mem.  <br />
<br />
As another note.  There is a switch you can add when running the program to debug...I haven't said much about it because it slows things down, but if you run Sidl Fiddle with the following:<br />
<br />
java -jar fiddle.jar -debug <br />
<br />
it will print out LOTS of info on what its doing.  You might want to try that to see where it explodes.<br />
<br />
Also, let me know what ui's you are using and I'll try to duplicate the error as well.<br />

I used the java -Xms32m -Xmx512m -jar fiddle.jar you suggest on the webpage and it will now load or I should say attempt to load gius.  As it parses the entire directory it finally get to the feedback window and just sits there.  I thought at first it was taking a moment and waited.  <br />

Let me see if I can explain it better.  :D<br />
I load up the program.<br />
I select the Default directory (I did this just to test it).<br />
I've tried other directories but it won't load my custom directoery at the moment.<br />
I select say the bank window.  I click the EQUI_Bankwnd.xml.<br />
I see at the bottom of the window where it says it's parsing files.<br />
Seems to be doing fine.<br />
Then it gets to the EQUI_Feedbackwnd.xml and it stops.  It sits on that files in the parsing listing.  No elements are loaded.<br />
The Program just stalls dead.<br />
<br />
Nothing else I can do so I just close it.<br />

P.S. I'm not doubting it's WinXP and some evil Java crap MS did somewhere.  Probably Microsofts sloppy uninstall of Virtual Machine or something.  Not sure if that has anything to do with it.  But I'm probably going to be reinstalling on sunday and I'll start with a fresh install and see how that goes.  It will probably work just great them  *Hope Hope*</div></div><hr />

Yes it's the feedback XML in the default folder.<br />
The DOS window does not show any error.  I even took the liberty of using the -debug arguement to see if any additional info was available and nothing.  the Software just stops working at the feedback window.  It actually won't even load any custom folders.<br />
<br />
I'll dump 1.4.1 and go back to 1.3 again and see if that doesn't anything with the new version.  I'll post here with my findings.  <br />

Even the default files won't load?  Do you get any error's in the DOS window?  <br />

I hadn't tested the default files before, so I attermpted to load the spell bar from the default directory just now and got the same error. <br />

Yel:  I'm really confused by your problem.  Can you open a dos window and type &quot;java -version&quot; and verify that you are running a 1.3.x JVM?  If you verify that you are on 1.3 then maybe try running fiddle with this line: java -verbose -jar fiddle.jar and see what the last set of classes that load are.  If, in this case it is something in JDOM or XERCES then that is further evidence that I need to research an alternative for my xml parsers (because they are sucking memory).</div></div><hr />

Double checked all the files and all graphics are in the folder and the UI/window works fine in EQ.<br />

<br />
After you reverted to 1.3 but before you tried to start up the program, did you delete the properties file?  It would've been created while you still were using jdk1.4 so it probly has some incorrect information now that you're using jdk1.3.  Good luck. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mystery solved. I did some investigating and found that somehow the box I was trying to run SIDL Fiddle on had not one, not 2 but 3 versions of Java Runtime installed on it - version 1.3.x, 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 (Don't ask me how that happened - im thinking maybe Windows Update got too intuitive but thats just a guess)<br />
<br />
I removed the 1.4.x installs and now it seems to be running fine. Well, fine in that I don't get a memory error. But it still seems to want to freeze on me when I try to open a screen. I'm letting it sit and crunch the info for a while to see if it unlocks itself after processing for a bit.</div></div><hr />

Most likely it was SUN that caused this.  I've had (at one time) six different JVM's installed.  For some silly reason they seem to change how they install each release.  I've had them install in the root directory, sometimes in program files, etc.<br />
<br />
Hope everything is working now!</div></div><hr />

Could anyone tell me why I dont see any graphics when editing ui's?  I dont have any promblems except that :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance  <br />
<br />
I have asked this question also, and have yet to see an answer.<br />
Sometimes it will show my custom graphics and borders, sometimes not. It always displays my custom gauges incorrectly. As far as I have been able to determin, it is completely unusable for working on windows that have tabed pages in them.<br />
<br />
I just wish it would show windows close to the way they will look in game. There are a lot of really nice things that this program does that SIDLWidl does not do, and will never do because the developer abandoned it. =/<br />
<br />
I havn't dismissed the program at all. I keep an eye on this thread and try each new version. I'm looking forward to the day it will be usefull to me as a replacement for SIDLWidl, and will pay for it gladly on that day.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ambros</div><div class="date">03-06-2003, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can offer a couple of notes on your comments.<br />
<br />
First, there is an issue (at least one) dealing with TGA files.  I don't have expertise in this area; and Fiddle is using a third party TGA reader.  Part of the reason I put this in open source was the hope that someone with more graphics knowledge would have some solutions.  I can't solve your problem though, because I see my graphics.  I don't know if it has something to do with the format saved or something else (I know that MS photo editor saves TGA incorrectly).<br />
<br />
I am aware that tabs and gauges are displaying half-azzed, and it is on my list to fix.  In fact, try zooming with them!  Sucks.  <br />
<br />
If there are other features you would like to see, I encourage you to let me know and I'll try to include them if possible.<br />
<br />
I am working as hard as I can to resolve issues, but please remember that I'm working on this on the side as a hobby.  I'm sure the author of widl probably ended up being unable to devote the time and justify the expense to maintain and improve it.  I haven't reached this point yet, but certainly those concerns play into how much effort I can devote to the project.<br />
<br />
So, I guess my rambling comes down to this; if everyone just monitors for improvements then I end up with little feedback (other than complaints) and can only work on what I know is a problem for me atm.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drylar</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. Here's what I've done and what it's (not) doing. I installed the Java runtimes, then fiddle. I attempted to run it, and got a bunch of errors, checked the faq, then got the runtimes. (There are a few of us that DO check them!) I downloaded and installed the runtimes. <br />
<br />
All seemed fine and dandy, I chose the correct folder, and it fired up. I went and chose a skin, nothing happened (other than the radio button showed I had selected it.) I tried 'load screen', nada. On the listbox, I tried selecting 'PlayerWindow' and the status line said 'parsing d:\everquest\uifiles/EQ_Animations.xml' then it slid off the status bar, and nothing happened. I see no change in anything, other than the file selected now says PlayerWindow.<br />
<br />
None of the skins load anything, and I see the same parsing message whenever I attempt to load any file. It just never populates the element list.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something? Or did I do something wrong.<br />
...I just went and reinstalled it all over again... no change. <br />
...I just tried 0.7.2 and 0.7.1 and they do the same thing, and it appears that it does something (too quick to read) before getting stuck at parsing the animations file. <br />
<br />
Any ideas? It looks much more promising than SidlWidl, and would like to see something that is still active replace it. I'm not a fan of abandonware.<br />

Very impressive for a beta. There are a couple things I'd like to see changed/added...<br />
<br />
1). Gamma Correction is still having problems displaying window/element. Change the default GUI interface background to another color instead of black or add a user selectable color???<br />
<br />
2). Add &quot;Save AS&quot; to file menu so that window/elements being worked on can be saved to a new location. &quot;Copy XML file&quot; doesn't allow for renaming XML file. :(<br />
<br />
3). Add double-click to elements so they auto-launch the open screen GUI for that element (or window).<br />
<br />
4). Add grouping of elements together using the left mouse button. That way you can move individual elements as a group.<br />
<br />
5). &quot;Load Background Image&quot; defaults to the &quot;My Documents&quot; directory each time you launch the command. Change it to load from user-defined directory where image files are stored.<br />

Ok i followed the tutorial but to get as far as i did first i selected the default ui, then switched to another ui to edit<br />
<br />
then I chose the bankwnd and saw it parsing equi_animations.xml<br />
<br />
that scrolled off the bar to the left and then nothing, elements didnt fill out and screen remains black<br />

<br />
I've had the same problem and the only way I got it to work is to make a copy of the xml and copy the &lt;pieces&gt; back into the one I edited. if you add new elements, you should make a corresponding &lt;piece&gt;.</div></div><hr />

There should be enough information in there to answer the question you asked in your post.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For everyone else...<br />
<br />
I've never updated/created a UI before, but I believe I'm missing something.<br />
<br />
As a test, I created a new directory that contained a copy of all of the default UI files.  Then, I opened up a target window in fiddle and hit save.  I made no modifications to the window, I just wanted to test Fiddle's output.  Unfortunately, the target window now does not work within EQ. <br />
<br />
This makes me wonder if Fiddle is broken with the latest UI patch.  Has anyone else noticed this problem?  Am I missing something basic here?<br />
<br />
Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
edit: modified some english to make it more readable...</div></div><hr />

A: You must have the 0.7.* runtime libraries installed in the same directory as Fiddle. Download the runtime files and unzip them into your fiddle directory. <br />

After much &quot;fiddling&quot; :p   I have discovered a few things.  First I would advise loading a background image from a screenshot in game.  This will rid you of the black box.<br />
<br />
In the elements window at the very bottom I found an entry that was in bold.  When clicking on this entry and selecting &quot;open screen&quot; I got stuff to appear.<br />
