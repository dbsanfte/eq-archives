My gnome fell in love with t.king's Steamworks spellbar (http://pub165.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=221.topic)  and came up with this about a week ago.  I am still playing with it and having fun with the great artwork.<br />

I am debating what I should do with this.  I really can't wait to see what t.king comes up with for the rest of his Steamworks ui.  Also, the windows are a bit unconvetional.  I used the player window for my target and grp info and just have the grp window turned off in the ini file along with the casting window.  On the spellbar I combined the mana info and casting timer.  I wanted to cut down on the number of widows I have to have visible.  It seems to have worked ... for now.<br />
<br />
I had the most fun with the chat window.  Making a window template was very intersting.  But now that it is done, I can apply it to any window i want :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvasie</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now, the spell book only has the gnome border you see on the chat window.  I am not sure when Thomus will make a gnome book.  The book I am using is similiar in style to Aya's book but has a rusty metal background with the gnome border I mentioned.<br />
<br />
All the windows you see are seperates.  I don't use many console type UIs.  For general release, I will do a traditional hotbutton window.<br />
<br />
I haven't done anything with the inventory yet, as I don't have artwork.  But, depending on how much I am allowed to play with original spell bar artwork, I may make one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ascher</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thomas has a pretty decent full UI version of this interface, all his own work.  Look in the Tking/remi section of the downloads.<br />
<br />
He Calls it Steamworks (its currently beta) and works quite well.<br />
<br />
I can't wait for the full release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kuvasie and TKing worked together to make the one in beta right now.  Tking credited her with the help and work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvasie</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys.  I started to make the one you see here before I was asked to work with Thomus on the 'real' Steamworks.  I still have this laying around some where, but I doubt I will ever post it.  <br />
<br />
I know Thomus has some other add-ons planned for this, like extra slots for the hot button window, pet window and such.  I am not sure when he will be able to get it, but we will see.  <br />
<br />
If the beta turns out to be the 'final' version, then I will release small variations to the original.  As you can see from the screenshot above I use a very different setup from the default, and as much as I tried to use Steamworks in its original form, I couldn't - he he.  So I do have some tweaks to it.  But out of respect for Tom and his artwork I will wait.<br />

Personally the skin i would pay to get would be steamworks combined with vert. that would be sweet.</div></div><hr />
