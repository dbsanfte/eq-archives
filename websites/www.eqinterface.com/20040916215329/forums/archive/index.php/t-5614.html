<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hkTRox</div><div class="date">01-15-2003, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings Fellow Eq players.  I am one of the old ui lovers and was a bit mad when they decided to remove it.  I am confused with the new spell gems they don't make sense at all at times and really was use to the old ones.  So I have been working on bringing the old spell icons into the new ui.  It is a lot harder then you think.  Since Verant Combined different spell lines into one unified graphic I can not replace the icon with &quot;The Old One&quot; since there are 3 or 4 old ones that need to go there and it would confuse me more to have say the DD Vs Summoned line be a mound of dirt because it shares the same icon as my point blank area effect dd.  This happens often and going though about 700+(out of 3700+) spells so far that I've switch things for there are about 150 spells that will conflict each other.  So I have to either leave the new one or try and get Verant to make more numbers of textures.  They don't even have to be new just need more numbers to play with and have seperate spell lines look at a new number that could have the identical texture as it did before.  That would then give me an option to say make SoW and Spirit of Eagle have different icons like they use to or like the example I gave above.  Here is a screenshot of my work in progress.<br />

It would still have conflicts but there would not be as many and you could still understand what the spells are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hkTRox</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I worked on it somemore and yes I will have to agree with you the more classes I add in the more conflicts I get.  Was down to 1 in 3 spells would have the wrong graphic and that would be more confusing then having the new ones.  So I will break it down a per class Spell Icons.  Like you said there will still be conflicts and some will be pretty off sometimes but it is much better then having like everything conflict.  I'll let you know how it goes it shouldn't take me too long to have 2 or 3 classes out for old spell icons</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hkTRox</div><div class="date">01-26-2003, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay I've finished up my first conversion of the old spell icons into the new ui.  I'm pleased with the results for a class specific instead of doing them all in one.  There are much less conflicts with the class specific vs all in one .  I am planning on doing other Classes, I just did the druid first since I play one in EQ.  Yes you might be saying but there already is a spell icon conversion for a druid why did you make another?  I started mine before I discovered Tru_Soldier99's conversion.  Many of the icons will be similiar since we both did the Druid class.   *If you are reading this Tru_Soldier99 please e-mail me at mnxklunk@aol.com would like to chat with ya. :)*  I was thinking about not releasing mine at all but I figured having more choices doesn't hurt and it isn't like we are making money off this work, it is solely for the community.  Here is a link to a picture of all the icons and  the zip file with the icons in it.  I am still calling it beta since it is a first release and there might be some mistakes I havn't discovered.<br />

I updated my help file and uploaded the new version so any new downloaders won't get confused.  I am currently in the middle of doing ranger spell gems and so far it might be a ranger/dru combine since many of there spell lines are the same.  I'll let you know more about the ranger conversion sometime next week.  Sorry for not having any content but I thought this needed to be addressed.  I took down the old file here is a link to the new file.<br />
