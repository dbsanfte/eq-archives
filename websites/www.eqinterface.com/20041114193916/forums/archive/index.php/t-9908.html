<br />
Unfortunately, due to the way SOE has their UI elements coded it can not be fixed.<br />
<br />
That is why we put that error in big, just do not use your mouse to click hot keys and you should have no problems, 0 - 9 work without a problem.</div></div><hr />

Work is demanding a great deal of my attentions but I'm working to get a newer, high res, shot up and running for you guys which will be built using the same exact images that will be put into the next release.</div></div><hr />

;)  The majority of what you are seeing in version 1 are rips from screenshots and hand edits.<br />
<br />
The release I plan to post a screenshot of tonight will be hand recreated images in addition to the use of original elements obtained from the source graphic files sent to me by a member of the Turbine design team.<br />

Thanks for the praise on the UI!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shouldn't be too hard to code one of those up for yourself.  Personally I've never liked vertical effects windows as they seem to just take up more of my screen area which is why ACUI ships with horizontal.  :)<br />
<br />
Shouldn't be that hard for you to Mod up though. :)</div></div><hr />

If you don't know what I'm talking about I'll explain. When you get an adventure in LDON a blue line appears on your compass to direct you to the adventure. <br />
<br />
In ACUI, the blue line doesn't appear on the compass itself, but off to the left on the HP total. I've worked it out that, if you have 4 digit HP and you put the blue mark centered on the second digit, that will lead you to the dungeon, but it would be nice if it worked the way it was supposed to.</div></div><hr />

I was not aware of the problem given that I do not have, nor plan to get, LDON.  <br />

Hopefully Enok can do that quick code update on that one.<br />

<br />
ACUI 1.0 is no longer being actively developed.<br />
<br />
I am devoting all my time and resources into ACUI 2.0 (r3) given it is far superior in design in every way.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that either Enok or someone else will have produced a Compass Patch after not to long for the original 1.0 Interface though. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
A patch was made available for ACUI 1.0 today...<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=58399<br />
<br />
Please do NOT install it.<br />
<br />
This patch will replace the ACUI Graphics in some areas with the default images destroying the look and feel of the UI.<br />
<br />
A formal patch is coming soon and I would suggest you wait for that.<br />
<br />
I don't blame the author of this patch for any of these problems but in the future hope that anyone who is considering writing a patch to someone else's UI would consult them first.<br />

I did come up with an 'Official' patch however. You can get it here:<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?goto=newpost&amp;threadid=11107<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if you installed Vanyia's patch, this should overwrite the same files she fixed, just with 'Official' changes. I keep putting apostrophe's around Official because I hate using the word but want to make sure people know it's from the original XML author.<br />

<br />
I was on my way out to a program at a local store and saw the patch, threw it into my directory for a quick check and saw the issues it caused so I did a quick post here to prevent Enok and myself from being bombarded with &quot;Why doesn't this work right.&quot; messages. :)<br />

This is a recommended update for EVERYONE who uses ACUI as it fixes several bugs and adds a few new features...<br />

I'd also like to announce the opening of the Official ACUI WebSite! :)<br />
<br />
http://elezibeth.electric-cat.com/<br />

This site will be a launching pad for all future ACUI versions (However threads and downloads will still be provided here on EQInterface.com.)  The site will also be the place where applications for special testers on versions and features of the UI will be accepted!<br />
<br />
Take a look and let me know what you think!  It isn't done yet but I'm working on it!<br />

Hey there!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your comments regarding ACUI, hopefully Enok (The coder) will be able to address your questions regarding the cursor replacement and spellbook replacement soon!<br />
<br />
Regarding the next release, the new ACUI 2.1 cursor isn't going to actually be larger than the current one, however, it will be very different than the one you see now.<br />
<br />
You can see a preview of it on the ACUI 2.0 beta image on the ACUI site at http://elezibeth.electric-cat.com/.  :)<br />
<br />
If there is anything else, please let me know!  :)</div></div><hr />
