The only problem (post-LDoN) that I had with the fixed version was that the windows were scattered all over the place.  I was able to reposition them to where they needed to be, but it may be something you want to take a look at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vindico</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks I'll get right on that. I hadn't checked any of the resolutions besides the one I use which is 1600x1200.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vindico</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just released a modified v.3 called Woodsy Visage. General setup is the same, just different graphics. I also finally re-worked the borders, tabs, and titlebars so they look much cleaner now. I also worked up enough time to finally create a spell book. You can get it all here: http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2486<br />
<br />
More to come in the near future: new MP3 player, and different themes in addition to Woodsy.<br />
<br />
Feedback welcome!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nivek23</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a bit of a suggestion... Remove the spell cast timer thing from the player window and put it in a seperate window, or you can keep it in the window and just have another window for a special graphic when you cast, (For example Tkings Arcane cast bar) I suggeting this because I tried to export one from another UI.. and it broke the UI.. so If you could fix this I will be much appreciateive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vindico</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SO basically you like the guages style? I could take out the casting bar and release the player window seperate, however I think having the exp and aa gauges in this window may also cause compatability issues with other UI's. I will look into the matter. Thanks for your feedback! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nivek23</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not a problem, Just that book lag bug and maybe that spell cast bar fix, and I will be a happy camper, I really enjoy your wood UI... great job<br />
<br />
Edit - Oh, I also noticed another bug, when you try to click on another text box window to type things in (such as your tell window) It goes back to the default one, so in order to do the tells, I have to make it the default... Might be something worth looking in to</div></div><hr />
