<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curee</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I switched to the new UI, and downloaded Geddines target window which worked ok. After hearing issues with people losing stuff when dying, I decided to go back to the old UI. Now I have no target window, and Alt-t does nothing. I DL'd his file into 1 I created called default2, and ingame entered /loadskin default2, which activated his target window. Now my default2 file is gone (I did NOT delete or move it) In the patcher window, I've done a through file check, but have not yet been able to get my target window back. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curee</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know how to replace the target default. I did find my default2 file, but that didn't help any. In eqclient.ini I did find that &quot;hide target window&quot; was set to true, i changed to false, save, rebooted, still no luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's still a bit of a bug in the UI when it will read cords completely odd.<br />
<br />
To replace the Target window with hte default one: Go into your default2 folder and remove the file EQUI_TargetWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Don't nesessary delete it. Just remove it.<br />
<br />
Then load the UI again with /load default2 ( do not use a 1 at the end ).<br />
[or just start upEQ if you're on one machine]<br />
<br />
After that, you should see your window again. Once done, put the EQUI_TargetWindow.xml file back.<br />
<br />
Should be fine then. If you understand X,Y cordinates, I would suggest opening that file up and make sure that 'Location' 'X' and 'Y' in the 'Screen' tags at the end aren't too far set for your screen resolution.</div></div><hr />
