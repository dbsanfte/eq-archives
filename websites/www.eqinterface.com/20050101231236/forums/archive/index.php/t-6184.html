<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maelia</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone!<br />
 I started useing the UI just a few days ago. I built a skin useing the UIbuilder, Kaori 4.0/ Mods, the skin came out beautiful. :) <br />
Then I found a download in Inventory called tkinvpurp.zip. I would really like to add this to my UI but have no idea how to.<br />
 I downloaded it and unzipped it. Went into game and typed /loadskin &quot;name&quot;. I got my inventory but it set all of the other things from Kaori 4.0/ mod back to defult.<br />
 So if someone can tell me how to have my Kaori 4.0/ Mods with the tkinvpurp.zip at the same time it would be greatly appreciated. :D <br />
 I hope this made sence to someone. Thanks for listening!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maelia</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I did not.<br />
How would I do that? Both files are unzipped in their own folders.<br />
Do I create and new folder then drop them in?<br />
Ack, I am sorry if I sound like a complete moron. I am not really good with computers and don't want to mess anything up.  :( <br />
<br />
Thanks for replying so quickly. :D  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
by creating a third folder you created a new skin. and because it only had the inventory file the game loaded the rest of the files from the default folder<br />
<br />
what ya need do is copy the inventory fils it self (EQUI_Inventory.xml) into the same folder  that has the files ya got from the UIbuilder  if that folder alredy has a inventory  let it be overwriten and ya should be set to go <br />
<br />
dont be afrade to mess around with the uifiles you can not hurt any thing most that could happen is the ui will not work and load the default folder or if your were messing in the default folder it would be overwritten next time ya started the game. mess around, messing up is the best way to learn <br />
<br />
<br />
think of a ui folder like your bed room  and each file is a poster on your wall  that ya want to look at.  by putting the inventory xml in a new folder it was like  hanging  a new poster out in the hall that ya would have to get up walkou of the room to see(load a new ui folder)</div></div><hr />
