<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Find one that you like, download it.  Extract the zip to your drive:/.../everquest/uifiles folder.  Each ui should have its own folder after extraction.  Read any notes or readme files that are included.  Once you have everything extracted and any UI_Player_Server.ini file changes made it should load automatically into the game.  If it doesn't, open your options window, go to load skin and select the folder name of the UI.  Then you should be good to go.</div></div><hr />

Start here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5231). :)  Okay...going to go step by step on this one:<br />
<br />
1. Name of mod as in name of UI=Nightelf-2004 and location on site is in complete sets-<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?s=&amp;op=showfiles&amp;catid=61&amp;sortby=date&amp;sortorder=DESC<br />
and the author is Jethal<br />
<br />
2. My steps were as follows-going from the site on how to download.  I went to the Sony folder and into uifiles...made a new folder and named it.  Downloaded the named UI above to the new folder...extracted the files from the zipped folder...logged into EQ...went to download UI skin...named folder was there...clicked on it to download but then when it goes through the whole looking like you're zoning crap...it's the same old crappy default UI.<br />
<br />
3. I've looked through the folders and I do not see an errors folder anywhere in the everquest folder...<br />
<br />
4. I hope I've given enough and explained it well enough that someone might can help me???</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">try renaming the folder Kayanna<br />
<br />
EQ has trouble with spaces, some symbols and rarely name length.<br />
<br />
( btw your errors file is a txt file called UIerrors  it can be found in the &quot;sony\everquest&quot; folder, I'm asuming by what you posted above your path is C:\program files\sony\everquest )<br />
<br />
look for Error...  you might see Warnings but they are normal for modded UIs ( and the default UI after a long weekend ;)  )</div></div><hr />
