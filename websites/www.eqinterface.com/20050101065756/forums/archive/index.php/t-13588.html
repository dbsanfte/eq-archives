Whenever I get a rez and the window comes up to ask me if I want to accept or not [YES] or [NO] the yes and no buttons are missing and basically I get hung there until the window expires.  Not only does it do on rezzes but anything that requires you to interface yes or no with the game i. e. No drop loot and such.  Need help with this one please.  Probably something simple knowing me.<br />

The next time you get a confirmation box, it will show up the proper size and you will have your buttons back.<br />
<br />
This is the effect of a bug with confirmation windows.</div></div><hr />

Hubbie had the same problem with his 'Are you sure you want to pick up this NO DROP item&quot; window. It's only in one Zone, dreadlands. the specific Files are being corrupted. more specifically it's a Trojan that some of the files here seem to have even though there is a disclaimer that its a secure download :(</div></div><hr />

Hate to say it but run a Virus scanner. Hubbie had the same problem with his 'Are you sure you want to pick up this NO DROP item&quot; window. It's only in one Zone, dreadlands. the specific Files are being corrupted. more specifically it's a Trojan that some of the files here seem to have even though there is a disclaimer that its a secure download :(  <br />
<br />
Sorry this has nothing to do with a trojan or virus. Per your other post I ran 2 manual scanns with the latest clamscan(linux scanner) and found no infected files.</div></div><hr />

The window size was too small.  I had to go into the UI_Char_Server.ini file and get rid of the size limititations.<br />
<br />
Thank you Thank you Thank you.<br />

<br />
This bug came up in my UI, since I use a very small confirmation dialog.  People who tried to switch to default after using mine were missing the buttons.<br />
<br />
The bug is that the confirmation dialog uses the ini file to size the window even though it is not resizable.  I've put a request on the Wish List to fix this bug.  Hopefully someone at SOE will notice and get it fixed.</div></div><hr />
