<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xsikal</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having display issues with the new combat options window (see attached jpg).<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen anything similar?  The blue/grey tones are due to the fact that I am using a modified version of the old abbatoir UI, so all of my buttons (hotkeys etc.) are converted to that look and feel.<br />
<br />
I am getting no errors in my UIErrors.txt file, but, as you can see, the window is very screwed up. :)<br />
<br />
If you have seen this before, what did you do to fix it?  If you have not seen this before, can you think of anything I can do to fix it?  (I'd prefer to not drop the blue/grey textures, and don't know why that would mess up the window's look anyway, but am willing to try anything)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

Edit:  Wanted to add... I am unable to resize the window, so this is not simply a case of my window being too small for its contents.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenwoodx2</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's very simple actually..  The combat abilities window is using a file named window_pieces07.tga..  This appears to be a new file just for the buttons for this window..  Some of the custom UIs also have a file by this name..  Since this is found in your custom UI directory, EQ uses this file rather than the one in the default directory with the proper graphics..  <br />
<br />
You have three options to fix this..  either rename the default window_pieces07.tga file (after copying it to your custom UI folder) and then modify the combat abilities window to use the renamed file instead of the default (again a copy of it in your custom UI folder) ..  or make it use window_pieces06.tga buttons (which are pretty much identical except they go up to 10) provided you don't have a custom version of that file..  or rename the window_pieces07.tga file that came with your custom UI to something different, and then locate all the animations using that file and modify them to use the renamed file..  <br />
<br />
Basically it looks like it's a bad idea to use SoE's naming scheme for your graphics files, since you never know when they'll add a new file in ..  (unless you number your files above 100 or something)  I had to make this type of modification to one of my UIs by the way, since I had borrowed files from Kaori and the custom files were named window_pieces06.tga and window_pieces07.tga .. (I renamed them and changed the custom animations)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xsikal</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the reply.  I took a look at the .xml file (EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml) and it is actually using window_pieces06.tga, not window_pieces07.<br />
<br />
This makes sense, as I deleted the window_pieces07.tga file a long time ago from my custom folders because something else SOE introduced was using it.<br />
<br />
I'll get rid of the custom .tga file (either rename and modify my xml files or just delete the tga file and see what happens), and verify that this worked.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

I hadn't needed to modify it way back when because I was using a custom hotbuttons window and custom animations file..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Took everyone's advice, renamed my existing window_pieces06.tga, changed the existing references in the animations file, and all is good. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
