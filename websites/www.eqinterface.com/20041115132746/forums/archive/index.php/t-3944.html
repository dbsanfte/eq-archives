<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you ever hotkey'd an item, but worried about left-clicking it and accidently picking it up then dropping it and clicking yes to ok the drop? I know I have, but no longer do I have to fear such an improbable problem thanks to the new Paranoid Hot Key Mod (patent pending)! Hotkey'd items can still be right-clicked or their corresponding hotkey number pressed to activate them, but they cannot be picked up by left-clicking.<br />

I sorta rearranged the layering order of the hotbutton, item slot and spellgem slots, put in an invisible layer to guard the items and made a couple things transparent.<br />
<br />
A screenshot would be sorta pointless since it's basically just the default hot key box with no title bar. I guess I can get a screenshot when I log into EQ today but still, the screenshot won;t impress you.<br />

Left hotkey bank is what it looks like with the default skin (default windows_pieces tga files), right hotkey bank is what it looks like with my Enoks UI's skin.<br />

P.S. - Told you it wasn't impressive looking. But still, it does what I says; you can't pick up hotkey'd items by left-clicking. Also, the weird inventory pictures are also part of my custom UI stuff, they'd look like normal inventory slots if you used it. Sorry that I didn't get a better 'default' screenshot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just wondering how you did it because I'd like to do the same thing for my clickies slots if it's possible (I don't hotkey my clickies, 10 hotbuttons is barely enough as is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laenin Raidge</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting idea. I do hotkey some of my clickies because we have 10 easily accessible banks to store hotkeys. This seems nice for people who dont swap gear using hotkeys, like myself. I hate accidentally left clicking the item and its now on my cursor, and Im all kinds of confused. Good idea (if I used custom UI's). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">easily accessible ha! with 3 characters I have a hard enough time keeping track of which hotkey I have in which slot, without having to remember which of 10 slots on which of 10 pages. And then switching pages takes forever because I can't reach alt-combinations so I have to click through with the arrows.  I use page 1, and then I use page 2 to store the buttons that I can swap into page 1 if I'm doing weird things like corpse runs or pulling or main-healing, and then I have my clickies set up next  to my hotbuttons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laenin Raidge</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know what they say about people with small hands . . .<br />
<br />
Anyway, most people I know put their click items in their hotkeys. Some put weapons there, then other slots mapped to their inventory, so they can switch items around just using the hot button area. In any case, most of the high lvl people I know,  when displaying screenshots, always have cilcky things (that are useful) there. Im not going to block my screen with my inventory when I want to quick click my Pre Nerf COS or JBoots . . . <br />
<br />
Pretty much, when I need to shift (not alt) to other sets of hotkeys, I Stay within the first 5, because they are reachable with one hand. The others are reachable if you use 2 . . . You do use a human sized keyboard, right? 2 hands? I dont get it . . .<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I was just saying how this was a good job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh, it is a good job :) that's why I want to know how it's done<br />
<br />
and, well, the small hands thing doesn't apply to me anyway, I'm female :p <br />
<br />
I can of course reach shift (sorry) combinations using 2 hands but in-game my right hand is kind of needed for my mouse- unlike my brother I'm not talented enough to play EQ without one. So if I can't reach it with just my left hand, or if I can't recognize it by touch (another problem and the reason I haven't remapped things like that) it's pretty much useless to me.</div></div><hr />

I like girls with small hands. <br />

How YOU doin?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aeluin, I'm not sure if it'd work for non-hotkey item slots BUT I'll give it a shot and leave a post here with what I find.<br />
<br />
Also, Laenin Raidge, do YOU have small hands? Using my left hand, pinky on shift and index finger to press a number I can hit 1 through 8 without looking at the keyboard and I can hit 9 and 0 if I look down and really stretch my hand. 1 - 5? jebus man! Haha, too bad I only use hotkey bank 1 (page 2 if I'm using my right click staff instead of sword and shield) so I guess my talent is wasted. =D<br />

It's something special about hotkey'd inventory slots that allowed me to make it where the item can't be picked up but still be elft clicked.<br />
