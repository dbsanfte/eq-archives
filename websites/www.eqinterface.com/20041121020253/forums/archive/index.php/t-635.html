I believe when I saved mine I had to do it in 24 bit. Seems some stuff you can save in 32 bit and some you can't. Only thing I can think of is in 32bit the file size is too big. And if I remember right then when I saved in 32bit the picture wouldn't show either and this would happen in 16bit too.<br />
<br />
I'd try saving each way and I bet that fixes your problem :)</div></div><hr />

Many things I am not touching or trying too many boundaries until UI comes out of Beta.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xallaron</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This post was in the wrong spot. I meant to reply to another post which the guys graphic to replace the class animation wasn't showing up and his would not show in 32bit but like mine, but did in 24 bit. So not everything works with 32 bit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ runs in 16 or 32 bit.  Saving in 32 bit should be just fine.<br />
<br />
If needed, saving in 16 should work too.  24 will just downgrade to 16 bit, most likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xallaron</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok you try making a Class Animation and getting it to show in EQ with 32bit....so far I know of 2 people that couldn't do it in 32 bit. Also 16 bit I believe is too low for the same graphic too.</div></div><hr />
