<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lena</div><div class="date">12-02-2003, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1996 is the link to the Katn UI that I prefer though i've tried getting them all to load half a dozen or more times trying different methods.<br />
<br />
A couple of things I've tried are:<br />
<br />
Renaming: Mine for instance would be UI_Sassi_91, when this wouldn't work I started from scratch and renamed it UI_Sassi_Zebuxoruk. It still wouldn't load.<br />
<br />
I searched your forums for all posts by Katn and read them all. He's not posted any updates that I can find in the patches forum or archives. I then searched for others having trouble with his UI and found several but Vitaee had posted a &quot;forced fix&quot; some time back that worked for him. I tried it as well and it still wont load. I suspect that because the &quot;forced fix&quot; was back in October that recent patches have made this fix not obsolete but irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I tried the same UI on my husbands comp and one of my sons with the same issues. It wont load. I've read the readme file a bazillion times. It's not complicated, the UI just plain wont function.<br />
<br />
Could one of you in some free time take a look and see if it's not functioning because of incompatability issues due to patches? I know it's asking a lot but if it's something you enjoy, finding a fix would make my day and many others I suspect because the UI is simply incredible and shouldn't go to waste. :(</div></div><hr />
