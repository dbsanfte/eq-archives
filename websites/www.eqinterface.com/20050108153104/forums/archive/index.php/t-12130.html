<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mondinga</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to see the newer versions of Solara/Vert held to a 256x256 image size maximum for backward compatibility reasons. This means the solwindowpieces01-03 would be divided up. This is so that the UI's work on machines with older video cards like Voodoo 3's. On these cards the UI's are quite unusable; it's disapointing as these are the only two UI's that suit my and I'm sure plenty of others idea of what a usable UI is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Mondinga, The voodo 3 is not a supported card by SOE, and trying to redesign Solaria to 256 x 256 is really not possible since that some of the items are 300pix tall. <br />
<br />
I am sorry that your voodo 3 is not compatitible but might I suggest picking up a GeForce 2mx/400, you can get one for around 19.00-24.00 and it would also work with the 3-D targeting ring.<br />
<br />
Also the voodo 3 is know to have issues with Direct X 9.0 and I am guessing the new engine that is due out soon will be 9.0 or above only..<br />
<br />
Sooo while Dolby and I normally do all we can to accomodate Solaria users, in this case it's just not effective. Everything is moving forward.<br />
