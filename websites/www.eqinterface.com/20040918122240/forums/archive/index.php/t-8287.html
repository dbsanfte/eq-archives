Not saying you are doing that though hehe :P  have you tried to move it, to center it more?<br />
<br />
With the windows, just move the pet window and the hot buttons window..they lay over top...verant doesn't have a code where I can have the chat windows constantly in front of those 2 windows..Thats the next thing I wanna try to fix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I loaded other versions for my other characters...they seem to be fine.  Just lost it on my Mage.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

I've been fooling around with trying a new skin now for months.<br />
<br />
Finally, I DL'd this one and gave it a try.<br />
<br />
Overall, I rate it excellent in visual appeal. But, I have just a few issues with readability (I hope you don't mind):<br />
<br />
target bar is nearly obscured by the claw-like filligree in the center. I'd suggest adding a dark line around it--not a thin outline, but a wider line; or, filling in the negative space in the filligree with the same background you have on the chat windows. Anything that will relieve some of the business there.<br />
<br />
(oh, sorry, forgot to mention I am a graphic artist---so please don't be offended. I've been trained to do Advertising art so, take all this with a grain of salt :)<br />
<br />
Health and Mana bars: not prominant enough. Sorta small and hard to get an immediate update on how I'm surviving heh. Generally, the info at the bottom is a bit to small--at least for me.<br />
<br />
installing instructions: unless I'm a completly bumbling fool (and this may well be true) the UI did not install following your instructions---not completely, that is:<br />
<br />
I copied the files from my chosen resolution into the main folder (which I renamed, btw--though I don't think this was an issue). Next, I found the UI_&lt;name&gt;_&lt;servernumber&gt;, altered it (after frantically trying to find the number for my server which you find in your main EQ directory, btw for those of us who are clueless heh) then I replaced it as instructed, loaded up the game and got:<br />
<br />
all kinds of bizarro windows...a mix of the new and old, I think. Not quite sure. Anyway, I decided to do what the instructions in the PoP gamebook says: type /loadskin &lt;foldername&gt; &lt;1 or 0&gt; and I chose '1' since I wanted all my slots set up as I chose before. Voila, a matter of moments, and this lovely UI sorta manifested across my screen in graceful fashion :)<br />
<br />
Combat messages: could I please suggest a little more info be forthcoming than just the miss, and points of damage? I agree that the default messages are way too spammy. What about:<br />
<br />
&lt;short attacker name&gt;: miss or &lt;damage&gt;: &lt;target&gt;<br />
<br />
for example:<br />
<br />
Loda Kai: miss: &lt;my name&gt;<br />
&lt;my name&gt;: 27 slash: Loda Kai<br />
Warder: 30 slash: Loda Kai<br />
R Hopper: miss Warder (or Jimbob's Warder)<br />
Loda Kai: 5 punch: &lt;my name&gt;<br />
<br />
Or something similar? Right now, it's all determined simply by color of the text I chose (which I remember of course).<br />
<br />
Other than this, I really do miss the chat windows going transparent, but can deal. :)<br />
<br />
But, as I said above, this is a very pleasing and appealing UI and I very much like the spell icons and the animations, the overall design is wonderful.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
