<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">many people are having trouble with trying to get the custom patcher skins working, the errors they appear to be having a due to not reading the readme, so I will write a detailed ( as best I can ) workthrough here.<br />
<br />
Stage1, make a complete copy of the default folder found inside C:\program files\everquest\skins, for this workthrough I will call the file &quot;XXXX&quot;<br />
<br />
Stage2, unzip your selected custom skin and rename it main-bg.png<br />
<br />
Stage3, place the main-bg.png inside C:\program files\everquest\skins\XXXX\images, this will overwrite the default one.<br />
<br />
3a the XML file inside your custom folder MUST match the name of your custom folder exactly.  so if the folder is called XXXX the XML must be named XXXX not xxxx nor Xxxx.  Spaces are also not allowed, the game just wasn't programed to read spaces in folder or file names.<br />
<br />
Stage4, exit out of your custom folder and the skins folder you should now be in C:\program files\everquest.<br />
<br />
4a  locate a file called eqp_config.xml<br />
<br />
4b  open that file in a text editor, notepad will do fine. DO NOT USE DREAMWEAVER<br />
<br />
4c  add the line &lt;skin&gt;XXXX&lt;/skin&gt; inbetween the lines &lt;EQPatchConfig&gt; and &lt;textures&gt; ( note, this is the only place it will work, you cannot place the line anywhere else in eqp_config.xml )<br />
you should have this now<br />
&lt;EQPatchConfig&gt;<br />
&lt;skin&gt;XXXX&lt;/skin&gt;<br />
&lt;textures&gt;<br />
<br />
Stage5, save and exit the eqp_config.xml<br />
<br />
Stage6, run patcher/enjoy<br />
<br />
*note, the custom skin folder cannot contain &quot;-&quot; &quot;_&quot; &quot;+&quot; &quot;=&quot; &quot;()&quot; &quot;[]&quot; in other words letters only, also you cannot have a space in the folder name, the game does not understand spaces.<br />
<br />
<br />
SPECIAL RULES FOR THE XYM PATCHER INSTALLATION<br />
<br />
Stage1, make a complete copy of the default folder found inside X:%program files%\everquest\skins, for this workthrough I will call the file &quot;xym&quot;<br />
<br />
Stage2, unzip the Images Zip into this folder *refering to the folder called &quot;Images&quot; found inside the &quot;xym&quot; folder*<br />
<br />
Stage3, the XML file inside the xym folder MUST match the name of your custom folder exactly.  so if the folder is called xym the XML must be named xym not XYM nor Xym.  Spaces are also not allowed, the game just wasn't programed to read spaces in folder or file names.<br />
<br />
Stage4, exit out of your custom folder and the skins folder you should now be in C:\program files\everquest.<br />
<br />
4a  locate a file called eqp_config.xml<br />
<br />
4b  open that file in a text editor, notepad will do fine. DO NOT USE DREAMWEAVER<br />
<br />
4c  add the line &lt;skin&gt;xym&lt;/skin&gt; inbetween the lines &lt;EQPatchConfig&gt; and &lt;textures&gt; ( note, this is the only place it will work, you cannot place the line anywhere else in eqp_config.xml )<br />
you should have this now<br />
&lt;EQPatchConfig&gt;<br />
&lt;skin&gt;xym&lt;/skin&gt;<br />
&lt;textures&gt;<br />
<br />
Stage5, save and exit the eqp_config.xml<br />
<br />
Stage6, run patcher/enjoy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trafy</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've made a little program name EQNicePatcher.<br />
<br />
Juste put *.png pictures in the EQNicePatcher directory and it automaticly change the picture (randomly) and launch Everquest or other third party application.<br />
<br />
EQNicePatcher duplicate \skins\default directory to prevent any modification with futur EQ Patches, rename XML file and include &lt;skin&gt; tag.<br />
<br />
No installation need, juste edit the .INI file to indicate your EQ installation directory, pout png picture and launch EQNicePatcher... It's all :D <br />
<br />
Program can be downlad here (http://trafalga.free.fr/eqnicepatcher.zip)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qinadwen</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nicely done m8 - thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meridious</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could you explain that a little further and in a little more detail?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trafy</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hum... first, sorry for my bad english :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
EQNicePatcher automaticly made the modifications describe in the post by Taleisin and choose a random picture for the patcher's skin.<br />
<br />
Steps are :<br />
<br />
1/ delete the personnal folder with  the custom patcher skin if exist<br />
2/ copy directory skins\default to skins\perso<br />
3/ rename file skins\perso\default.xml to perso.xml<br />
4/ rename eqp_config.xml in eqp_config.xml.bak (erase previous .bak file)<br />
5/ create a new eqp_config.xml with &lt;skin&gt;perso&lt;/skin&gt; (auto erase previous tag before make change so tag is always at the good place)<br />
6/ choose a random PNG file in the EQNicePatcher directory and copy/rename it to skins\perso\images\main-bg.png<br />
7/ launch Everquest<br />
<br />
In the exemple, I use Perso for personnal folder. This directory is indicate in the INI file at line SkinName=Perso.<br />
<br />
The delete operation (step 1) can preserve delete file in the Windows trash if the line &quot;Trash=1&quot; exists in INI file.<br />
<br />
Step 1 and 2 are to preserve any bug with futur patch of Everquest. You have always the good files in your personnal patcher skin directory.<br />
<br />
Step 7 read the ligne EQExe to launch Everquest. You can use other third program if you don't launch EQ directly.</div></div><hr />

So this tutorial and maybe all of the patcher mod skins will most likely be removed soon to save server space.</div></div><hr />

woohoo new UI author...  though I'd like to point out the patcher XML is different from the UI XML  :p</div></div><hr />

Im getting  confused with what Folders you are  speaking of at certain times.<br />
 Also inside my eqp_config  there wasn't a &lt;texture&gt; line. Is there suppose to be?</div></div><hr />

<br />
what you change to main-bg.png is the patcher skin you download..  if you download one of mine it will be called (skinname)main-bg.png  you have to remove the part in red for it to work with the patcher.<br />
<br />
the folder itself can be called anything you want, as long as the XML file inside has the same name* see above tutorial<br />
so if your folder is called &quot;new&quot; you need to go inside of it and change the name of the xml from &quot;default&quot; to &quot;new&quot;<br />
<br />
as for your eqp_config.  you say there was no &lt;texture&gt; line?  please post a copy of it and I'll take a look.</div></div><hr />

-------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Just noticed the &lt;/textures&gt;&lt;/EQPatchConfig&gt; at the very bottom.. is that where I place it? Since you had &lt;EQPatchConfig&gt; written , and the way you had it lined up, I figured it was suppose to be a  &lt;texture&gt; near that one up top.<br />
Thanks for replying , and I'm gonna  give it a try again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Insert just before this &lt;textures&gt; tag.<br />
<br />
Or more simply, look my program describe in the 2nd reply. With it you don't have to make any modification yourself  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm I guess not all eqp_config.xml files are alike..  all mine are at the top<br />

&lt;skin&gt;xym&lt;/skin&gt;<br />
&lt;textures&gt;<br />
&lt;oldworld&gt;true&lt;/oldworld&gt;<br />
<br />
but he is right, just before the &lt;texture&gt; line should work</div></div><hr />
