Here's the deal.  This assumes you know the basics of how to open up and edit an ini file.  <br />
<br />
1.	Make sure you're logged out of EQ.<br />
<br />
2.	Open up your UI_Charname_Servername.ini file.<br />
<br />
3.	Use the search function to find Popdialog.<br />
<br />
4.	The first entry you find should be [PopDialog0]<br />
<br />
5.	Delete this entire section of the file. (For those that don't know, an ini file has a number of sections, each of which begins with a &quot;heading&quot; line that has a word encased in square brackets... for example [PopDialog0]<br />
<br />
6.	To clarify, put your cursor at the beginning of the line you found using the search function, and delete all the text up to but NOT including the next section heading.<br />
<br />
7.	Use the search function again to find and delete all sections that have a section heading similar to [PopDialog0].<br />
<br />
8.	Overall, you'll find and delete a section for [PopDialog0], [PopDiaglog1], [PopDialog2], etc.   How many you find will vary.  Make sure you delete all of them.<br />
<br />
9.	Save and exit this file, and then you should have working confirmation boxes in EQ.<br />
<br />

EDIT:  Dear Admins, since this topic comes up on a weekly basis, could you please put the above info into the FAQ??  Not that people bother reading the FAQ, but still....:)</div></div><hr />
