It's based of Drakah's &quot;Drakahmix&quot; UI (awesome work btw!), and the MMD winamp skin which I modified to fit with this ui.<br />
<br />
The spell icons are from the Beta WC3 icons.<br />
<br />
http://forums.legacyofvirtues.org/attach/soesui2.jpg <br />
<br />
Basically same UI as drakah's but more viewable area (configured by /viewport 0 0 1280 800)<br />
<br />
If anyone likes it I'll zip it up for download...<br />
<br />
*Update*<br />
<br />
Got the 1024x768 version working, obviously less viewable area, but hey.. it works :cool: <br />

/another edit: would like it if you could post some screenshots of your spellbook in my thread, as I was unaware mask of the hunter had the KEI icon.. etc.. would be helpful bro</div></div><hr />

I assume you missed this setting when changing it over to 1024x768.<br />
<br />
Also going to look into a mod to lay the window selector buttons and spell gems horizontal embedded into that top border graphic.<br />
maybe someone will get to this befor me. great job btw.. <br />
<br />
/update<br />
<br />
I have found that by editing the Y axis setting for ActionWindow in the UI_Name_##.ini file to something more like 100 rather then 728 of a possible 768 on a 1024x768 resolution that this can put the buttons onto the screen where you can see them. This is livable but still bugged.<br />
<br />
okay that makes the box visable, great right.. but you still can't drag and resize the dang thing right? okay well now you get to open up your text editor and play with some XML if you want. The settings for resizing this window are near the very end of the file you will find a size setting &quot;313&quot; which i would say make about &quot;213&quot; or so.. you can play with this number to reset the height of the window.  also right in that area you will see other options &quot;true&quot; &amp; &quot;false&quot; which just work as option switches for this. so you can toggle it being resizeable, minimizeable, with a border, header and so on.<br />
<br />
okay, well hope this helps someone work out bugs in there UI's that is or was as clueless as me earlier today.  pretty simple stuff really just conbined to look complicated. <br />
<br />
make backups of files you edit befor editing also so you can refer back to them just incase you mess up.. =) <br />

Did you copy the ini file out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eolorn</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having the same problem, I cant move the Alt+M or Alt+Y window. (pet and the options window)<br />
<br />
I followed the instructions as stated. Copied the UI_YOURCHARNAME_35.INI file to the EQ directory. (renaming it to my character of course). I moved out the file that was there before. (difference was 40.ini instead of 35 /shrug)<br />
<br />
All works great and looks great - except the above problems. I've been trying over and over to find something I like, and I think this is it! I'm just hoping we can find a solution to this somehow....<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Great work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pepsiblue</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I changed ini too , i get my xml files are not compatible but the mod loads, but dot know how to fix error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elpiper</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same here for the Alt-M window, it's stuck too low in the bottom-left corner.  Will try changing the position physically in the .INI file and see if that allows me to move it afterwards.<br />
<br />
I also noticed that the inventory was MUCH too large - basically I get everything in the upper-left part of what I assume is a much larger original Inventory window.<br />
<br />
I managed to switch your icons for t.king's icons without a problem, and on the whole I have to say I love this mod.<br />
<br />
*edit* I should also note that the MP3 window did not work for me, as some buttons overlapped and it overall looked &quot;scrunched up&quot;, but no biggie.<br />
<br />
I also managed to move the Actions Window by doing the following: <br />
<br />
- open the EQUI_ActionsWindow.xml file in a text editor<br />
- in the last paragraph, change the entry for  &lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;false&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt; to<br />
&lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;true&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;.<br />
<br />
This creates a titlebar by which I was able to move and position the menu where I wanted it.  Then I re-edited the file to remove the titlebar.  I made it appear over my group window, as I rarely use it (see attached image).<br />
<br />
The size of the Actions window is also set at 119x313, which makes it rather tall for no reason.  I changed that to 119x190 by changing the<br />
<br />
 &lt;Size&gt;<br />
  &lt;CX&gt;119&lt;/CX&gt; <br />
  &lt;CY&gt;313&lt;/CY&gt; <br />
 &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
<br />
in the last paragraph to<br />
<br />
 &lt;Size&gt;<br />
  &lt;CX&gt;119&lt;/CX&gt; <br />
  &lt;CY&gt;190&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
 &lt;/Size&gt;</div></div><hr />

Released Version 1.1<br />
<br />
- Fixed XML Error Bug<br />
- Fixed Actions Window (Smaller &amp; Movable)<br />
<br />
The player stat window is actually the Pet Info window (brought up by ALT+F1 if you can't see it). If you used the supplied .ini file though you *shouldn't* have any problems...<br />

Im using this mod for my beastlord in 1280 x 1024.  No problems yet.  But I was checking out my wife, who plays at 1024 x 768 and noticed a prob.  The vertical buffs when full to 15 is being covered up by part of your console.  I just downloaded a new buffwindow for her but thought you would wanna hear about the prob.  It was annoying to hear her asking for haste all the time when she had it. :D</div></div><hr />
