<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">09-03-2002, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everquest is (in most aspects) my favorite game of all time. There is very little I can really complain about... but everyone has their gripes and groans about certain parts. This be mine!<br />
<br />
What happened to mood setting music? This was, and still is, my biggest disappointment in the game.  The music got turned off a heck of a long time ago, and it definitely wasn't very impressive to begin with.<br />
<br />
For now, I use good ole WinAmp to play mp3 files while I'm clicking away in the world of EQ. It spices things up a bit, especially loading up a certain playlist during certain activities, such as exploring, fighting, travel, and questing. It gets me by and keeps me from going insane during the more uneventful periods in the game.<br />
<br />
Now for what I'm really getting to... something I haven't seen... and been wishing for. Ambient music for EQ! I've been hoping that one of these releases VI might surprise me and come out with a revamp of the horrible midi system it currently employs. I've lost faith, it seems it just isn't in the cards.<br />
<br />
But... <br />
<br />
Maybe it isn't hopeless after all... a program that was developed for parsing the log file and returning audio feedback in real time caught my attention. Most of you are probably familiar with it, EQWatcher. It led me to ponder if it might be possible to develop a program that takes over where Verant left off. Am I the only one wishing for something such as this?<br />
<br />
Via monitoring (in real time) of the log file, would it be possible to create an ambient music atmosphere by setting playlists in WinAmp based on input from the log monitor program? Even better, using your own MP3 files if desired? Oh how I would love that!<br />
 <br />
Using EQWatcher, I managed to accomplish this - in a manner. Setting keys to certain events, such as autoattack being engaged, the death of a mob, etc.  It was certainly interesting, but not quite effective. Due to limitations of the program, and the use of sync/non-sync sound events - the result was choppy at best.<br />
<br />
The question/challenge I'm setting forth is; can this be accomplished?  Is there someone out there with the knowledge, and desire to make this daydream a reality?<br />
<br />
Discussion, comments, and ideas are more than welcome.</div></div><hr />

What you're asking to do would be .... interesting to say the least, but after a while it may start to get a little annoying =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id have to agree with you on this topic... the music is very 'annoying' and my god the ticking in Ak'anon (its no wonder why there is shadowknights and necro's there.. it drove them insane and made them start raising the dead to end it.. diff topic..) but seriously.. the main reason that I can surmise as to the reason they use midi style music... size. It is a very small file and therefore takes up less space on disc rather than mp3 (as any good 'napster downloader' can agree upon), or wav (eek), or any other format (too many to list individually here). Oh granted there are a few formats which press down the file size to nearly midi size, but those too sound tinny (sp?) let alone cheap sounding. Midi is an all around solution as most (if not all) systems are capable of playing midi formats without any problems, and once again the primary player here is file size. But i do have to agree with you, they seriously need to update the music style or at least the format. Too many locations share the same song too many times... and to paraphrase an old quote &quot;I want my MTV&quot;... (the old MTV that is)... just me 2pence...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bummey, how could it get annoying? I'm not understanding.<br />
I think it would be great... the ability to load up a playlist based on in game events would be the ultimate.<br />
<br />
You could use some good 'fantasy' music, classical, etc.  Heck, you could even crank up a set of your favorite aggressive tunes for when you are attacking! Metallica, Disturbed, etc etc...<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about loading up one specific song, that would be better for a while, but then you'd get bored of it. I'm proposing that it loads a playlist of a distinct mood of music to set a tone. Best of all, the playlist could be changed/edited at whim, so it never gets repetitious.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
I've been doing some more fiddling, and using a crossfader directsound output in Winamp I was able to get much smoother transitions. The only functionality I am missing is the ability to load playlists on the fly - and have begun discussion about it with the author of EQWatcher. The program should, I believe, have enough flexibility and robustness to handle fairly complex sets of triggers to handle 'mood' alterations due to in game actions.<br />
<br />
In the least, it will be interesting to see what comes of it. Incidentally I was informed that VI is doing some minor revamping of the music/sound system on the test server in the near future. Nothing close to what I'm attempting, but it will be nice to see what they are up to.</div></div><hr />

Midi is an all around solution as most (if not all) systems are capable of playing midi formats without any problems, <br />
<br />
They raised the bar for computer specs a long time ago and everyone followed, I'm sure changing the format of music to MP3 wouldn't make them raise it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason for the MIDI based engine is obviously size, as has been said before. But now verant is realizing that, while their game has come leaps and bounds in graphics technology and gameplay, its sound engine is still hobbling along, sometimes working sparingly, sometimes not working at all.<br />
<br />
So they're revamping it.<br />
<br />
Although the last patch made the sounds a bit &quot;worse&quot;, in my opinion (simply meaning that the midi music is more jumpy and, as a gm i talked to recently put it, very &quot;ethel murman-esque&quot;), they're obviously working on it--and as they said, it will be a long road. <br />
<br />
There's no excuse in these days for music in a high tech game to be lackluster and barely work. And verant recognises it, and fortunately, they're at least trying to do something about it. I've got a feeling that before it's through, we'll see much better ambient sound (a3d?) and perhaps a whole music system overhaul--though i doubt that they'd re-release the midis in a more dependable format simply because it would be such a huge file, they may do so in an expansion.<br />
<br />
 I'm sure that, if we wait a while, things will get better, and much more so. The actual tunes in the game are very nice; if only it had a system to make it shine. I'm holding out, because I think Verant will come through--eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jahari Durden</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like the EQWatcher idea.. 't would be a reason for me to install that program again..<br />
<br />
Other than that, I just hope the &quot;new&quot; or at least overhauled music engine will bring some positive changes. :) I don't think I've ever even heard the ingame music.. Turned it of straight away after hearing the midi-sounds in the installation. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Argh!<br />
New patch totally screwed over my sound, don't know if its just me. I submitted a bug report with system hardware and specs, along with the problems. Those problems are, cut-out of sound in general, crackling/popping, sudden changes in volume, ambient sounds (IE: rainfall) totally overpowering other sounds, changes in form (horses/illusions/wolf-form) cause character movement sounds to become either totally overpowering or nonexistent.<br />
<br />
Alright, I can deal with that... but... they also broke the /note function as pertains to EQWatcher! /panic<br />
So the work I was doing is on hold pending fixes to the program and/or /note function. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No your not the only one... hell in the load up screen just when I thought my sound was repaired near the end it starts to pop and crackle like an old vinyl record and a bad needle (gah showing my age here!)<br />
<br />
I personally dont think that the revamping is going to be a new format, but merely and updated midi.. there have been some improvements in the midi format lately to give a more realistic sound to it, but yet it still sounds like the one we've all grown old with. True that Verant has finally seen the music (so to speak) and realized that it needs tuning... but if they plan on using the same format, all its going to be is a New Shine finish (as per the commerical). The old car may look brand new, but its still an old car. It would be nice if they could go to MP3, but I can just imagine the patch on that... my god and you thought the last mega patch took a while... gads just one mp3 song with the updated mp3 format would be murder! You'd see hell run rampant on that day... its going to be interesting to see what Verant is going to come out with... Come on Verant! You work with Sony (a music industry top) lets see something good!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadeweaver</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well... solving the patching on the mp3 switchover wouldnt be too hard. They could solve that by implementing over time. However, a better, and perhaps more userfriendly solution would be to upgrade the /mcicontrol command to be more userfriendly. That way they could provide an alternative, instead of a replacement of the midi system. Perhaps with the use of .m3u, you could get remotely the feel of an ingame system, controlling the music with socials, e.g /mcicontrol combat.m3u (I havent, by the way, even tried to figure out the /mcicontrol system. Too complicated and ackward to use at the time being... at least for my taste)<br />
<br />
A second way would be to just implement support for the mp3 format for the time being, and then supplying the actual audio material bit by bit over the future patches. So, that in the meantime users could add their own &quot;enviromental&quot; music.<br />
<br />
I am ofcourse just tossing around ideas here, but solutions is there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good points indeed! Though lets just take a big look back at Verants patchwork... everything they have done is always on a big patch. Guess they dont look at it as you and I, one little patch here, and another one here (though they do quite a lot of patch here and there).. but for the most part all their patches are HUGE one time deals (time saver for them i suppose). But I do agree with your idea of the occasional patch, do the primary MP3 format download and gradually add music patches a few days at a time, or allow people to add their own musical score to the list by merely changing the name of the song. As for the MCI program.. I have messed with it, and my god... the first time I used it.. the music came blaring over my speakers (had to do some volume tweaking on that one and quick!) But unfortunately you just cant stop the music (anything short of actually pausing or stopping the music manually) when you leave an area or change it when you want  combat music (unless again you do it manually)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadeweaver</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. this idea is sort of ripped from the setup of the Sims sound system, but how about enabling folders to control the different soundscores?<br />
<br />
Aside from direct zone related music, there could be folders where you put the music to be played in that situation.<br />
<br />
e.g:<br />
<br />
/combat<br />
/city<br />
/sea<br />
/plains<br />
/spooky<br />
/forest<br />
<br />
etc... etc<br />
<br />
Tossing ideas again, btw. Not that I even for a second think that Verant will ever see this, or regard it as a plausible solution. Allowed to dream arent I?</div></div><hr />

But.. soon it just would buzz or hang.. choppy so i started playing without sound and turned up the jam box.. which in turn got me doing..  /sings...  role with it baby...  <br />
i got lots of response out of this and i became well known for bursting out in song..  and ppl started doing the same..   so.. i would like the idea of loading up my own music to listen to..  <br />
sometimes the lag mades it hard to type it as fast as its sung though..  have a guildie that will say.. Honey sing me a song. hehe..  now if this gets implimated i hope its easy to input in the game..   &lt;newbie&gt;  :cool:</div></div><hr />

 we'll see much better ambient sound (a3d?)<br />
<br />
I sure hope to god they don't use a3d... I think the only company who produced a3d cards went out of business anyway and I haven't seen a game support it, ever. EAX is definatly the way to go, although It would probably be a waste of time this late in EQ's life to redo the sound engine w/ something that jazzy. Just something that sounds nice would work for me and is always there =)</div></div><hr />

In fact the official EQ Website stated that SB Live Series are having issues with their music program. Its a shame too, because I'm sure that majority (if not a large portion of the EQ community) are using SB, if not SB Live series. I dont know... I have a feeling that someone is spiking the doughnuts at the office and getting everyone hopped on Goofballs. If they are going to make changes to any programs, they should test them with the most available cards out. Im sure they dont program and test their game on one computer in some guy's cubical. &quot;Hey Jeff... if your done with your accounting, Mary has to get in there and check her EULA additions and then I get it...

Often while fighting the sounds will replay over and over again for no real reason.  It gets quite annoying to keep hearing &quot;ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh.&quot;  I often have to turn off my speakers or just turn the sound effects all the way down in the options menu.  I wish VI would fix these problems, but I wouldn't hold my breath.  With all the crap going on with their CS I doubt they will take the time to fix their sound problems.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From an interview on GameSpy:<br />
<br />
GameSpy: Final Question: what's the one thing you want our readers to know about this expansion? <br />
<br />
Robert: Well, you should know (if you don't already) that PoP will have: <br />
<br />
Thousands of new weapons and items <br />
20 new zones <br />
More than 70 new NPC models <br />
100s of new trade skills and recipes <br />
New multi-grouping system (raids) that allows up to 60 players to team together New quest system that allows unprecedented depths of gameplay <br />
A huge quest that ties the entire expansion together <br />
In game MP3 music <br />
Planar hub for easy travel between areas of Norrath More than 100 new Alternate <br />
Advancements More than 100 new spells <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I emboldened that one point of interest so you would notice it. Aparently verant is being EXTREMELY cryptic about this for some reason. You'll note that nowhere in the patch messages or features lists of PoP, on the official website or otherwise, is this &quot;in game mp3&quot; smidgeon found. Only a few other things hint at it:<br />
<br />
-For those of you lucky bastages who preordered PoP early enough to get the special offer to buy the &quot;everquest CD soundtrack&quot; for $5 before the supplies ran out (And really, who didn't see that coming? :rolleyes: ), you're probably clever enough to know that mp3s are the format of choice on CDs. I don't know what's on the disk, because practically all information about it anywhere on the official site has dissapeared.<br />
<br />
-The file (mp3index.txt), as you pointed out, is a simple listing. It is a listing of the mp3 filenames EQ is allowed to load. It is as follows:<br />
<br />
bothunder.mp3<br />
codecay.mp3<br />
combattheme1.mp3<br />
combattheme2.mp3<br />
deaththeme.mp3<br />
eqtheme.mp3<br />
hohonor.mp3<br />
poair.mp3<br />
podisease.mp3<br />
poearth.mp3<br />
pofire.mp3<br />
poinnovation.mp3<br />
pojustice.mp3<br />
poknowledge.mp3<br />
ponightmare.mp3<br />
postorms.mp3<br />
potactics.mp3<br />
potime.mp3<br />
potorment.mp3<br />
potranquility.mp3<br />
povalor.mp3<br />
powar.mp3<br />
powater.mp3<br />
solrotower.mp3<br />
<br />
You'll notice, if you're minutely clever, that those all have to do with PoP zones. Nothing else. SO, my comrades, it looks like, for now at least, the only place you'll be hearing snazzy non-crappy format mp3 music is in the PoP zones. Will they be adding more? Is that &quot;Everquest Soundtrack CD&quot; what contains the mp3 versions of the already existing musical tracs (which, by the way, is quite nice if they were in a good format)?<br />
<br />
You'll notice that it's just a text file, brought by the patcher into the *main directory*. Not only does that mean we cannot legally edit it, but it will be overwritten by the patcher if we do. So you can't replace, say, &quot;powar.mp3&quot; with, say, &quot;Everlast - Who Got the Hooch.mp3&quot; and expect it to let you slide. Even if you edit it after the patcher, or if you're crafty and rename one of your favorite .mp3's to one of the ones on the list, I'm guessing it has some kind of checker--since the music files will likely be in the main directory also, because there's no new folder--for the date edited, or file size, or what have you. <br />
<br />
My speculation: The folks at veran..err, sorry, Sony Online Entertainment have put some time into making brand-spankin'-new mp3 format music for their new expansion, and these files will be included with the rest of the expansion on the disk. The other songs, however, are either not finished yet, or not ready for the public by whatever devious schemes verant is planning, OR are already included on the &quot;Everquest Soundtrack CD&quot; that some of you lucky bastages will be getting, and the rest of us will have to wait for verant to restock it and PAY THEM to get the new music files. Which kind of makes sence, in a backwards sort of way. I won't know more to speculate on untill i've actually installed PoP and my sexzay Firiona Vie collector's edition figurine is firmly in my grip. I'm guessing a lot of you will be doing the same thing.<br />
<br />
-Casa out.<br />
<br />
Edit: Glancing at my patcher, i noticed this file: eqtheme.mp3<br />
When the servers come back on, you all will be treated to a masterpiece. It is awe inspiring. It nearly brought me to tears.<br />
Okay, it wasn't that amazing, but after 4 years of listening to old junk midi format sound batches, it was extrememly pleasing to the ears.<br />
You will all go, immediatly, into your patches folder, arrange the files by date, find and run eqtheme.mp3. Now! Go and be pleased! I cannot wait until i get my PoP disk now. Have fun, kids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I really like the MIDI soundtrack in EQ.<br />
<br />
I have a SB Live card and I play EQ on Windows ME.  (I also use Windows XP, but as many of you know the sound is screwed in Windows xP for EQ)<br />
<br />
Now, when I load EQ in Windows ME, even the starting theme sound sounds wonderful!  Not tinny at all!  Very rich and full, like an actual orchestra.  That was the reason I bought the SB Live card in the first place.<br />
<br />
Now, I will say that the new mp3 intro sounds pretty nice, and it ran pretty well.  But I really hope they maintain some of the midi that is currently out there..<br />
<br />
Last night I went shopping at a merchant.  And I couldn't leave!  The music was sooo nice!  They patched the sound engine you say?  It made a HUGE difference for some of the midi songs.  The music sounded so peaceful.... it was just nice.  Again, not tinny.<br />
<br />
So what I hope they do with mp3s is allow user customization.  (Like many of you have said).  They really ought to just extend the UI directory for the sound as well.  Users can already change basically EVERYTHING about their interface.  Why not the sound?<br />
<br />
Anyway, just my 6 sp.<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

yep I know.. I dont even own PoP yet.  I may only get it for the new zone artwork ;)  but only after the patch craze is over.<br />

I had to hear the new theme.. gotta say its not bad. :nana:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey at least its a start with the theme. Better than the tinny crackly one they originally had. At least its deep and theaterical sounding. Plan on purchasing PoP today. Was pretty weird to see the book on the pedestle near the newbie zone in Everfrost (take a left when you first enter the newbie zone after the ramp).. there it sits alone along the wall. Gonna be interesting to see the new stuff. And finally get some decent music.. (though Im gonna change a few songs probably).<br />

<br />
Actually Casandunda, if you alter the files AFTER the patcher has ran, you can alter the files and listen to the music you changed it with (just make sure to name it after the file you want to change). I do that with my eqtheme file with &quot;Anvil of Crom&quot; and it works... I love how it fades when you get on the game. Sweet. Yeah its a hassle but at least you have the music you want. Just make sure you alter the files AFTER the patch has ran, otherwise its just copies over the files you altered. Good luck to you all! <br />

(yeah I know I repeated myself from the previous post.. sorry) :nana:<br />
<br />
--edit-- Forgot to add... you'll have to do this everytime you log onto EQ, because as Casandunda states it does copy over your altered files... hassle yes... but benefit to listen to your music.. priceless..</div></div><hr />

<br />
(Make sure you read comment 2, it's much more important than comment 1)<br />
One, I personally like MIDI's because I have this ancient, weird, at it's time super expensive soundcard made by Yamaha that produces the most rich instrumental sounds when playing midi files, so in nearly every case, when I play a MIDI file it sounds great. On my new computer though I have an SB Live and MIDI's are bleh. Sometimes I actually go to my old computer (it's now an answering machine) and play MIDI files for memories' sake.<br />
<br />
Two, I have experience with programming that involves active parsing of the EQ log file, SO I could make what Tellgar wanted, something that plays MP3's (through Winamp, don't wanna waste time coding my own MP3 player) when events happen in game. BUT, I will only do this if there is interest in it. I won't claim authorship of the program Ever-Bot (http://everbot.cjb.net) as it's author wishes to remain anonymous (*wink*) and out of SOE's view, but this would be an addition to said program. Currently Ever-Bot mainly just does text-to-speech conversion for EverQuest chat so you can hear people say things, but throwing in MP3 playing based on text triggers would be quite simple. Anyways, if this interests anyone I'll set aside some time to make it, but I need input, what triggers are important for music playing? Zoning, fighting, dying, leveling? And should Winamp be made to load playlists and randomly pick a song from it (Winamp can do that right? I never use random).<br />

<br />
I'll try and get around to taking a look at it. Currently I've continued experimenting with EQWatcher, scripting triggers for sound events etc.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I'm sure there'd be interest in any number of different projects. How much interest can never really be predicted.</div></div><hr />

I thought most of it was very good @ setting a mood. Jay Barbeau did an excellent job composing them, imo. I especially liked the Qeynos Hills and Qeynos Town themes. The Qeynos Town Theme gives such a sense of greatness and glory. :) And then there's the original EQ theme... :D I'd sent in an email to sony awhile back asking why they turned off the music and they said it was accidental for the most part, from what I remember. THey've begun to reinstate it. I miss the old battle music... good thing I have the entire zip collection of old EQ MIDI music... :p</div></div><hr />
