<br />
     First I want to say that this one change to EQ has generated some of the best creative life in EQ that it's seen in a long time. The work all you programming types have done is fabulous.<br />
<br />
     I have a request though, You know when you are browsing the Bazaar Search window and you hover your mouse cursor on a line... and that stupid message pops up to tell you to &quot;Right Click to inspect and item or Right Click a trader to point his way&quot;... I MUST GET RID OF THAT!!!! Grrr.. It was fine the first time or two.. but now it's in the way!<br />
<br />
     Is there a simple way of taking that out? A simple line in the XML file that I change from True to False? or does it take a deeper change to the Bazaar search XML?<br />
<br />
     I am not a &quot;Programmer&quot; but I know the basics and can decypher most things if given enough time.. It would take me forever to track this down on my own and could possibly mess my UI up while testing it. I wondered if someone had stumbled across this already.<br />
<br />
     Thanks, and everyone, Keep up the great work!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arantius</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes in my UI I have removed all tooltips besides pesky hardcoded ones like the buff icons and such.  Anywhere in an XML file that says &lt;ToolTip&gt;Blah&lt;/ToolTip&gt; , it's safe to delete that line, and that blue box won't pop up anymore.  And agreed, that is one annoying tooltip (And it seems 99% of the people still don't know to right click on someone's name on their own).</div></div><hr />

Is there a &quot;Remark&quot; statement for a line.. incase I wanted to test something without deleting the whole line?</div></div><hr />
