<br />
First, I'm sorry if this is an annoying question. I truly have used search, and tried to dig up an answer to my issue. But I've had no luck, the only other thing I know to do is post here and ask for help from you, or others who may know.<br />
<br />
First, awesome UI and a big thank you to Infinity. It's my absolute favorite I've ever seen. <br />
<br />
This is the link to the UI on the site here. <br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1826<br />
<br />
You can see the screenshot and such and how it's supposed to appear there.<br />
<br />
The only issue I have, is this:<br />
<br />
I've downloaded the Infiniti1_7.zip. I get into game, and I can use it fine, except for two issues;<br />
<br />
1) The Inventory screen is clear. There's no 'blue' backing to it.<br />
<br />
2) The same deal for the spellbook. No blue background, just clear.<br />
<br />
I did check my fade and transparancy levels individually on the two boxes (Inventory and Spellbook) and everything, and all are set to 100%. <br />
<br />
Just to see what happened, I downloaded Infinium <br />
(another of Infinitys UI's) and tried it, and the blue background shows up fine on the Inventory and Spellbook with it. <br />
<br />
What can I do to get the blue background to show up for the spellbook and inventory on infiniti1_7? I even downloaded it twice, just to be certain something didn't go loopy in those regards.<br />
<br />
I'm real sorry to inconvenience you with another question, but I really love the UI, it's just that without that blue background in the inventory screen and spellbook, it's very difficult to make the lettering/etc out. <br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
