    I've just gotten back into EQ and found the new UI.  Upon reading the latest /GUCOMICS, I saw the link for EQinterface.com.  On that site it has listed a section for UI editor, but it's been pulled.<br />
    Is there a user friendly UI editor available out there, I'm not to familiar with XML (never used it actually).<br />
    I appreciate any comments or suggestions that may help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Felessan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">psychogears</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the editor that most of us are using are either Notepad(or any other text editor of your choice) or XMLPad that has a 30-day free trial thingy. I use Notepad.<br />
<br />
As far as a user friendly one, I don't know of any. I know the link you're talking about but that one wasn't working right. So for now, just doing it by hand in a text editor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weredragon</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am already have all the Node objects coded in one program I am making for a WYSIWYG EQ UI Skin Viewew that will let you see, modify, adding and removing of objects (EQUIS as I have it named).  It currently Reads and parses every object the is in EQUI.xml.  The current part I am working on is syntax checking, and a TGA ActiveX Component for the program (I would LOVE to have someone to do that component for me though while I work on the syntax coding). <br />
<br />
So in short, one is in the works, and is 1/4 done in only 1 week.<br />
<br />
So Hang On!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For all of you using notepad, try downloading EditPad Lite. It's free and 1,000,000 times more useful since you can set file associations from within the program itself.<br />
<br />
If you still want to view the files with IE ( I don't know why you would), there's an IE button you can click on the toolbar. Extremely useful for me since I hate WYSIWYG HTML editors.</div></div><hr />

You will have a Startup list of current &quot;resources&quot; (objects) wich you can open then modify in a parameter window.  Windows of the objects willl let you include those resources as if your working on a form.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gendal</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Working on a similiar project atm, posted a set of ss's on the casters realm at (http://forums.crgaming.com/cgi-bin/eq/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=307&amp;t=000199). <br />
<br />
I am back now and working again on it but an alpha version just depends on how much free time I get =p<br />
<br />
Btw getting a tga file imported with the alpha channel intact was probably the hardest thing I have had to do. Using the PaintX library you can write a dll to get you the tga with alpha channel, but you can't use the active x paintx control to import stuff because it gives you a CPiture I believe with out an alpha channel (I think). I got around it by using the paintx library with a custom dll, using that to import the bitmap with alphachannel not premultiplied and then writing it into a c# .net image bitmap myself. big ol pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />

Please add me to the beta list as well. I have never messed with xml before and would like something like EQUIS to help with the editing of the xml code.:nana:</div></div><hr />
