I got rid of all my custom files, started from the new default files, and started plugging in customizations one after another.<br />
<br />
However, the moment I had to run Remmy.exe to try to set up my spell gems and/or class animations, my custom UI would fail and load up as default.  Luckily, the &quot;restore&quot; feature works fine, but in the meantime, no animations for me.<br />
<br />
Anyone else wanna verify that the 9/9 remmy.exe (or the earlier one, for that matter--I tried both) isn't working with the new with the new patch?<br />

<br />
If you have an animations.xml file in your custom skin directory you will need to delete it.<br />
<br />
Then copy the above file remmy.exe (after you unzip it) to your custom directory and run it.<br />
<br />
Now you are ready to add in any of the other animations such as class animations from t.king</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remelio</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need to delete your current animation file.<br />
<br />
This file is meant to be used in place of any file that includes a remmy.exe - use this version instead of the one included in the zip file until further notice.<br />
<br />
For those of you exhibiting errors, I'm working on a &quot;no frills&quot; version that will just *run* (no progress bar, no neat buttons)<br />
<br />
Hope this clears things up.</div></div><hr />

I admit, readily, that I am a complete and utter noob.<br />
That said, I have a question regarding my Animations file.... <br />
Why is it the one used PRIOR to running Remmy.exe is 177 KB, while the 'adjusted' version present afterwards is only 17.4 KB?<br />
<br />
Please try not to fall over laughing or roll y'er eyes too much.  I really want to know. :confused:</div></div><hr />

Everything is working just fine, but no matter what I do, I get the ranger animation for all of characters.  I've tried installing the specific class animations and rerunning that patch inside each of the folders, but it doesn't seem to notice.  <br />
<br />
I'll be the first to admit I'm just short of computer illiterate, but I'd love to have someone attempt to help me correct this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay...I'm not going to ask how you wrote that into the code cuz I'd just go cross-eyed trying to figure it out.  I was testing all the skins on my ranger, so the other animations wouldn't work.  But when I logged in the Mage, the magician animation worked, and the same for my druid and cleric and their respective animations.<br />
<br />
Anyway...guess my problem wasn't anything more than operator error (as if that's anything new).  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creator</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well after 5 hours of frustration...<br />
<br />
You have become better at teaching yourself about computers! (3)<br />
<br />
...I decided to search the help forum.<br />
<br />
Much to my pleasure I found a topic related to my own, and didn't start a new one.  Fear Kudane.<br />
<br />
For three years (could it be longer!? ~gasp~) I've hated the default enchanter class animation.  Nothing has ever been as poorly thought out as a the lazy leather eye of insanity.  I would avoid opening my inventory window's before the new UI's were available.<br />
<br />
So I found a UI with no class animation (note, make sure your UI's inventory window contains the class animation area) which I liked very much.  <br />
<br />
Untill I saw T.King's work.  This class animation inpired me to change over my whole UI.  My character is bald.<br />
<br />
Using this new Remmy zip I got it to work.  I had tears of joy to finally see it and not have to log on and off to test for the 84th time.<br />
<br />
Here is how I used this fix and had it work.<br />
<br />
I reinstalled the enchanter class animation zip.  When prompted to autorun Remmy, left the box highlighted and continued.  But when Remmy camp up, I hit the close window.  You may be able to just say no to the auto run (as this included version was not working) but I want to tell you exactly how it worked for me.<br />
<br />
So my custom UI file contains all the animation files, but I have not patched it with Remmy yet.  I then unzipped the 'New' Remmy version included in this post by Remelio (You are my hero) into my custom UI file, replacing the one that was included in the animation zip.<br />
<br />
Ran the new Remmy file, hit the patch button.  Logged on.<br />
<br />
Happiest enchanter in the world.<br />
<br />
Good luck.  :) <br />
