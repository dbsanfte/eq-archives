<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slashro</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This appears to be a result of the patch that prevents hitting the esc button and accidentally closing popup windows.  I am having the same problem with all popup-type windows, rez boxes, no drop boxes, delete confirmation, drop confirmation, etc.  Any one know what file this might be that has these in them?  I will continue to look but have not found it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remelio</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">equi_confirmation_dialog.xml<br />
<br />
or something like that.<br />
<br />
If you notice, you get a UI error every time you log in because the default file is missing the cancel button.</div></div><hr />

I don't know enough to be sure of the next step.  Should I look for the equi_confirmation_dialog.xml file to be present in the folder of whichever UI I'm running?<br />

Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drachandor</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completely uninstalled EQ.  I then went through and deleted the Everquest folder from my machine.  I then completely re-installed the game.  This solved the problem being discussed here, which unfortunately was not my only problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">becksta</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had this same problem.<br />
<br />
My solution is not quite so drastic as Drachs :)<br />
<br />
I did a search for all the ini files in my eq directory and blew them all away... probably overkill but I figured it's easier to make some new hotkeys then try and track down the problem file.<br />
<br />
worked fine.<br />
<br />
back to redoing my hotkeys now....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skuzzo</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question?  If u deleted all the Ini files does it repatch them for u or what? Im kinda newb about this stuff and dont want to do any perm damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ini files hold your interface window positions, macros, hot button info, and other configurations. EQ will make these ini files again but your custom settings will be gone. So you will need to re configure your hotkeys and macros and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chylder</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i experienced this problem right after the last patch, i found that if i deleted my UI_character.server.ini file, the problem was solved... i was tipped off to this file by trying to switch UI's without the 1 command, ie: to switch back to the default window positions. however, i found that no matter what i did, the windows stayed where they were and didn't return to default positions. another glitch i was having (and something that can be a more pleasant clue in to this problem) is a lack of the targeting ring, where one was present previously. This is a much easier fix compared to the reinstalling that was mentioned earlier in the thread.</div></div><hr />
