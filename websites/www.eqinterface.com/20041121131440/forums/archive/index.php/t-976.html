<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pini Uldar</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Files Changed:<br />
- EQUI.xml<br />
- EQUI_Animations.xml <br />
- EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd.xml<br />
- EQUI_BazaarWnd.xml <br />
- EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml <br />
- window_pieces04.tga <br />
<br />
Files Added:<br />
- EQUI_CompassWnd.xml<br />
<br />
Changes:<br />
[EQUI.xml]<br />
- Added Include for EQUI_CompassWnd.xml<br />
<br />
NOTE: This is a _crash_ change. If you customized EQUI.xml in your mod (i.e. copied it to your mod directory and changed it) you MUST add this include to your modded EQUI.xml or else EQ will crash to desktop after trying to login with a character that uses your mod.<br />
<br />
[EQUI_Animations.xml]<br />
- Added a Texture definition for windowpieces04.tga (which contains the compass)<br />
- Added A_CompassStrip definition<br />
- Added A_CompassOverlay defintion<br />
<br />
NOTE: This is the stuff for the new compass window. If you fail to add these to your EQUI_Animations.xml, your skin will fail to laod since they are used in EQUI_CompassWnd.xml.<br />
<br />
[EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd.xml]<br />
- Changed the tooltip on the Update Traders button. Changed the word Players to Traders.<br />
<br />
NOTE: This is a very minor change and won't cause any problems really. If you changed the Search window and want to keep in sync just change the tooltip.<br />
<br />
[EQUI_BazaarWnd.xml]<br />
- Whitespace changes (changed back from UNIX style linefeeds to Windows style carriage return-linefeeds)<br />
- Positioning cleanup. Only real changes were to Y coords in stuff in the window.<br />
<br />
NOTE: This isn't really necessary if you redid your BazaarWnd.xml<br />
<br />
[EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml]<br />
- Whitespace changes (changed back from UNIX style linefeeds to Windows style carriage return-linefeeds)<br />
- In OPC_PCSpellsComboBox, the position of the Off choice was moved to the end from the 2nd spot<br />
<br />
NOTE: Minor cosmetic change. If you want to keep in sync with the default and you customized EQUI_OptionsWindow, you may as well change it.<br />
<br />
[window_pieces04.tga]<br />
- Removed old duplicated button images<br />
- Added new compass images<br />
<br />
[EQUI_CompassWnd.xml]<br />
- New File<br />
<br />
NOTE: This should fall back on the default version if it is not in your mod, so don't worry about it unless you want to customize it.</div></div><hr />

You crash coming into the game? You can get into the game but your skin fails to load and you end up in default? You get into game with your skin but your compass looks wrong? Your sense heading is still 1 and your compass wobbles a lot?<br />

Anyone confirm that?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cendorly</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm also having the same problem with the compass not working.  The window for the compass is there, as is the background matching my custom mod.  Just the graphics showing the actual compass are not showing up.<br />
<br />
Custom mod works fine, sense heading is maxxed, everything is as it should be minus the compass.<br />
<br />
I've copied over all the files, edited the animations file, etc.  Just can't figure out why the compass graphic isn't showing up.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly apprecated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pini Uldar</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're probably using the old window_pieces04.tga. Make sure that you just delete that file from your skin so it falls back on the default one. The old default window_pieces04.tga (in case you copies it) has button graphics in it.<br />

I'm not sure if I copied the code wrong in the animations file or what.<br />
<br />
If anyone has gotten the compass to work, please let me know what the fix may be.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pini Uldar</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mean delete it from your skins directory not the default directory.<br />

Compass works fine for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailora</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thanks for the info. All I had to do was add the lines required to my EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
<br />
My skin is only a modified buff, target, group, player windows. I basically just picked the good parts and kept that.<br />
<br />
My compass works just fine =)</div></div><hr />

<br />

I've noticed this too.  Ever since the patch I don't get the full name of the mob with the 00 added on.  I'm guessing that this was actually an exploit and they fixed it, although, I'm hoping not...'cause it was damn helpful.<br />
<br />
Anybody have any definitive word on how to get this working again, or if it's gone forever?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, in editing graphics you can do so in game now - Yes , Very Nice! :D</div></div><hr />
