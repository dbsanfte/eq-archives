<br />
As an example, I am building the Necro2 UI with a couple tweaks for my roomate, nothing too complex, and it all works fine.  The problem is that when I change the name of the UI to the name of her character (I used the name &quot;Demonus UI&quot;), the whole thing goes to default.  Renaming it back to &quot;Necro2&quot; makes it work fine.  This is without changing anything in the UI (or even opening the directory to such). I even tried fully turning off the computer and restarting, and it doesnt matter.  Why does the name of the directory make such a difference, and how can I change it so I can use different directory names?<br />
<br />
The main reason I'm concerned is that I'm ok with a single ui for all characters (makes it easier for me), but she loves different UIs for each of her characters, litterally over a dozen UIs, and its hard keeping them straight since she wants little tweaks to each one, in this case she wants to use the same base UI for her SK as well as her necro for example.<br />

Necro2 (notice the space... wait, there is none)<br />
<br />
Try using Demonus_UI instead.<br />

EQ isn't happy when a UI directory has a space in it.</div></div><hr />
