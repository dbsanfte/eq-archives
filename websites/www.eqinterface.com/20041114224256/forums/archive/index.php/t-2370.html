Get it HERE (http://home.attbi.com/~lhumphreys/winmode.zip)<br />
Please keep in mind that I just finsihed it and havent had a whole lot of time to test it for possible buggs.  Thus the reason its in the Beta forum.  :D</div></div><hr />

Any chance you'll make a higher-resolution version for us people with big monitors? ^.^ And how does the inventory look on it? Show us more shots! Great job.</div></div><hr />

Now all you have to do is make the spellbook cover the entire screen and the &quot;look and feel&quot; or old-skool EQ will be complete  :p   Seriously though, excellent job!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could run it in the resolution he designed it for and use the /viewport command to shrink the viewable area down and adjust it to fit. That way you get the interface, and still get the performance benefits of a lower resolution. you also don't get UI windows blocking off parts of the viewable area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded your mod and started changing things around a bit. One thing I discovered is - I cannot move the action window around. Is there any fix for this? Oh yeah, and could you include your UI_Name_server#.ini file?<br />
<br />
I use the SidlWidl program ( http://www.sidlwidl.com/ ) to modify stuff, but when I tried to load your mod it said there was an error in the player window. &quot;Line 3, position 3&quot; is what it said. It also said the same for Oguler's Beastlord mod, only instead of player window it was action window. &quot;Line 3, position 3&quot; is what that said as well. Dunno if it's something with your mod or if it's the program.  I ended up deleting the player window. But now it looks all crappy. It's tiny, doesn't match the rest at all.<br />
<br />
This is kinda what it looks like. :(<br />
<br />
<br />
         ----------------<br />
         |   player     |<br />
         |   window  |<br />
         ----------------<br />
------------------------<br />
|  group window    |<br />
|                            |<br />
|                            |<br />
|                            |<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
Anyway, how exactly could I make it work? I don't like the default player window. And I havent figured out how to add things like percentages yet. Earlier I tried taking out the player window completely, and just putting the player info stuff at the top of the group window. I took the player window image and combined it with the group image, so the player window was on top of the group window, as if it were all one. But when I tried loading it, it looked all stretched out, but the bars and everything were normal size.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, did you know you were missing the little actions window icon on the selector window? Just thought I'd point it out ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice UI though. I really like it ;) The only big problem I have with it is the actions window. I just can't move it :( And the colors in the hp/mana bars.(I hate having lines in them, regardless of color.) I did manage to change the colors of the exp bars, and took the line out of the target window, but as far as the player window I am totally un-able to do anything with it since I can't load your mod with it's player window.<br />
<br />
*EDIT* Bah. My little *picture* screwed up. But you should still get the general idea. I don't feel like messing around with it anymore because it's like 5:30 am and I have been up all night messing around with it. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rayvenn_vz</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the comments guys.  Ill try and answer your questions as best I can.<br />
<br />
Q1.  Will I make versions for other resolutions?<br />
A1.  Atm I'm really busy with my classes and I dont have the time to invest into doing that.  It requires rescaling the size of all the background images to fit in those resolutions, and I would have to do them for each resolution.  The default file only uses a texture to fill each window, were as WinMode uses an image of each window as its backgroud, and thus cannot be rescaled without resizing the images manually.  This would also require recoding all of the texure size declarations in the animations and template files for each resolution.  Basically it means i would have make avalible a version for each resolution.  For that reason I tried to choose a size that seemed like a happy medium 1024x768.  If a lower resolution is what you looking for, plz refer to Caleal's post.  He is correct.  By using the viewport command to make the window 671x510, you are actually running a much lower resolution than the what the UI is set at.<br />
<br />
Q2. Error Loading player window using SidlWidl UI editor?<br />
A1. Im not sure why you are getting an error loading the player window.  I believe that program is still in beta phase so it might be a glitch.  I coded all of my files manually using Peter's XML editor so im not real familiar with how SidlWidl works.  Also, I'm not quite clear on what you are trying to do to the player window.  The percentages are there already for health and mana. What are you trying to add to it? <br />
<br />
Q3.  Actions window toggle in selector window?<br />
A3.  Yes im aware it doesnt appear. I could only fit 8 icons in the window so I chose to push the actions window button off the screen since it was my intention to always have it on in the design of the UI.  You can still hide the actions window using Alt+M but It will look pretty weird without it.<br />
<br />
Q4.  Can't move actions window?<br />
A4.  The problem with the actions window is that you need to have the borders turned on to be able to grab hold of it.  Because of the multi page setup in that window, you cant just grab the window itself.  Since my actions window has no boarders it can't be moved but it is set to load in its intended spot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q5.  Is there a necro animation?<br />
A5.  The class animation is dynamic to the class  your using the UI with.  I believe all animations except beastlord exist and will show. There is a minor bugg with the animations though. It usually loads the warrior animation as default and doesnt load the proper animation until  you open the inventory window.  I believe this is a minor glitch in VI's coding.  Its really something you would never notice unless you put the animation outside the inventory window.<br />
<br />
Q6.  Will I add a casting window?<br />
A6.  Not sure what your talking about here.  If its the cast time window you speak of, then it is already there. It is the default window and appears only when you cast a spell.  I plan on keeping it that way, but I will be adding a background to it that matches the one in the original windowed mode.  I could make it permanent in the player window but my intention of this UI is to keep it as similar to the old UI as possible. I want it to fit like an old shoe.  Even with that said though, this is something I definately will consider doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, with all that said, I have a question of my own.<br />
<br />
Kaenil, what is  this line in the target window you speak of? I dont see a line when I run the UI.  Are you talking about the ruler below the health?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the little line at the bottom of the bar. With the target window it's a light red color. With your mana bar it's white, and with your hp bar it's green.<br />
<br />
It's the blue line in the exp bar under the orange :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rayvenn_vz</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Character Picture would have to be added to the background image file manually using photoshop or a similar program.  VI took out the char picture in the old UI as well so  you would have to add a static image of your choice.<br />
<br />
- To get rid of the old style arrows, you would have to use the default window_pieces03.tga file.  You would also loose the old style buttons.  You could also use photoshop to post the default style buttons from the default file if you wanted to keep the current buttons.<br />
<br />
-You could also extend the selector bar background image file using photo shop.  Just copy and paste a section to lengthen it.  Then use a smudge tool to blend the textures so it looks like a solid pieces. After that you will have to increase the length of the window in the EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml file.<br />
<br />
-if you /load winmode, the actions window should automatically go in the bottom right hand corner, then all you have to do is like up the other windows above it.  If you use the /load winmode 1, it will not go to its defined location.<br />
<br />
Sounds like most of the changes you want to apply require some photo work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
did you create a copy of your default folder and then put the winmode files in it? if so that is the wrong way to install it.<br />
<br />
All u need in your winmode UI folder, is the files you get from my link.  Any files that arent there, your computer just looks in the default folder for.<br />
<br />
<br />
I see this problem happen alot.  People duplicate the default folder and then copy the custom ui files into it.  What happens is, VI alters the default files, making your copies of them in your custom UI folder not work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last patch EQUI.xml was changed to add the gems game window.  If you delete the winmode file that you created, and then reinstal them using the instructions in the readme file, they should work again.</div></div><hr />

Thank you so much for making this for us.  I am sick of getting made fun of because i can click or post links.  This was the only version that didnt really bother me so thank you thank you thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wish the viewport wasnt so small. What I am working on is the original style interface, with some enhancements due to XML UI, but keeping the original graphics size. This, in 1024x768 I have a viewport of 784x608. If you put this side by side with the classic EQ ui, the viewport would be quite larger. And at 1024 I think that the old graphics still don't look too small and are fairly easy to read.<br />
<br />
I tried your UI and it's good.<br />
<br />
I find the most annoying thing is when we use the overlaid window for spell buffs, we can set the Fade TO at 0% and the borders disappear.. but you can not click THROUGH it.. and it still fades in when the mouse passes over.. grrr :P  Wish we could find a cheat for that.<br />
<br />
Good job though, this is the closest I have seen to what I want, still not quite there yet, things like the old ui spell gems for example, they were on the left side of the view in nice little 'recessions', I want to see those :)<br />
<br />
PS: I also wont be using the parchment for the chat window I think,  using a darker background gives more custom colours to play with. The choice of custom text colors is restricted on a bright background :/</div></div><hr />

Also the new update is using the default inventory and selector windows atm.  I will be rebuilding those files soon so stay posted for an update soon.<br />

I have a question also for those using winmode UI.  Has anyone noticed a lag time when opening backpacks?

The reason u cant move the window is because the pages overlap the spots that u would normall grab to move it with your cursor.

all you have to do is make the changes in the general 2/24 fix section of the patch fixes board on this board, then dont forget to add a call for charms in animations.xml, this is what you need to do, it was forgettin in the 2/24 post:<br />
<br />
find &lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_InvEar&quot;&gt; in animations.xml<br />
<br />
right above it paste:<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_InvCharm&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
			&lt;Texture&gt;window_pieces04.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
			&lt;Location&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;180&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;Size&gt;<br />
				&lt;CX&gt;40&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
				&lt;CY&gt;38&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />

This is the UI I actually use in game.  The large view area UI's usually give me a massive headache, especially when im 3boxing.  Anyhow, the link is the same.  As my previous post.  I will upload a fresh zip file tonight to make sure I have a working version up there.<br />

<br />
we now have the ability to update your files.. sooo you can just re-upload to the same place (ie not have to submit new write up) and keep it updated..<br />

just as a suggestion =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
it would be nice to get another UI update due to 8/26/03 patch. <br />
<br />
I am still not very familiar with XML code and it would be nice if someone could fix this UI and post it here or at least tell me what exactly I have to do to fix it myself :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

Though I'm having a couple of probs with it. Well...actually I can't load it. It says there is an Error with the XML. I'm assuming this is because of the GoD update...good work though with it and keep up the good work...i really miss the old UI</div></div><hr />
