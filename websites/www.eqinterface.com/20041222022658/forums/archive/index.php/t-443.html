<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ryoken0367</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have yet to see a couple of things I want, and was wondering if someone could either point me at a site where I can learn this stuff *grin* or make one for me *big grin*.  What I want is:<br />
<br />
Player Box<br />
<br />
Name Surname              life/lifetotal<br />
Lifebar and %<br />
Manabar and %<br />
Stamina bar and %<br />
SPACE<br />
Exp Bar and %<br />
<br />
Group Box<br />
<br />
Groupie 1 and %life<br />
Groupie 2 and %life<br />
Groupie 3 and %life<br />
Groupie 4 and %life<br />
Groupie 5 and %life<br />
<br />
Buff Box<br />
Icons with spell name, red for harmful, blue for buff, small strips.<br />
<br />
I think I've seen the buff box somewhere, I just gotta get it, but the rest I've never seen one exactly the way I want.  That's why I'm posting here.  If someone feels up to making me one, great!  If not I'm 100% wiling to learn, just need some pages to hit or guides to look at or something!<br />
<br />
[Edit]<br />
<br />
Forgot I'd also like the Target Box to have % of baddies life left :D<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<br />
If you want, I could make this. Drop me a line at DarkPhantomon@yahoo.com if you're interested. It might take a few days though..<br />

(Include, if possible, a Paint-made BMP of a rough idea of how you want it to look. What you have there isn't very descriptive.)</div></div><hr />
