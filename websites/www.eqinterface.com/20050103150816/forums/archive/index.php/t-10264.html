<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noqture</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the last LDoN patch they added 2 new graphics. 1 was the Adevturers Stone and the other was the Quest bag for those that bought the game in the box. <br />
<br />
I seen the fix in the patch fixes but all it is, is a picture and I am not sure how to add it to my UI. Please any help would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need to add the graphic, EQ will pull it automatically from the default folder.  The only reason I included the image in the patch thread was simply to show folks what had changed, so that if someone modified their dragitem.tga files, they would know what needed to be added/changed.  (As far as I am aware, no one has ever modified the dragitem files, there would be no point to it.)  The only thing you need do is make sure that the appropriate coding for the new dragitem is defined in your custom EQUI_Animations.xml file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, there was a thread a while ago asking for highlights around items, so a few mods were made.  For example: White Highlights (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1950).<br />
<br />
However, I have no intention of keeping that mod up to date and should probably delete it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimarin</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I know what Noqtue is referring to.<br />
<br />
When I followed the patch fix posted, it listed some edits to the animations file.  I did those edits in my mod file, but what I found is that I needed to go back and add the drag items for 26 and 27 deeper in the animation file.  I had to have done something wrong previously.<br />
<br />
Before I did this, my new bag from the expansion was showing up as a pearl necklace.  I even made it disappear completely while i was editing.<br />
<br />
Here is what I did:<br />
<br />
&lt;TextureInfo item = &quot;dragitem27.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;256&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;256&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
	&lt;/TextureInfo&gt;<br />
<br />
and...<br />
&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
			&lt;Texture&gt;dragitem27.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
			&lt;Location&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;Size&gt;<br />
				&lt;CX&gt;256&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
				&lt;CY&gt;256&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
			&lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
<br />
both had to be pasted in their appropriate homes in the document.<br />
<br />
Not sure what I did to cause this problem but hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
