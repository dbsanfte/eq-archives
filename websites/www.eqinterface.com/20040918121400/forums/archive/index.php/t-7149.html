<br />
It can be downloaded here:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1445<br />
<br />
You can view a picture of it here:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=1445<br />
<br />
The melee version can be found here:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1390<br />
<br />
And can be viewed here:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=1390<br />
<br />
Remember these only workin 1280 x 1024 resolution.  Both come with an INI file to auto arrange the windows and set the viewport.<br />
<br />
The two chat boxes on either UI can be customized to display whatever text you want.  They are set with an opacity of 0 so to access the menu on them simply right click near the right edge of the black area.  It may take a few tries to find and it may help you to up the opacity temporarily while working with them.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think!  You can PM me if you have any questions or simply leave a reply here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maleil</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am liking the way you arranged the windows and the clever targeting system you have.  Definitely two thumbs up.  Great work.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the UI, and got a couple of things I'm curious about.  I can't seem to get my Raid Window up using this UI.  Is that a bug with the UI, or is it just something with my files?<br />
<br />
The other thing is a casting bar.  I don't see that included anywhere.  Not a huge deal though, I can move that around no problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton, and keep up the great work :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanys.Neoconker</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love it.  Looks awesome, and the gauges and windows and everything blend together prefectly.  Keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rynoa</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoops...there is a raid window in these UI's that was a custom request for one of my friends.  Just delete the RaidWindow.xml out of the custom directory to get the default one back.  Pretty sure not many will like this custom one as it was tailored to one persons specific needs.<br />
<br />
As for the casting window...i purposely left that open for people to add whatever they want.  I tried the arcane one and it came out really small and I didn't like it.  So the way I use it is to have opacity on zero and put it right above my own name below the target bar.  Line it up with the other guages and it looks pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maleil</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yay.. thank you Rynoa :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would you be willing to release just your inventory?  It looks absolutely amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rynoa</div><div class="date">03-04-2003, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked into making the inventory a stand alone mod, however I'm not quite sure how to easily do it.  The inventory in it's current state requires modifications to the Animations and Templates files.  I think there is a way to include the code from the animations file into the inventory file but I don't know how to do it and not sure if it's possible with the templates file.<br />
<br />
The only way I for sure know how to do this is to post a modified Inventory file, then provide instructions for people to add the code themselves for those other 2 files.<br />
<br />
I think it will be more work than the average end user will want to do to get this to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">03-04-2003, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In that case don't worry about it :)  I don't want it to take someone a lot of work.  Thanks for the reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aandiian</div><div class="date">03-04-2003, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked the overall look of this UI however I noticed that the Window Selector was replaced by the bar that shows the stats on the far right.  On there is the button for Options, and the button for Inventory (I think thats what it was, been a few days since I tried it out), however I don't see any of the other buttons.  Am I missing something, or do you just use the Alt-key commands to open the functions you want?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rynoa</div><div class="date">03-05-2003, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah just use the Alt + commands.  Even the two that I left on there can be gotten by the alt commands, but I use those two enough (options and main) to where it's nice to have the button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">03-05-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:D   I love the inventory. Could i ask for a stand alone one vesion. Yes i tryed to pull it out  (sigh) didnt work. :D<br />
<br />
edit : Just got my head out me butt and read all post..you can kick me now. I also dont want to make it a lot of work.</div></div><hr />
