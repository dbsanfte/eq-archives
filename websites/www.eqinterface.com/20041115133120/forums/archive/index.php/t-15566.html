<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vixyn</div><div class="date">10-24-2004, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">UI was created with 1024x768 resolutions in mind, and 800x600 as secondary, would probably be too small in larger resolutions.<br />
<br />
<br />
The frame of the player window is the casting window. Its a really noticeable purple, so should be easy to see. While this UI was intended for my rogue, it has caster support - as you can see, mana and spellcast bars were included in the pieces.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is an ini included in the zip - the player and combat windows are pretty hard to pick up and drag, so I did it for you. Keep in mind though that the UI is for 1024x768 res users. It points to a VixUI folder - so, unzip the files into a folder named that and you'll be gtg.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Well, it got approved, heres the link, with 2 SS's instead of the one 2 posts down. One shows the pure melee, other shows the pure caster bits. Hybrids shoudln't have any issues with this, either.<br />
<br />
Most of the pieces are named .vix so that I oculd find them easiest - if you want to plug in a new buffwindow, though, no worries - thats .xml as I didn't mod it.<br />
<br />
If you're wanting to plug in a different spell cast bar, though, it's probably not going to work unless it has its own graphics with it, or strips the graphics, a la Lunix, as I moved and redrew the spellgem holders.</div></div><hr />
