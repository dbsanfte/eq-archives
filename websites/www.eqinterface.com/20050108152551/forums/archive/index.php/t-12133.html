<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">supafly</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I'm still working on my UI, and I have the hotbuttons arranged in an irregular (read: non-square based) pattern.  For instance, I'll have a long rhombus that's at a 45 degree angle housing one button, then another rhombus at a 70 degree angle housing another button and nesting up against the first.  Now, I'd like the entire rhombus to function as the button, but I can't do that with my present knowledge because I only know how to make objects a square, with one top-left set of x,y coordinates.<br />
<br />
Now, with image maps in HTML, you can create irregularly shaped objects by giving multiple coordinates.  Is it possible to have multiple X,Y values for the location tag?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope.  You can make the shape anything you want, but the &quot;image&quot; has to be a square.  Anything that isn't the shape will just be transparent, but it'll still be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">supafly</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Darn.  I was afraid of that.  Okay, another solution I thought of was to make the buttons into large enough squares that they cover the area I want to be visible (these pie-like wedges of the window).  Of course, because they're not aligned to straight 90 and 180 degree angles, the squares will overlap here and there.  Is it possible to use the Hotspot command to make a smaller portion of the button actually interactive?  Like, if I have a 40x40 square button, could I make the interactive portion only the 20x20 square middle of it?  I tried looking for information on Hotspot, but other than that being where the focus of a cursor is, I still don't really understand how/why it's used in static objects like buttons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can make artwork that is larger than your button but looks like part of it.  However, this will probably just annoy people when they think they are clicking on the button and nothing happens.</div></div><hr />
