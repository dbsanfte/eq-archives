		<div>Hope you feel better soon Ax. When you do, a suggestion for your update: Would be very convenient to have a small box with a timer for personal tribute. During raids this can be forgotten very easily, but the box with the countdown timer will make it much more visible and easy to remember, plus can check time left without pressing alt-u each time. Thanks!</div>

		<div>Thanks for the post Ax, good to know updates are coming. You asked for a list of changes we would like to see for the next update, and I would like to list a few ideas.<br />
1. Visible tribute timer<br />
2. Easier to read font (for stats, resists, etc that are not in inv window, but under the xp bars)<br />
3. Combat abilites window that is similar to <a href="http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3111" target="_blank">http://www.eqinterface.com/download...nfo.php?id=3111</a>, aka a bit easier to see which hotkey belongs to which disc.<br />
4. Updates to the hotbars so all can be shown, audio triggers window, inventory tabs, etc (Update to most recent patches)<br />
5. Updated map window<br />
<br />
These are simply my ideas. I love your ui and and would be happy to see it progress and keep being used throughout each patch/update. Thanks for all your hard work, and get well soon!</div>

		<div>Hey Ax, found this board. Glad you are feeling better. I love your UI and miss using it. May I add some suggestions. When I log in now that bar that shows yoru exp and other stats doesnt show up anymore. I loaded it on one toon and it showed up but not on my other toons. Gonna reload the file and see if that helps. <br />
Also can you go back to the orig chat boxes w/i the brown background. I have found it hard to read. Other then that, love it. You do nice work<br />
thanks for all your effort and please take care of your health first.. we can wait<br />

5. Updated map window<br />
<br />
ok 1 is doable just gota find place to put it.<br />
<br />
2 i struggled with fonts since httk went live i cant get one that makes every one happy i had thought old english engravers font was better than previous font but ill try again to find a better font. might do letters in plane engraved style like its a button.<br />
<br />
3 ill look into a alt combat window . some like other version some deletated that file to use default.<br />
<br />
4 in works <br />
<br />
5 had my map mod i was working on patched outa existance so when im bit more healthy ill work on it .<br />
<br />
<br />
had power suplie go out on comp just getn recovered an recovering from a virus ( had to nuke c drive ) virus was from me being sick at keyboard an screwing up .im on my 6th offical pnemonia of the year atm new meds working fairly well so hope to get in some shade tree codeing before years end.<br />
<br />
atm playing eq off of d drive an its out side of windows registry. i click the exe in old folder to log on .net1.0a sdk installed, photoshop installed . notpad +++ installed. so working to get httk back in fighting shape!<br />
<br />
been usen default ui an with axeion it felt like i had lost part of his flow in game .ui can make an experiance in games enjoyable or tons of work.again i am truely sorry for the delays on httk.but rl hasnt exactly been kind to me this year.<br />
<br />
like to thank those that took time to post about httk , send pm's an emails asking about me an my health.hope every one has a merry xmas an happy new year.</div>

I have one small problem however. The light chat box background is making it hard for me to read chat. I noticed earlier in this thread someone was able to change it to the dark marble background. Could someone post a more detailed explanation on how to change it? Keep in mind I know almost nothing about UI modding, so I need simple directions if possible :P.<br />

		<div>a quick a easy way to get that changed with out changeing your font colors ( which i did cause i liked the ancient scroll look but will make it as a add on in next httk version) is to take the wnd_bg_scroll.tga file an delete it then copy wnd_bg_light_rock.tga file ( as in make a second one ) then renamed it to wnd_bg_scroll.tga.<br />
<br />
this would keep from breaking item window by deleting the chat xml an put them with a black marble like back ground again .hope this helps</div>

		<div>I put out an update patch a little while ago, all be it a bit crude looking, It was able to make the UI error free.  I have been working on the hotkeys a little more and working with axeon's use of background images and finally figured out how to make the other set of hot keys have their own background images. As soon as i finish what I am working on I will release at least the hotkeys in the form of an update to my patch files.<br />
<br />
** People who are experianceing &quot;crooked&quot; images, this UI was created using the old default UI, there for you must keep all the old default files together with the UI.  Make a copy of the default_old and place HTTK UI files into the coppied folder, overwriting any files asked of you.**</div>

		<div>This has got to be my favorite UI so far. I would love to see it updated soon. The hack put out even though it makes the interface usable, there are still some issues with graphics and such. I would like to make a request that shouldn't be too difficult though. Would it be entirely possible to make a version of the 12 slot Short Duration Buff (song) window vertacle instead of horizontal? Or does anyone know of a substitute I can use? I tried one from SARS but it broke the UI. Also instead of putting the LFG tool on the group window could you put it back on the action window?<br />
<br />
Thank you for all of your effort.<br />
<br />
PS - I hope you are doing well with your battle with health issues and can continue your work soon.</div>
