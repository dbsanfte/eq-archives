<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xymarra's UI, version 3.8, is available for download Here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1232)<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=18755<br />
<br />
Latest Patch - OoW 9/21/04 (http://www.eqgui.com/showpost.php?p=79109&amp;postcount=632) - This patch is now included in the download, so you should not have to patch if you download the main UI.<br />
<br />
The base UI and all of its mods are in the Xym UI (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?op=showfiles&amp;catid=49) category at this site.  Unfortunately, these do not all mix and match.  If two patches change the same file, they are likely to be incompatible.<br />
<br />
This UI was designed to work in a 1280x1024 window.<br />
<br />
The default version does not work properly for pure mel&amp;eacute;e types.  One of the panels uses the spells window.  There is a special mel&amp;eacute;e version, but it only works for the 1280x1024 resolution.  It will not mix-and-match with the different resolution patches because it creates a side panel with a fixed height.<br />
<br />
If you have any troubles with my basic UI or with any of these patches, please post to this thread.  It's more likely to get a quick answer than an e-mail or a PM.  Often questions can be answered by people other than myself, especially questions about how to install the UI and the patches.<br />
<br />
Please don't feel you need to read this whole thread if you have a question.  I have left the thread in one place for ease of linking and searching.  Just jump to the end and read the last page or so.  Hopefully I won't let any errors sit around long enough to gather more than one page of dust. ;)<br />

<br />
and you can *force* the spell window to show with pure melee... I have seen it done before.. might check into that Xymarra, maybe you can find something else to put in the window for melee types, and then you have your 1 extra box...<br />
<br />
(ie, have two different XML files, one for caster one for melee, but both forced to show)<br />

I think I will just use the pet window, which has the tick timer in it now.  Mel&amp;eacute;es won't want that.  I was going to use the panel for a more comprehensive inventory mirror.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lasagna</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You just resize them to where you want them, since they have no titlebar.

<br />
I designed the border of the chat windows to be thicker on the top than the other sides so that I could pull them higher to see more lines at need, while preventing accidental resize on the sides.  Most of the time, I find the 12 lines adequate, but I bring them all the way up the window when I do things like talk to quest NPCs in Knowledge.<br />
<br />
Personally, I resist resizing the viewport to other than a 4:3 ratio, because that loses field of vision.  My first attempts at a UI had all of the panels in the bottom third of the screen and the 3D world in the top 2/3.  This drove me up the wall because I felt like I was staring through a narrow eye slit and I had to pitch up and down all the time to see things.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you make the whole window smaller, but preserve the aspect ratio, the whole world gets rendered smaller, so it's harder to get close up detailed views of people and stuff.  It's a trade off. ;)<br />
<br />
I cant seem to be able to move the chat windows. I can move everything else but when i try to click on the chat windows i dont get the 4 way cursor to move them =( <br />
<br />
The chat window doesn't have a title bar, so you don't ever get the option to move the whole window.  You have to resize it into place instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unzip this onto the old version.  It has a new UI_Basic_00.ini file that puts the new panel in the right place.<br />
<br />
This will muck up the original, so if you want to use both versions, unzip the basic set to two different directories and then patch one of them with the mel&amp;eacute;e version.<br />

<br />
Yes, replace EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml with the one from default, or from a different UI.<br />
<br />
I noticed in the screen shots theres a box w/ stat information ... but i dont have it ... what is that under ... i've changed Resolutions thinking it was hiding but i dont see it <br />
<br />
That lives in the target window.  You probably have it hidden.  Hit Alt-T to make it appear.<br />
<br />
Also, that timer thing ... i dont need it ... and i think that anyone that plays a pet class would luv to have a pet command box than the timer. <br />
<br />
Well, I play an enchanter primarily.  I find that having my pet's name and health is perfect for keeping track of my summoned or charmed pets.  I use hot keys, not buttons, to issue commands, so I find the buttons to be useless clutter.  You are free to replace the timer with a pet info window if you so choose.</div></div><hr />

The chat doesn't have a title bar, so I can't move it, I understand that. I have made sure that the Lock isn't on for my chat window. If you move the mouse to the edge of the window, you're suppose to be able to resize it. This works across the top edge of the chat window, but it does not work for the other 3 sides. I can only make my chat window taller, not wider, or more narrow, and as a result, I cannot &quot;move&quot; the windows using the resize trick. <br />
<br />
This is a great UI and I would love to use it!! But right now my chat windows are on top of each other, and I am not able to make use of the UI.<br />

<br />
If you move the mouse to the edge of the window, you're suppose to be able to resize it. This works across the top edge of the chat window, but it does not work for the other 3 sides. <br />
<br />
The top border is four pixels wide so that you can grab it easily and pull the top up or down.  The other three borders are one pixel wide.  You can grab them and resize the window, somewhat painstakingly.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can use the UI_Basic_00.ini file which will place four chat windows in reasonable places, two visible at the bottom and two invisible just above them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rizuma</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I to play a necromancer and want to use the pet window vs hot keys.  I've tried replacing the pet info window file with another moded pet window and even the default one.  However, each time I try that the skin will error and refuse to load up.<br />
<br />
I love this UI and for now I'm using hot keys for pet commands.  If the pet window can replace the timer it would be icing on the cake though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the problems with using hotkeys for pet commands are twofold: you can't command your pet while casting and you lose the space for additional hotkeys (at least those of us who can't handle more than one page...). On the plus side you get to add neat little social thingies in with your pet commands- but for me, the pet window with buttons is much more functional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I hate buttons. ;)<br />
<br />
I will give feedback to Verant, suggesting that hot buttons should work during spell casting.  That's a legacy from old UI days.<br />
<br />
I do use a second panel of hot buttons for pet commands when playing my enchanter.  When playing other pet classes, I hotkey &quot;/pet attack&quot;,  &quot;/pet back off&quot; and &quot;/pet report health&quot; and just type the rest as needed.<br />
<br />
I just tested the default pet info window with my UI.  I had used one element from the pet window in the player window without renaming it.  Use the attached player window if you want to use a different pet window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ssmokey</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An Update to the chat window problem.<br />
<br />
For anyone else who had a similar problem as me, you can delete the chat window xml from Xym directory and copy the default chat window xml to there. This gave me the title bars so you can move the window around, and it still matched the rest of the UI!<br />
<br />
Looks good now! yay!<br />
<br />
fyi, i use a higher resolution than the one its designed for, so that is why loading with the default placements didnt work for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I chopped up the side panels and squished everything down a little to fit in 1024x768.  I can't really make the panels any narrower without drawing all new health bars, so this is what you get.  The chat windows are way too small now, but you can move things around to make it work out.<br />
<br />
Have fun. ;)<br />
<br />
EDIT: By the way, this is only a patch of the UI.  You will need to download the full UI and then unpack these files on top of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love this UI when I'm playing my bard, well even my druid for that matter.  My only problem is that I am unable to run at 1280x1024 at a higher refresh rate than 60Hz.  I would invest in a new monitor but I have Photoshop fully callibrated for this monitor and it's such a pain to have to recallibrate.<br />
There are a number of us that can run 1152x864 at 72Hz which is quite pleasing on the eyes and allows for a fair amount of room.<br />
Unfortunately I'm not really UI savvy, else I would hack and slash the stuff myself to get it to fit.  I would like to offer my services if needed to make this useable at lower resolutions, I just need a swift kick in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, SUPERB work here this is one of the finest UI designs I have seen yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To run at 1152x864:<br />
<br />
Download the 3.0 version.<br />
Download the 1024x768 patch and overwrite the files.<br />
<br />
Edit EQUI_BuffWindow.xml and EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml:<br />
Set the window height of both to 491 by replacing &lt;CY&gt;395&lt;/CY&gt; with &lt;CY&gt;491&lt;/CY&gt; in the Size tag of the Screen block at the end of the file.<br />
<br />
Set your resolution to 1152x864 and move the window panes into place.<br />
<br />
The buffs won't fill their panel, but that will take a lot of number shuffling that I don't have time to do right now.<br />

A) where you had to add the inventory bar INSTEAD make it a third chat window, very slim, put &quot;player hits and misses&quot; in that window, and abbreviate them to &quot;number only&quot; that would be nice, and also, as a &quot;timer&quot; that you referred two, i would like that for i am a monk.. 6 minute timer for mend = nice :) just a few hints/requests</div></div><hr />

<br />
Switching from different characters- back and forth it can get confusing to remember the spells by gems only.  Check Sars cast bar with names- I was using his UI til I saw yours and the only down side I've found is the spell names.

<br />
Well, there's a layout problem with it ...<br />
<br />
I wanted to have a texture behind the side panels and those little gold scroll things in the corners.  The size of the texture there is the size of the window, so everything has to fit inside that and there isn't enough room for the spell names to the right of the bar.<br />
<br />
I could put a list at the bottom instead of the mini-inventory.<br />
1: Spell 1<br />
2: Spell 2 ...<br />
but it wouldn't have the spell gems with it.<br />
<br />
A) where you had to add the inventory bar INSTEAD make it a third chat window, very slim, put &quot;player hits and misses&quot; in that window, and abbreviate them to &quot;number only&quot; that would be nice <br />
<br />
I think you can do that yourself.  Just make a new chat window and move it where you like it.  Set the hits mode from the window menu.  Turn off the side panel entirely if it gets in the way.  If you use the basic UI as a non-caster, it won't show up anyhow.<br />
<br />
as a &quot;timer&quot; that you referred two, i would like that for i am a monk.. 6 minute timer for mend = nice <br />
<br />
You can set up any timers you like using Arista's timers (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/customize.asp).  Drag them wherever you like. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can fix that in any UI.<br />
<br />
Open up EQUI_ChatWindow.xml.  The first part should describe the chat input line.  It looks like this:<br />
<br />
	&lt;Editbox item = &quot;CW_ChatInput&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;CWChatInput&lt;/ScreenID&gt;After the ScreenID line, add this line:<br />
<br />
		&lt;Font&gt;5&lt;/Font&gt;You can use font 4 or 6 if you prefer.  Font 3 is the default.</div></div><hr />

Xym- thanks for looking into that-I'm not sure if putting the spell names at the bottom would help much.  The time to look there if confused or uncertain of which gem to click on, it would be easier/quicker to just hit 'Alt'.  Is there a way to trick the computer to thinking the 'ALT' key is always being pressed (always on)??  Ideally something like 'hit alt key once' they are on and stay on/'hit alt key again' they go off and stay off.  <br />
Maybe I just need a better memory (brain type), but switching between caster type characters can get confusing to remember the spell gems.   Again, thank for your effort and the GREAT mod!!</div></div><hr />

There is a bug that prevents many people from seeing chat channels, but I don't think it is related to the UI.<br />
<br />
Try loading the default skin (/load default 1) and see if you can chat in channels.  Then go back to mine (/load xym 1).  If you can see the channels in default but not in my UI, please let me know.<br />
<br />
In other news, I am going to update my UI very soon.  I have been cleaning up a couple of the graphics and, of course, added the new files to EQUI.xml.  Look for a 3.1 version this weekend.</div></div><hr />

What I have been trying to do is to make the UI generic in the sense that I could apply any texture to the various panels.  Towards that end, I have made a number of transparent &quot;glass&quot; buttons.<br />

I removed EQUI.xml from my UI, so in the future, new windows won't break the mod.<br />

I did exactly that on my husband's computer and he played his warrior all night without complaining, so I suppose it worked. ;)<br />

Btw, great skin ... I think its my favorite thus far.<br />

Oh, and I know how to make them, but just wanted to let you know that the &quot;others hits&quot; (hitsmode on bottom left, no border) box you have in your screenie doesn't appear in your settings for the zip.</div></div><hr />

The way it appears on your screen depends on your monitor, video card, and gamma setting.  If, for example, you are a human keeping the brightness cranked way up to see at night, the whole UI will seem pretty garish.<br />
<br />
When I look at screen shots outside the game, they look almost completely black, so I try to lighten them up to the level they appear in game.  It is an inexact art. ;)<br />
<br />
I will put up a darker green background, but I can't promise to hit the same level as that screen shot when you load it in game.</div></div><hr />

Is there a way you can add into the group window the  &quot;F1&quot;  &quot;F2&quot;  etc.. to the names of the toons?  Its so important to target the right character for a crucial heal and that would make it so much better.  <br />

I am working on that right now.  I need to log in and test it with a full group before I can post it.<br />
<br />

<br />
There is no way to display pet health percentages.  Pet health bars are currently displayed as green bars almost half the height of the player's health bar.  I could move them down a few pixels to lie underneath the player health bar, but there isn't a whole lot of room for it.  I will see what I can do about designing a cleaner narrow bar for pet health.  That will require new art, so it won't happen too soon.<br />
<br />

They shrink the 3D world into the part that isn't covered up by the UI panels.  If you are using the UI the way I do, you shouldn't see any of the black edge, since it should all be covered up by green panels.<br />
<br />
There is a problem with mel&amp;eacute;e characters using the basic UI.  Since the left panel is the spell gems, it doesn't show up for characters who never get spells.  If that is your problem, take a look at the meleeui.zip patch on the first page.  That patch replaces the spell gems with an inventory panel.<br />

Well, that would require lots of new artwork, so it won't be happening too soon. ;)<br />

Nope, larger gauges. =) I solo a lot as I don't always have time to play for several hours, so half hour here, half hour there, yada yada.

Any chance I could talk you into making (or advising me on how to make) a couple of (hopefully simple) modifications to this already wonderful skin?  :D<br />
<br />
1. Swap the compass with your highlighting compass (preferably the middle one shown in your sample pic - http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=637).  I tried it myself, and although I got the compass to highlight, it lost the decorative border.<br />
<br />
2. Flip the compass, so the curlique decoration stuff is on the bottom (allowing the compass to be &quot;hung&quot; from the top of the screen).  I tried to simply paste the new image ever the existing one, but that didn't work so well - wound up with pieces of both being displayed on the screen (not sure how, as I completely replaced the existing image in the TGA file).  :confused:<br />
<br />
3.  Change the color scheme to a silver &amp; blue, instead of the current gold &amp; green.   This is the change I have had the most success with myself, but I have not yet been able to change the borders on the chat windows, although I have gotten it everywhere else.<br />

<br />
The compass is more complicated than it appears. ;)  The decoration stuff is an actual window border.  Verant's border code had real troubles with the border until I added a lot of empty space over and under the compass itself.  I think if you were to copy the decoration flipped upside down so that the interior compass part lined up with the original, it should work.<br />
<br />
Someone else asked about a flipped compass.  I tried it myself, but the art looks wrong upside down, so I am going to make a new frame for an upside down compass when I get some time.<br />
<br />

<br />
Getting silver on the old windows should be easy.  Just use the old images. ;)<br />
<br />
The chat windows use the horizontal gold bar in GoldCurves.tga and the thin window border that I added in window_pieces01.tga.  I should probably move that to another file, but I keep forgetting. :P</div></div><hr />

Actually, this is exactly what I tried to do.  I wound up with a kind of a transparent version of the original image (probably the border code you mentioned), overlayed by the portion of the pasted image which occupied the same space as the original image.  :eek:<br />

Unfortunately, the web based UI Builder is extremely outdated, and most of the entries it lists can no longer be used without editing the XML manually.<br />
<br />
I personally use Athee's LocWizard BETA 2.0.1 (with Planes Of Power Loc's added by somebody else - don't remember their name right now).  It uses the Feedback window to display a list of Loc's, and works quite well with Xymarra's UI.<br />
<br />
There's a slightly outdated thread discussing it at http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?goto=newpost&amp;threadid=2205.<br />
<br />
I got the PoP version from http://eq.stratics.com/eqskins, but their site appears to be down at the moment, so I have attached the file here.  To use it, just unzip it into your UIFILES/XYMARRA (or whatever you named your skin) folder, then start EQ.  Once in game, type /F to display the window.<br />

<br />
If so, then look in the file UIErrors.txt in your EQ directory.  There will be about forty lines saying &quot;Warning: can't find file foo in xym, looking in default&quot;.  Ignore those.  At the end of the file, there will be a line that starts &quot;Error&quot;.  Copy that line out and post it here.<br />
<br />
And please find out where you got the mod you are trying to install.  You should be able to unzip the mod into your xym directory with no trouble, unless it modifies one of the same files that I do.  When you are unzipping it, make sure it doesn't overwrite existing files.  If it gives you a &quot;Do you want to replace a file?&quot; message, then the mod is incompatible.  It's also incompatible if it replaces EQUI.xml.<br />

EDIT: Thanks for the explanation, Shadowphoenix.  I didn't know quite what she meant by a webbuilder UI.</div></div><hr />

If you change the background to a light color, you will need to change all of the text labels to a dark color so that you can read them.  Some cannot be changed at all, such as the stat values.</div></div><hr />

I love your UI.  It works very well for raid situations where one needs to have two or more chat channels open.  Additionally, since I started using it I have noticed that I have less lag.  Perhaps this is because there is less going on in my screen.  I play a Paladin and a rogue.  The Rogue obviously uses the melee version, and the pally the caster version.  I have a few questions though pertaining to customizing your UI to better suit my tastes:<br />
<br />
1) How would I go about changing the pointer.  I find that I have troubles seeing yours during heavy combat situations.<br />
<br />
2) Is it possible to change the location of the small inventory and the spell gems?  I would like to swap them around so that my spells are closer to my hotkeys.<br />
<br />
3)  Is it possible to get the book button back on the bottom of the gem bar?  <br />
<br />
4) I would like to permanently remove the spell counter.  I have moved it to the top right corner of my screen to get it out of my way, but I would like to be rid of it for good.<br />
<br />
Aside from that I am completely happy with the UI you created.  Well done!<br />

You would need to edit the EQUI_Animations.xml file.  Find the block of code that looks like this:&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DefaultCursor&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
		&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
			&lt;Texture&gt;Deco.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
			&lt;Location&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;160&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;Size&gt;<br />
				&lt;CX&gt;25&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
				&lt;CY&gt;25&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
			&lt;Duration&gt;10000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;Change the Texture name to the name of the file with your cursor image.  Change the location and size tags to match the location and size of that cursor.<br />
<br />
Cursors are the only elements that actually use the Hotspot tag, so make sure that is correct as well.  The hotspot is the location within the cursor that is the active point;  (0,0) is the upper left corner.<br />
<br />
2) Is it possible to change the location of the small inventory and the spell gems? I would like to swap them around so that my spells are closer to my hotkeys. <br />
It is possible to move things around like that.  Unfortunately the mechanism that is supposed to make it easy is broken. :(  If I were to use the subwindow structure to group the pieces properly, they would always show up faded.  So, swapping those pieces would require changing the x,y coordinates of all of the pieces in the window.  It's not too hard, just tedious.<br />
<br />
3) Is it possible to get the book button back on the bottom of the gem bar?  <br />
That I can do.  Attached is a spell gem bar with a book.  I had to get rid of the range and ammo inventory slots to make room for it.<br />
<br />
4) I would like to permanently remove the spell counter. I have moved it to the top right corner of my screen to get it out of my way, but I would like to be rid of it for good. <br />
Do you mean the little tick timer?  It is the pet window, so Alt-F1 will hide it.  You can obliterate it from your ui entirely by deleting EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is odd.  I would try loading the UI directly.  In game, type &quot;/load xym&quot;.  Most of the windows will get close to reasonable places.  If that works, then you are doing something wrong with the ini file.  If it doesn't work, then there is something wrong with the UI directory.  At least it should help narrow down the problem.</div></div><hr />

Just a couple of questions.<br />
I'm a fan of T.King art and he has designed quite a few spellbooks (http://pub10.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=217.topic).<br />
I've also use the mod (http://pub165.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31.showMessage?topicID=24.topic) for T.King's spellbooks by Remelio.

<br />
Secondly, I've quite a few characters and I would like to use your UI mod as a base but make little changes here and there to fit the class characteristics. However, when I unzip the xym UI in a different directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\EverQuest\uifiles\bard), another error occured which caused the UI not to load. How do I fix it?

I just tested a TKing version 2 spell book.  I extracted Xym31.zip into a directory by itself and then extracted the default version 2 spell book into the same directory.  It worked without flaws.<br />
<br />
Version 1 spell book didn't work because it is trying to use the normal spell book images as defined in EQUI_Animations.xml and I have removed those.  Attached is an EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml file that should work with TKing's version 1 spell books.<br />

I am not sure what is wrong here.  I do this myself to test the various versions when I post them.  Unzip the package into bard.  Change the word &quot;xym&quot; to &quot;bard&quot; in the ini file.  Alternatively, you can load up xym without changing the ini file and then type &quot;/load bard 1&quot; in game.</div></div><hr />

I was also unable to resize the left side of the chat windows for some reason.  I finally broke down and added the title bar back onto them, which let me drag them wherever I wanted them.<br />
<br />
To do this, edit the EQUI_ChatWindows.XML file, and look for...<br />

I just downloaded your UI and it looks awesome, however for some reason my Stat box, that should be in lower right corner, is missing. Did I miss it somewhere? <br />
The stat box is the Target window.  Hit Alt-T to bring it up.<br />
<br />
I believe you need to hit Alt-C to bring up the compass.<br />
<br />
If you missed the files, you would not have blank spaces, you would see the old target window and the old compass.</div></div><hr />

The pet name and health bar are at the bottom of the player window, so they were not affected.  The pet window was coopted for use as a tick timer.<br />
<br />
If you prefer the default pet window instead of the tick timer, all you have to do is delete EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml from the xym directory.<br />
<br />
If you were using some other pet window, you will have to reinstall it.  Most likely you will have to wait for a patch for that mod, since the Jan 9 patch most likely broke all pet info window mods.</div></div><hr />

Is this the version 1 or version 2 TKing jade spellbook?<br />
<br />
If it is the version 1 book, you should use the image files from the jade spellbook mod and the EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml file that I posted as a fix to my UI for those books.<br />
<br />
EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml for use with T.King version 1 spell books (http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=25262) <br />
<br />
If it is the version 2 book, you should use the complete spell book mod as created by Remelio for those books, including his EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml file.<br />
<br />
I am currently using the version 2 default spell book, but with a different layout of spells on the pages.  I can post my xml for this spell book if people are interested.  I'll attach a screenshot after the servers come back up from the most recent patch.</div></div><hr />

I decided I wanted a Short Duration Buff Window that matched this UI a bit better than the quick fix one Xymmarra released.<br />

My best idea on how to go about doing so was to reduce the size of the icons in the standard buff window, then reduce it and put the SD buff window below it.  Here is a screenshot of what I wound up with.<br />

<br />
I have posted a patch and ask that it be incorporated into my download.  I will try again with a full zip.  I don't want to upload the patched version as a new UI, because the system doesn't handle that very well.  It goes to the back of the queue with a different id.<br />
<br />
i am using xym left hand version is there a way to make the song buff window that shdwphnx made so it will show these changes? <br />
<br />
Yes, that is a simple change.  The only difference between the left and right panels is the decoration.  The window type WDT_Right adds gold flourishes on the left side of the window.  WDT_Left adds them on the right.  All you have to do is open the two files in his patch and change WDT_Right to WDT_Left.<br />
<br />
The corner panels required more rearranging.<br />
<br />
 I am still trying to figure out how to change the border decoration on it around a bit, but not sure if I will be able to. Hopefully Xymarra will beat me to it. <br />
<br />
To get rid of those extra decorations, you would need to make two more WDT types, one that only puts the decoration on the top and one that only puts it on the bottom.  This shouldn't be too hard to get right.<br />
<br />
Just copy and paste the full definition of WDT_Right in Deco.xml a couple times.<br />
Rename to WDT_RightTop and WDT_RightBottom.<br />
Remove Corner_BottomRight from one and Corner_TopRight from the other.<br />
Rename WDT_Right in the two files to the new window types.</div></div><hr />

Yup.  Change needs to be made in the EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml file.  There should only be one line that needs changing, and it is toward the bottom.  Change...<br />
<br />
&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Right&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />

<br />
Those links are in the spell gems window.  The filename is EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml.<br />
<br />
In that file, search for the two items called &lt;InvSlot item = &quot;Range&quot;&gt; and &lt;InvSlot item = &quot;Ammo&quot;&gt;.<br />
<br />
To change their types, you need to change the EQType flag and the Background image.  The EQType flag describes which slot will be used.  The Background tag describes how to draw it. <br />
<br />
You don't need to change the names of the two items, you can leave them as &quot;Range&quot; and &quot;Ammo&quot; with no ill effect.  But, if you do change the names, you will need to change them at the bottom of the file as well.<br />

<br />

I also have been using a different gauge artwork and experimenting with a narrower center panel (image attached).  If people like the new version, I will switch over to it for all the gauges.<br />
<br />
I solo a lot as I don't always have time to play for several hours, so half hour here, half hour there, yada yada. So its important for me to concentrate on my hps and the current gauge is just too small. I need something that screams, &quot;You're dieing you moron!&quot; =)<br />
<br />
I know this request was made rather a while ago, but I have been working on it slowly.  The new health bars have flashing gems in the background of the bottom two bubbles.  Personally, I find the flashing gems so annoying that I keep myself over 30 mana just so I don't have to look at them.  This seems to be a useful adaptation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The invite and disband buttons have image labels, not text labels.  So, sorry, but it is not possible.<br />
<br />
What are the chances you could make the melee patch compatible with the 1024x768 mod? Or maybe post the necessary edits to the Pet window for it?<br />
<br />
A quick fix is to change the height of the window to 395.<br />
<br />
In EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml, search down to:<br />
<br />
	&lt;Screen item = &quot;PetInfoWindow&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
After that, find the line with CY and change 617 to 395 as such:<br />
<br />
	&lt;CY&gt;395&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
<br />
This will cut off the bottom of the window, but at least it will fit in the screen.<br />
<br />
I don't think I want to get into the task of laying out that window for every resolution.  Perhaps some nice person here who wants to use the UI that way can take this on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lasagna</div><div class="date">01-26-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xym, could you please list what windows use what files as their backgrounds? I was attempting to change the cark and light wtd textures, but I ended up with some very strange results -- The actions window being a 3rd color that to my knowledge I dont even have in the folder for one. Just a rundown of what controls whats color would be much appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xym, could you please list what windows use what files as their backgrounds?<br />
<br />
Panel.tga<br />
<br />
The rounded corner windows use Panel.tga.  These are the four corners and the bottom center.  The animations used in the various windows are defined in Deco.tga.  Files for windows that use these textures are:<br />
<br />
EQUI_ActionsWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_GroupWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_TargetWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml<br />
<br />
If you want to use a different texture for the UI background, your best bet is to post it here so I can make a Panel.tga for it, since I have the nicely masked files ready to go in my paint program.<br />
<br />
wnd_bg_light_rock.tga<br />
<br />
Background images are usually defined in a window definition type.  The following window type definitions use wnd_bg_light_rock.tga:<br />
<br />
WDT_Left<br />
WDT_Right<br />
WDT_Thin<br />
WDT_OnePixel<br />
WDT_Def<br />
WDT_Rounded<br />
WDT_RoundedNoTitle<br />
<br />
wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga<br />
<br />
The following window type definitions use wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga:<br />
<br />
WDT_Chat<br />
WDT_ThinDark<br />
WDT_OnePixelDark<br />
WDT_Def2<br />
WDT_Inner<br />
<br />
Listing the windows that use those window types would require describing every window in the game.  I assume your problem was with the Panel.tga file, so I won't go into the rest now.  If this doesn't answer your question, please ask me again. ;)</div></div><hr />

This ends up a tint thats darker than any of the other windows. Is this window automaticly tinted? Or if not, whats causing this? And I may have to take you up on the offer to make a panel.tga, once Ive found the right background (Dont wanna bug you multiple times (Like im not :rolleyes: ))</div></div><hr />

That's the effect of a bug that I have been complaining about forever.  All subwindows are faded, regardless of the fade value of the parent window.  Sorry, there is nothing we can do to fix it other than whine to Verant to fix their bug.  This is another of those &quot;one number in code&quot; bugs.  Subwindows should have 100% opacity, not whatever silly value they now have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The chat windows are setup without a titlebar on them, which unfortunately has the side effect of making them unmovable.  However, then can be resized.  To position the window where you want it, just drag one edge at a time.  However, many people have trouble moving the left edge.  If it happens to you as well, please check some of the older messages in this thread for ways to work around it.<br />

The first thing is, I suggested to you a while back to offer an inverted decoration around the compass for those who may want it at the top of their screen, a &quot;hanging vine&quot; as opposed to a.............&quot;vine that grows upwards&quot; :D <br />
I suppose I could go about altering the tga file myself, I've downloaded a program called Xnview (http://www.xnview.com) so that I could view the texture files, but it just left me with more questions than answers. Anyhoo....<br />
<br />
Also, since the patch yesterday, many were unable to use their custom UI's, myself being one of them. After loading the default UI and realizing how utterly inferior it is, I decided to just paste the two new files VI had patched in the default folder into my xym folder. This seemed to do the trick, untill this morning. The patcher had received more files this morning (though nothing else appeared in the default folder), and when i logged on, my left-side panel was missing. I am a monk, so it's the one with my inventory in it. I tried every alt + A-Z combo trying to get it to reappear. The pet window file is still in my xym folder, but for some reason it won't show up, not after reloading the UI in game nor repasting it from your original xym melee patch file.<br />
Please help me Xymarra! I'm sure I'm a retard and the solution is simple!<br />
Thanx much<br />

<br />
That is still in my mind, but I haven't gotten around to it.  I tried simply inverting the existing decoration, but it looked wrong.  I will need to draw a new one.<br />
<br />
Also, since the patch yesterday, many were unable to use their custom UI's, myself being one of them.<br />
<br />
I don't know what they broke this time.  I was able to log in without errors, using both the regular and mel&amp;eacute;e versions of my UI.<br />
<br />
After loading the default UI and realizing how utterly inferior it is, I decided to just paste the two new files VI had patched in the default folder into my xym folder.<br />
<br />
Hm, that should not be necessary.  EQ always looks in the default directory if it can't find something in your UI directory.<br />
<br />
The patcher had received more files this morning (though nothing else appeared in the default folder), and when i logged on, my left-side panel was missing.<br />
<br />
The left side panel for mel&amp;eacute;es is the pet window.  Try Alt-F1 to bring it up.</div></div><hr />

Getting the test patch may add some missing files and fix the crashing.<br />
<br />
If you are still crashing to desktop, look in your UIErrors.txt file in your EverQuest directory.  Find any lines that start with the word &quot;Error&quot; and post those lines.   There will be about fifty lines that look like:<br />
Warning: file XXX not found in directory UIFiles\xym\.  Attempting to use file from Default skin.<br />
These are completely normal, so please do not post them.<br />
<br />
If there are no error messagess in the UI, it is likely that something other than the UI itself is causing the crashes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't want to post a file, since I will probably change the animations file and I don't want to keep posting variations, but I will give instructions:<br />
<br />
Open up EQUI_Animations.xml in a text editor.<br />
Search for &quot;DefaultCursor&quot;.<br />
This should lead you to this block of code:<br />
	&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DefaultCursor&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
		&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
			&lt;Texture&gt;Deco.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
			&lt;Location&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;160&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;Size&gt;<br />
				&lt;CX&gt;25&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
				&lt;CY&gt;25&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
			&lt;Duration&gt;10000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
Replace it with this block of code:<br />
	&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_DefaultCursor&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
		&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
			&lt;Texture&gt;window_pieces01.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
			&lt;Location&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;230&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;40&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;Size&gt;<br />
				&lt;CX&gt;22&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
				&lt;CY&gt;22&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
				&lt;X&gt;4&lt;/X&gt;<br />
				&lt;Y&gt;1&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
			&lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />

Just wanted to know if this UI works at 600 x 800 resolution. thats what I always play at and i'm looking for a good enc UI.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried running it at that resolution.  I am afraid most of the graphics are a bit too big.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to have a pet window and keep your timer?<br />
Perhaps by using the small window in the bottom right hand side that has the icons with some numbers?<br />
<br />
The easiest thing is to use a different unused window.  Attached is a version that clobbers the Friends window.  You need to delete the EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml file or put in a different one to use this window.</div></div><hr />

I just started using this UI after the patch 2/4/03, and I cannot seem to get the compass to display. Everything else seems working well, and I don't get an error, but I simply cannot see it anywhere.  when trying to move out the EQUI_CompassWnd.xml file, I simply get a load error and it defaults to the default UI (I assume there is a request somewhere to load your custom compass file, thus the error). I haven't really looked into the XML at all, but I suppose I could if need be. I run at 1280x1024, and am just using the default version of your UI that I downloaded from this site. <br />

Sorry, that has been the solution to the problem almost every time someone posts &quot;I can't see a panel&quot;.<br />
<br />
If there isn't an answer for this I guess i will just have to go in and disable whatever you put in to force it to only use your compass, as trying to use the default compass with your UI simply breaks the UI.<br />
<br />
The default compass breaks because I removed its artwork from EQUI_Animations.xml.  Those are the last two animations in the default file, so if you copy them over, the default compass should work.<br />
<br />
I am afraid I don't have a good guess as to why you aren't seeing the compass.  I assume you also tried editing your ini file and loading without using the ini file.  Is there something very unusual about your computer?<br />
<br />
Is anyone else having this problem?<br />
<br />
EDIT:  There is one thing to try.  When I was designing the compass, I found that if I messed up the size numbers, it didn't show up at all.  You might try editing the compass window and increasing the dimensions of the window.  It might look funny, but if you make it big enough, it should show up.  Then at least we would know what the problem was.</div></div><hr />

The UI file that is included with the UI has the &quot;show&quot; variable for the compass window as '1', but the named UI file I had put in my directory had somehow set that variable to '0', thus the compass wasn't showing up. I doublechecked the initial unnamed file that you included, and it does have it set to '1', so not sure how it got set to '0'. Either way, it's working now. Thanks for the tips.</div></div><hr />

and I love them. Could you posible do the same thing for the Charm Slot Image(window_pieces04) so that itlooks like the other INV pieces?<br />

I used a feather for the charms slot.  If I see something more appropriate later, I might change it.<br />

The charms slot is in a different image from all the other inventory slots.  If you include my window_pieces04.tga, you will get my custom compass art along with the new charms slot.  Sorry about that. ;)</div></div><hr />

That would be the tick timer.  It is a one minute clock that resides in the pet window.  You can make it appear by typing Alt-F1 in game or by editing your .ini file.<br />

I am afraid that is not movable at this time.  It is on the list of things that we would like Verant to change about the UI.  Pretty much your only options are to move your UI elements around so it isn't on top of anything important or to turn it off.  I don't remember the default key command for turning it off, something like Ctrl-F12.  You can find it by looking in your key bindings in the Options window.</div></div><hr />

I was curious if this is possble or not.  Can you take the bag in slot 1 and give me access to each item without going into inventory so that it takes up the blank section on the side.

However, that is ok as being a warrior it is not crucial to my play.If you are using the mel&amp;eacute;e version, that is why you don't see the timer.  I had to use that window to make the left hand inventory panel, since warriors don't get a spells panel.<br />

About the best you can do is leave a bag right next to the edge of your screen and hotkey the bag.  Then you can hit your key and swap between the weapon slots and the open bag.</div></div><hr />

This was discussed a while back (around post # 39 or so... http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=20843#post20843), and unfortunately, it turned out to not be possible due to the way the background textures &amp; borders have to be applied to get the scrollwork appearance that helps make this skin so unique.<br />

Moving the side panels from left to right is very easy.<br />
<br />
To get a left handed mel&amp;eacute;e version:<br />
<br />
In a fresh directory,<br />
unzip the basic XymUI<br />
unzip the mel&amp;eacute;e mod, and<br />
install the lefty mod.<br />
<br />
Now open up EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml, the only file that was changed by the mel&amp;eacute;e mod and search for this line:<br />
<br />
&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Left&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
Change the word &quot;Left&quot; to &quot;Right&quot;, since you want that panel to appear on the right hand side of your screen, as such:<br />
<br />
&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Right&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
You will have to drag that panel to the proper location, but otherwise you should be good to go.</div></div><hr />

I figured mele types wouldn't miss the tick timer. ;)  It is not available with that mod.  The one minute timer lives in the pet info window, which is the window I used to make the inventory side panel.  I did make a version of the tick timer that inhabits the friends window (http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=32227) instead of the pet window, for those who want both a full pet window and a tick timer.<br />
<br />
If you want some nice timers for spawns, buffs or disciplines, please check out Arista's timers (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/customize.asp).  The panels that I use are: Actions, Pet, Compass, Group, Player and Target.  So, if you put the timers in Bug, Feedback, Friends, Gems, Help or Notes, you should be fine.<br />
<br />
If there is a lot of interest in these, I can try to make a skin for them that matches.</div></div><hr />

I've now come to prefer having my buffs boxes (normal and song) horizontally across the top. Is there any chance you could add that as an option? One of the side benefits to this is that it would free up the right side of the screen, which would allow for a caster to have both the spells window up as well as the inventory window up, one on each side of the screen.</div></div><hr />

This seems like the sort of option that you could put together fairly easily from existing pieces.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of nice horizontal buff boxes available.  Pick any one and install it.<br />
<br />
Get the inventory pet panel from the mel&amp;eacute;e version.  Change it from left side to right side.<br />
<br />
If you want to keep the tick timer, use the friends window version for that.</div></div><hr />

I've gone to using the &quot;Wood&quot; background graphic in 1600x1200 mode, and have made a few tweaks myself.<br />
<br />
I've adjusted the right bar with your optional &quot;Song Buffs&quot; mod, and made them both as long as the left bar... plus I'm putting use to the Stats Window with words (the pictures are just TOO small in 1600x1200, heh).<br />
<br />
Overall I like the group window with the F-Keys added to it. I love the way you've designed the Music Player. I really love the inventory slots along the Left Bar, also.<br />
<br />
I'd really love to see a few minor tweaks to the whole thing tho. For example.. I can't seem to get my Chat Window titlebars to come back no matter what options I change / tweak. They just won't show up. Another thing that's  just a minor irk... there is no highlighting for Active Items in the Vendor Mode window for the bazaar. So if I'm selling things I can't tell what items are active or inactive without some work. The missing green highlight that's normally there would be a very nice correction.<br />
<br />
Another minor thing I'd love to see an option / adjustment for is having a 1600x1200 version of the &quot;Left Bar with Spellbook button&quot; mod. If I use the existing one, it downsizes the bar from 1600x1200 compatible size.<br />

All that said, I really love it and just hope you keep it working with future patches !</div></div><hr />

It's not that it's not there, it's that the color of your UI is green, so it's difficult to see.  The only thing I really see messed up with the bazaar trader window is the button that says begin or end trader.  When you first enter trader mode, Begin Trader and End Trader both show, after clicking it, it works as it should.  Personally, not a big deal to me.<br />
<br />
One thing I would like is to put the auto equip area in place of the range/ammo slots that are on the (i think) spell bar.  I'm pretty sure I can do the code, but do I have to remove it from the Inv window?<br />
<br />
Another thing I did was made the Spellbook button available.  I didn't actually make a button, but I made it so the scrolly area below the 8th spell gem was the click area for the button.<br />
<br />
I also also added a pet info window from Aledark's UI.  I didn't re add the timer yet though.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is my favorite UI (Aledark comes in 2nd), and I've tried quite a few</div></div><hr />

Scarey enough, I HAVE actually edited the Style_Titlebar line in the ChatWindow XML file to &quot;TRUE&quot;.. and the title bar STILL doesn't come back. Heck I've even removed the whole damned file from the directory and reloaded the UI. STILL didn't do the trick. Guess I'll just have to fiddle with it some more.<br />
<br />
As for the vendor mode thing, yes someone mentioned that the item highlight is there.. I'm just not seeing it because of the background window color. Well... I'm using the Woodgrain pattern. That green item highlight should stand out like a sore thumb. :D <br />
<br />
I hadn't thought about jumping the spellbook button code over from the smaller bar, thanks for the idea. I can do that myself easily, I'll just have to fiddle with the location on the bar... and that's not that hard.<br />
<br />
As for the ability for you to edit 1600x1200 versions of your UI I fully understand that difficulty. I'm just happy you've gotten a default 1600x1200 out. I myself have already tweaked the short duration buffs window as well as the standard buffs window. I made the buff 'buttons' a tad smaller so I could fight all 15 (or however many) all on the shorter bar. I also made the Short Duration Buff 'buttons' the same size .. just so it all lines up and looks right (which ends up giving me space for 7 short duration buffs on the bar... even tho there aren't that many.. but that's another issue.)<br />
<br />
I'll post a screenshot as soon as I can log in. (As of right now I can't even get in Everquest. EQGAME.EXE is crashing on me at startup.)</div></div><hr />

This is an issue with the default window.  I didn't want to replace any of the newer, more complicated windows, because Verant seems to like to change them a lot.  I never plan to replace the Options window, because new options are constantly being added, and I will never replace any of the bazaar windows, because I don't use them enough to notice when they break.  <br />
<br />
I'll screw around with it again and see what I can figure out, concerning the chat windows.<br />
<br />
As per your suggestion about the bank window.. can you tell me what changes are still required in order for your mod to be compatible?</div></div><hr />

I tried deleting the bankwnd.xml but still no go.<br />
do I have to copy the ini file to the everquest folder again, overwriting the old 3.1 ini version? that would delete all my settings which took very long to set :(<br />
maybe you can post the changes here which should be done to the ini file?</div></div><hr />

It's called EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml.  So, you don't have to do anything.  Eventually I will get around to making my own version of the big bank, but for now theirs is fine.<br />
<br />
I logged on with no issues today, made a froglok, and stomped around.  The map worked fine.  The big bank box was there.  I was able to bring up the LFG window ... although nobody was actually using it.  Similarly, the guild window came up, but my character was not guilded.<br />
<br />
I'll try reinstalling it from the uploaded version to see if I missed something there.</div></div><hr />

Well...don't know what resolved my problem, but I did the following:  deleted the xym bank xml file and left the bazaar.  Did not crash since.  The bazaar is definitely buggy on Talon Zek...example...tried to zone out to nexus, but if I ran out the left side of the hallway I would get transported to the stairs leading to the Shadowhaven side of bazaar.  Did it twice.  So problem was result of bazaar, I gather.<br />

<br />
      I'm having a problem with the filters of the chat menu... My main grief of this topic is the channels filter when you right click the chat box area where you type at. For the left chat box I selected Channels----&gt; Say and for the right I selected Channels----&gt; Guild (just to clarify I'm talking about Filters----&gt;Channel------&gt;?insert channel here?) Now with that setting the Text from npc's mostly still goes into my right chat box, instead of my left chat box, where its suppose to be going.<br />

    When your in trader mode and you click begin there is a green highlighted border that goes around the items that are active and ready for selling, maybe by changing the trader ui so that the green highlight overlaps the UI instead of the UI overlaping the green highlight; or if thats not the case then maybe increasing the border size of the green highlight or increasing the bightness of the green highlight.<br />

<br />
I did the following to my Xym Directory:<br />
<br />
- Deleted the BankWnd.xml file<br />
- Copied over BankWnd.xml &amp; BigBank.xml from the &quot;default&quot; directory<br />
<br />
... and mine works just fine. I don't have a looking for group button on my Party Window (that would be the upper right corner one) but I'm okay with that since I can put it on shortcut-key to bring it up.<br />
<br />
When I log in I've got my Xymarra skin working just fine, and all new features for LoY work just fine! <br />
<br />
-XYMARRA-<br />
I figured out why I couldn't get my Titlebar to come back for my chat windows. I had capitolized the &quot;T&quot; in True... apparently EQ doesn't like that. I changed to to a lower case &quot;t&quot; and now the titlebars are there just fine and dandy. Who knew, heh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JeremyT</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah I said I'd post a JPG of my version of the interface, so here it is converted down from 1600x1200 to something more reasonable!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I should alert everyone to the fact that the moderators of this site have given me a special category for UI mods.  Instead of creating attachments, I will post them as full fledged UI mods in the Xym UI category (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?op=showfiles&amp;catid=49).  It was a little chaotic at first, since I didn't see exactly how it worked, but I think I have it mostly under control now. ;)  The mods with consistent names are the right ones to download.<br />
<br />
When your in trader mode and you click begin there is a green highlighted border that goes around the items that are active and ready for selling, maybe by changing the trader ui so that the green highlight overlaps the UI instead of the UI overlaping the green highlight; or if thats not the case then maybe increasing the border size of the green highlight or increasing the bightness of the green highlight.<br />
<br />
Ok, I tried setting up a vendor for the first time.  My little test character now has a backpack full of Crushbone belts available at the standard price. ;)  However, I can't figure out what this highlight is.  Is it in the trader satchel or the trader window?  When does it appear.  I couldn't see it in the default UI.<br />
<br />
There is a yellow highlight around the item I am currently pricing.  This is the same highlight that appears when I buy or sell an item at a vendor.<br />
<br />
If someone could please show me a screenshot of the highlight appearing correctly in the default UI, I will try to figure out why it isn't appearing in mine.  Once again, there is no bazaar window in my UI, either for buying or selling, so if there is a problem with those windows that is specific to my UI it is only with the skins, not with the window itself.<br />
<br />
- Deleted the BankWnd.xml file<br />
You do not need to do this.  The new big bank window uses a separate xml file.<br />
<br />
- Copied over BankWnd.xml &amp; BigBank.xml from the &quot;default&quot; directory<br />
Please don't ever copy files from the default directory.  EQ will find the files in default if they are not in your custom UI.  If you copy them over, you will miss any subsequent updates that Verant makes to those files.<br />
<br />
The Gauges:<br />
<br />
For the Gauges I would like to see my Stamina Gauge<br />
<br />
The Targeting Gauge, I seem to have a problem with also; because the character and targeting gauge is the same size I get confused somewhat. I believe it'd be more readable if it was a smidge thinner not alot, but enough to tell a difference.<br />
The stamina is the thin pale yellow bar underneath your mana.<br />
<br />
The player health bar and mana could use the normal 100 pixel bar instead of the larger 150 pixel bar.  I made it larger in response to a request that the player health bar be larger than the group health bars.  Everyone has different preferences. ;)<br />
<br />
The Spellbook Button:<br />
<br />
I've notice that their isn't any spellbook button underneath your mem`d spells; I was wondering if you could add it.<br />
There is a mod to add that button.  It is linked from the first page of this thread.  After I get around to testing it again, I will put it up as a mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I finally got that green glow to appear and figured out the trader window thing.<br />
<br />
The problem is with my graphics for an inventory slot.  The default graphic for A_RecessedBox is the image of a grey inset box.  My graphics use transparency to allow the underlying texture to show through.  The way they manage that green highlight under the items for sale is to tint the graphic for A_RecessedBox bright green.  If you look closely, you can see that the bottom and right edges of the slots are highlighted.  The center of the slot is not highlighted, because that portion of the slot graphic is completely transparent.<br />
<br />
I can fix this problem by creating a new graphic for those slots and putting up a trader window that uses the new graphic.  I don't have time to do it right now, but I will try to get to it in the next day or two.</div></div><hr />

No major rush at all on the Bazaar Vendor window thing, I just wanted to mention it to you for a correction in the event that you came out with a major revision in the next week or so.<br />
<br />
As for the Bank Files, I hadn't really worried about not getting those files updated if I copied them.. mostly because I make notes on my UI changes and whatnot. So I remember if I need to re-copy a &quot;default UI&quot; window.<br />
<br />
Why would I put myself through that madness? Well having my own copy of the Bank window in each character's UI directory (I have 3 copies of my Xym Interface, technically) allows me to make minor tweaks and changes (Like changing the name for the windows themselves in-game). It's all minor stuff that just more customizes the UI to whichever Character I play. Mostly minor &quot;fun stuff&quot; changes.<br />
<br />
For instance , in my Bazaar Window I changed the top window title in the Window Title Bar from Bazaar Vendor ... to &quot;Yahmish's Global Emporium !&quot; for my Ranger. Heh<br />
<br />
And concerning Mods, let me know and I'll wrap up a &quot;Generic 1600x1200&quot; version of your UI I've tweaked to using, and will upload it. Just tell me where / how to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it didn't take very long.  I just used the old default inventory slot.  Attached is a fix to the trader window issue.

If you would like to post it, feel free.<br />
<br />
Create a zip file with only the files that you have changed.  It is best to test it once by unzipping the base UI and then your mod into a fresh directory and loading it in game to be sure it is correct and complete.<br />
<br />
Attach it to a post on this thread.  Attach a screen shot to another post, or I can use the one you already posted.  I will link it from the front page.<br />
<br />
Be warned, though.  Once you put something up and people start using it, you are obligated to maintain it. ;)</div></div><hr />
