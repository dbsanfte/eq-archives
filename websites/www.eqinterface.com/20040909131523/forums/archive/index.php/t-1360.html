VERT Style Square Buttons:<br />

The mod only changed the spell icons and buttons, the hot box was just to show them as shortcuts.<br />
Made this to help those people who wanted the spell book button back and to fit in hot button windows..<br />
<br />
Just put these two files in your VERT folder and your ready to go!<br />

<br />
Basically all this is... the same as VERT's regular player window with the addition of the mana bar to the melee set-up.  I found this would work for me as a more general set-up to use between my melee and casters.<br />
<br />
I also added the graphic file for the icons.<br />

<br />
I replaced the Icons in the Player Window with text and put in ALL stats there.<br />
<br />
added the petgauge at bottom of HP gauge, Mana and stamina gauge are both in there now, too.<br />
<br />
HB window now has the 8 general slots in there insteads of 4 general and 4 other and i shuffled the order of the Prim/sec/range/Ammo around a bit to make it easier for juggling instruments.<br />
<br />
Edited EQUI_Animations to get t.king's spellbooks right, all other t.king spellbooks and default VI spellbook should work now.<br />
<br />
Got t.king's spellgem bar in (Jade) DON'T CHANGE THIS!! At least not, if you don't know how to edit the EQUI_Animations.xml; the actual Animations file is a mix of Verts and t.kings.<br />

Hope you all like it...<br />

Just replace the spellbook grphic (spellbook01-04.tga) and the EQUI_spellbookwnd.xml and you should be fine.<br />
The trouble comes with changing the spell gem bar, that's the one I use Jade for. My spellbook is the Mandolin, by the way, not the one I like most but I kinda feel obligated to use, being a bard...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iluvatar</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, i'll give it a second try.<br />
Here's all the changes I made to Vert's wonderful UI.<br />
<br />
Player Window:<br />
Put up all stats at bottom in 3 rows, 3 columns.<br />
Gauges for Mana and Fatigue both in.<br />
Added Pet Health Gauge on lower part of HP gauge.<br />
<br />
Hotbutton Window:<br />
Changed it so you got all 8 general Inv slots there, shuffled around the Prim, Sec, Range and Ammo slots to better suit a bard for juggling.<br />
Order is now like this:<br />
General_1	General_5<br />
General_2	General_6<br />
General_3	General_7<br />
General_4	General_8<br />
Primary_Hand	Secondary_Hand<br />
Ranged_Wpn	Ammo<br />
<br />
<br />
Modified Animations and Spellbook to get t.king's BEAUTIFUL spellbooks, Icons and spellgems to work.<br />
<br />
Archive includes only the .xml files, you need to add the graphic files (.tga) with spellbook, spellicons and spellgemicons yourself (did that to keep the .zip small enough).<br />
<br />
Taking out the cast bar and use only the spellbook works fine (see readme_too.txt in the .zip file)<br />
<br />
Having ONLY the cast bar and NOT the spell book is NOT possible without changing the EQUI_Animations.xml file manually.<br />
<br />
<br />
You should be able to use ALL t.king spellbooks with this Mod (again, see readme_too.txt in the .zip file).<br />
<br />
<br />
Now let's see if the Attachment Upload works...<br />
<br />
Velvet<br />
<br />
Edit: I believe I finally made it to get the attachment in there (ya, go ahead, call me stupid, next time I'd better read the maximum size note before trying to attach a 2MB file...:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now.. Is there any way to link them up so that they're one unified window? I lnow I've seen it (I'm using a version of one now) but the one's I've seen are fone on my main EQ box that runs in 1290 but my secondary box is limited to 1024 and the size of the mod takes up too much valuable space. The slimmer footprint of the mod you have there would be perfect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krip</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure you could just make the player window much longer and put everything in the one window if that's what you mean?<br />

Personally I just line em all up on one side as shown in the screenshot :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Name / Surname<br />
Hpgauge / Hp% (with pet hp included)<br />
Managauge / Mana%<br />

XPgauge / XP%<br />
AAXPgauge / AAXP%<br />

Could you apply that to the Inventory window for us? Or possibly do a version with Pet Health replacing stamnia? Int caster here as well.<br />

<br />
send me an email with your uierrors.txt file to dhoracek1@cox.net<br />
<br />
whats happening is that when you add something in the XMl file you give it a name for instance PW_PlayerName I try to use the name of the window IE PW = player window. and if the author of the other mod assigned the same name to something, it will give an error. The good part is this is SO SO easy to fix. Just send me an email with the name of the mod you used, and the uierrors file and I'll get you fixed up.<br />

Well you want a stand alone spell casting gauge? if So theres different mods you can find for it, look at the Vert 2.1 Tweaks thread for them.<br />

As it is, with no pet the lower right three quarters of the health bar is blacked out, and with a pet, the pet health bar appears not below but on top of the player health bar and is aligned about half an inch to the right of all the other bars.<br />
<br />
I'd really like to use this... I find all the new player windows to be WAY too busy to be able and keep track of my own health easily while I'm watching the player window to see who needs heals. I've died several times because I didn't notice my own health dropping while I was running around casting Torpor on everyone else. I like the fancy player windows during downtime but during fights they are worse than useless for anybody who is main healer in a group.</div></div><hr />

    But i downloaded the original wis version sokol-wiswv and then the int version sokol-intwv for my cleric and chanter respectively.  Only problem is that on the int version the casting timer that appears on the mana bar appears a little too the right when it starts and almost touches the mana %.  Then if i have a pet up his hp guage is also shifted too the right a bit.  Is there any way you could left justify both of them or tell me what too change so they will look right ?  I am still Very new too the mods business but i love these for the simple cleanliness that they bring too my window.<br />

When you open a book, right click on it and turn off the background. It isn't pretty, but it makes the books readable.</div></div><hr />
