<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afton</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just run the yeksha zone in advanced and let it patch some files.  it might be getto way but it works for now.</div></div><hr />

I too am having this very same problem.  I load EQ, it goes through it's nice little humor bar, you know the one, &quot;DING!&quot;  LFG &lt;looking for graphics&gt;&quot; etc. till it says Finished loading world, then crash to desktop.

No where is there a file named EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml  on my hard drive.  Verant has struck once again!  So much for a bigger and better bank!<br />
<br />
/rude VI :mad: <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll play with this tonight when I get home from work, and post a fix for it, if I find one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KingGeo</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just run testeverquest.exe  to patch all the missing files off the patch server, then cancel out and start up EQ again.   All should be well after that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I'd really love to know what the heck is going on?  Are folks getting 2 or 3 or 4 different patch downloads?<br />
<br />
Some say nothing has changed.<br />
Some (like myself) get the:<br />
  		&lt; Include &gt;EQUI_BodyTintWnd.xml&lt; /Include &gt;<br />
Some seem to be getting the:<br />
 &lt; Include &gt;EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml &lt; /Include &gt;<br />
<br />
Weird.<br />
<br />
But yes, if it is looking for the EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml file, then run the patch from the Test Server which will drop that file into your Default folder, and you should then be able to log on okay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dyschord</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After trying all the numerous suggestions listed all over, still crashing after I zone.<br />
<br />
I use Vert 2.2 Crystal Meth.<br />
<br />
Not sure what else to check or do. Are the Vert 2.3's crashing, or are they working normally?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felblade</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welp, I seem to be able to log in now using the default UI, but I have ghosting with my cursor, and my Zone Alarm status icon in the task bar blinks through the interface.  Not running in windowed mode either.  It seems playable, didn't crash while zoning at least!<br />
<br />
Anyhow, it seems maybe VI needs to finish ironing out the kinks on this patch, so I'll wait till tomorrow to see whats up.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

Temp fix that works for me is to  Alt + Enter into windowed mode, then go back to full screen.<br />
<br />
nice patch day *sigh*</div></div><hr />
