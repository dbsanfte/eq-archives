<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mathezar</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all =) i've searched long and hard for a good (updated prior to 2/24/03) UI for my mage.  I have a great one for my ranger (look for Mav's if anyone has a ranger out there hehe) and i would like to get a good one for my mage.  If anyone would like to share their current UI or a brand new one coming out I would be very grateful to all who help out. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rashnu</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the modified version of Quartz called Alyquartz for my mage.  He is my main and I have found it to be the most efficient UI for mages.  Not sure how I could get it to you but there is one here but as far as I know not updated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mathscitch</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alyquartz has the updated version out for LoY.  I believe its on the complete sets.  If you can't find it there you might also check in the Featured sets too.  I tried his for my wiz but didn't particularly like it.  Most of the UI's I have found are too small ( I 2 box alot and use the mouse so I need larger buttons).<br />

I hope that helps.<br />
