Sooo..  you could put everything into the group window in order to keep the buttons availabe, but then you'll lose the new target indicator thing (it will only show up in the target window) ..  You could put everything in the target window, but then you won't have the buttons (some people do this because you can make a hotkey for the buttons, or use text commands like /lfg) <br />
<br />
What I would suggest though (unless you are wanting to use one of the boxes for other stuff) is to simply size the windows to similar dimensions and then stack them on your screen..  (which I believe is the default anyway.. ) ...</div></div><hr />
