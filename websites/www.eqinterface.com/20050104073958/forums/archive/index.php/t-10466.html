I extracted the zip file into my EverQuest/UIFiles directory and since it didnt come in its own folder I made it Enok.TKin<br />
<br />
In game, the links to items, dont actually link. Cant click on them. I wondered if someone could tell me what file this was in, and what to add or change to make items link again.<br />
<br />
Also for LDoN. The blue line in compass doesn't show up. I love the compass graphic in this file, while I know where most of the dungeon entrances are, its still kinda peeving not to have it there. Duno if this is a simple line of code that needs to be changed or something really complicated.<br />
<br />
I would really just like to be able to open links to item descriptions, the blue line is really not a huge deal but figured i would post it int he event its something tiny to resolve :)<br />
<br />
Thanks to any who can help.</div></div><hr />

There should be a lock somewhere that you can click to allow you to click through.  From one of his FAQs:<br />

Q: Why can't I click on links in the chat window(s)?<br />
A: The &quot;Sneeze Guard&quot; prevents clicks on hitsmode chat windows; to<br />
fix this simply click the little &quot;locked&quot; icon in the Main Chat<br />
window's upper right corner, then links will be clickable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Elindel is right about the chatlock (although I'm removing that from my new stuff since the &quot;Always Chat Here&quot; option now works correctly). As for the compass, thanks for letting me know. The UI I personally use now (Enoks UI Sleek) DOESN'T have that problem with the compass and I don't know what causes that problem. I'll look into it.<br />

<br />
The only thing I wish I could cover is the close box.  So annoying to accidently close a window that has 15 different things being sent to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ill have to search for the sleek one and see if i like it as much as I do the one I have atm.<br />
<br />
I read through 2 of the &quot;readme's&quot; that came with 2 of the Enok series UI's and didnt see this &quot;sneeze guard&quot;. Didnt even realize the little image on the chat window to &quot;unlock&quot; either. Guess I should buy some glasses! lol.<br />
<br />
Thank you all! I am fixed hooray! Minus the lacking blue line but hey i got a map! :)</div></div><hr />
