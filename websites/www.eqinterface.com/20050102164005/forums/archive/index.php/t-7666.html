<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any reason why my error log would suddenly be filled with row after row after row ad infinitum of this:<br />
<br />
Warning: file UIFiles\xymelee\ not found in directory UIFiles\xymelee\.  Attempting to use file from Default skin<br />
Warning: file UIFiles\xymelee\ not found in directory UIFiles\xymelee\.  Attempting to use file from Default skin<br />
Warning: file UIFiles\xymelee\ not found in directory UIFiles\xymelee\.  Attempting to use file from Default skin.....etc.<br />
<br />
Does this make any sense??<br />
I use xymarra's UI for melee, so my custom UI folder is called 'xymelee'. It was working yesterday just fine, but today I am crashing upon every zone, goin straight to DT. It also crashes when i attempt to /load xymelee in game.<br />
Could someone please explain to me what &quot;folder xyz not found in folder xyz&quot; is supposed to mean?<br />
Thanks<br />

That is saying that it can't find your files, and the reason it is crashing to desktop is because it keeps writing that line over and over and over and over and ... every couple of seconds, which very very quickly gives you a massive UIError.txt log file, and your system just can't handle it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I hadn't changed anything before I logged on today, I just kept dropping to desktop every time i tried to zone. I have made some changes and customizations to various files in the past couple of days and before then too, but nothing like this has happened untill now. I'm not an xml wiz by any means, but I am usually smart enough to figure out what is wrong from the error log and fix it. I have patched my UI files completely on my own since LoY came out and have almost always been able to make things work when something is wrong. But I'm dying out here now :confused: Those messages don't make any sense to me.<br />
<br />
Thanks for you time<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try this.<br />
<br />
In your eqclient.ini and UI_CharName_Server#.ini file, change the appropriate lines back to default.  Then when you get in game, try doing the /loadskin CustomFolderName 1 command.  Don't use the loadskin window, type it in manually.  If that doesn't work, and you haven't changed anything since the last time you were in game (and everything was fine?), then it's gonna be a tedious process to find out where the problem is.  Start with the suggestion I just made, and let us know. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just did what you told me, wrote default in my client and the other char/server file. Logged on and tried to zone without even attempting to reload my custom UI.....and I still crashed. <br />
This is fun innit?!<br />

<br />
I have noticed the UI files errors at times also, but never a consistent thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, if you are crashing out using the default UI, then obviously it isn't the skin that is causing your problem.  I'd suggest you do as Enchasze just said, and go hit up the Tech Support forums at the EQLive site.  Sorry. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kurgan</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think the solution is that a file is corrupt in the default UI folder, I would try deleteing that folder and let EQ repatch it in. Then I would move your you custom UI folder and force the default to load, then i would put my customs files back in fresh from new files. Its erroring when trying to find the default file, not the custom file. Atleast that is my guess here. I may be wrong, im certainly no expert by any means LOL<br />

Logged on. Tried to zone, and crashed. Please tell me I am not going to have to reinstall Everquest, I'd rather gouge my eyes out with a rusty grapefruit spoon.<br />

Thanks again for the help<br />

Sorry i couldnt be of more help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure I'm really finding any answers on the tech support boards. It's kinda hard to determine the root of a problem that occured out of nowhere. I have a well running, high quality computer with everything that's needed to run EQ and then some. Having everything up-to-date and compatible makes a lot of the tech help listed obsolete.<br />
Unless any of you want to see what's written in my dbg.txt  file about the crashes, I'll go post on the tech support board and see about getting some answers there.<br />

<br />
hehehe<br />
<br />
My son has had a similar issue recently which for some whacked reason seems to be temporarily corrected by deleting the files in the USERDATA folder.  These are your coversations with the NPC's and in some cases they are causing serious issues.<br />
<br />
I have also heard that the /FILTER Badword option needs to be turned off in order to zone in some cases.....<br />
<br />
But the most heinous of all these accusations would be that the guild management tool has a very subtle but destructive bug in it that is causing zone issues.  <br />
<br />
I would try the first option, consider the second, and see if you can disable the loading of the guildmanagement window in the EQUI.XML file.<br />
<br />
Good Luck....I know your pain.<br />
Oh...and have a banana it's healthier for you than grapefruit.<br />

You are my savior sc2! Who would have thought that the Userdata was to blame. I deleted that, and I've been able to zone just fine. And my custom UI works, of course, not being the problem anyway hehe. <br />
Also, if there is a file in the userdata folder that isn't supposed to be there, could that also cause problems? For some reason I had placed a texture file in there by mistake (shame on me, shame shame).<br />
Thank you for making my day better!<br />

/em dances on his tiptoes....<br />
<br />
Glad the info could help!<br />
There is so much on the SoE BBS, that sometimes it is very hard to decide what is worth looking at and what is pure trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting.  That's a new one for me, I'll have to try to remember it.  Glad it's all working now (that being the main thing.) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Enchasze</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Userdata file?  Is that also been updated since LoY with all the new quests?<br />
<br />
Haven't seen that one on the Dev boards , might want to /feedback/bug/report it.<br />
<br />
Nice solution to keep in mind.<br />
