And B: Cause horrendous video lag. In total I have 6 files in my custom UI ... I was wondering if anyone else was having the same problem or knew a fix. My UI has the following changes in case it helps.<br />
<br />
EQUI_Buffwindow<br />
EQUI_Animations<br />
EQUI_Hotbuttonwnd<br />
EQUI_Inventory<br />
Window_hotkeys.tga<br />
Buff bitmap image<br />
<br />
Edit: After playing around trying to find the problem, i've narrowed it down to my Animations file ... anyone know what inside it could be causing the problem?</div></div><hr />

Error: Could not find child A_AttackIndicatorAnim in window PlayerWindow</div></div><hr />

is at least one of the problems you are having, CeggoEQ.  You need to make the appropriate changes to the Player Window.  <br />
<br />
Also, both of you, see if my note about the changes to the EQUI.xml file make a difference when corrected ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CeggoEQ</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Err.... how do I fix it? =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CeggoEQ</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm assuming this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=61393#post61393) is what you wanted me to fix... but I had tried that earlier and it didn't fix anything.  All that did was mess up my player window by adding some glowy flashy thing to it when I turn on attack.  Still getting the horrible lag when I open the Combat Abilities window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In this section of the fix:<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_AttackIndicator&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Cycle&gt;false&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;Texture&gt;TargetBox.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
&lt;Location&gt;<br />
&lt;X&gt;6&lt;/X&gt;<br />
&lt;Y&gt;2&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
&lt;CX&gt;116&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;28&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Change the size to look like this:<br />
<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
&lt;CX&gt;0&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;0&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
<br />
That'll make it so that the flashing bar doesn't show up at all, until the author of your UI gets a chance to edit the .tga file to fit their window.<br />
<br />
Re the lag, I think I've found the problem everyone has been having, see the stickied thread at the top of this forum, or the &quot;Addendum&quot; thread in the Patch Fixes forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CeggoEQ</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Find:<br />
<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
Immediately after that line, ADD:<br />
<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_CombatSkillsSelectWindow.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
This line is already in my Default folder's EQUI.xml file.  And Delta 2.2 Rellix doesn't have a custom EQUI.xml.  Should I copy the default EQUI.xml to the Delta2.2 folder?</div></div><hr />

and so on... all the way up to 04535:_t3dLoadBMInfo.<br />
<br />
the lag is related back to the Augustt patch when they added WINDOWPIECES_06.tga and WINDOWPIECES_07.tga. &quot;BLANK&quot; its trying to load is images from WindowPieces_06 and 07...the lag is caused when the Combat window tries to load a graphic that is not being pre-loaded by the animation file. we just had to fix this in VERT..<br />
<br />
see this post for what to look for.. (follow link to Animations file).. you will find that *your* Animation file is missing this fix.<br />

I set it up to use the normal window_pieces06/07... and use those locations...  they don't work for Vert tho since they use solwindow_pieces06/07.<br />
<br />
I don't know what the correct locations are etc.<br />
<br />
Would be nice to get another 'fresh' install of Vert ready that worked with all the recent updates.</div></div><hr />
