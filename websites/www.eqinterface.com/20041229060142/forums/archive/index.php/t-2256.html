<br />
We did not intentionally remove any of the files.<br />
<br />
 Dolby did some basic repairs and maintiance on the DB last night, and it is looking as if a few must have been removed in this process. Dolby is looking into what got dropped and how. As we said before we are still upgrading this DL portal and it's still got a few bugs... let me share a few things with you to help with uploading. <br />
<br />
1. Please do not use this ----&gt; ' &lt;------ character, especially in file name. it gets a \ added to it... and that corrupts the file name, its only annoying in the discription.. but if you put &quot;Kudane's Bard Mod&quot; it will become &quot;Kudane\'s Bard Mod&quot; and that is un-usable.. Dolby is working on a fix<br />
<br />
2. ZIP all submissions<br />
<br />
3. Screenshot, if it doesnt have a screenshot, it doesn't get approved*<br />
<br />
4. Fill in Discription with what changed or what's new, No need to included instructions on how to load it, add that to a README.TXT file and included it in your zip file, (you should/could make mention of the readme in the discription)<br />
<br />
Will let you know what Dolby finds about the missing downloads.. <br />
<br />
*There are a few exceptions, such as tools to fix the note file or such... but these are rare <br />
