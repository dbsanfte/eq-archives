Everything was working fine, till I loaded a custom combat abilities window.  After I did that, I was getting lag like I would expect on a large raid, and if I went to a large raid (did an open RD raid) well, it was a nice slide show.<br />
<br />
Combat abilities window :http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2890<br />
<br />
Everything was fine if I Alt C and closed the window.  So I deleted the CA mod, and closed EQ.  Restarted EQ with the default CA window, and I am still getting bad lag, but only when the CA window is open.  If I use the complete default UI then I have no problem with lag.  I have tried using other CA mods, but I get the same lag no matter what CA window I am using.<br />
<br />
I really like using Delta, and don't want to change UIs if I don't have to.  This sound familiar to anyone?  I don't mind having to learn some coding to fix this if someone could point me in the right direction.<br />

I really didn't want to paste my UIerrors.txt to here, its not small.  Basicly all the warnings in it are the files that are not in my delta folder.  I only have the mod in there, so all the rest of the files it pulls from default.  Quick count of the lines of errors is 1020 lines.  By far most of them say &quot;Warning: file UIFiles\grathic\ not found in directory UIFiles\grathic\.  Attempting to use file from Default skin.&quot;  Only 64 lines say anything else.  Same type, but each dif.  Like EQUI_blahblahblah.xml not found for all the windows that are not modded.</div></div><hr />
