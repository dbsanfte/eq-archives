<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vesban</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to install Lestor's Imrpoved buffwindow into a new folder under uifiles but I don't know how to extract it into the new file (C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest Trilogy\uifiles\Monk). When I extract it it creates a subfolder instead of going directly into the folder: Monk. I've read the  FaQ including the pictures for noobies with the right and wrong examples but i'm still unable to extract the files direclty into the UI Monk folder. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.</div></div><hr />

Then you delete the now empty directory the UI was originally extracted to and load the new UI using the /load Monk command.<br />
<br />
If you need an explanation on how to cut &amp; paste files from one directory to another, just let me know.  Doing this won't hurt the UI, trust me.  I've been extracting, cut &amp; pasting, and renaming directories while playing with these UIs for a bit now.  :D <br />

Hehehe!  That works, too!  :-)<br />

I misread your post, Vesban.  I thought you were saying that it was going into a completely seperate folder than what you created, not a subdirectory of your created folder, like Mortis is explaining how to work around.</div></div><hr />
