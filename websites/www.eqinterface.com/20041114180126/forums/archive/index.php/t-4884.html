The one on my website has the charm slot added (I haven't taken an update SS).  I also switched the loc guide to the friends window, and the mini stat window to the pet window.<br />
<br />
There are grey, green, red, and blue versions included.  There is a pure melee player window, a pet caster player window, and a low level player window.   The ReadMe file contains directions for getting the exact look you want.<br />
<br />
As always, if you have questions/problems/ or suggestions, post here or contact me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, the version on my web page is updated.  <br />
<br />
I usually lag a couple days behind in updating it here due to how overloaded the servers can get at patch time.  But if a patch breaks the UI there will be something on my web page by that night.   I can't handle raiding with the default ;).<br />
<br />
Glad you enjoy it, it's really nice to see people from various servers who use it.  Thank You.<br />
<br />
New in v2.15b<br />
<br />
 Added a ninth slot to the hotkeys on the hotbutton window, and I fixed the issue with bag names overlapping the combine text in some containers.<br />
<br />
 Player windows have all been redone, they are visible in the screenshot, and all are included in the download.<br />
<br />
 UI is still available in blue, red, green or the standard grey. Each color has the files in a seperate folder. If you use grey be sure to delete the windowspieces_03 and 04 .tga files. Default load is green.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arabell</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to put an invite/disband button on the group box? Hard to tell if you are group leader at times when you miss the message.  Got the update btw and works great. Also got some others in my guild interested in it. Keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">03-06-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took those buttons out since I'm just so used to using CNTRL I and CNTRL D.  I probably won't add them back to the normal download (I can't say never, since I said I'd never put in the spell book button, but that will be back in the next release :p).<br />
<br />
But I'd be happy to do a custom one for you.  Do you want the new LFG buttons in there as well?  I'll work on it tonight.<br />
<br />
As for what is coming next with the UI, probably nothing too big.  I've been going through and adjusting the height and width of a few windows so that they line up better.  <br />
<br />
For instance in my working copy at home the buff window is as wide as the target and players windows, so you could stack them all, and the spell cast window is as tall as the hotbuttons window, which is as tall as the group, player, and target windows stacked.  Things like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arabell</div><div class="date">03-07-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I  prefer to have my spell casting gems a little larger since this is an area where I am using a lot.  Also I am no spring chicken and I hit the wrong gem from time to time, especially when you are tanking a mob hitting you for 900hp a whack.<br />
 I have been learning to use my ctrl I/D buttons but what would be useful is to have some way to identify who the leader of the group is. In past ui's with an invite button, if I targeted someone and I was the leader, the button would change color. Any way to change the leader's name color or something to indicate this?<br />
 Keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Version 3.01 is now available, fully LDoN compatible, and is awaiting moderation here at the site.<br />
<br />
New in v3.01:  <br />
<br />
 The biggest change in version 3 was the color changing boxes. They change from green to yellow to red to flashing red and make it much easier to see where a group member's health is. <br />
<br />
 Restructured some code to make it more patch resistant, and made sure it was fully compatible with LDoN. <br />
<br />
 New buttons for the MP3 player. The old Winamp ones weren't very &quot;eqish&quot; so I made them to match normal EQ buttons. <br />
<br />
 Removed the loc guide since the LoY map feature has replaced the need for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to thank people for all the feedback, it really helps give me direction for improving the UI.  <br />
<br />
New in version 3.2:<br />
<br />
 I received alot of feedback from people that they wanted the ability to have a pet window.  Instead of moving the stat window to another window like the friends window, I integrated it into the Actions Window since the Invite, Disband etc buttons take up more space than they need to.  <br />
<br />
 Designed a pet window that features a color changing percentage like the other windows, and doesn't take up much vertical screen space.  You can see up to 16 buffs on your pet.  <br />
<br />
 Further reduced the size of the MP3 player and made it the same height as the pet window.  <br />
<br />
 The link all button is now in the loot window but doesn't take up any additional space.  It's very similar to the combine button.  Any time it is yellow it is active.  <br />
<br />
 Since Sony added numbers the the backgrounds of the hotbuttons a couple patches back, the numbers in the corners weren't needed.  Removed the number and added Sony's backgrounds.  This means you if you use one of the alternate colors you'll be copying more files over.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone, sorry to be so slow to respond.  I've been really busy the last couple months with a new job.  <br />
<br />
When I get home this next weekend I plan to get the UI patched and up to date with the recent changes to the game.  <br />
<br />
For now I'll try to answer the questions posted here.  <br />
<br />
I hope you update soon after the upcoming melee patch that is supposed to happen on December 14th. Also with you UI my spell bar, spell book, and petwindow don't look like your screenshots. Guess I over right some of your code. I could resize the pet window left to right but not top to bottom. Also I cannot move the ranger track window. I have the most recent download from the website<br />
<br />
The spell bar and book are probably different because the screenshots are taken with TKing's g2 spell icons.  I don't include them because they are available here and would drastically increase the download size of the UI.<br />
<br />
The pet window also has those icons, but the resizing issue is something else.<br />
<br />
While not in game, you need to go into your UI_PlayerName_ServerName.ini file and look for a section that says:<br />
<br />
[PetInfoWindow]<br />
<br />
down at the bottom of this section will be a line that says Height1280x1024 (the number may be different, it will be whatever resolution you use, 800x600, 1024x768, 1600x1200 etc) and it will say =142 <br />
<br />
change that number to 50.  Now log in and the pet window should be the proper size.  (I've added this to the FAQ on my website as it's a common question).<br />
<br />
I would like to change the player windows that you show from the normal to the melee but i cant find the anything that tells me what i have to do to change it.<br />
<br />
All you need to do is rename the piece you want, EQUI_PlayerWindowMelee.xml for example to EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml (you'll need to delete the existing file first).  Then just reload the UI and you'll have your new player window.  I've added this to the FAQ, thanks!<br />
<br />
I just d/l your skin, I need a horazontal buff bar, yours said it can be done I just cant do it. can you help me?<br />
Oops, those should have been linked off the alternate pieces page, <br />
I've fixed the links now.  The buff window is available at http://www.efn.org/~smann/elui/buff.zip<br />
<br />
Great UI, only two questions: where can I download the alternate pieces on your web site or how do I install them if they came with the original package.<br />
<br />
Can I remove the green tint in all the windows?<br />
<br />
Great work, keep it up.<br />
<br />
Alternate pieces on the website now have working links.<br />
<br />
You can remove the green tint.  Delete the window pieces and mp3.tga files and copy and paste the files in the gray directory.  Now it will have the standard grey tint.  (the number of files you pasted will be less than the number you deleted, this is okay).  <br />
<br />
are you planning on realing a patch for the new endurance bar? be nice to have for my war. also, i can't seem to find the air meter while swimming..<br />
<br />
I hope to have the patch done by February 1st.  I also added a section to the FAQ on my website about how to fix the breath gauge being off screen, hope that helps.<br />
<br />
And Sandaedar I believe I answered your question elsewhere.  <br />
<br />
Thanks everyone and sorry again for being so bad about responding.</div></div><hr />

GoD came out and it still hasn't broken.  However, one minor gripe is that the pet window does not display buffs.  Is this just me?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) I notice the disc window pic is missing, will there be an update to include that?<br />
<br />
2) The compass isn't showing when I load it.  What should I do so the compass will show? (Yes, the proper window pieces are in the UI file).<br />
<br />
Thanks! Great work!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chulakorn</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Elindel,<br />
<br />
I have searched long and hard for a new UI since your 3.2 became obsolete (LoY, LDoN, GoD, and OoW) and I have to say the search has been futile.  Besides, the other style's just dont fit me and they have the same recurring problem, compatability with new EQ files.  Your UI in my opinnion has the best layout for versatility, functional display, and streamlined customizability.  I cant play EQ without elindel LOL!  It has been tough playing on the old EQ default UI and I just cant seem to adjust or adapt, it has really interrupted my style of play as I have practically raised myself on your UI.  <br />
<br />
All other UI's including yours per the OoW expansion say this:  &quot;Your XML files are not compatible with current EverQuest files, certain windows may not perform correctly.  Use 'Loadskin Default 1' to load the EverQuest default skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
I know it is alot to ask of you and I have no conceivable way of knowing how time consuming, difficult, or problematic programming this stuff is or can be, but I want to thank you for Elindel 3.2 and hope that you can continue your great work in the future, time giving of course.  I do appreciate and miss your talent.<br />
<br />
As a player I know you are familiar with some of the new tools such they have introduced into the game:  Combat skills window, endurance and mana displays, 9th spell gem, LDoN augment add/removal windows, new leadership group/raid aa etc etc, and a possibility for an additional 5 buff effects which  display duration.<br />
<br />
It is my wish that somehow you may be able to create new patch that incorperates all these new additions with and will function in-game.  I do not desire that you change anything!  For the player window maybe you can add the mana/endurance, as well as a place for the group leadership aa and leadership aa akin to how you display lvl xp and aa xp etc.  One for each corner.<br />
<br />
Other than making the augmentation windows and combat skill windows functional there really doesnt seem to be anything else!  I love your work keep it up.  <br />
