On the Download Section, I try and preview the mods available for download.  Ususally I have no problem but with some I get my browser trying to download a file called &quot;preview.php.exe&quot;.  No matter what I do from that point on I cannot see the preview.  What's up?<br />
<br />
One example is this mod...<br />
<br />
Mix &amp; Match - not so fancy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tried useing both IE6 and Mozilla and I see the picture just fine. Try now, maybe something was going on with the server at the time you viewed it.</div></div><hr />

I'm using IE5 at work and IE6 at home.  Just thought I would let you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I get some time I'll try to reproduce the problem. Is it happening on all of them or just on certain mods/skins? Are you able to download the mod/skin?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Yes I am still getting this problem with SOME screenshots.  What I did was this.  When it asks to DL the preview.php.exe file, I did so then renamed it to preview.jpg, or whatever format the preview pic was supposed to be in and I'll be damned if the image wasn't there.  Apparently it is naming some of the preview images &quot;Preview.php.exe&quot; for some weird reason.<br />
<br />
So if you really want to see it, DL it, rename it, and view it locally.<br />
<br />
HTH</div></div><hr />

<br />
users cookies enabled?  <br />
<br />
not sure if user needs any specific scripting enabled.<br />
<br />
or possibly the name assigned to the image on the EQGUI server is causing problems with the PHP scripting.<br />
<br />
If possible - capture the HTML source being delivered to you and post it back here.  That might give a Dolby a something to munch on if he isn't able to reproduce it himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah its just the way Netscape 7.0 is. It works fine in Mozilla. So its something the people at netscaped messed up. Basicly Netscape isnt reading the headers correctly. When I get some time (in a week or two) I'm going to try something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issey</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IE 6 here - it occassionally happens to me too. I've learned to wait a few days and then retry - some still won't open even then. Regular cache clearing and refreshing is all I know to do....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IE 5 / IE 6 - Default Settings, but often I receive this message.<br />
<br />
I think some of it has to do with firewall software many businesses use.  At home I never experience this issue, but at work with an MS Proxy Server and CheckPoint firewall, I often rec'v the prompt to download the PHP file (not usually an exe extension tho).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I store all the files under the html root so people cant hotlink directly to the files. Then the php script pulls that file out and with the header info tells your browser what kinda file it is. I guess some proxy's and browsers are stripping off the header and not looking at it. <br />
<br />
When I get some time I'll look into fixing it.</div></div><hr />

I use Opera ver 7.10</div></div><hr />
