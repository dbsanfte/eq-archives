<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cendien</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to make a spellbook like the old one? I know I'm not the only out there who wants this. I dont know much about XML, but I'm pretty sure this can be done. Basically what i want is a spellbook with like 5 spells per page instead of 8 or whatever it is now. I find it SO annoying to try to find all of my spells now.. i search page after page till i find it.  I know you higher lvl druids and peeps with lots of spells prolly feel the same way. <br />
<br />
But then again, this is just a request and i dont even know if it can be done!<br />
<br />
Any and all help is appreciated.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Folletto</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I totally disagree with 5 per page. I redid my book in the new 8 per page and love it. Sure it was some work and sure I had to get used to it but having 16 spell slots open at once is really nice. Especially for my druid. Now I have one page for Rings and one page for Circles. And I can fit them on the page in such a way that they represent the geographical location of the ring/circle<br />
<br />
What I would really like is MORE spells per page so I do not have to turn the pages so much.<br />
<br />
What would be even better is tabs at the bottom for each page so I can go from page 1 to page 31 without hitting the page button 15 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elpiper</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the new spellbook!  It's nice to have all ports, all group ports, etc. on the same 2-page spread.  Much less page flipping involved.<br />
<br />
What you should do is simply make hotbuttons for your spell types after you rearrange them, in order to avoid having to flip through them.<br />
<br />
I have two banks of hotbuttons for spells, ie roots/gate, AOE, PBAOE, Port, Gr.Port, Evacs, Debuff, etc.  Just make the buttons read /book 1, /book 6, /book 10, /book 30 etc. and no more page flipping...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xenaswolf</div><div class="date">03-09-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pardon if this sounds dumb or has already been covered. Since I have NO programming skill, what I would love to have in a spell book is this....<br />
<br />
Tabs like index tabs that say stuff like, gates, heals/buffs, dots/nukes etc<br />
<br />
If this could be done for each class it would be too cool. <br />
<br />
So when I'm looking for a particular spell, I could turn to the tab it is classified as and find it much easier.<br />
<br />
Don't know if it can be done, has been done or whatever, but if anyone is ambitious and creative there is an idea for you .<br />

<br />
<br />
I would like to request the old style spell book, I cant read that new Micro one in the Vert mod 2..5a<br />
<br />
Here is a pic of what it looked like.  This size or bigger would be nice.</div></div><hr />
