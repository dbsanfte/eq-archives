It's based of Drakah's &quot;Drakahmix&quot; UI (awesome work btw!), and the MMD winamp skin which I modified to fit with this ui. The spell icons are from the Beta WC3 icons. Main difference is about 100 pixels more viewable area vertically. <br />

you should be able to click on the tab that says &quot;player&quot; on it to see your stats. which is left of the &quot;clicks&quot; and &quot;pet&quot; tab.<br />

I have been doing some debugging on this particular UI, do a search for &quot;Soes&quot; to find more beta testing info on this if you have any more problems. :cool:<br />

- Fixed Actions Window (Smaller &amp; Movable)<br />

The player stat window is actually the Pet Info window (brought up by ALT+F1 if you can't see it). If you used the supplied .ini file though you *shouldn't* have any problems...<br />

Awesome work Soes, i was waiting for the 1024x768 version of the drakah ui, and u made it !<br />
I was wondering though if that could be possible to add the % on the aa exp and regular exp ? thats always great to see what % can give u a mob :)<br />
Beside that % thing, the casting bar is the one from the previous version of drakah ui ? (ie the normal bar, asking cuz i see the general layout is from the previous drakahui)<br />
I m really waiting on ur 1024x768 ui from the new drakah's, it will look great i can feel it :cool: <br />

Only one thing bothers me.  In the 1024x768 version, the last 3 buff icons or so go underneath the console.  Probably works dandy in 1280x1024, but just not enough room at that size at 1024x768 as shown below.  <br />

Any chance they could be made a bit smaller?  I really like that style, the icons are just too large at that resolution.<br />

If you use the supplied .ini file though you should have no reason to move it.. its designed only for 1024x768 and 1280x1024 resolutions, and the ini file has the location for the pet window defined in both...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Set up the rest of your windows where you want them, then leave room where you want the &quot;locked&quot; window...in this case the pet window.<br />
<br />
2.  When you have everything pretty much where you want it, /load default 1.  DO NOT FORGET THE &quot;1&quot;  to keep everything else where it's supposed to be.<br />
<br />
3. In the default UI, move the pet window where you want it. <br />
<br />
4.  When you think you have it, /load (skinname) 1.  Again, keep everything in place with the &quot;1&quot;<br />
<br />
When you go back to your UI, the pet window will of course have moved.   And it may take a couple tries to get it exactly where you want it.  DO NOT FORGET THE &quot;1&quot;<br />

Thank you for addressing the buff window problem!  Now I can see all of my buff slots in the same style.<br />
<br />
Two comments however.  The 15th buff slot has a misalignment between the caption and the icon (as pictured below).  <br />
<br />
http://home.columbus.rr.com/guill/buffwindow.jpg<br />
<br />
There is also an offset between the edge of the screen on the right, and the start of the row of buff icons.  I'm not sure if this latter behavior was intentional or not, but to remain consistant with the previous implementation, the buff icons would touch the right screen edge.  <br />
<br />
If these two particular issues were fixed, this would be the perfect 1024x768 buff window.  Thanks again!!<br />

The same thing happened when I loaded the unmodded Mp3 player, and then edited it myself as I am sure you probably did. <br />
<br />
I am tearing my hair out here trying to figure this out, to no avail. It either crashes the entire UI with no error (comes up with no skins only window positions) or comes up all distorted. I have restored everyhing I can think of.<br />

It's the best I've seen.  Also kudos to trallos_drachen for fixing the 1024x768 buff window that Sudo provided.<br />
<br />
Is anyone working on a Short Duration Buff Window with 30x30 icons for 1024x768 to match?<br />
<br />
Because of space issues, my preference would be to have them be Icon Left - Caption Right and be placed on the screen above the Spell Bar on the left hand side.  Essentially a mirror of the Normal Buffs currently on the Right hand side.<br />
<br />

<br />
This currently is designed for 1280x1024 resolution, once I figure out how to move the bard song labels to the right side of the buff icons, I'll be posting a 1024x768 version SOON..<br />
<br />
*** PLEASE NOTE ***<br />
The UI will come out mangled unless you copy the UI_YOURCHAR_YOURSERVERNUMBER.ini file and rename it accordingly, for Veeshan players it would be like this: UI_Soes_35.ini where you would replace Soes with your character's name. Once you renamed the file, copy it to your BASE EQ DIRECTORY and make sure you overwrite whatever existing ini file might be there. IF YOU DON'T DO THIS THE UI WON'T WORK CORRECTLY!!!!<br />

Open up your UI_charname_servername.INI file (not the one in the UI directory, but the one you have previously copied into your EQ directory)..<br />
<br />
Look for this:<br />
<br />
[MainChat]<br />
<br />
The third or so line will be:<br />
<br />
Width=xxx<br />
<br />
Where xxx is somewhere in the 600's.<br />
<br />
Change this into:<br />
<br />
Width=414<br />
<br />
Now the chatbox will fit on your screen perfectly. :) Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look in your ROOT EQ Directory (usually c:\program files\Sony\EverQuest Trilogy) it may be different if you chose to install to a different directory.<br />
<br />
In this directory scroll around until you see the UI_CharName_ServerNumber.ini file for your char... for instance mine is UI_Soes_35.ini...<br />

Take the .ini file from MY UI ZIP FILE, rename it to the corresponding filename for YOUR character and OVERWRITE the exisiting ini file on your ROOT EQ Directory.<br />

There is just one problem, this version of the UI will remove the Blue &amp; Red background icons from all Spell Icons (buff window, song window and spell book)... I tried for like 5 hours to figure out a way to seperate the background definitions for buff window and song window, but there is no way (that I could find) to do it. Any XML experts got a suggestion? Seems no matter how you define the background texture for buffs or songs, it defaults to the BlueIconBackground and RedIconBackground from EQUI_Animations.xml.</div></div><hr />

I think OVERWRITING ANY file on EQ directory is bad idea.  Just simply rename .ini file to... whatevername.ini.old file.  This way, you can always go back to orginal UI without hassle.<br />

Can you post up the short duration buff window you altered for that screenshot?  It's really the only part that needs to be altered besides the pet window for the patch screwups.<br />
<br />
Also I went ahead and fixed the pet window since then, the message was getting annoying. ;)  If you like I can post it up for you to include, all it does different is the sit/stand button works like it does in the unmodded pet window now, changing text.</div></div><hr />

IF YOU ARE CRASHING... <br />
I think i know the problem, open up the UI_CharName_ServerNumber.ini look for the <br />
[MusicPlayerWnd] section and delete this line:<br />
LastM3U=C:\Program Files\KaZaA Lite\My Shared Folder\playlist.m3u <br />

I always like the idea of Drakah's UI.  I tried it for a bit and what I did not like about it was that it took up too much room.  You sir have perfected his design in a way that works fabulously!  It takes up as little room as possible yet gives me all the things I liked about Drakah's UI without making me look at all the stuff I did not want or need.  The only thing Im not useing is the buff icons as it's just to hard for me to relearn another set of buff icons.  I love it and thank you for the time you put into it! =D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">johnnypic</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a problem where my chat windows get resized to larger than what the ini file makes them out to be.  For example the main chat window gets resized so that it is off the screen.  I cant move it because it is locked.  I switch to a higher resolution.  Resize the window and bring it down back to 1024 and the chat window is still big and I cant move it becaue it is locked again.  This is the main chat window.  The small window get big but it is easily changed back to original size.</div></div><hr />

Great UI by the way</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any way to fix this?  I play a mage, so this can be rather a pain considering the Soes setup.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MadCatXII</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah ive had that same issue as well, i play a cleric and i have ornate legs which let me cast cleric pet mana free and im really bummed out that the pet window (along with the clickies and stats window :(  ) dissapears after every round since pet disappears when i no longer have any aggro. Hope theres some way to fix this cause imho this is the best UI out there and i dont think ill find a replacement anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

Dangit!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PetrosDaroc</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So...quick question...<br />
<br />
Will you be putting in a spellbook icon by any chance for this UI, Soes?  Everyone keeps talking about the new spell favorites thingy, but as stubborn as I am, I refuse to switch UIs just to check this feature out.  I'm just way too used to this UI to change it now.  :)<br />

BANANA DANCE! :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">waywreth</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was hoping for the same thing PetrosDaroc was.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to simply switch out the Soes spellgem bar, or will that screw up the custom ini?  I'm guessing it will.<br />
<br />
I'd really love to have access to custom spell lists, but I can bring myself to change UI's!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hojo</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the layout of this UI. Just got it yesterday and I have a few questions.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to add Tking's G2 spell icons to this mod? I don't really care much for the Warcraft ones.<br />
<br />
Also, is there any way to add the G2 spell icons to the hot button window?<br />
<br />
I've tried fiddling around with it and the best I can get is G2 spellbar and icons in properly, but when I try to put them in the hotbutton window, they look all screwed up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aislyndragon73</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Answering the question of the Pet/stat/click window going poof, under options, there is a button on the general tab that says PET WINDOW POPUP. Just click that button and your window won't go poof anymore.<br />
<br />
Great job, LoduzVZ, on the spell bar with the added book button. Ive been hearing how wonderful this save spell sets is and hadn't gotten the chance to use it yet. :)<br />
