<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">VI/Sony announced yesterday some huge changes to EverQuest coming. If you have not read the article here is a summary:<br />
<br />
A massive change to EverQuest is coming soon in order to correct faults that 'have been allowed to grow out of control'.<br />
<br />
Here are the main points: <br />
<br />
* Manaburn is being changed to only allow one manaburn to be cast on an NPC per minute.All Wizards with Manaburn will have their AA refunded if they wish to purchase different skills or mana burn again. <br />
<br />
* Complete Heal is being reduced to a 7500 hitpoint heal. This in anticipation of a new line of heals (hinted at in the article)<br />
<br />
* Rods of Mystical Transvergence (Mod Rod 2) will no longer be droppable but made into a targettable summon. They will give 360 mana for 450 hitpoints and only be usable once per minute. <br />
<br />
* Monks will have their effective AC lowered in order to make them more realistic as a light armored offensive class and to give back more of the tanking prestige to plate and chain classes. <br />
