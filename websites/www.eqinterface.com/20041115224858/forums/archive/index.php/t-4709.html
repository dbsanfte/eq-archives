<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, until I can figure out how to zip the UI to below 2MB, this will be the spot to get it (if anyone can tell me how to zip it smaller than 2.5, please inform me, mine's roughly the same size as vert's)<br />
<br />
Several bug fixes, several graphics and xml revisions, and several new features including a fletching guide in the pet window (ranger's don't get pets, useless window made useful :) ).  Read the _ReadMeFIrst.txt file included.<br />
<br />
Here's the PIC (http://webpages.charter.net/nytcrie/EQ000004.JPG)   Keep in mind this was taken in 1280X1024.  Smaller resolutions will have larger windows.  JPEG compression fuzzied the text up a bit as well.<br />
<br />
And you can find the zip file HERE (http://webpages.charter.net/nytcrie/Kiriani_Ranger_2.1.zip) <br />
<br />
Enjoy and as usual, comments and suggestions always welcome.</div></div><hr />

I have since the beginng put my target bar on top. I cant stand having my target in the middle of group info. Is there anyway you could make it other way around? Or make a group/Player/Targert stand alone??<br />

<br />
As for separating the windows, if I do, you lose the click inventory, and you lose the player stats.  It;s a trade off, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />
