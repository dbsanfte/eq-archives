<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">howardb1</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is an update to a UI that I posted in the request area a little while ago.  I changed it so that the bars were full sized, and the box was size-able, allowing me to hide some stats if I wanted to.  This verson shows the progresss bars, percent, and raw current / max for HP, Manna, Endurance, EXP, and AA Exp, plus the AC and Attack scorce at the bottom.   Mainly, the point of this version was to make the bars easier to see and to act as a back-drop for the stats to make them easier too.  Short of creating new bar graphics, does anyone know how to make the bars taller?  The font I use is a bit taller than the bar and so looks a little off to me, but using a smaller font would make the text harder to read.<br />

This ui is a mod of Fang's PlayerWindow mod with the help of other EQ Interface members.  I just re-aranged things more to my liking : )</div></div><hr />
