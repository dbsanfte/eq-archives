Hello Norrath,<br />
<br />
In the next update, tentatively scheduled for December 16th, any bards who have used AA points to purchase either Extended Notes 3 or Sionachie's Crescendo will have those abilities removed and the AA points reimbursed.  The abilities are being changed so that they only affect beneficial songs and chants.  The use of these abilities on some AOE and damage songs or Chants was overbalancing, which made this change necessary.  Please be aware that you will be receiving a refund of these AA points and that you cannot save more than 30 points.  So if your refund brings you over 30, you will need to spend them before you zone after the update.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're completely nerfing bard lull to the point it's now almost useless, and they're practically giving it to monks as a new skill for their melee update. The shocker? Monks were the ones that complained, along with clueless bards that still don't understand the true purpose of their class.<br />
<br />
Speaking of monks, I have some comments of my own on that.<br />
<br />
Feign death, as I recall, was not really meant as a pulling tool. In fact, pulling, using feign death, while ingenius when it was first used is more or less a pathing exploit that takes a little bit of skill to perfect. Feign death was meant to be an escape tool, not an exploit like it's used today. Monks were never meant to be pullers for a group at all. However, the game has changed towards that direction because a hand full of individuals shared their experiences with it, and the ability has not had any sort of real nerf. Sure, they nerfed the fact it isn't a sure fire way of ridding yourself of aggro after a certain level, but that really doesn't make a difference: FD is overpowered in it's current state. There is no mistaking it.<br />
<br />
Feign death, up to this point, however, has not been able to replace a good bard, or a good ranger. That is about to change with the lull nerfs going in. As you might be aware, bard lull is now five minutes duration. A little long, and does need some trimming... but it's going from five minutes to fifteen SECONDS. They are practically making the line USELESS. As a friend joked, they might as well give them a new mana song to replace it. It's about as useful at this point. The kicker is the ability monks will be getting to reduce their own aggro radius in relation to mobs attacking them, more or less doing the same thing pacify and lull has done. As far as we're aware, it is also an unresistable, passive thing that entirely trivializes certain aspects of the game, and is completely destroying a fundamental aspect of the gameplay of the bard class, especially at high levels. It doesn't ruin the class, but it cripples their ability to pull, and for many bards, pulling is the entire thrill of the game for them.<br />
<br />
All of this because someone had penis envy over an ability their class was not designed for. Bravo.<br />
<br />
Bards are overpowered. It is no secret. However, an overboard nerf like this is NOT the answer to balancing them. Practically giving one of their, at one point, exclusive abilities to another class that was never designed to pull for groups is NOT the answer to balancing them. This will only piss people off and further prove the statement that the squeaky wheel gets the grease, no matter how disfigured, or improperly fitting that wheel is.<br />
<br />
Don't let them do this to you, bards. If monks can do it, so can you. First lull, then something else. They're already doing scale backs on damage shields. They'll start doing it to other lines as well, and if you let them, they will turn you into a low-level enchanter that can dual wield once enough people complain about you.<br />
<br />
Destroying one class is not the way to class balance. Recognizing their roles in groups, and further strengthening their ability to complete that task is the key to class balancing, while scaling back abilities that are not fundamental to the class if they are overpowered enough to warrant such nerfs. Bards are one of the most unique classes in that they can fit many roles, from mere support, to the one-man pulling assembly line for a group. Don't let SOE ruin their ability to continue to be a viable part of the game.  Complain, and stand up for your classes, even non-bards. If the newbie iksar monk twinks can do it, you sure as hell can too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyrefang</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me clear this up...<br />
<br />
&quot;any bards who have used AA points to purchase either any bards who have used AA points to purchase either Extended Notes 3 or Sionachie's Crescendo will have those abilities removed and the AA points reimbursed or Sionachie's Crescendo will have those abilities removed and the AA points reimbursed&quot;<br />
<br />
So does that mean that ext. notes 1 and 2 will remain unchanged?<br />
<br />
While the news is discomforting, thank you Torgas for letting everyone know.  I had seen the spelldat and the changes to the damage shield.  That change does nothing but hurt the group, not the bard.<br />
<br />
As for pulling, many situations where I have grouped with a monk, some have turned down the notion of pulling, some as so far as ditching the group all together just because they were asked.  =P  Very true the duration of our lull could be shortened, but to 15 seconds?!?!?  That's useless!  You could split one, maybe two MOBS at most, depending on the situation.. I hope they adjust the enchanters mez times/casting times to account for the botched pulls, all because the experenced pullers were nerfed to the point where the lulled mob would reaggro on the one that was pulled when noone else wanted to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It hurts the group. That's exactly it, Fyre =/ In SOE's little crusade to keep the players happy, they don't realize the mistakes they make along the way =/<br />
<br />
For those of you who still don't understand the scale of this nerf, let me try to make some comparisons. Anyone who thinks my comparisons might be too dramatic, understand they are EXACTLY what bards will feel like...<br />
<br />
Clerics... imagine your complete heal limited much in the same way as the Donal's BP works. You can only use complete healing on a person every ten minutes. Would this break the game? Mmm... probably not. Would it make it that much more difficult? You're damn right. Complete Healing, while DEFINITELY overpowered, has had the game practically built around it. Many encounters ASSUME you have complete healing, and if you were to take it away, the mechanics of healing in many situations would change dramatically, ESPECIALLY if they didn't impose such penalties on druids or shamans, or, better yet, gave them BETTER healing abilities.<br />
<br />
Monks... imagine feign death still working like it does today... but with one catch... when you get up, any of the mobs within your line of sight will aggro on you up to a certain distance. It makes sense, no? That's already how it happens to a certain extent, but at a shorter range. Not too bad right? Let's add in the added bonus that a mob you've already FD'd off of will not be fooled a second time and will aggro on you anyway. Wouldn't THAT suck? Would FD be useless? No. Would it cut it's usefulness down to a fraction of what it is right now, where people RELY on FD to shake aggro off of a mob more than once? Yes. But, it still follows in the general form that FD was designed around: Feign death is an escape tool, not a pathing bug exploit. Add on top of it a chance that the mob will see through it anyway, and you have a pretty good idea of what bards will feel like. It doesn't make the skill TOTALLY useless, no, but damn close.<br />
<br />
Those are just two examples of how other classes, including my own, could feel the pain of this bard nerf. For those of other classes, I'm sure you can conjure up your own images of how SOE could nerf one of your class defining abilities. It's not pretty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's not turn this into another discussion over monks, FD pulling, and things that are still under testing with melee enhancements.  <br />
<br />
Verant long ago weighed the risk vs. reward of FD pulling.  Most of the EQ community that I interact with agrees that FD pulling is often a last resort means of pulling.  That it is one of the most dangerous way to split mobs.  <br />
<br />
Along the bard nerf of their lull line, I feel there is no reason why bard lull should be better than that of the other classes.  By the definition of a bard, they are not the best at anything.  <br />
<br />
It is true that the cleric, enchanter, ranger and druid lull spells last for 42 seconds, but they do not reduce the aggro radius as much, and they take longer to cast.<br />
<br />
Now look at straight numbers about how many mobs can be lulled before the effect expires on the first mob. I have not played a bard in nearly two years, so if my recast delay is wrong, please let me know.<br />
<br />
I pulled these numbers from spells_en.txt using EQCaster.<br />
Pacification takes 4.5 seconds to cast, and 2.25 to refresh.  6.25 seconds per mob.<br />
Harmony of Nature takes 2.5 seconds to cast and 2.25 to refresh.  4.75 total.<br />
Quellious takes 3 seconds to cast and no time to refresh.<br />
<br />
Look at this chart.  T1 is the forst target and starts the clock at 0 when the spell lands lulling it.<br />
<br />
Bard<br />
T1 0.00<br />
T2 3.00<br />
T3 6.00<br />
T4 9.00<br />
T5 12.00<br />
T6 15.00<br />
Bards can lull 6 mobs before the effect breaks on the first mob.  With 3 seconds remaining.<br />
<br />
Druid/Ranger<br />
T1 0.00<br />
T2 4.75<br />
T3 7.00<br />
T4 11.75<br />
T5 16.50<br />
T6 21.25<br />
T7 26.00<br />
T8 30.75<br />
T9 35.5<br />
T10 40.25<br />
Treehuggers can lull 10 mobs, with 1.75 seconds remaining.  9 safely, leaving 6.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Cleric/Enchanter<br />
T1 0.00<br />
T2 6.25<br />
T3 12.50<br />
T4 18.75<br />
T5 25.00<br />
T6 32.25<br />
T7 37.50<br />
Clerics and enchanters can lull 7 mobs with 4.5 seconds remaining.<br />
<br />
Now it looks like Druids and Rangers have the best lull spell, except that their spell is only useable outdoors.  Then it looks like clerics and enchanters have a better lull than bard, but only by one mob.  Is being nearly 87% as effective that much of a problem?<br />
<br />
Please feel free to correct my numbers,and adjust them using typical aa and focus effects.  But try to stray away from &quot;the best&quot; as the average player is, well, average.</div></div><hr />

Suggesting that bards still aren't the fastest runners in game? I find that hard to believe.<br />
<br />
(excluding any mounts -- this is run speed only)<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow Togras. Just read your rant. I have to say, if you feel that close to the changes do you really think it's not overpowering?<br />
<br />
I'm a monk and I happen to know about FD first hand. You do not. Just like I don't know about bard's pulling first hand. I do know that FD has become a pulling tool since the beginig of time while bard weren't. I do know that high end games FD pulling is used as a last resort or an &quot;obsolute must&quot; cause it takes too buggin long to &quot;FD split&quot; mobs.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to start any rant between classes, but I will say this; SOE is making a change. You have two choices: Live with it or Quit the game quietly.<br />
<br />
Nobody wants to hear long blown out rants as to why you feel the way you do. If a change is causing such a rant than maybe one should write an edjucated explination to SOE about these changes. Rants tend to get ignored.</div></div><hr />

Until I max out my wizard and get my druid going, I prolly wont go for the bard again until I want the challenge of mastering swarm kiting, but I have to hold the line on this subject...<br />
<br />
RolePlaying 101 from the D&amp;D ages. -  Bards had the ability to MEZMERIZE entire cities with their talent at singing.  They could charm a single person into becoming a complete slave, they could change an entire audience into people who would go to war for that entertainer.  The song of a talented and accomplished bard could turn undead simply from the might of the holiness that was conveyed in their voice or simply the instrument that they used.<br />
<br />
...and so I submit that a Bard by the very nature of their accomplishment (50+ level) sings to a mob, unless it is deaf, it is gonna be pacified, or enraged or turned into a puppet.  From the days of Gary Gygax's first words on the subject to long before when we heard dulcet tunes from the Shire... Besides choosing the path of the enchanter, NO ONE, not even SoE should ever be completely screwing with what a bard truely is.  <br />
<br />
Admitedly I did not know this effect had a 5 minute time on it.  It should be shortened, but 15 or 30 seconds.  I'm sorry, it takes time for rage to come back, it takes time for someone to snap out of a trance or a suggestive state.  Someone needs to look at the abilities of the classes more in light of what they really are and not swing the pendulum so far to the opposite as to cut off the fingers of those who are strumming the instrument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nwinn</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I'm not entirely mistaken... they changed EN/SC to not work on detrimental spells quite a while ago anyhow.  They're just now announcing it and refunding those points.  I'd guess that 90% who spent those 15ish points did so simply to use them for solo'ing /shrug.  I spent those points so I can avoid ae's that are centered around the target while providing songs for a tank group during raids, to greaten the area I can cover with manasong, resists, etc.<br />
<br />
I've played my bard for almost 2 years now, most of my time is spent raiding and, honestly I love it and don't really care about EN/SC as long as it still works for beneficial spells, which it does and will continue to.<br />
<br />
This refund is well-deserved and overdue but the 'changes' to those aa skills are not new... it's ridiculous to call this sort of thing 'class-breaking.'<br />
<br />
As far as bard lulls go... it is VERY handy and I'd hate to lose that ability altogether but, it being changed just means I'll use mez/fade to pull more often.  Any changes made to bard lull songs are also not class-breaking.  In my opinion, it's just something new to consider when you pull.  So, once again /shrug.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I agree completly with sc2kmayor's summation of a bard's abilities.  It makes sense for a bard to be very good at communicating ideas, commands, etc via their songs... if they're an 'accomplished' bard. ;)</div></div><hr />

I beg to differ, our guild almost always uses Monk duo-pulling at raids, for two reasons.  The first and foremost being, high end mobs can't be lulled =P, and two, you can bring mobs to the group faster.  Just thought I'd point that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">laertise</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can only say there are three classes that should never pull Beast, Mage, Necro (SK could go here if they have a pet out).<br />
<br />
Because no matter how good you are at pulling occasionally you'll get hit with a spell or a stray punch then your pet attacks ans holds the mob up. Other than that you name it and Iv'e seen someone pull with it or Iv'e used it to pull.<br />
<br />
And the tag team monks for pulling on raids works great. Ohh and last I think Iv'e only had a bard pull for me once or twice. My main is a 64 pally I generally pull for myself the only time I don't is when we are chain pulling and I want the next mob there before the first one is dead. My bards are there to make me hit faster make my caster regen mana faster and put in some dps. <br />
<br />
On a side note when we were doing our tactics keys we had a bard pulling in PoS because everything was getting stuck in the middle. They were able to get the things in the middle out, using an aoe spell. But druid can do this to with there wolf spell. But with everyone I went with to work on this key the bard was the <br />
best puller we had.<br />
<br />
If your a bard and you think this cripples your class, then you don't know your class well enough. And them doing this will be good for you so you can learn all the other benefiets of your class.<br />

And them doing this will be good for you so you can learn all the other benefiets of your class.<br />
<br />
Are you kidding me?<br />
<br />
A bard puller is one who is comfortable with the rest of the benefits of their class, and knows that sitting there, twisting battle songs, gets EXTREMELY boring. A bard puller is one who understands the technicalities of their class thoroughly enough that they can enjoy a more exciting facet of the game. While bards are versatile, there is actually very LITTLE to a bard. They are not a very complex class, nor do they ever have to be, as EQ is not a very complex game. Anyone who says otherwise has not played for four-plus years. Everything about a bard comes with both experience, and simply common sense; experience so you know what the songs do, and all of their technicalities, and common sense so you know when to use them. It's just like every other class in EQ, except bards tend to do it at a faster pace, and require more focus and attention than most other classes, which is still not a hell of a lot if you've been playing a while.<br />
<br />
Bards were the original class to even get the lull line. NO OTHER CLASS GOT ANYTHING LIKE IT EXCEPT BARDS. Other people complained. Other classes finally got the lines, but bards always had the better lull because of it's instant recast time, and the fact they could move while casting. That's one thing that person with the chart didn't actually take into account: Bards can move while casting, which changes the dynamic of it quite a bit. Another thing people don't understand is that bards are hardcoded NOT to get aggro with their songs, and with their melee damage, which is another thing that changes the bard dynamic a little as well. They generally don't have to worry about getting aggro in a fight unless the tank blatantly sucks, or they purposely try to get aggro.<br />
<br />
I'm sure people are like &quot;Jessail, stfu, you're a cleric, what do you know?&quot; I know a lot by being best friends with a bard who's played his class to death and knows what he's doing in ALL situations of EQ. I also know a great deal from simply playing the game ever since its live launch. Throwing numbers at me is nice and all, but anyone who crunches numbers to prove a point, especially about a bard, is not playing EQ correctly. There's a variety of different variables, which a bard is equipped to deal with more effectively than a ranger or cleric is.<br />
<br />
Bards are getting an ENTIRE LINE OF SPELLS made USELESS. There is no justification for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I decided to single out this post especially due to the retardedness of it.<br />
<br />
You clearly missed the entire point of my post. I wasn't speaking for clerics, you idiot. I was speaking COMPLETELY for bards. I don't give a crap if they nerfed cleric Paci. It'd be stupid, but I rarely pull that it makes no real difference to me, especially because I know they'll never nerf it simply because, while it has its uses, it's rarely relied on in a group like bard lull is at times. Do you know why I don't often pull? Because that's not my job. My job is to heal and do some damage when I don't HAVE to heal. Sure, ANYONE can pull, but there are some classes that simply do it better than others. A warrior is NOT going to pull a large stack of mobs without getting adds. It's just NOT going to happen. Monks, or really good SKs could split it, although monks are best suited for splitting because, ha ha, THEIR FEIGN DEATH IS GOD DAMNED INSTANT. No, that isn't overpowered at ALL. Yeah, sure, a warrior could pull, and the entire pulling mechanic takes skill, but it'd just be being foolish to not acknowledge the fact that some classes are better designed for it than others.<br />
<br />
Bards could lull-split, or Fade-split, but even Fade is not as good as monk feign. One, Fade does not work nearly as well as Monk FD, simply because if the mob sees invis, it'll reaggro the bard. Two, Fade costs mana, and a lot of it, which limits its usefulness tenfold. Don't give me this jealous crap, when you purposely keep yourself ignorant of the simple fact that monk FD is one of the single, most overpowered skills in the game. <br />
<br />
Anyone who tells me that feign death is NOT overpowered is ridiculously stupid. Click a button, and if you AREN'T RETARDED, you instantly lose aggro. Sure, it can fail, but at high levels, how often does that happen? Once, maybe twice a raid? Shut the hell up. Even rogue evade isn't as good as that, and rogues are supposed to be the masters of escape. I'm not talking about AA, either, where rogues RIGHTFULLY take their throne in that department, but the base skills are much different. Seriously, all of you people who are telling me I'm wrong about monk FD, especially after watching my circle of friends play for over two years consisting of a bard, a cleric, a monk, and a rogue, all in the end-game, have absolutely no clue what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
You also seem to be ignoring the fact that FD pulling is a PATHING EXPLOIT. Let me try this again:<br />
<br />
FD PULLING IS A PATHING EXPLOIT <br />

Got it? You're taking advantage of the very STUPID AI using a skill that was NEVER designed for it. Ingenius, surely, but exploiting none-the-less. And as I SAID BEFORE, it takes skill to do it well, but that's like saying it takes skill to shoplift. It doesn't really matter HOW good you are at it, it still makes you wrong. Grats, thief.<br />
<br />
The problem is, FD pulling has been such a common routine over the years that it's accepted as a way of pulling, even by SOE. It's just the way it is now. That doesn't make it any more, or any less overpowering than it is.<br />
<br />
Lull, on the other hand, was DESIGNED JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE, and was DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR BARDS, which makes perfect sense since, as I mentioned, bards are hardcoded NOT TO GET AGGRO. I know this through watching, and through my conversations with a very skilled bard over a span of several years. Now they're taking away what was once, a long time ago, a class-defining ability and giving it to a class that was NEVER DESIGNED TO BE THE PULLER OF A GROUP. A monk was designed for DPS, and to be able to heal themselves, and others once upon a time.<br />
<br />
Still think monk FD isn't overpowered? Monk FD is one of the few skills that developers have actually NOTICABLY had to work around to make some encounters in newer expansions. There is only one other skill like that in the game, where developers actually HAVE to work around it in order to keep it challenging: Complete Healing. Everyone who isn't retarded knows that spell is ABSOLUTELY overpowered. 400 mana for 7500 healing. No catch. Who gives a crap about the 10 second cast time? That's what chains, and good timing are for. This is coming from a CLERIC, by the way, something I should rightfully know what I'm talking about, wouldn't you say?<br />
<br />
Take your jealous bullcrap and shove it. You're wrong, no matter how right you want to be, and the proof is in the game. Play it a little bit as opposed to talking about playing it and you'll understand.<br />

We've all (Kudane, Dolby, myself) said it before.  And I'll say it again:  This board is about EQ User Interfaces.  We allow this one forum for general chit chat about various other stuff.  We do not allow this forum to be a flame-pit!<br />

Togras - this is not a &quot;bash SOE&quot; or &quot;my class is better than your class but I'm getting nerfed because you exploited&quot; forum.<br />

Lurker99 - the only people on this board that can tell someone to STFU are Dolby and Kudane (and possibly me).<br />
<br />
Everyone - You can disagree with someone.  But you can darn well do it politely and respectfully.  Or you can turn it into flames, which well get the thread locked/deleted and the individual(s) doing the flaming warned/banned.<br />
<br />
Get back to being respectful and courteous folks.  No name calling.  No telling others to STFU.  If you want to do that, go elsewhere, it isn't wanted nor will it be tolerated here.<br />

Clear enough, I trust.</div></div><hr />

This isn't a bash SOE thread, nor is it a 'my class is better than your class, but blah blah' thread. I'm not even a bard!<br />
<br />
This is a 'people are really stupid, and I'm defending one of my favorite classes' thread because they are being unrightfully nerfed while another, much more overpowered ability is staying intact. I ask to read my posts a bit more closely as opposed to just skimming before you pass judgement.</div></div><hr />

aka Flame bait, whatever way you want to phrase it.  Cut it out.<br />

/edit The point I was making, to everyone, is that I have no problem whatsoever with this topic remaining open provided it goes back to being a discussion, not a &quot;rant&quot; nor a &quot;flame&quot;. If you want to continue the topic, get back to being polite and courteous. If you have a problem with the way someone responds (ie they flame, etc), bring it to the attention of the Ops/Mods and we'll deal with it. Flaming back isn't an acceptable way of dealing with it. Not here. Other boards maybe, but not here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In either case, the point I'm trying to make is this:<br />
<br />
While the bard lull nerf will hardly break them as a class, it WILL effectively all, but destroy a facet of their class that made them so desirable. Bard pullers are among the best in the game simply because of their pure versatility, and now that one of their most prized lines is being nerfed to the point of practical uselessness, their pulling abilities will be crippled. Good bards will be able to work around it, making pulls longer, but possible, but it will still remove a very viable way of crowd control.<br />
<br />
I use monk FD as an example because it is one of the most widely accepted forms of pulling, and it is true, no matter what you care to believe, that FD pulling is a pathing exploit. Look at it logically: You're using FD to take advantage of the fact that some mobs path back at different intervals, and thus, completely trivializing pulling in some cases. Many attempts have been made on SOE's part to dull the usefulness of the tactic, but some monks have been able to pull even the most notoriously difficult of mobs with relative ease, and a little skill. That's good, and all, but it doesn't make it right when players are pre-equipped with other ways of dealing with an encounter the way it was supposed to be dealt with.<br />
<br />
People take it for granted, but what would happen if monk FD was removed from the game COMPLETELY? It would make monk pulling practically extinct, that's what, but it still would not remove their fundamental purpose as a class: DPS. People would have hardly any fun playing a monk anymore, simply because a facet of the game they were most famed for excelling at would be taken from them.<br />
<br />
Yes, I believe monk FD is overpowered in it's current state. It is an instant escape, with no drawbacks save for the occasional failure. Rogues get nothing like that until AA, and rogues, as I said, are supposed to be the masters of skullduggery and evasion.<br />
<br />
Compare bard lull/fade/mez pulling to monk FD. Which takes more skill, and which was truly designed exactly for the purpose of making encounters for an entire party easier? Hint: They're the same answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Togras, Thank you for bringing the topic back to discussion instead of &quot;ranting&quot; or replying to rants.<br />
<br />
AS A BARD, let me say that while YES this change hurts. It isnt going to hurt my chances of getting a group, or being wanted in a group..<br />
<br />
It was over powered, with everything else Bards can do it was a bit strong.<br />
<br />
And on the test server they have UPPED the length of time that bard lull last. Soo they are still working on the formula to get exactly what they want.<br />
<br />
Sooo EVERYONE feel free to continue to discuss, But as Cairenn Said.. the only people who *could* say STFU (but never would) Are Dolby, Myself and Cairenn (yes, she could.. and Dolby and I would back her 100%). Please keep this thread friendly.<br />
<br />
I love discussions, But once someone states thier oppinion, and you state yours.. CONTINUE ON... your not going to change them, and they are not going to change you.. Re-arguing, and ranting wont do anything but get you a vactions from EQInterface.<br />

Have Fun, Place Nice!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These are the opinions from 3 bards in my guild/alliance, one of whom is my RL husband:<br />
<br />
Eh, that needed to happen. I view that as more of a good thing than a nerf.  Now you wont' have those people who like to pull 50 things in Fire and kite them for an hour for &quot;leet exp&quot;  <br />
<br />
Other things happening with bards next patch: <br />
-Jamfest may actually be fixed, but it won't affect resist songs <br />
-Lull is being adjusted to only last 18 seconds <br />
-and apparently, the DS on PoV has been reduced by 33% or so. - Janlara<br />
<br />
The change to AE kiting is good...that was just way too ludicrous. <br />
<br />
The reduction of the DS is just stupid...we are not talking about an overpowering game breaking amount of damage being added. <br />
<br />
As for lull...I think they went too far. Shortening it is one thing, no problem with them doing that. They should have left it at something more than 18 seconds though. Given the number of resists in hard LDoN missions our lull has become absolutely useless there. Even on easy missions it will be screwed up. With a duration of 18 seconds we will be able to lull two mobs reliably while we pull a third, assuming no missed notes. They could have at least left it at 30 seconds or even a minute, but that is not to be. - Silvendras<br />
<br />
IMHO, the stopping of AE kiging is a fix and not a nerf... I think everyone, including bards expected it. The only ones whining are those abusing it. <br />
<br />
Lull is currently very powerful; however, I agree with Silv... the 18 seconds does seem pretty short. Perhaps it just seems short though. Does it normally take 18 seconds (that's about lulling 4 times, at 3 seconds to lull, and 1 second to react) before previous lulls start breaking. *shrug* - Reed<br />
<br />
And after the latest adjustments:<br />
<br />
Further news from test... Lull has been upgraded on test to last a few ticks longer... However, normal test server disqualifications apply. - Reed<br />
<br />
The PoV DS was a bug. - Janlara<br />
<br />
Yeah, <br />
<br />
Psalm of Veeshan DS reduction has been changed back. Rytan admitted that this was a mistake. Same goes for the lowered resist value on Elemental Rythms. It would also appear that they have indeed decided to fix Jamfest (an AA that makes the bard appear to be a higher level than they actually are...thus making songs of ours that scale by level more effective) and that it will affect the resist portions of songs. <br />
<br />
Hoping that lull is in fact extended somewhat. Reed, the catch to lull being 18 seconds is that in some LDoN dungeons for example there are four or five mobs close together that if you pull one you get them all. If lull is 18 second duration, then you can lull three and pull one with a zero second item or ability...Bellow AA for example. By the time that the mob reacts and starts coming to you, the first lull may have worn off. If the mob is a caster then the first has definitely worn off and likely the second as well. Even on a mob that is not a caster, with lag or other factors it is likely that you could only reliably have two mobs lulled while pulling a third. <br />
<br />
I can see them wanting to fix this, given that it would seem a lot of people were doing assassination missions by getting the mob to spawn and then just lulling past to get to it. Makes an assasination mission rather trivial to complete. <br />
<br />
AE kiting was just outrageous and definitely needed fixing. The fact that we were getting an unintended damage benefit on PBAoE songs makes it almost an exploit. - Silvendras<br />
<br />
Now, that's what I'm hearing from three bards I know and respect a great deal.  If they themselves are saying that the lull was overpowered the way it was, ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My original post stated Lull, in its original form, was overpowered. It lasted a full FIVE MINUTES. It has never been safer, than, say, FD pulling, but it is a fairly powerful tool.<br />
<br />
I can't vouch for AE kiters. I personally think AE kiting and swarm kiting are overpowered, and the EN/SC fix is warranted. It wasn't meant for detrimental songs anywho.<br />
<br />
Most of those quotes seem to be defending the EN/SC fix, which is perfectly fine by me, and by all of the bards I speak with. As I said, I was solely defending Lull.<br />
<br />
The Lull thing with LDoN is not the fault of the mechanics of Lull, but the mechanics of LDoN. LDoN seems to reward farming the adventures, or zerging through them as opposed to actually crawling through them. That doesn't warrant a complete destruction of Lull. The fact they're still toying with its duration gives me hope, though.</div></div><hr />
