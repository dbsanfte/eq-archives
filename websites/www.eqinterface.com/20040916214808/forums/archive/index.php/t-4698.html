<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daellig</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all!<br />
<br />
In the gui I am making:<br />
<br />
Daellig Celtic (based on t.king artwork) (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4524&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1)<br />
<br />
I have the ability to add timers to the interface using Arista's WONDERFUL mod.<br />
<br />
Arista's UI Timer (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp) <br />
<br />
I need to know how many you want on average. I can put up to 7 in the interface based on its current design.<br />
<br />
I also need to know what lengths you would want. The names will all be default names since this is part of a GUI and is designed for a large audiance, so I can't put specific spell names in it. However if you have a lot of spells that last say 1 hour I could call it &quot;Long Spell&quot; or something.<br />
<br />
The other thing to keep in mind is that I can have some of the timers be the same length, just different colors.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />

(I don't use timers- have a stopwatch hanging on my monitor for the rare occasions when a ranger needs to time something)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanys.Neoconker</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should for sure put up a 0:06:00 timer for Mend.  Then maybe just do intervals of ten minutes, 20 minutes, etc.  Just my suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daellig</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is for the t.king celtic based gui I have in my other thread in this forum. The window is actually the MP3 Player, which exists in the lower right portion of the GUI. It is a tabbed window. The first tab shows all current stats, the second tab is the MP3 Player, and I can easily add a 3rd tab that has timers on it for those that use them. There is sufficient room on the tab for 7 timers so I thought I might add them to make the GUI that much more functional.<br />

Here is a link to the pic in the other thread so you can see the window I am talking about.<br />

I also have a timer for Haste and a few others that are random but I would say that most enchanters would depend on those main 2.</div></div><hr />
