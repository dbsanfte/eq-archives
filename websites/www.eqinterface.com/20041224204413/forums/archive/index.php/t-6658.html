<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loadeenng</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">after spending hours taking a flash animation, exporting it to jpegs, then going through each jpeg and isolating the image i want and putting them all into a .gif animation (i had assumed this would worki am teaching myself as i go) the window that i wanted to use the .gif for just comes up with the default background.  <br />
<br />
there is nothing in my uierrors file, and after looking through the uianimations file i'm assuming i have to create an animation like the classanims.  my question is how would i go about doing this and then using that animation as my window background?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kungpo</div><div class="date">03-10-2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Writing the Xml part for this ..i have gotten down yet myself ...But the graphix part ...if you look at the class anime's the images is kinda like old cartoons ...where each frame is Down 1 bye 1 in one file and saved as a *.tga ...  Hope this helps even a little..I was successful in adding my own Anime to the class files ...but getting it all displayed right into 1 animation for the coding wasnt something i was able to do hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try making a custom draw template (WDT) for that window and where the &lt;Background&gt;wnd_bg_light(or dark)_rock.tga&lt;/Background&gt; tags are, plug in the file name of your animated gif in place of the normal background tga.<br />
<br />
This is asuming you matched the X/Y size of your gif to match the size you want for the window.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure your gif animation will work that way, but its easy to try at least.</div></div><hr />
