<br />
XML is an interface language - it lets you describe things in detail in such a way that other software can recognize data structures and read the data.   Its not a full fledged programming language.  In this case, the XML is providing detailed instructions to the GUI on window location and content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As stated, a but. XML is a Display Language<br />
<br />
All is does is Display Data. Nothing else. It can't see what's what or why what's that is that.<br />
<br />
It's used merly to explain what the data is. It's like a fancy INI file, nothing more.<br />
<br />
XML is used more these days cause it's easier to parse and you can really do some complicated data structures with it, and there was constraints for it.<br />
<br />
IE, in INI you can = or = &quot;&quot; or = '', but in proper XML, you can &lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt; or &lt; /&gt;, nothing else.<br />
<br />
It's rather nice, and it's good to have a set of rules govering data files now.<br />
<br />
<br />
But, that's all. Once an XML file is created, it's up to the reading application to take the data and use it's named tags and values for a purpose.<br />
<br />
All the logic is handled in the application. XML just gives you the data (in plain text).</div></div><hr />
