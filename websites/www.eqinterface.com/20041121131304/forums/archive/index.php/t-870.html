<br />
I've been trying and trying to get tabs into the Friends windo and every time, nothing.. = \ This is disapointing..  If anyone has been sucessfull getting tabs into other windows, please post how.. Thanks..</div></div><hr />

I suppose I'll know more tonight when I actually sit down to work on it.</div></div><hr />

Tab support is strictly up to the UI engine, and I doubt SOE/VI implemented them universally (it would be a lot of work).</div></div><hr />

Anyway, take your time on the maps thing, but i have to say i'm really looking forward to it. The current map program is kind of cumbersome and difficult to use, i hope that you're able to remedy that. Some kind of zone connection map for the main areas, with links to the zone's map itself, would be reeeeeealy cool--if it's possible. You may only be able to do this in the help window though, since only it reads html. Since you really can't edit the help.html since it gets overwritten by the patcher (which you *can* get around but it's a pain) and it's also against the EULA (as far as i've heard) to modify anything that's outside the uifiles directory. Which would include the help.html.<br />
<br />
What I think might work, if you haven't already found another way to do this, is make some kind of button in the EQUI_HelpWnd.xml that links to the html file which in turn links to the rest of your map files. I'm not sure how it is done but someone named strega managed it with his tradeskill window. I think.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck, take it easy, and i look forward to the fruits of your labour!</div></div><hr />

What you suggest would be great, but I don't think will be possible.  Any of this stuff will be cumbersome, because for some reason the GUI loads all images really slowly the first time, and I'm not sure why.  I'm planning on having a program that will let you choose, say, 10 maps to have in the GUI that you run ahead of time that would set up the xml for you.  You wouldn't have access to more than those in the game, unless somehow you had a ton of different mods, each with it's own unique set of 10 maps...  ugg...  I may just give up and write an app that fits in the help.html file and uses that, even though it's &quot;illegal.&quot;  Probably the quickest and easiest way.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, in that same post ( http://forums.eqinterface.com//showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=248 ) I explained why that won't work in certain windows. Technically, you can add tabs to just about anything. However, special purpose windows such as the chat window are off limits. This is because of the way the program accesses the window parts to fill them in.<br />
<br />
It is possible to make a tabbed player window, group window and the like, but the friends window is one of those that is restricted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madcoil</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I created a tabbed version of the pet window with 2 pages: player info page which a lot of people have converted the pet window into, and a pet command page which is just variation on the default pet window.<br />
<br />
Tabs are actually pretty simple to layout once you get used to it. Just took some time combing the actions window to figure out how. A tabbed window will have an included piece of type TabBox. The tabbox has included pages of type Page. The order of the pages in the tabbox determines display order left to right. Each page has the normal assortment of pieces that you would see in an untabbed window. Each page also has specification for whether the page tab will be text or icon and what the active and inactive version will look like.<br />
<br />
Right now looking at whether nested tabs are possible (tab page with with tabs within). If nested tabs are possible, plan to try them for a map or recipe window. Nested tabs would involve creating a new TabBox entry to place in the Page entry of the next higher tab level. Talking exponential growth of file here. Probably wont go more than 2 levels deep simply because dont want to write a file that rivals the animation file in length.</div></div><hr />

Haven't tried the others yet, but the friends window didn't work, as others have pointed out here.<br />
<br />
Testing was done by putting my timer mod, which uses 10 tabs to implement the tick marker feature, into the above mentioned windows. The XML I used can be generated with my web tool, by selecting a configuration containing the tick marker:<br />

you have to glance at the information?  I use extended osmosis.  leave books in car, and their information gets to my brain.  My track record with tests is every time I study, I fail, every time I don't study at all, I get the top grade.</div></div><hr />
