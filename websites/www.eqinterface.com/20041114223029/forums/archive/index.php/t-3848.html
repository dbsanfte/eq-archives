First you need to make your User Interface Modular ... that means taking all of your modifications to your EQUI_Animations.xml file, EQUI_Templates, etc etc, whatever you may have modified and place them inside of a new .XML file that you create. This makes mix/matching mods much easier.<br />
<br />
After this part you need to 'Include' the .xml file in everquest. What I mean is you will need to edit your EQUI.xml (in your UI folder)file to look like this.<br />
<br />
http://eqinterface.com/images/misc/include.gif<br />
<br />
What this does is cause your UI folder to look in the default folder for its MAIN includes (normal windows, graphics, templates, etc).<br />
Then it looks in the UI file that you created (replace EQUI_Quartz.xml with your own) and loads its data.<br />
<br />
http://eqinterface.com/images/misc/loadorder.gif<br />
<br />
This way any time verant adds a new window OR graphics your UI will be affected in no way.. I guess we'll see how well it works when the Test server mp3 player comes in :) Note: This way will not work so well with customized cursors, and possibly some other methods... Any additional input of ways to get around this is appreciated and should be said to the UI public :) <br />

<br />
I'm a little confused though (unsurprising ;))... your example shows two EQUI.xml files, that I think I understand: the edited one in your Custom folder being the one that includes your EQUI_Quartz.xml, which in turn contains pointers to the animations, graphics, etc... (right?)<br />
<br />
But what makes EQ look at the Custom EQUI.xml first, and not the Default?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is that way because Verant has designed things so that the system will always look in your custom dir first.

<br />
Kelric, I think that is just the way it works (thankfully)...Because EQ is loading a UI in a custom folder, it automatically looks in that custom folder for files its told to find, regardless of where the file telling it to find them is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OHHH! So really, it's reading the UI_character_server.ini file to see what skin is being used, and then jumps to that folder, eh? That makes sense, then! Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My best guess is that the client looks for the EQUI.xml first in wahtever directory is flagged by the user by entering a line in each character's respective User Interface initialization file ( ex. UI_Gnosis_64.ini ).<br />
<br />
The client determines the default directory per character by parsing the directory as whatever is in the MAIN section to the right of the designator UISkin=<br />
<br />
The client determines the default directory globaly by parsing the directory as whatever is in the eqclient.ini file in the DEFAULT section to the right of the designator UISkin=<br />
<br />
This is just a guess and would like feedback as to any other thoughts...<br />

The thing I am stumped on is that in the your example of how the file should look, you show:<br />
<br />
blah blah blah<br />
yadda yadda<br />
blah gaugetypes<br />
<br />
&lt;XML ID = &quot;EQInterfaceDefinitionLanguuage&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Composite&gt;<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;../default/EQUI.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />

     &lt;/Composite&gt;<br />
&lt;Schema xmlns = &quot;EverQuestData&quot; xmlns:dt = &quot;EverQuestDataTypes&quot; /&gt;<br />
&lt;/XML&gt;<br />
<br />
The line that I have in bold .... it has a &quot;path&quot; defined in it.  When I try to put a path in, it chokes.  What am I missing here?<br />
<br />
Also, as you have already noted, it won't work for things like cursors.  We still end up having to go back and edit the default EQUI_Animations.xml, rather defeating the entire purpose.  Has anyone come up with a work around for that yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do not change that line.  That line is set to do exactly what it should do.  It will use the &quot;..\ &quot; to go up one directory from the current directory (which would be your custom skin directory) then it will use the &quot;default &quot; to go to that directory and then it will grab the &quot;EQUI.xml &quot; file from that directory to include in your custom UI.<br />
<br />
It is this process that makes this UI so that it is less likely to break.  By including the Verant EQUI.xml file in this file it makes it so that any change that Verant makes is always included in your custom skin.<br />
<br />
So do not make a change to this line leave it so that is says <br />
&quot;&lt;Include&gt;../default/EQUI.xml&lt;/Include&gt;&quot;</div></div><hr />

Finally a way for people to use a modified EQUI.xml but still reference the original so patches won't impair the functioning of the UI due to an outdated modded EQUI.xml.

I want to comment out the casting window.  I don't see any way to do this, under this method.<br />

I understand the principle.  I just see some difficulties with it.  The two main being the ones already stated:  Cursors (animation file) and Casting Windows (ui file).  <br />
<br />
Make a dummy EQUI_CastingWindow with no xml in it. This way it will include the file but, the casting window won't appear since there's no xml in it. <br />
<br />
Making dummy files of those you would rather comment out may seem like more work, but if that means most people can go in and play right after a patch instead of having to add a new line to the EQUI file (or waiting for someone else add the line for them)  then I'm all for it.<br />
<br />
And no, the unbreakable UI solution isn't perfect, but it's much better then what most people are doing right now. I hope it catches on.<br />
<br />
EDIT: All that you should need in a dummy file is this:<br />
<br />
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;us-ascii&quot;?&gt;<br />
&lt;XML ID=&quot;EQInterfaceDefinitionLanguage&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;Schema xmlns=&quot;EverQuestData&quot; xmlns:dt=&quot;EverQuestDataTypes&quot; /&gt;<br />

Oh, I quite agree that anything that will make this entire process less painful for *all* of us is a good thing.  Just coming up with questions so we can figure out ways to deal with them, in the attempt to make this *really* work, ya know?</div></div><hr />

True enough. Maybe I should have been more explicit in the last post. For a few windows making a dummy file of them would get you into trouble (The bazaar window springs to mind here). <br />
<br />
But, for the two windows that are most commonly commented out (EQUI_BreathWindow and EQUI_CastingWindow) making dummy files for them is perfectly valid. No incompatibility messages or errors should be forthcoming. Though I am only speaking from my experience with them and it wouldn't be the first (or last) time I was mistaken about something. Though your method is safer for most people deciding to get rid of a window.  :)<br />
<br />
Also with the dummy file for those two you get the nice bonus of not wasting memory to load something that won't even be seen by the user.  And really, I just dislike putting in any code that isn't going to be used.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ps. Love your work on Glass. I'm looking forward to seeing the finished mod.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, a slightly cleaner way to accomplish the same end is to delete EQUI.xml from your own directory entirely.  Then, in the first loaded file that you modify, insert your includes at the beginning:<br />
<br />
&lt;?xml version = &quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br />
&lt;XML ID = &quot;EQInterfaceDefinitionLanguage&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Composite&gt;<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;Gauges.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;Gems.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;ThinBorder.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;Deco.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Composite&gt;<br />
<br />
For me, this is in EQUI_Animations.xml.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobeken</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you could not use includes at all and just put all your custom animations in any standard UI file you want...<br />
<br />
But Xymarra does have a point...<br />
<br />
Those who mix n match UI's cant exactly easily put your custom animations from your UI in with someone elses if they all require a custom EQUI.xml file...<br />
<br />
The BEST option is to just put your custom animations/etc in a named file, then include it in your modded file...So people who mix n match can still mix n match...As long as they dont overwrite your one custom file that has your animations/etc in it...<br />
<br />
But really and truly, there is no unbreakable UI...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But you can work toward that goal. And I happen to like Statix's method; I don't mod Animations, Templates or any other common file and I wouldn't want to have Include statements or shared animations in a window file (which is all I will mod anymore because all non-window files have broken at one time or another) because then I'd have to tell people who download my skin how to fix things if they decide they want to mod that particular window. <br />
<br />
As is, all I have to say is &quot;don't replace EQUI, don't put in a custom Animations or Templates, don't copy over your default directory and don't delete EQUI_Aeluin, and this mod shouldn't have any problems.&quot; Even so I get a few support questions but they're mostly from people trying to add broken mods or mods that come with an Animations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a good suggestion.  I have had some success with crash proofing on my WC3 mods because i was including most of the animations declarations into the actual files that will use them.  This has worked well so far but there was no way for me to create a custom window design without using the templates files.  Unfortunately for most skinners EQ has chosen to patch the two most critical files and patch them frequently.  Those 2 files are the templates, and animations files.  Also if you add any declarations to the main EQUI file that gets patched as well.  I think Verant just wants to challenge us to see if they can use our methods of patch proofing in their own code.  What better way to save DEV time and funds heheheeh.   At any rate.  I will most definately be trying your suggestions on my WC3 mods and see how they work out.  Very nice contribution.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is actually a pretty simple concept. You have the first file that EQ looks for (that's modifiable) and you  use it to include only what your mod or skin uses, plus the other EQUI file. Since it already loaded some stuff from the custom file, it won't load it from the original EQUI. If Verant changes anything in the EQUI file, it won't matter because you aren't eliminating it from your file processing. Same with the animations file. You can do a custom animations file (EQUI_Animations_Spec.XML) that is called before the other animations file, but the original EQUI_Animations still stays intact and updateable. Basically, the EQUI.xml fix is working off that same principal. <br />
<br />
What I was doing (pain in the butt if you ask me) was taking the windows that were grouped together (ie, swapping stuff around between Player, Pet, Grouup, and Target) and looking in the EQUI file to see which it loaded up first. In this case, it would be the Group window, so I was using that window to define the animations for those three windows. But, I ran into a problem of wanting to reuse some graphics in the buff window, which got loaded first and wouldn't have a definition for the custom graphics, so I had to move all that info from the group window to the buff window. I have about 3 out of 6 XML files that don't have animation definitions now. This will fix it so I don't have to have animation definitions in ANY of my files except the custom animations  :-)</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, if I decide to put all my custom animations or Includes in the breath window for instance, it would be ridiculously difficult to attempt to explain to someone over PMs how to put in a different breath window.<br />
<br />
Besides, individual window mods almost never come with a modded EQUI. It's not practical or useful to do that unless you have a complete set. And members who are mixing-and-matching elements from more than one set tend to be the more experienced ones who can either figure things out themselves or at least understand a semi-technical explanation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, the idea of using a Quartz.xml file is a good one, although it's still necessary sometimes to edit the Animations and Template files.<br />
<br />
This new scheme is a better way to use Quartz.xml --  the EQUI.xml file is still self-updating.  But there are still some things not fixed by use of Quartz.xml.  There are two I can think of:<br />
<br />
1) Some objects can't be replaced.  Verant could probably fix this if they really wanted to.<br />
<br />
For instance A_SpellBookSlot is used in the spell book but that word does not appear anywhere in the file EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml.  To make changes to A_SpellBookSlot I have to actually edit EQUI_Animations.xml.  There is no way to make the spellbook use an object defined in Quartz.xml instead.<br />
<br />
Another example is A_ClassAnim08/ A_ClassAnim09/ A_ClassAnim10.  If you want to have a different custom animation loaded based on which character is being played you must edit the EQUI_Animations.xml file.  There's no way to put a custom animation in Quartz.xml and have it used instead of A_ClassAnim08.<br />
<br />
2) Sometimes windows are changed, not just new windows added.  For example, the Stat column that was added.  It just wouldn't work to include ..\default\BazaarSearchWnd.xml in your custom bazaar window.  Someday they'll add a new required control to the player window, or the inventory window, and on that day every mod everywhere will break.</div></div><hr />

It's true that certain things can't be modified without changing animations- cursor size and class animation frames are the most annoying ones. But most mods don't even change them anyway; why not make the effort to avoid modifying files that *will* break the UI?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the answer to that is, basically, because it's there. <br />
<br />
What I mean is, if only modify the files that won't break, and only in ways that won't break, you're limiting your creativity. Now, there's nothing wrong with doing simple changes, just moving around the data that's already there - that's what I've done with my personal UI. But some folks want to do more... and SOE included the files for them to change, giving them the ability to stretch the boundaries a little. Look at all the amazing UI's that have been created, that require changes to &quot;breakable&quot; files. It may not be &quot;high&quot; art, but it IS art, in my opinion, made all the more attractive by it's practical usefulness.</div></div><hr />

As I've said multiple times, the only things you can't change without modifying core shared files are cursor size and the number of frames in a class animation. Now you can do some gorgeous things if you do modify those- see t.king's class animations- but if you choose not to modify them, why on earth would you not make the effort, as I said above, to make your mod patch-resistant?</div></div><hr />

You'll need to update that file for yourself when there's a patch, but if your play directory and the files you upload use the new method, you won't have to update them; you'll still be able to play and so will the others using your UI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never have worried too much about &quot;patch proofing&quot; my UI since I just update it the morning of the patch and people can grab the new version without too much hassle.  But obviously the less often it breaks, the better.  <br />
<br />
I already put my custom animations in a seperate file since it makes for cleaner code than defining essentially the same item in 3 or 4 different windows.  <br />
<br />
But I haven't been able to get away from modifying the animations and templates files.  I use my own custom borders, as well as modifications to BlueIconBackground and RedIconBackground.<br />
<br />
The borders wouldn't be a problem to move, though I'd have to change the method I use (I actually replace the WDT_Rounded and NoTitle borders with mine so that the UI is more compatible with taking pieces from and adding pieces to.  <br />
<br />
But I can't find a way to make another file behave like the BlueIconBackground and RedIconBackground, and I'm guessing there is no way to do so, since it decides which one to call based on the spell.  But if anyone has found a way to do it, I'd love to hear it.</div></div><hr />

Just write your own definition in your custom file.  It will still grab it from there.  If you need an example, download my forry ui and check out the EQUI_Forry.xml file.  Its huge, but it works.  My template definitions are near the bottom of that file.</div></div><hr />

If I moved the template to EQUI_Elindel.xml and renamed it WDT_Elindel it would work fine.  But then if you liked my player window and dropped in another skin, you'd need EQUI_Elindel.xml and an include for that file to make it work at all.<br />

The chat window templates aren't the problem, I can rename and move those, but there's no point if I can't find a way to define BlueIconBackground somewhere other than the animations file, and I don't think there is.<br />

If I change the way my borders work now all I do is eliminate having a custom templates file, while the UI still breaks every time they change the animations file, and it becomes less compatible with mixing and matching, which really isn't the direction I want to go :(</div></div><hr />

Also any window using the new border needs it's xml moded to, a very simple change but still present, best to try to mod the TGA file for borders.<br />

<br />
I ended up deciding against removing the templates file.  It doesn't get changed often and when it does I can have a fix up before the servers are.  To me that was less cumbersome than having to include every window in my UI to get the correct border.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Banderwyr</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be nice for us if SOE decided to correct this obvious shortcomming in custom ui mods by giving us a free blank slate file to use...<br />
<br />
Basially they could just add two lines...<br />
<br />
&lt;Include&gt;SIDL.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
&lt;Include&gt;Custom_Animations.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
&lt;Include&gt;Custom_Templates.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_Animations.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_Templates.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
Then just have Custom_Animations.xml and Custom_Templates.xml be blank files in the default ui, while in our own mods we can edit them as much as we want. As long as we don't reuse the same definition names as ones used in the EQUI versions of those files, we are good. That would allow EQUI.xml and the animations / templates file to update as much as they want, without breaking any custom ui mods. I know this isn't the most fullproof method as there would still be some things that would not be changeable without modifying the stock default animations and templates, but this would at least get us closer than we already are...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummm.. But that would make sense and stuff.  I've really noticed that even though SOE allows the Custom UI's, they really dont like it. IE - See what happens when they added the target indicator....where we had to actually copy the the files to the UI folder instead of it seeing them like normal.. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the way that SOE has been making the .xml files for the new windows it seem that they are moveing more away from universal graphics and more toward defining them per window.<br />
<br />
The CAW and Hotbutton windows are good examples.  Instead of making universal buttons numbered 1 to 10 in the EQUI_Animations.xml file and using the same ones for each window, they defined them seperately for each window. (A_CombatButton1*, A_HotButton1*, etc)<br />
<br />
Adds more lines of code, and I don't know if that is good for the slower systems, but it does eliminate much of the dependencies on the EQUI_Animations.xml file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Banderwyr</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using animations and graphics per window that needs it, is ok in theory, but there will always be a need for a global animation file.<br />
<br />
It is just more code efficient to define a graphic that will be used numerous times, only once. And of course you have to do this in a file that gets loaded as one of the first files in the includes in order for it to be truly global and work in ANY window that you want to use it in.<br />
<br />
I can see SOE getting sloppier and sloppier with their coding habits in the ui files, until eventually modders will either be locked out of the ui changes, or they make it truly custom.<br />
<br />
An example of truly custom would be:<br />
<br />
1) Force the game to load a custom ui folder, and use that same folder name to pick up a custom include file. For exaple say I have a ui called Banderwyr, the game would look in the Banderwyr folder for a file called Banderwyr.xml and load any includes.<br />
<br />
2) If EQUI_BuffWindow.xml exists in my Banderwyr folder, load it INSTEAD of the one defined in EQUI.xml in the default folder. (This is already done)<br />
<br />
3) If I define A_BtnNormal anywhere in my files in the Banderwyr folder, the game should know that it is to use THAT definition INSTEAD of the one in the default files.<br />
<br />
The 3 things listead above enables us to include whatever files we want, without breaking our ui whenever they need to patch in something to the default ui. It also makes all of the files that could possibly be customized TRULY modular without excluding new and updated content that the game wants to throw at us via a patch. And lastly, it makes that modular feature work right down to the CODE, so that we can replace Animations, Templates, or whatever we want, and still allowing the default animations, and templates to load if we didn't already define that specific one. Again making it possible for new content to come in without forcing us to update our uifiles to get them to work.<br />
<br />
*** I am just speculating with the above, and it is an example. Feel free to add whatever you want as more examples or ideas.***</div></div><hr />
