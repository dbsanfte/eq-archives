My problem is that the images in my spellbook are kind of messed up somehow. <br />

<br />
As you can see, the &quot;Back&quot; button on the top left is totally missing, but it still works when I click in that spot. Also there is a gap on the right side of the book. Call me clueless but I just can't figuire out what is causing this. Any help would be greatly appreciated, If not I can live with it. Have been using my book like this for maybe a few months. Just decided to see if anyone else had the same problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But thats only my guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zip up your &quot;EQUI_SpellBookWnd.xml, EQUI_Animations.xml&quot; and any other files you think might be related to this spell book.  I can take a look at the file and let you know where the issues are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Primer55</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, including my EQUI_Animations and EQUI_SpellBookWnd files in a zip attached to this post, still haven't found a fix so any suggestions would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Notice the holders for the gems on the right are off and the background is off on the far right of the book.</div></div><hr />
