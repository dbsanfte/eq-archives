The most downloaded Mix &amp; Match EQ UI <br />
<br />
- Numerous bug fixes since 1.4, mainly XML errors<br />
- Added LFG Button to Group Window<br />
- Updating Spell Casting Window, thanks LoduzVZ (includes Spell Book Button for auto-scribing)<br />
- Fixed XML errors with Percentages in Target &amp; Group Windows<br />
<br />
There's too many features to list, but it is a Mix &amp; Match UI based mainly off DrakahMix (kudos!). The main differences are 100 pixels more viewable area and it works in both 1024x768 and 1280x1024 resolutions.<br />

Download Here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1371)<br />
p.s: USE THE SUPPLIED .INI FILE OR YOU WON'T GET ANY HELP FROM ME :) If you use the supplied ini file there should be no need to use any /loadskin commands or manually move any windows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenrix</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure when you extracted the files from the zip, it didn't create a subfolder under your EQ DIR\uifiles\Soes\Soes.<br />
<br />
Just go into the directory and make sure the path only reads (like it would look on mine): C:\Program Files\EverQuest\uifiles\Soes<br />
<br />
If it is setup like that, then you should have no probs...otherwise you will want to take that folder out into your \uifiles\ directory and delete the other empty one.<br />
<br />
Sorry if it sounds confusing, but best way I can think to explain it.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkrigel</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the simple fix is when you copy the UI_yourname_49.ini file into your main directory and log in the game. instead of typing /loadskin soes type /loadskin soes 1<br />
<br />
it takes and loads the skin from the INI file instead of setting a default ini placement</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a quick look, but it appears that EQ is not seeing the path correctly (just call me MOTO)<br />
<br />
Your directory structure should look like<br />
C:\Program Files\Everquest\UIFiles\Soes\&lt;a grunch of files here&gt;<br />
<br />
The above assumes that you unzipped the UI into a directory named Soes in the directory named UIFiles in your EQ directory.<br />
<br />
Any folders inside the Soes folder will not be seen by EQ, therefore the UI will be &quot;broken&quot;.<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salbus</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since it wouldn't let me delete the first Soes file (It said i was using it, even when i was off of eq =/) so i made a new one called interface (cuz i'm so creative) which is C:\EverQuest\uifiles\Interface\soes and then all the files... that's not good then is it? What am i supposed to do to fix this if i need to...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velisaris</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're getting some sort of error message about files being in use when you're deleting the old folder, just reboot and delete the old soes folder.<br />
<br />
When you download the 1.5 version, it should unzip to a folder called Soes15.  Inside that folder is another folder called soes (actually, this will be the only thing in that folder).  Copy THAT folder into your uifiles folder in the EQ directory.<br />
<br />
Now, open the soes folder and find the UI_Yourchar_Yourserver file...open it.  Select everything and copy it. Close that file and go back to the main EQ directory.<br />
<br />
Find the appropriate UI file for the character you want to use this UI with (UI_name_##).  Open that file, select everything and delete it.  Then paste what you copied earlier into that file, save it and close it.<br />
<br />
Start EQ and you should be good to go...no need to type /loadskin or anything.  BTW, you're going to have some error messages about the UI because not every window was changed, so if the game can't find that window in the soes directory, it'll use the default window.  Those error messages in the logfile are just telling you that it's using the defaults for those items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salbus</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ack not even THAT worked... and i tried it twice, then i also tried /loadskin anyways, still didn't work, it's really bugging me lol. Here's how I loaded it in steps:<br />
1. Downloaded it of course<br />
2. Extracted the files from my zipped folder on my desktop to C:\EverQuest\uifiles\Ranger<br />
3. Went into UI_YourName_YourServer.ini, copied it, deleted the old things in the UI_Kunaden_92.ini, and pasted the new one and saved<br />
4. Logged onto EQ, screen was the old default UI, typed /loadskin Ranger, nothing, /loadskin Ranger 1, and still nothing, it's driving me insane</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unzip the file to C:\EverQuest\uifiles\ (it will automatically make the &quot;Soes&quot; directory)<br />
<br />
Rename UI_YourName_YourServer.ini to UI_Kunaden_92.ini and copy it to your C:\EverQuest dir, overwrite your old one.<br />
<br />
If you follow these instructions you shouldn't need to do any /loadskin commands, the UI will work with all the windows in place, assuming you're in 1024x768 or 1280x1024 resolution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Downloaded the UI<br />
2) Extracted the zipped files from my desktop to C:\EverQuest\uifiles, and it made a folder called soes by itself<br />
3) I opened up soes and found a .ini file called UI_YourName_YourServer.ini, right clicked, click copy all and minimized it<br />
4) you need to go to C:\EverQuest (the place where you can see all your screenshots and stuff), find a file called UI_(name of character you want the UI for)_(some numbers, depends on server).ini<br />
5) Open the .ini file, and delete everything inside, after that, right click and paste<br />
6) Save the changes and log into EQ and it should load by itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if it's necessary to rename the UI_YourName_YourServer.ini in the soes folder, but i renamed it to UI_Kunaden_92.ini (The character and server i wanted the UI for)</div></div><hr />

Well I tried to edit but no go on that.  I got 2 Soes UI folders in my .zip so I used the most recent one.  Copy and pasted the .ini folder and when I logged in I got a little lag so I checked my uierror.log this is the new stuff.<br />

I don't see anything out of the ordinary there.. all those errors are just from UI files that I havn't customized, so it's just calling them from the default folder. Everyone who uses SoesUI will have errors like that in their UIErrors.txt... it sounds like somethings corrupt with your EQ installation. Have you tried doing a full scan in the patcher?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sommarnautt</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup did full scan and it only replaced a zone file.  I figured I would see how things go.  I made the trip from PoTranq to VT with no problems untill I zoned into VT and it crashed to server select this time.  I dont know whats going on here.  Im going to re-install EQ and see if that helps.  Wish me luck!!  But it's a great UI none the less.  I love how much free space I have now.  My old one was so cluttered!</div></div><hr />
