<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathara</div><div class="date">08-31-2002, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I summitted my mod to the site a day or so ago but finished some of my more final modifications much faster than I thought(was adding a whole bunch of stuff).  On the old script we could just update the mod download... but Im not seeing that capability with the new stuff... Should I just reupload it and put a note at the top saying this is an update of the first one or something else?  I just dont want there to be any confusion since I am most likely going to have to do it at least one more time for a couple more things I plan on adding(have no idea when that will be done).  I would post it on the boards... but as it has grown a bit its fine for the main site but a bit too big for the boards.<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Just upload your updated version and leave a note for kudane in the description to delete your old version.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to make sure that you guys dont have to use space on something that isn't any good any more =)</div></div><hr />
