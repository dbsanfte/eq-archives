<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JDStaley</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, The Userface I had originally downloaded awhile back, which was entitled Druid on my computer, and contained T.King artwork, has been telling me I had problems for quite some time, so today(upon the first time I crashed when I zoned) I decided to download the most recent available complete set UI off of EQInterfaces.com, which I believe is entitled Drestin Thoth or something like that(entitled Thoth when I get in game and load it up) I'm really not concerned as to what Interface I use, as long as it has the percentages of HP, Mana, Stamina, Exp and AAExp, along with an open inventory to easier open my backpacks, I will enclose the UI errors experienced just a matter of moments ago when I loaded up &quot;Thoth&quot; and tried to zone, which of course immediately crashed me to Desktop, if I could find what it is I need to do or download to fix this, I would very much appreciate the help, as I cannot stand the Default UI =(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">infinity9</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well not sure if that UI uses some weird XML files but the error log did not mention the EQUI.XML file being missing so I would try deleting the one in the custom skin dir first as it just tells what files are to be attached.</div></div><hr />
