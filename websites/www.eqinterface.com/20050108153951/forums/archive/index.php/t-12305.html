<br />
I can usually figure out xml code (using trial and error if all else fails), but I have no idea where to start when it comes to graphics (I have trouble with stick figures).<br />
<br />
I have a tga file which has various bits of frames and stuff in it (The T.King Celtic 2.0 SE Modders Kit (http://pub165.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm27.showMessage?topicID=72.topic)) .<br />
<br />
It's in the supporters area which is why I havn't posted it here.<br />
<br />
I would like to use in my UI, but I have no idea how to set up the xml code to reference the bits.<br />
<br />
Also, it has borders in it, which I am guessing can be made stretchy somehow, but I have no idea how.<br />
<br />
Any help  would be very much appreciated :)<br />

I'm fairly sure I can get the xml working, it's getting the sizes where I'm syuck. My graphics tools are MS Paint *grin* and I don't think that is quite up to letting me count pixels.<br />
<br />
The file has an image for the top left corner in it, but I have no idea how (if I can) to flip it to use it on the other corners ?<br />
<br />
Also, there are 2 different solid frames (e.g. all 4 sides) in the file, and I have no idea how to reference them and make them stretchy.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing I'll have to wait till someone releases a UI using the file and hack it to pieces *grin*.<br />
