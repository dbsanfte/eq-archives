<br />
Kudane has posted the photoshop / Paint Shop Pro DDS plugin in the sticky above.<br />
<br />
I thought I would also post some tools I found handy when dealing with DDS files when I was making Morrowind mods.  :)  Most of these are unnecessary if you already have Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro, but hopefully there's something you can use.<br />
<br />
The main site for these is http://fly.to/mwgfx/  There's a lot of handy stuff here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show&quot; is the main item.  It allows you to view .DDS files, perform some simple operations, and convert among all supported file types.  It's also handy for just converting a .tga to a .bmp for editing if you don't have PSP or Photoshop, but note that that won't perserve alpha channels.<br />

<br />
<br />
TGAtool2 apparently lets you export an alpha channel from a TGA file and then edit it in MS Paint.   :eek:   Haven't actually tried this yet.<br />
http://www.mnwright.btinternet.co.uk/train/tgatool2.htm<br />
<br />
Convim lets you batch-convert between supported file types.<br />

<br />
Remember to pick up the DLLs needed to use these: http://www.mnwright.btinternet.co.uk/graphix.htm#dlls<br />
<br />
Hope you guys find this useful.  :)<br />
