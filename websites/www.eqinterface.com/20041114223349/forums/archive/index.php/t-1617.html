Questions:<br />
-Can you get Vert 2.0 in the original Color?<br />
-I remember you saying there might be a blue version out, any luck on that?<br />
-If I use Vert 1.1 and have various mods from Sokol, like reverse buff icons and rearranged resists. . .am I goin to have to request new mods if I install Vert 2.0?  or will it kinda xfer over?<br />
<br />
Love the hotbutton selector btw  <br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylnathorn</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very Nice I just started using Vert last night(was using quartz) I really like it but a Blue version would be awesome. I already tinted the windows to blue(as much as I could) but not everything tints. Anyways just a small reaquest and I am sure it beleongs in the request area but what the hey=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vertebrae</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems like blue's a popular colour. <br />
It's in the works.<br />
<br />
As fer compatability with the old vert ui. I'd say most likely not. <br />
<br />
Hopefully with Sokol's help i can make a lefty buff window and other variations.<br />
<br />
Version 2.0 is still very unfinished. Lets see where I can go from here.</div></div><hr />

Would anyone do me the favor and upload the files to the new Download section? Vertebrae or Kudane or whoever has the files...<br />

Vert 2.0 modified to show t.kings spellbooks and t.kings/remelios spell cast bar...<br />
Just uploaded it to the mix'n match section...not sure though if it worked, soewhere during the upload it said something along the lines of &quot;sorry, server is too busy, try again later&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'll wait a while to see if it came through, before I try again...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this *the* 2.0 Vert, because the only version right now is sickly green and named after pot. =)<br />
<br />
Are we to take that this is a &quot;non-official &quot; mod of vert? If so, I don't understand that it was posted by Vertabrae.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any clarification.<br />
<br />
-rs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vertebrae</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yepo this is the release of vert 2.0 - leaning towards a different theme cause well.. i chose to. lol this mod prolly isnt gonna make everyone happy. but hey, that was never the intention with the first either.<br />
<br />
  If I feel i'm getting bored with this one and head another direction, that'll come another time. In the mean time, just wanted to give some food for thought with the mod I use at home. I'm offering you 2 new things that no other mods offer. A compass that tells u + and - , and a Tirrani's tool that customizes the hotbutton.<br />
<br />
 If ya really wanna know why i went green i'll tell ya. Most of my ideas for the ui come when i smoke that stuff. I was bored of seeing blue this and blue that. Vert means green in french,.. i think. Thought a poison green was an appropriate colour for rogue. My good friend Kildaere is a druid and likes the colour green. <br />
<br />
Anyways. I'm looking foward to seeing u guys play with this one and mod the crap outta it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didnt think anything could inprove Vert 1.1 for my 1280 box but you did it with 2.0<br />
<br />
As a few ppl have asked before - any chance of some files to make it a blue tint? Only cause it's easier on my tired old eyes <br />
<br />
I had modded Vert 1.1 to have an easy on my eyes blue background, applied some of the mods to this version and it seems to work fine - but not all the boxes accept the tint <br />
<br />
Thanks again for a great skin</div></div><hr />

anyways version 2.1 has been sent. there is a blue version available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">YoMaD</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Edit: I just downloaded crystal meth and it looks good with dark red tints, have new problems for you. Pet hp is split into mana and is grey colored, so it's hard to see. Advanced targetting's fraction split bar is grey split into white, it's also hard to see. Group pet hp is grey split into white, also hard to see. The only things needing color changes are the split bars that are grey, blue would be good but I'd personally do red because I have red tinted windows. Also, could you make the buff window wider to include more of the longer buff's names? I have it stacked over the player/pet tab, and if you could widen it to be the same width as that window it would be great. Also alt doesn't work on spell gems to see the names but that's expected, I'll just have to get used to it, at least it saves room.<br />
<br />
Another edit: Personal preference but I'd like current hp/max hp rather than the other way around.</div></div><hr />

I was able to get it to work Tadashya once I had removed the spellcastingwindow from the Vert folder.  So it will just use the one from the Default folder.  I really do like that Ivy Spell bar it looks awsome!!!<br />
<br />
I did find that the Loc Guide Mod wont mix and match with Vert 2.1.  <br />
<br />
Currently I am running the Vert 2.1 Blue with the Vert 2.0 Steel as the logo that blinks on the Character select window.  My wife would not really like to see blinking Crystal Meth or Canabis :D</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling you have some cool stuff fer us not to long from now. <br />

kagetan - buff windows might get f'ed up when u start the mod. from before, try resizing. im pretty sure the blue buffs are working fine. the buff windows have invisible borders, but are still resizable, just tricky.<br />

I released and have tested:<br />
<br />
Ocean Spray - Blue version (Similar to Vert's Crystal Meth)<br />
Dozen Roses - Fuschia version<br />
Grey Matter - Straight Grey version<br />
Golden Rod - Yellow/Gold version<br />
<br />
If anyone has any requests for color combos I can make them, I'll just do it with the 2.1 mod from now on.<br />

You might be able to just replace the graphics in my version with the graphics in Vert 2.1, haven't tested it though.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah another note, I didn't see invite/disband buttons on group window if they were supposed to be there. <br />
<br />
I missed that at first too YoMaD but then I saw that their is a Little + sign and a Little - Sign that will appear.  The + appears when you click on someone to invite them.  The - Sign will appear after group is formed to Disband that person or group.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
If you hold the mouse pointer over the + and - Sign when they appear it will say Invite or Disband respectivly.<br />

<br />
There was an extra window when I first got it up and running, showing str, agi...all that sort of stuff plus resistances.  I closed it because I didnt think I had anywhere to tuck it out of the way.  Now I have room and want to get it back!!  So where can I get that back?<br />
<br />
Plus is there a buff bar for Vert WITHOUT the names of the buffs on them?  I just want the little buff boxes without the names.  If i mouse over them though they can show the name if they want.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

If you download the tking vet2.1 fix for the spell book and put one of the books in as well you still have bad framerate problems.But i found if i loaded ivygems and changed the spell cast window it fix problems.However i dont realy like to use that part of the mod.If someone could do a different cast spell window that would be great. I liked the one from vet 1.1 but it however will not cross over,and the one from vert 2.1 is what causes the problems if someone could fix it plz help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rizwank</div><div class="date">09-02-2002, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">couple of quick thoughts if you dont mind<br />
first, the smaller item icons with the 12 total (4x weapons, 8x custom) was a lot cooler, the larger icons are kinda bulky and less cool looking :)<br />
<br />
the image doesnt show what the inventory looks like however<br />
<br />
One nice thing about the orignal vert was the unqiue icon for STR, I Was going to ask if you could do the same for STA and weight (I play a monk ) ... the loss of those unique icons for the &quot;overall stat&quot; window is kinda saddenning, it added a LOT of the flair in the first version<br />
<br />
the new compass and stamina bar rocks.. it taking up room for mana is kinda annoying thow<br />
<br />
the auto config app looks awesome, any way of getting it to set the above issues i mentioned ;p maybe allow 3 Primary stats that are shown all the time, and the rest require the inv to be open?<br />
<br />
might want to consider integrating mapui into it too ;p thats yoru call of course<br />
<br />
hope you take this with the intent it is meant with !<br />
<br />
thx<br />

<br />
Thruout the week i'll prolly be fixing some bugs here and there. I'll try to go thru some of the issues people have with vert mod.<br />
<br />
On another note, I've recieved alot of email's offering donations and such fer the time put into this mod. I found it strange yet thankful, lol. So I've setup a Paypal account under yellowmonkey26@hotmail.com to recieve any donations. <br />
25% of any donations will be given to www.eqgui.com for all thier hard work and to keep this site growing..<br />

Anyways heres a quick fix fer the pet window which was unfinished on release.</div></div><hr />

If you're reading this...<br />
No other compass will work with 2.1. They all read off by about 45 degrees. <br />
Can something be done so that any compass skin will work?<br />
Sorry but your compass is just too small to be useful for my tired old eyes.<br />

Its a great buff bar but i think it would make more sense going the other way ... instead of being placed on the right side .. on the left... some of the text rolls off ...<br />

I think that would be a nice addition to a really really great mod ...</div></div><hr />

It seems so small when I am in 1280x1024 resolution.  Also a bit bigger Hps showing on the Player Window.  I dont know XML very well at all.  I have been able to figure out a few changes that I made to my Player window to get the Red Health bar.  But I couldnt figure out how to make the size any bigger for diffrent stats.  If anyone could post what I need to make things bigger I can try to do it myself.  <br />
