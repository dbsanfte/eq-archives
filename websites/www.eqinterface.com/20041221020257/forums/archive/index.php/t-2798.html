    I had a cool idea for a new kind of window similar to Athee's Timer window in usefulness.  I plan to make a window in which you enter a loc, and it takes your current loc, and calculates which compass direction you have to go.  I know the math for calculating the direction, but need to know where and how to enter it.  I am a web designer and programmer, so you don't have to give me instructions like I'm a little kid.<br />
   Also, to do this, I may need to access EQ's internal loc variable, anyone know how I might do this?<br />
<br />
    Thanks to anyone who replies.</div></div><hr />

   Very good idea you have there.  May be overly-utopian, but I support you.  If you do get this to work however, I will be your first user (Maybe...).  Sorry I can't help you at all.  Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

I was told that you are unable to do any mathmatical calculations in XML.  Sorry dude.</div></div><hr />

Sorry - you're out of luck - can't be done under the current UI schema.  The UI is intended to allow modifications to layout - not to function.  Therefore, the is now way somone working on a mod to capture input from the user and perform calculations on it and generate output.</div></div><hr />

Guess I'm gonna have to alter the schema =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soontace</div><div class="date">10-11-2002, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There might be a way to do it.  It would require the user to do a little math.  They would have to take thier current location X1, Y1 and subtract it from the location the would like to go too X2, Y2.<br />
<br />
X2-(X1), Y2-(Y1) ....4000-(-200), 5000-(200) = 4200, 4800<br />
<br />
With this information they could scroll and get the bearing 318.8 degrees (see attached jpg).<br />
<br />
The problem I had was not being able to figure out a way to create an overlay that would keep the X, Y headings displayed while the user scrolled through the table.  <br />
<br />
If you would like to play around with the table download it from the link I posted above.  There is a test text table included in it that you can paste into the xml file.  If someone comes up with a way to use the info and make it work I will do a complete text table (-10,000 to -10,000) that is formatted correctly if required.</div></div><hr />
