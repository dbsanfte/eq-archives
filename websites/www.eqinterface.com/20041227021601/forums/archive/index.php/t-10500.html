Since there are so many complete sets we felt there should be some sub categories to help people better find what they are looking for.<br />
<br />
If you have a sub category for the complete sets area to suggest to us please let me know. If your an Author and find your interface in the wrong category please PM me, kudane or sokol.<br />
<br />
Also please note the new poll to the right. ---&gt;</div></div><hr />

We have those categories... named a bit different but pretty much the same. We have all of those but the DashBoard mainly because many DashBoard UI's fit in the other categories better.<br />
<br />
Compact UIs = Minimalist<br />
Default Tweak UIs = Functional<br />
Fantasy = Fantasty, Medievel &amp; Celtic, Evil (open to more ideas too)</div></div><hr />

i was talking about INSIDE the default section... most of our categories now are by window name.. not by design..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angellica</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think useful to sort by resolution because I need no very high resolution UIs and I must search one to one on UIs to get it...<br />
<br />
Maybe:<br />
1.-  Low Res UIs (upper limit 1024*768 or another useful).<br />
2.-  High Res UIs (the rest).<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry for my terrible english and thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manxs</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about organizing them into a Caster / Melee area.  Some of the sets are designed for casting classes and others are designed for melee and it would be nice to be able to find a set for the particular type of class that we are setting up</div></div><hr />

We cant have categorys where interfaces could be in both of them. They need to match the theme of the categories we have now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
same here.  I don't care for the categories.   I know there's something on the front page about newest uploads... but somedays there's more uploads than are listed on that.  <br />
<br />
It was much easier to go to complete sets, and just see at a glance what the newest uploads were.</div></div><hr />

Sorry guys. I'm sure you'll get used to it.... I hope. :)<br />
I'll see how difficult it would be to add a &quot;list all&quot; button for the complete sets. <br />
<br />
These categories not only makes it easier for most people finding what they want it also makes it easier for us to keep things up to date. Once we figure out what we want to do with the out of date interfaces we will start pruning. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to generally sort them by most downloaded and go through them like that, but now I have to go into 10 different categories to have a look see, which is somewhat annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xikanir</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A sub-section for wrap-around UI's would be nice (Kinda like Xymarra's - I know that one is in Featured though, but same sort of thing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greblokmm</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I second having them seperated by resolution also. Takes alot of looking for ones that will work on the 3 computers at my house. One comp uses 800X600 one uses 1024x768 and the other one 1600x1200.</div></div><hr />
