They came about through my continued playing of warcraft 3 and the like of the gauges they used, so i made my own. These are graphic mods basically, the xml files were included to maintain continuality with the windows.<br />
<br />
Blue is humans, Green is nightelves, orcs and undead arn't quite finished yet.<br />

<br />
Standard XML mods should interact fine with these, just some words of warning, the guages are larger than standard 14 heigh, and the boarders in the inventory are actually seperate graphics.<br />

If that's too much work, just stickin the xp bars in the PW would be great.</div></div><hr />

Ive been using your UI and its just great. Very visually pleasing.<br />
But like legion i was hoping to have the exp on player window too, so i downloaded your edited playerwindow and replaced it in the folder. However it caused the UI not to load. To make sure it was that file, I reopened the first post .zips and just placed that playerwindow.xml back in the folder and it loaded fine.<br />
I saw that a few folks loaded already so im not sure if im the only one havng the problem.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Thanks Luminea, i'm happy that you're enjoying my mod.<br />
About the player window, sorry for the confusion but the edited playerwindow that i attached was for the Mortis player window mod, to get it to work with mine you'll also need the other files from his mod.<br />

LiamLee i've never thought of using the casting gauge in the player window, i'll see about making another playerwindow mod when i've finished Red &amp; Purple Q.<br />
