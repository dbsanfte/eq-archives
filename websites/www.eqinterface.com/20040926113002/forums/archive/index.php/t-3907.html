I had assumed the border was tiled and not stretched.<br />
<br />
What I began to wonder is: what is tiled in the UI and what is stretched?<br />
<br />
We know the backgrounds are tiles, and now I know the borders are stretched, but what about scroll bars and other images?<br />
<br />
As a side, I think it would have been simpler had all textures been tiled instead of a mix of stretching and tiling.  Definately would make for some easy mods.  But this is VI, they don't wanna make thing too easy for us ;p  heh heh</div></div><hr />

For scrollbars (from personal experience anyway):<br />
<br />
The &quot;thumb&quot; of the scrollbar (the moveable bar) is defined with a FrameTemplate. The Middle parameter is stretched, while the other parameters (usually Left/Right or Top/Bottom depending on H or V scrollbar) act as endcaps for the middle image, and are shown as-is, unstretched.</div></div><hr />
