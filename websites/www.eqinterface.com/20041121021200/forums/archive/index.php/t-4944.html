<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nanan</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After messing around with my UI and doing alot of customizations and touchups Iv run across a few problems with strange offsets or inacurate displays on some objects and items.<br />
<br />
My first issue is with the WTD inner borders, it seems that the bottom left corner is offset incorrectly. I have tryed to fix this by changing the location the animation file looks for the window piece but this does not solve the prob. It seems that there are a few issues with this in the UI and well Im confused and out of ideas. <br />
<br />
Any input as to how to fix these offsets would be a big help. Ill attach the windows pieces1, animations.xml, and a screen shot of what Im talking about.</div></div><hr />

The screwy edge on the windows tab is due to an oops of 9 pixles to the right, once corrected it alowed me to see the other errors. Same thing with the wtd inner pieces, i guess the guy who did the UI animations xml didnt proof his work very well, after going through the file I found about 15 errors. <br />
<br />
Still cant figure out why the background of the window is bleading through the inventory buttons tho, its like a mistery.</div></div><hr />

After altering the alpha with photoshop the problem has been corrected.</div></div><hr />
