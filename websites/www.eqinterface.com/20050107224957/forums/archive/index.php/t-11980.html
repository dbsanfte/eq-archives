Okay, start a Vah Shir Bard.  Go do citizenship quest.  Guy tells me to go find 3 Scorp Shells.  So I go out for about two hours, Level 4 now and have 3 scorp shells.  Then he say go get 4 Grimling Skelly Femurs and crush them, make them into a bowl, and give the bowl to him.  Soo, go out to the pit, kill about 50 Grimling Skeletons, finnaly get 4 bones.  Then I spend 3 hours getting my pottery skill to 26.  Try the combine.  Nope.  Nada.  I was like, Okay I'll just go kill more.  Reach lvl 6, absolutey NO Grimling Skeletons. I killed about 50 Decaying ones.  Then I got mad. <br />

Is the point of these quests to piss us off?<br />
<br />
simple solutions that Verant could, but wont do:<br />
-Make correct monsters spawn more times.<br />
-Make items drop more times.<br />
-Give Vah Shir Tracking<br />
-Make recipes no-fail<br />
<br />
Rants over.  If you've read this far, go get yourself a cookie.</div></div><hr />

Sorry had to do it. :)<br />

I think quests in general need to be re-tooled with better stories. There are a few that have great stories but it seems most are just thrown together just to get an item with no story.</div></div><hr />

One of my alts is a Vah Bstie.  I know starting off on these skills can be tough.  Best thing is work on the skill you need a bit til it becomes trivial.  Until they make the tradeskill changes its a suck it up kind of situation.</div></div><hr />

Lol, been a couple years since I've played so I'm a bit behind.<br />

As for the new tradeskill thing.  If it's going to be as the said it was, I think prices are going to go way down. Except for spiderling silk, which will go up.  That's when I'm proud to be a farmer:D .</div></div><hr />
