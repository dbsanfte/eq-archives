<br />
it happens as soon as i enter the world<br />
<br />
i am running NO UI, the guys at EQlive had me uninstall that first and it didnt solve the problem<br />
<br />
they said i may have a memory leak, but after taking my PC to a shop the guys there said my system was running fine<br />
<br />
i replaced my vid card with a 5700 ultra geforce fx...still getting crashes<br />
i got and ran adaware/spybot and several other spyware programs and still got crashes<br />
got a firewall and installed it and still got crashes<br />
<br />
right now i'm open to any suggestions you guys have....<br />
thx<br />
<br />
edit..i was running the infinium UI before the crashes started....every thing was working fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">check your EQClient.ini make sure it has UIFiles= set to UIFiles=default even if your character is using the default it could be loading pieces from somewhere if the EQClient want to load a custom UI..<br />
<br />
Also what OS (windows XP, 98, etc) are you using.<br />
<br />
and did you try a fresh install of EQ?<br />
<br />
what driver for your video card? try the lastest beta driver (yes, sometimes the beta driver works the best) from www.guru3d.com<br />
<br />
start with those.. we see what we can do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have the latest driver for my vid card installed on the suggestion from someone over at EQlive<br />
<br />
and i have installed/uninstalled EQ twice now<br />
i have a clean install up now<br />
<br />
<br />
as for the UIfiles=default issue...i have a line that says UIskins=default...is that what you mean?<br />
there is no &quot;UIfiles=deault&quot; in my eqclient.ini at all</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, UISkins... (silly programers call the folder Files, but Skins in INI)<br />
<br />
which version of the Drivers for your video card, did you get a beta or certified.. (also where did you download it from)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaakarot Saiyaj</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nvidia driver version 53.03<br />
downloaded it from the support page at eqlive.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balsalt</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got same error on old box after the 12/18 patch...noticed it was occuring earlier than when trying to log onto test.<br />
<br />
I set my video down from 32 bit to 16 bit, and set windowed mode = false in the eqclint file and it started working again.  32 bit is now beyond the reach of that card in EQ.<br />
<br />
The card is a VooDoo 5500 running on Amigamerlin drivers, so I don't claim it to be the same problem as yours, just offering another possible work around in diagnosing it.</div></div><hr />

nvidia driver version 53.03<br />
downloaded it from the support page at eqlive.com  <br />
<br />
guru3d has a 53.30 driver for that card... You should be able to download it via THIS LINK (http://download.guru3d.com/pafiledb.php?action=file&amp;id=714)<br />
<br />
See if that has any effect. <br />
<br />
I am still investigating further ideas.<br />
<br />
<br />
53.03 is &quot;WHQL certified my microsoft&quot;<br />
<br />
53.30 is a beta, which means you will get &quot;this is not certified&quot; message.. click &quot;install anyway&quot;<br />
<br />
53.30 is dated 12/19/03 sooo its after the patch, there for it could contain the correction you need.. (no promises though)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gotten message that the 52.70 driver released right before the 53.03 had really good results.. soooo that version can be found Here (http://download.guru3d.com/pafiledb.php?action=file&amp;id=701) at Guru3d.com <br />
<br />
might Try the older version (52.70) first to see if that helps at all..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaakarot Saiyaj</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">went back to an older version of my vid card driver as well as the beta version and also lowered my video down from 32 bit to 16 bit and am still getting client crashes<br />
<br />
any other ideas??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onetwo1212</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had simaliar problems in the past.  My fixes were:<br />
<br />
Deleted all ini files<br />
Ran docmem and found I have a memory leak Can be found HERE (http://www.simmtester.com/PAGE/products/doc/docinfo.asp) I had this problem after installing new ram.  After taking the ram back the technitions at the computer store just pluged it into a mobo and said it was fine.  Maybe this is what your computer store did.  The leak would only happen when precise data was written in the right order to the ram.<br />
Added a cooling fan(this only helped when the computer had been used intensivly for a while before playing)<br />
Uninstalled Lucin graphics<br />
Deleted all files associated with the zone the char I was trying to log on was in.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure you have tried some of these, but maybe someone else can come up with ideas.</div></div><hr />

Any files with your character names in them, and had them update themselves. After that, i was able to get back into eq np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nazrin</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try actually re-installing DirectX I know that might sound funny but sometimes after installing new drivers DirectX does some weird things.<br />
<br />
I pretty much re-install directX now everytime I install a new driver just to save the hassles.<br />
<br />
Cheers <br />
