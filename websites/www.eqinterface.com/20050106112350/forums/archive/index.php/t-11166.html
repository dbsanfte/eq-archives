<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As many of you are aware, I am Canadian.  The date is November 11th.  It is just past the 11th hour in my time zone.<br />
<br />
On this day in Canada we observe Rememberance Day.  The US calls it Veterns Day.  Other countries observe it also, under whatever name.<br />
<br />
Originally it was called Armistice Day in honor of the armistice that brought World War I to a close on this date in 1918.<br />
<br />
Whatever country you are in, whatever name you call it … on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, please pause for a moment of silence.   Remember and give thanks  - To all those that fought and died, in any war.  To those that survived but gave so much and lost so many.  And to those who continue to serve in whatever capacity to ensure our continued freedoms.<br />
