<br />
This is the Release of the LadUI.<br />
<br />
Custom windows.<br />
<br />
BankWnd and BigBandWnd has been slightly modified. Credit to Kudane for this modification.<br />
<br />
BookWindow has been slightly modified. Credit to Kudane for this modification<br />
<br />
CastSpellWnd has been changed to two rows of four with the book button in the middle and the inventory bags atop the gems. This gives easy access from the gems to the hotbuttons, and from the inventory bags to the inventory slots above them. Credit to Ladred for this modification.<br />
<br />
ChatWindow has been slightly modified. I only took out the title bars and the frame around the chat windows. Credit to Ladred for this modification.<br />
<br />
CompassWnd has been heavily modified. Moved the compass to the right hand side of this window. Exp and AA exp bards follow to the left. Stats next, and finished off with hp, sta, mana, breath bars to the far left hand side. Since I moved the actual compass to dynamic zone indicator line shows up over the hp,sta, mana, breath bars instead of the compass. Won't take you long to find out that the direction to the zone is at about 25% of those bars. Credit to Ladred for this Modification<br />
<br />
ConfirmationDialog, Container, GiveWnd, InspecWnd, LootWnd, MerchantWnd, TradWnd, Inventory all have minor modification to allow for easy clicking and moving of items from one place to another. Credit Kudane for these modifications.<br />
<br />
GroupWnd is laid out from 2 to 6 on the far left hand side of the screen. This is easy to watch and select people with the 'F' buttons if you are a healer. Credit Ladred and Kudane for this modification.<br />
<br />
HotButtonWnd is set at the bottom of the screen just under the castspell window. There is a 5 minute timer above the hotbuttons and weight stats at the bottom. Credit Ladred and Kudane for this modification.<br />
<br />
PlayerWindow is centralized in the middle of the screen and has only your inventory slots in it. It also lights up when attack is on. Credit Ladred for this Modification.<br />
<br />
ShortDurationBuffWindow and BuffWindow are both lined atop the screen with the names underneath them. Credit Drakah for this modification.<br />
<br />
TargetWindow have large bar for the HP, Target HP, and Mana. These are divided in 8ths for nukers and healers as each two lines are 25%, 50%, and 75%. Credit Ladred for this modification.<br />
<br />
The Target Indicator is in dedication to the fine people over at Township Rebellion. You can easily customize it with your guilds name by changing the .tga file, or find a suitible one for you here at EQGui.com.<br />
