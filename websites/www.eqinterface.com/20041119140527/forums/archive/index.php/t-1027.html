<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently using a self-modified version of Mafoo's Group Window:<br />
<br />
http://snmbarham.tripod.com/EQ/mafoogroupwindow  http://snmbarham.tripod.com/EQ/mygroupwindow<br />
<br />
But I'm having a very strange problem.  I've (obviously) made a few edits to the window to suit my purposes, and I can still make edits (I moved the self-name today).  But it's not saving all the changes I make now.  In the same sitting that I moved my name, I also changed the EQType for the Self Pet HP% (it was set on 0, I changed it to 69... found on this board somewhere that it was the appropriate EQType), and I moved the %'s associated with each pet to the right by one, as well as lengthened the window and added in the invite/disband.  I load up EQ and the only difference I see is my name is now more properly centered.  So, I go back into the file and everything I saved (hitting Save after EACH edit) has reverted back to what it was.  The reason I saved after each edit is because I had already made all the changes once, except the name, loaded and got nothing... so I thought maybe I'd forgotten to save, but I didn't see how.  The second time, I made sure I saved.<br />
<br />
No, I did not get an error (no errors in my UIErrors file).  Nor did it try to load the default instead.  As I said - it actually kept the name Location CX change... just not all the others.  I'm going to pull my hair out.  Can anyone explain to me WHY it did this?!?  If there's a logical reason, so be it... but I see none.  Especially since I've made all the other changes with no problems.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

What XML editor are you using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using XMLwriter that I downloaded from EQToolbox.  I've made adjustments to several other files over the past couple of days... completely revamped Mafoo's Player Window (sorry Mafoo, I just liked my idea better... hehe) with absolutely no problems... As well as re-creating a couple of the default windows to fit me, I don't understand why it's just this one file - and why all the other changes I've done have taken... but ones I did at the same time (never even closed the file between edits, just scrolled on down) don't take.  /sigh.  I swear my computer is sentient and loves having a snicker at my expense. :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ForinIronshield</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know why its doing it, but here are my suspects:<br />
<br />
1) Windows caching utility (you just thought you had changed it, Windows is using an older copy loaded into the file cache).  Unfortunately, I don't know if there is a convenient command to force the file cache to reload.<br />
<br />
2) EQgame.exe caching utility (you just thought you had changed it, Windows is using an older copy loaded into its file cache - aka the texture cache.  I've been suspecting that a lot of stuff other than textures is getting dropped into that cache).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you say makes sense.  <br />
<br />
Except that:<br />
<br />
1) My name moved about 9 pixels left (yes, I over-compensated, although I do have it centered pretty close to perfect now)<br />
<br />
2) When I logged back off and pulled the file up, my CX Location for the name was changed to the value I gave it at the same time I changed all the other values - the ones that did not hold.<br />
<br />
If those 2 things had not happened then I'd say you're absolutely right.  But to me it just doesn't fit.  /sigh<br />
<br />
I thank you for your help, tho!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koplal</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed similar problems. I'll make edits to the window and only half of them will take hold but when i open the file the changes are still there. That's something to do with the cache i think not sure but it sucks. Now your problem i don't know if its the same problem or not but i found if i removed teh default folder from uifiles it loads properly. Dunno if it helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never did find out what the problem was.  I'm sure I'll never know why after a full save, a file would discard 90% of what I saved and just keep what it felt like.  /sigh<br />
<br />
But I did finally get the window adjusted.  I did it in small increments, tho.  Adjust one type of thing, save, load, see that it saved.... adjust another, etc.  AND I got the EQType to work.  I don't know if it's placement within the code can cause a problem, but I moved it from between the &lt;/size&gt; and &lt;textcolor&gt; (where you'd normally insert &lt;text&gt;&lt;/text&gt;) to right below the screen id.  It's all working now.... least - it works when I'm solo - haven't tried grouping yet.  hehe<br />
<br />
Thanks for trying to help me, ForinIronShield &amp; Koplal.  Much appreciated.  :)<br />
