8\25\04 Official Update (http://home.comcast.net/~centhena/8.25.04update.zip)<br />

I have only one thing to say to SoE<br />

NEENER NEENER NEENER !!!<br />

MUAHAHAHAHA!!!! You sadist bastages I have conquered the impossible! <br />

<br />
*giggle* Sorry I had to gloat just a little (ok so that was more than a little)! This stupid window took me a week and a half. I had to reinvent the way I look as xml. I learned several things that I didn't know before. I had to redo the whole damned thing 3 times and finally after much headaches, cursing, and missed /tells It's here. I give you......<br />
<br />
The New Container Mod *super cheezy anouncer voice with echo*<br />
<br />
Here's some screenies.<br />
<br />

Tradskill Bag (not to be confused with the tradeskill window this is for the experiments)<br />

Remove - There is also Insert and Delete but it won't let me post that many images the buttons for them look just like this remove button except of course they say insert and delete. I did up these buttons myself so they're not as great as the Done and Combine ones but I tried.<br />
<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~centhena/remove.jpg<br />
<br />
Disabled - I really couldn't see the point of having a button show up if one couldn't be used<br />
<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~centhena/disabled.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
I worked really really hard on this. I've never ever had a mod take more than a day maybe 2 max and I had to bend the rules a bit to get it to work but it works perfectly in my game. I really hope you have the same good results. This window has only been tested at 1024x768 i have no idea what it will do in other resolutions. Lemme know if you like it. I sure hope you do. Also please let me know if you have any problems with it so I can fix them. The best part about this window though is that it's standalone. It does NOT require my ui to work. :o) So now people that don't even use my UI will be able to use this one. I'm going to submit it on it's own as well.<br />
<br />
There was also a 1 pixel error in the inventory window causing this really annoying little white line at the bottom it has been removed. you can find the corrected files in the update as well.<br />
<br />
I'm putting everything on hold for a few the container has really exausted me for the moment on all this. I'm gonna go work on leadership and get the target rings for the marked npc's next. Perhaps when I finish that i'll be ready for more alternatives. I'll keep up with patches though if they change something AGAIN.<br />

<br />
Well something's up with my ISP and all my links point there that aren't housed on EQInterface. I'll get the main body of the UI zip file updated and posted here tomarrow or at least that's my plan. That way if the stupid isp hasn't figured out what's wrong and fixed it at least you'll be able to get the updates even if you have to reinstall the ui.<br />

<br />
Welll Here's the patch i've been promising all week sorry it took me so long to get it put up but at least it's here now. This patch has the following features listed.<br />
<br />
New Windows<br />
<br />
PVPMerchant<br />
PVPStats<br />
PVPLeadership<br />
<br />
Updated Windows<br />
<br />
Raid Window<br />
Adventure Merchant<br />
Options Window<br />
DynamicZone Window<br />
Ticket Window - redid it just in case<br />
Inventory - Conjoined the graphic and resplit them to suit my fancy and enable me to edit them better. So this comes with all new .tga's called centkinventory0x.tga your old tkinventory0x.tga's are not useless and can be deleted though they don't have to be. In this window I have added the mana and endurance numbers to the player info section. This required me to elongate the window by 24 pixels hence the need for the graphic rework. Just a lot of fancy cut and paste work really. Coding for it was a bit wonky no idea why but it works so that's all that really matters. If for some reason anyone gets an error or has a problem with this window let me know righ away and i'll retool it.<br />
<br />
Changed Windows<br />
<br />
I've removed the tradeskill window as i found one i like much better Axeion strikes again he really does put out some beautiful t.king mods. I've decided to add this one to my ui as well you can find a link to it on page 8 of this thread in a post from fireheart.<br />
<br />
Welp that's all i've put in the patch the stupid container will have to wait for now but i'll get it up soon as i can get it done i know you all are as anxious to have a working container mod as I am so i'll get it up pronto when i've got it working. Damn them for not making the augment sealer a seperate window like the tradeskill one. As for everything else well I&quot;ll get to that when the stupid container works again. Anyway here's the link.<br />

I'm BAAAACK! hehe Since there was a patch the other day I figured it'd be a great time to get caught up on the ui. The main ui file is updated and currently in moderation. So i have a nice little update for ya :o) you can get it here.<br />
<br />
5/27/04 Official Update (http://home.comcast.net/~centhena/5.27.04update.zip)<br />
<br />
Here's what you'll find in this update.<br />
<br />
New Windows<br />
<br />
TicketWindow<br />
TicketCommentWindow<br />
HelpWindow - never before included due to it's prior total lack of purpose.<br />
<br />
Updated Windows<br />
<br />
Options<br />
BazaarSearch<br />
BigBank<br />
GuildMgmt<br />
Targetoftarget - I had to make this oen sizable to get it the way i wanted it<br />
LargeDialogWindow -  No idea what this is. I couldn't pull it up so i just tinkered with the code hope it works.<br />
<br />
Changed Windows<br />
<br />
Give/Loot Windows - found these and i really like them so i scrapped mine and added these. Here's the page for it there's a screenshot there of course. You should also check out his other mods they're really nice.<br />
<br />
Give &amp; Trade Windows (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3202)<br />
<br />
PlayerWindow - I don't know about you but I'm really sick of pressing L to check on my leadership exp so....I added the group leadership exp bar to this one. I didn't bother with the raid leadership exp because most people aren't constantly leading raids even they're always raiding. There is no percent code for it yet when there is I'll add it. But in the mean time here's a screenshot :o)<br />
<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~centhena/player.jpg<br />
<br />
FixedWindows<br />
<br />
Inventory - well there seemed to be an issue with the class animations showing properly I knew it couldn't be the animations file cause they were working they were just behind the inventory window instead of on top so i removed a bit of code and took out the inv_portrait.tga and it works fine now. note: you don't need to delete the tga to make it work but you don't need it anymore.<br />
<br />
Target Indicator<br />
<br />
Ok there's a whole lot that I wanna say about this one so here goes. :o)<br />
<br />
Last patch I added the one of Raxthorne's target rings. Well for some reason it went kaput. Well not completey kaput but it developed the horrible blinky thing. So i decided to educate myself on target rings and poured over the ini and looked at all the graphic files and couldn't figure out what was wrong. So I thought to my self that maybe i should just find another one that i like so I started looking here in the three-d ring section and I found one that i liked but not more than the raxthorn on Sooo I decided to keep trying to fix it.  On furthur research i found out that for an animated tartet ring you have to name the first file in the animation name0.tga not name.tga. When the game didn't fine name0.tga it put a blank one in it's place hence the blinky thing. So i renamed the first file and tada works fine :o) But now I have this other target ring also so what do I do with it. then it hit me when i was looking at the ini there is more than one target ring. I decided to use the other one i found for the deletaged main assist target ring since i don't like the one that poped up once i fixed the main one.<br />
<br />
For those who have no idea what that is here's an explination. Delegate Main Assist is a GoD Leadership ability that allows you to assign the job of main assist to a specific person in your group. This has several graphical benefits. First you get little arrows around the main assist's targeted mob's name. If the group leader has earned the abilities you can also see a health percentage by the name as well as a number indicating the order in which the mobs are to be killed. The last thing it does is creat an additional target ring around what ever the main assist has targeted to be a large visual aid of what everyone's supposed to be attacking. This of course is changable :o)<br />
<br />
So I decided to change the Assist Target Indicator :o) but the thing is that when the main assist is targeting something they see not only theer assist indicator but also the main indicator and so does everyone who has the main assist's target targeted. So it had to be something that looked nice with the Raxthorn indicator. Then I thought of the one I'd found while I was looking for a replacement :o) I'm quite pleased with the result. Now keep in mind that the raxthorn one changes color depending on the con of the mob targeted whether or not it is the main assist's target but the assist target indicator is only in white and gold. So without further adue here are the screenies :o)<br />
<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~centhena/splittarget.jpg<br />
<br />
The names have been smudged to protect the innocent. The one on the left is the raxthorn one and willl show up all of the time as the standard target ring. It will change color depending on the con of the target. The one on the right is the assist indicator it never changes color. Both are animated and spin :o) But what do they look like together? :o)<br />
<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~centhena/combinedtarget.jpg<br />
<br />
tada! pretty isn't it :o) even with color'd cons which i couldn't find any it's pretty and a great magical celtic feel. I hope you guys like it :o)<br />
<br />
You can find the origional target ring that I took this from at the following link.<br />
<br />
Celtic Circle (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2981)<br />
<br />
Ok now that all that is taken care of. I want to let you know what my plans are for the ui however slowly i accomplish them hehe. Ok first off I want to make a 4 button version of my celtic combat windows stand alone mod. I do not have any plans of making one with out clicky slots. If there is a high enough demand I may rethink this though. I am planning on trying to fit prmary secondary and range on there for melee switches but i don't know if i'll be able to fit it i may have to shrink them a bit but we'll see. The other thing I want to do is to resize this ui to make it more userfriendly for tighter resolutions. it's very very hard to read at the really high resolutions. Sedanni I still haven't forgotten you I just haven't gotten around to picking the project back up but i haven't given up I will work on it.<br />
<br />
I also wanted to take just a minute to thank everyone on Veeshan who has sent me /tells or come up to me to tell me that they use this ui and how much they like it. It gives me warm fuzzys and makes me feel all spiffy, special, and important and don't we all need a little of that every now and then. Thanks guys!<br />
<br />
Centhena<br />
<br />
PS. everything between today and what's posted below was removed because the silly thing said i had too many images doubt you'll need the info that much anyway<br />
<br />
<br />
***********************<br />
<br />
Ok the main body of the UI is hosted here. I repack the UI with all the updates and all the new windows generally every patch and zip it up all nice and such. The link for it is below.<br />
<br />
Centhena's T. King\Drakah UI v1.1.zip (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=2568)<br />
<br />
Since they only take screenshots up to 300kb i had to shrink it down alot so a clear 100% sized screenshot can be found below. <br />
<br />
Screenshot (http://home.comcast.net/~centhena/centhenaui.jpg)<br />
<br />
This screenshot is however outdated but you can still get the idea of what the UI looks like.<br />
<br />
The most notable change in this version is that I've had to remove all the class animations files to make it small enough to upload. So to solve that problem I've made a patch for the ui to add all the class animations. Now the patch file was too big to host here so I'm hosting it myself and you can find that below. This file will add ALL T. King Class Animations to date and will be the file that I will update with new animations as they come out. To install it simply unzip into your ui directory and allow the animations file to overwrite. Please keep in mind that this UI was made with the intentions of using these class animations. If you do not use this patch you will most likely NOT have any animations for the classes that have already been done to date. It is also important to mention that this patch file is only intended for use with this UI. It will most likely screw up any other ui you try to use it with because it has all the edits for this ui included in the animations file that comes in the patch.<br />
<br />
Centhena's UI T. King Class Animations Patch.zip (http://home.comcast.net/~centhena/ClassAnimationsPatch.zip)<br />
<br />
I've repacked all the smaller windows that were requested into one file and posted it in the Downloads sections here. You can find it here.<br />
<br />
 Smaller Window Options (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2569)<br />
<br />
I also put together a zip of all the alternate windows I created as well as were sent to me by others. You can find this nifty zip here.<br />
<br />
Alternate Window Options (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3048)<br />
<br />
As always I take no credit for any of the artwork included in this UI. All the work I've done had been in the coding and piecing together of the different mods. All credit for the artwork go to T. King with some edits by Drakah. The majority of the credit for the elaborate coding goes to T. King Drakah &amp; Remelio who coded some of the windows included here before I ever got to them. Great job guys!<br />
<br />
Anyway I hope you like my UI and to those who already use it I hope this make things easier. If you have any questions, comments, requests, or problems please post them here.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Questions;<br />
1. Is it mix and match. I like my compass and target cum clicky bar etc but most of the rest would do nicely.<br />
<br />
2. Is it scaleable to fit 1600 by 1200 with a black bit of 1600 by 300. Can't remember the terminology. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
3. Is it possible to add a health, mana, XP ,AA, pet health for each party member and sta bar to the group window as I and many others like these up front.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quiblles I know but very well thought out and executed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moniqa</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a wonderful UI, first time I've changed UI's in over 6 months!<br />
<br />
As a fellow cleric I also would like the group window with all members (including self) and separate pet health bars... tends to make my life much easier as well as my job.<br />
<br />
The only other suggestion I could possibly think of would be smaller bags and merchant windows... I have these in another UI, but I lose the pretty artwork you have on the ones included if I install them.  Kinda messes up the flow off this UI so I'm going to try and adjust for now.  The mini's are very cool for those of us who are still operating 17inch monitors or smaller.  I could email them to you when you have time to look at them and see if you would want to integrate them into this UI... or a modified version2, you would love them I know!  Wish I knew how to do this stuff instead of asking for changes... :rolleyes:  Short of those two minor things, it's perfect for me!<br />
<br />
The containers I have been using I downloaded from here... Condensed_Claritin_Container is the name, and the merchant window I have been using is... everymerchant... also downloaded from here.<br />
<br />
I will be checking back on this UI regularly for future updates... I love it!  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moniqa</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correction, I downloaded the container and merchant windows from eqinterface.com<br />

Sorry about the misinformation....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't mind taking requests as long as I don't get too swamped with them. Moniqa check for a pm from me. I will be working on the group window first as it was the first request but fixing up the other windows for you is really no problem. Also as they are released to the public I intend to update the animations file with the newest class animations from T. King. Just please keep in mind that I'm a full time mommy of 4 so my time can get rather lmited.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But.... (there's always a but isn't there?) there's just some things I'd note.  The container window looks a little odd with some border thats cut off.  And I myself am more used to the traditional merchant window and loot window... I could just use the original ones but.... yours have that neat little border.<br />
<br />
I would download it and test it out as soon as possible, but as I'm typing this I don't have time to wait for it to download (darn 56k)  I'll get to it as soon as I can to post some more notes if I have any</div></div><hr />

But it is not my origional work it is Remelio's. So I'm gonna ask him if he minds if i do it up a bit.

After that i&quot;ll move on to the other requests as they are recieved in order.  I will take most requests.  About the only thing i have no intentions of doing are container windows. I will be making up a smaller version of the container window that I have recently added to this post as an update it will be in my small windows folder when I release version 2 which will include any T.King animations to date that are not as of yet included and an options folder with choices of windows that have been requested and modified. Along with the modified windows there will be screenshots of the window available in the options window so you can see what you're getting before you put it in there. All windows however will be available for DL through this forum as they become available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I saw in the screen shot, says &quot;Added Celtic Fillagree and Scrollbar Chain to all standard windows, what if I just want to use this part of your UI?  How would I be able to just use these parts?  and Would I be able to use just these parts? Thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well the ui is intended to be disected and you can take pretty much any window out of it as long as you have the animations and textures files in your ui they will function independantly. for the chain in the scroll bar you only need the texture file it will change all of the slider bars to the chain.<br />
<br />
as for the celtic border... in eq there are windows that are sizable and ones that are not. the ones that are sizable are easy you just change the texture of the border it auto sizes it and you have a prefect window. unfortunatly this is not the case the majority of the time. I have gone through and recoded EVERY window with the exception of the help and tips window by hand. The only ones I haven't changed are the ones that I got from T. King himself or from Drakah and Remelio. It's not a skin you can just plop in and poof you have borders. It's hard coded into the windows themselves.<br />
<br />
I would recomend taking the windows you like or that are similar to what you use now and switching to them if you want the border. I am taking requests for certain modifications to other style windows ie smaller merchant window and the like. As long as the requests remain reasonable I intend to continue to take requests and will post the end result here when it's completed. If you have a request for a specific window to have the border around it post me a link and I'll do it up for you. I don't mind multiple requests as long as it doesn't start getting ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I have no problem loading UI's on Windows XP but my old computer runs Windows ME (*Gags*)  and it refuses to load a new UI. Oddly enough it will load the spell icons though.<br />

So whatever is causing your problem could be multiple culprits.</div></div><hr />

I know for sure that it works with XP pro and 98 SE hehe and I have tested it on both. Are you running any other mods? Sometimes one mod can crash the WHOLE ui. If you are using Drakah's chat window as is it will crash the ui you need to replace it with the one I modified for compatibility. The animations additions in the xml for the chat window are now in the animations file. Using the chat window found on Drakah's site will cause duplication of the animations and will crash the ui. Any animations used must be unique if they are to be included in the xml itself any multiple uses of an animation or texture must be added to the animations file. Any duplication will cause a crashing of the entire ui. since the textures I used for the ui are from the chat window the origional chat window is not compatible with this ui the one included with the zip file posted here must be used with this ui. sorry if i repeated myself or rambled a bit I was just trying to make it as clear as possible. If you have any further questions or need any further help please feel free to let me know and i'll be happy to see what I can do for you. If you still have problems please post a few specs about your system what expansions you have enabled and the like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remmy's Loot / Container Windows<br />
Buff window with the Blue/Red colors to show different Spells<br />
Kuvasi's Hotbutton Window (I use a grey one she did for my current ui)<br />
--------------------<br />
Do the Containers have to have the hot button stuff on top?</div></div><hr />

If so did you add them to the animations file in the zip file for this ui? Are the mods up to date with the latest changes to the ui? If you can post links to the mods here I'd be happy to take a look at them for you and see if i can get them to work make what ever adjustments are needed and post them up for you. If you don't have links send me a pm and we'll work something out. <br />
<br />
And yes Remelio did make a version of the container window without the swap slots on top but I did not include it in the ui nor did I modify it to have the side borders. However you can download it off the supporters forum on T.Kings site if you have access. It was never completed to Remelio's standards as it still has no side borders so it was never released to the public.<br />

<br />
[Line:1705 Source:UIFiles\tkingceltic\EQUI_MerchantWnd.xml] Couldn't find class:item 'WDT_Border' reference in FieldParseItemOfClass()<br />
<br />
btw, excellent work on all this.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: another question while I am at it.<br />
<br />
In the hotbar... it works great but I am having a very irritating thing happen.  When I set up my hotkeys the text wraps around to the second line.  Actually I keep all names short enough except my backstab key cannot be shortened any.  It looks like this<br />
<br />
    Backsta<br />
         b<br />
<br />
Which is very annoying and unprofessional looking.  Would you happen to know what (if anything) I can edit in the .xml to make it not wrap like that, I dont care if the text runs over the size of the button, it would look much better that way then it does now hehe... thanks a lot =) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">are you using the normal size merchant window or the shrunken one? Not that it should make any difference but it'd help me narrow down any possible problems if the following doesn't solve the problem.<br />
<br />
when adding the merchant window to your ui are you using the textures file included with this ui? unless you have modified the textures xml to work with your ui you should use the one included in this ui. The reason your ui isn't finding WDT_Border is because that's what I named the border texture that i added to the textures xml for easy usage otherwise each window would have to have a seperate WDT_something with details of what textures to use where so i made one that would encompass all and used it in most of the windows..... the same thing that the eq programers did with the default ui.  using my textures xml will also add the chain to the scroll bars. you also need to make sure that you have the graphics included of course the majority of the windows use the drakah_chatwindow.tga as the border graphic as that's the one I took the border from. if you want to add the textures to your own textures xml file you'll need to add the wtd_border section of my textures xml to your xml and that should solve your problem.<br />
<br />
As far as the wrap around for the hotbuttons. You know I've never even thought about it and it's never occured to me to even look at why it does that. Off the top of my head you could trying adding the line:<br />
<br />
&lt;AutoStretch&gt;true&lt;/AutoStretch&gt;<br />
<br />
No idea if it'll actually work but it's worth a try. I'll try to tinker around with it and see what I can do although I know there's no command to turn wordwrap on and off on the buttons it does it automaticly. You might also want to modify the size of the decal for the buttons make it slightly larger. Not sure if it'll work but heck what could it hurt.  In the meantime I'll see what I can conjure up for you. Keep in mind though I'm not a mage. :op</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, that download does not include a Textures.xml file (at least I didnt see one).<br />
<br />
Second, where do you suggest I insert the &lt;AutoStretch&gt;true&lt;/AutoStretch&gt; ?  I am still pretty new at this XML stuff hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, keep up the great work =)<br />
<br />
<br />
edit, its the mini merchant window I am trying to get to work =)<br />
<br />
<br />
edit again, do you mean the window_pieces01 file?  If so yeah I cant replace that window because I use Tking C2 Celtic mod and he uses that file name for his tectures as well.  Any way I could rename the file and edit some XML in the merchantwindow.xml file to make it point for that diff textures file?  If not could you make one to do that? I mean if you use Tkings art as a basis maybe it should be able to be added to other Tking UIs hehe, only makes sense =)  Thanks a ton for the answers again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the main zip file for this ui contains the textures file it's called EQUI_templates.xml sorry for the confusion I was calling it the by the wrong name hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
the auto stretch command if it works would go in each button segment of the xml most likely right after the &lt;font&gt;1&lt;/font&gt; line I haven't gotten a chance to play with it yet so i have no idea if it'll work</div></div><hr />

<br />
... still cant figure out how to make so the text on the hotbuttons dont break up like they do for me...<br />
<br />
...another thing, with your AA window... if you have AAs in the triple digits it kinda offhangs off the visable area... it cuts off part of the 3rd number? Also, the Train and Hotkey buttons have something wrong with the right side of their graphic.  Do you get the same problem?  If so would it be possible to fix it please?<br />

There is no file in this ui that you can take and insert in your ui and poof you have borders. I personally edited 95% of the windows in this ui myself to add the border and edit the windows so that the border didn't cut anything off of the actual windows. Everything was done &quot;by hand&quot; there is no quick fix that will resize all the non sizable windows so that the border doesn't take away from the window. At least to my knowledge. If i'm wrong please correct me. and the window pieces files don't have the borders. they are actualy taken from the drakah_chatwindow.tga file.</div></div><hr />

There were no errors at the time that I'm posting this.... I can't believe I actually more or less fixed this... lol<br />

I'm providing a link to download the entire UI here under a new file name of &quot;Centhena&quot; so that those who are busy, lazy or lost when it comes to this UI stuff can still enjoy Centhena's UI till she comes back and tweaks it.  <br />

Thanks for all the help on the bank window and error fixes!<br />

Also note that I use mini containers, so if you don't like mini's you will need to download Centhena's containers on the original post and replace them here, or you can get them out of the original UI, although I think she tweaked some and has the single download file for them.<br />

awesome Centhena!  Let me list a couple known issues I have with some of your mods so you can get em fixed while ya at it.. I may repeat some you know I just wanna make sure =)  Here goes:<br />
<br />
The AA window is still not wide enough... it cuts of the AA # if its triple digits. (FIXED this for myself, just letting you know tho)<br />
<br />
The EQUI_JournalNPCWnd didnt work at all.. and the posted fix didnt work for me (beting it was user error lol)<br />
<br />
For your containers, could you make a version that has no picture and no name on it? Just the slots, combine (at top), done (at bottom), border and the 4 little pri/sec/ammo/rng slots at the top (with about 5 pixels between the combine button and the slots... hate accidently taking items off when im clicking fast during tradeskills hehe.)  Just take out the picture and name of the container if you can plz, thanks!<br />
<br />
hmm, I thought there was more but its late and I cant think of it atm.. I'll post later if I find anything =)</div></div><hr />

I will get this fixes banged out and posted up I promise. Sorry it's taken so long. Oh and please do not ask me any questions on Horizons.

NO real signifigant changes atm. Just to make it a little easier to download and install with all the updates and options and such. I've also emailed the admin and requested permission to have this ui hosted despite it's size. Hopefully they'll approve it so I don't have to worry about comcast chaning my hosting address again so that I have to change all my links yet again. Broken links don't really help people. And I usually don't catch it for at least a couple days. Anyway just wanted to fill you guys in on the plan. Once I hear back from them I'll start a new thread for version 1.1 with the new links for where ever it ends up being hosted. In the mean time all the links should be working so everythign should be ok.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok well here's the deal. I really want to get this ui listed under my list but they aren't gonna host it as it is. The recomendation was that I remove all the class animations from the ui thus making it small enough to upload. Well I kinda like the idea that they're already available in this ui. So I'm thinking what i'll do is pull out all the tga's (graphic files) and make a patch for it as a seperate zip. This will require 2 downloads to have the whole ui as it is now but I think the benefits of having it hosted here is worth it. So I'm gonna have the UI as a whole minus the tga's for the class animations and then another zip file with another copy of the animations file and all the tga's for the class animations. This will also make it easier to update for the new animations as they come out with out having to update the whole ui. So V1.1 will not have class animations included but I will upload a class animations patch as well that will included the animations file updated with all the class animations. Hope that made sense hehe. <br />

I'd be more than happy to edit it for you to give it the nice borders. I'm not really in a position to do any extra coding work above and beyond up dates. I've decided to go back and resume work on the small container. This is about all I can manage right now as the containers are probably the hardest window to work with. The demand was so high though that I really feel it important to ge it out there and since there are no other containers like mine/Remelio's I figure I'm the only one that's gonna do it.<br />

I've actually taken real playing back up again. Hehe all this time I've been away from playing EQ and only been online to test and modify the ui. I've been doing too much RL. But since LDoN I've found a new love for the game and startd playing again. Hehe never know I might actually make 65 after all I mean I've only been playing for close to 4 years now hehehehe. So with playing, being 8 months pregnant and playing Mommy to 3 kids not to mention my husband *giggle* my time's a little short. <br />
<br />
Any changes you'd like though if you can find me a working XML I'll be happy to recode it to match the ui.<br />

I installed it today and it works perfectly.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarr Quikblade</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I was working on myself (and being a n00b at this still its taking some time as I learn) was to edit the Container window to have just the top border (with the close and minimize buttons on it) which would make the done button unneeded and able to be taken out completly.  Not to have any side or bottom borders (for those tradeskillers).  To take out the 4 small item slots at the top... not really finding a use for them at all.  Have a small (yet still large enough to easily click on) regular &quot;Combine Button,&quot; preferably at the top below the top border - and no graphic on the button, I would just prefer a default window button since the Celtic UIs default buttons look good.  To take out the title and the bag image completly (at least the title, possibly the container image would fit nicely under the combine button.)  And to finally make the whole thing smaller to take up less space.  Not sure how this would effect the tradeskill containers (such as brew barrel/oven/loom/forge) though.  Is this anything like you had in mind?<br />
<br />
<br />
btw great work and thanks for putting in the time to support the updates and requests... used a lot of it and edited much myself in order to learn.  Really enjoying it.  Keep it up though, you have a real talent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my plans for the container are prety much exactly like the container I have posted except that I will use 30x30 slots and possibly have another one where the 4 swap slots are removed. depending on what kind of success i have with that i may or may not make other varients since everyone seems to want something different. This will be a slow process as I am concentrating more on playing than I am on making containers. So it'll be mostly when I don't have enough time for an adventure and such. <br />
<br />
If you want to remove teh borders you can simply set the style border to false but leave the title bar true this will give you the top bar but the rest will not show set done button to loc and size 0,0 that way you don't get a compatibility issue the rest should just be a mathmatical adjustments to all the slots and image if you want to keep it and such to move them up and make them smaller.<br />
<br />
Anyway hope that's helpful good luck with your project.<br />

<br />
The only thing that I changed in the buff window from the origional default window was that I removed the text from the title. Because I wanted a clear sizable window that showed full sized icons basicly the default window faded to 0  without the title so it'd just have the pretty pictures and nothing else. I did the same for the songs window. I know this sounds silly but are you sure the window is open? have you tried alt b for the buff window? Do you have this problem with the default ui or any other ui? Do you get any kind of error messages about your xml not being compatible or the like? Have you installed the ui as is or have you made and changes? If you made changes what changes did you make? If you can answer a couple of these questions I'll see what I can do to get it working for you.<br />
<br />
CVamian <br />
the item text in inspect items are hard to see through the border, any way to change the text color? <br />
<br />
Yeah I was thinking about that the other day actually I just havn't gotten around to playing with it but I'm sure there's a way to fix it I just have to figure out how. I never really noticed before because I wasn't really playing much. But it annoy's me too so I'll get it done soon. Probably be one of those things I'll do when the container gives me fits and I need a break.<br />

My favorite alternative, so far, is the T. King Celtic v2 - with spell names ( Picture (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=2087) ).  The file is here ( File (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/download.php?s=&amp;id=2087) ).<br />
Surely, some melding of the two styles is possible, perhaps with large oval Gems, suspended from a half-frame of Drakah's great filigree?<br />
The other modification I'd love to see is in the Buff Window.  I like those vertical 15-slot ones, like ( This (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=50) ).  What would be Really cool is to mirror the Spell Bar described above, a half-frame of filigree cradling the column of small Icons, with the spell Names sticking out to the Left, sort of like ... Spell Name - o] ...<br />
Sadly, I can visualize this thing, but don't have the skills to create it... :( <br />

<br />
now the bad part, i downloaded it 11/6 late at night installed it yada yada all went fine. i died and tried to rez myself (problem 1) the accept rez box isnt big enough to show yes or no. so i can accept any rez's. (problem 2) while trying to /loadskin default so i could accept the rez, it twice crashed EQ. i cant even switch back to default size.<br />
<br />
and a few things you may look into adding. now about a small stat bar to show things like resists and wis, int, sta, crap like that.</div></div><hr />

However I am cleric and have Never ever had a problem rez'ing myself or recieving a rez from anyone else either. What resolution are you using? If you are having problems I'd suggest switching to default ui and then changing size and then reloading the ui. <br />
<br />
Have you modified any of the windows? Are you using the whole ui? Did you switch out any of the windows for others you liked better? What os are you running and at what resolution for both desktop and eq?<br />
<br />
If you can answer this questions for me I can try to find you a solution. <br />
<br />
As I have stated before as far as the group and player windows it is entirely too difficult to please everyone. The ones included in the ui file are the ones that I personally use. If you have one you like better that you would like me to modify to match the ui please post it here or send it to me or something and i'll see what i can do. I am a mother of 3 soon to be 4 here in like a week or so so I really don't have time to do all the recoding.<br />

I downloaded it earlier - before the patch - I had alot of trouble getting to load though.  I eventually cut and pasted everything into a different UI figuring I was somehow missing a file, too lazy to actually compare, and that did the trick.  <br />
<br />
Now I've redownloaded it because of the changes in the patch and this time I can't get it to work at all.  I assume that I'm doing something wrong since everyone else seems to not have any problems.  I unzip it into a folder with the same name as the zip file then go into EQ and load it from the options menu... I get the default skin every time.  <br />
<br />
Now I tend to download new skins at obscure hours of the morning and I'm not exactly sharp so if it's obvious no pointing fingers and laughing.  I'm using the ini file that I already have - I've not changed it from before.  Please help, thanks.<br />

Now however I have no targetting ring.  Not sure I want it anyway but for some reason you now have to be nearly on top of NPC's to see the names overhead and that's the only way to tell which is targetted.  I need to be able to be back a bit in some situations.  <br />
Could this be some other setting that I have - I haven't changed anything and my farclip is all the way up, spell particles and effects are turned on and I tried turning opacity all the way up but I got nothing.  Any help would be appreciated.<br />

If you modified anything or changed a file or added something different then i'll need to know what was done in order to figure out what went wrong. oh and just point of interest I NEVER use the loadskin feature in the options window it's notoriously buggy.... i use the /loadskin command  so loading it would look something like /loadskin centhena 1 the one being the variable required to keep all your windows in their current position anything else other than 1 and you'll get them all reset to default postions.<br />

Thanks, Centhena, you've made me a better person... *grin*<br />
<br />
However, ( You Knew there was going to be a 'however' in this, didn't you? ) I use a basically 'standard' window layout... just traditional about such things, I guess... and the Target Window looks a bit silly, sticking out from under my Group window.  It's the only odd-looking one in the bunch.<br />
I could go with the default Target window, but even modified with WDT-Border, it looks wrong...  Small and plain.  Any plans for an Alternate Target Window?<br />
<br />
How about one that follows the same size, art and style of the Player and Group windows?  It doesn't need yet Another graphic representation of the target's health...  No need for flashing/glowing green/blue/yellow/red animations, when I've already got a nice red bar and a %number.  What might be nice is a simple Dot or Square of color to show the Con-color, or just a modification of the existing outline, like you use already.<br />

Did ya see my post, asking about a horizontal hotbutton bar?<br />
<br />
Drakah said that it could be done, changing the colors, but you'd have to change them all, and it'd be too time consuming, check out the post under xml modify</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fireheart</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like Centhena's adaptation of Drakah's version of T.King's art- based GUI...  (Quite the list of 'begats' there!)  However, the Target window just looked Funny, with it's size, shape and scroll-work, hanging under the Group window in my traditional/standard window layout.  That Target window was clearly designed to sit in a central location, attached to a more Integrated window layout.<br />
I hunted through the EQGUI site, and saw many good-looking Target windows, but none that looked right, even after many hours of haphazard coding efforts, to try to get them to work.  Finally, I was mournfully looking through Drakah's UI samples and spotted it...  Could that be the elusive 'nearly perfect' Target window?  It was buried in another UI version, but perhaps I could extract and adapt it?  Yes I Could!<br />
<br />
So, here I offer my efforts for your perusal.  Please feel free to examine it, critique it, tear it apart and put it back together, fold, spindle, or mutilate it as you will.  Improve it, decry it, or validate it, I know it's still not 'perfect', but I'm not an elegant, practiced coder, like some of you.  In fact, Please improve it, if you can and I'll happily use Your version, instead.<br />

This is the perfect target window for those who really don't want to have it centered like I do. I keep mine mounted on top in the center of my chat windows so the one included works best for me. But this is a great mod to add to the options zip. I'll see what I can do. It looks like from the screenshot that it's not the same size as the group/player windows. I can try to shrink it down to make it match and become a little more stackable. I notice also that there's a little space between the border and the main body of the window. I think I can fix that as well to make the internal filigree blend better with the border. I'd also take out the window title. To me it really takes away from the border of the window and just isn't needed. I'll play with it and see what I can come up with.  Since I've made 65 FINALLY hehehe I have a little more time to play around with it.<br />
<br />
As far as the horizontal hotbutton window I'm not sure if I have the time to accomplish that before you'd give up on it *giggle* If you can find one that you like I can retool it for you though to match and fit. If you can't find one you like I'll see what I can do. <br />

My question is this..  I would love to have a buff bar that had the name of the spell, preferable a horizontal one but vertical would be better than none.  I have tried downloading various buff windows and every one crashes the UI.  Could someone point me to one that won't crash it or if you get the time, could you please create one?<br />

There have been a few different requests for this with text on one side or the other either horizontal or vertical. If you pick one out that you like and post it for me I will play with it and make it work for you. I'll then add it to the Alternate Window Zip file.<br />

I have only had one other person tell me they couldn't accept their rez so this problem has happened before but as i heard nothing further about it I dismissed it as a fluke. also what resolution are you running eq in and also your standard desktop resolution. have you added anything to the ui or are you using it as is? did you remove or edit anything?<br />

<br />
When using windows XP's unzip utility it automaticly (unless changed by the user) unzips the contents of the zip file into a folder with the same name as the zipfile. This will not work for UI files as the folder needs to be 1 word for it to work properly with EQ. Renaming the folder to something shorter will solve the problem in this instance. If this is not the problem you're having please let me know.<br />

I have heard 3 people say that they have had a problem with their rez box. I have never had this problem and the ui has over 4000 dl's and I've only had 3 people mention it. I have yet to find a way to duplicate this problem so that I can work on it. Killing myself is no big deal i'm a cleric I can rez my self all day for the little box and work on it but i never have a problem with the box. the only thing that I did to the box that pops up such messages  is to change the border from the default to the one i used for the ui. It was actually an extremely easy window to do since there's really not much to it. So all I can do is ask the standard questions and hope to get a responce. Neither of the other 2 who mentioned this problem reply'd back to my queries.<br />
<br />
1 What operating system are you running?<br />
<br />
2 Do you have all everquest expansions?<br />
<br />
3 What resolution are you running on your desktop?<br />
<br />
4 In what resolution are you running EQ?<br />
<br />
5 Does this happen to all confirmation messages or just your rez box?<br />
<br />
6 Has this happened more than once?<br />
<br />
7 Are you running the UI &quot;as is&quot; (nothing but the files contained in the available downloads provided by me) or have you added additional mods.<br />
<br />
8 If you have added other mods to they require modifications to either the animations or templates files?<br />
<br />
9 Are you using the most recent version of the UI? ( Most recent version was posted 2/11/04 most, most recent patch also made available 2/11/04 in the UI's thread)<br />
<br />
10 Does switching to default resolve your problem? (If not than it's probably not a problem with the UI.)<br />
<br />

P.S. If this post is indeed about my UI and I haven't misread it please post any further responces on this matter in that thread as i check it daily but might forget to check this. <br />

I had replaced your bazaar window with the Mortis one because I couldn't get your bazaar window to work, it would totally freeze my computer and i would have to reset it. Apparently this window modifies some animations and templates files, and isn't comaptible with your UI. Although I was using it before the patch with no problems. Anyway, my problem now is the bazaar window (trader window). I've always had to replace that file in the UI with someone else's, its no big deal though...I can go without the bazaar window being fixed. Thanks for your reply :). You really do a wonderful job on this UI, keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />

 I have had Centhenas UI on EQ now for about 4 days after having just checked it out. I was a BIG Infiniti fan, but after installing and playing with this one, I LOVE IT. I love the graphics, the artwork and the ease of use with it. You have asked for requests however, and I have a few, if and when you get time and can make it possible. I have seen all of the addaptions that I am looking for on other mods..but would really like to have the same graphics and &quot;feel&quot; that this one has. Ok..so here are my requests then...<br />
<br />
1.  A Stat window, showing the same stats as in the Inventory window, but smaller, like the same size of the character info window, and maybe with a tab to go directly to a mini inventory. I have seen this on another mod, cant think of name atm though. <br />
<br />
2.  Listing the spells beside the gems, but with the same graphics as the normal gem bar. <br />
<br />
3.  Perhaps a compact bank window, with catagories like Bazaar with 4 spots, Trade Skill items with like 3 spots, etc. Also seen this done on another mod, but would like the same graphics again:)<br />
<br />
Anyway, those are just a few of my personal requests. I only WISH I knew how to alter these myself, then I wouldnt have to ask anyone for this. But as stated, if not possible, thats ok, I love how the Mod works currently, I would only like these things fitted in. If you can do any of these, email me at darke1@earthlink.net and let me know. Thanks in advance.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya guys sorry I know I've been kinda MIA for a while. I've been spending alot of time researching ways to make a living from home at home. Some of you know, but most of you don't, that I moved cross country last year leaving just about everything I owned including my business. I decided to stay at home with the babies but come November my income will be cut off. Unfortunatly untill yesterday I hadn't had much luck but I think I've found what I what I've been looking for. This means that I won't need to spend as much time as I was trying to find something but I will be needing to spend time working. Dunno where that's gonna leave me as far as times goes since I still have to manage 4 kids at the same time. But I haven't given up. <br />
<br />
Yes I do plan to release a patch of anything and everything that is broken or missing. Yes I have more options to release that will be coming roughly around the same time. Just don't hold your breath. Please feel free to DL the updated t. king icons that will at that time added to this ui they should be drop and go no problems. I dont' want you guys stuck out there with crappy icons. <br />
<br />
I just need to have a day where I can work on it when someone isn't sick. It was a crazy winter if one of us wasn't sick just wait 2 weeks and if we're weren't all sick then at least 2 of us were.  Thank god spring is here. I haven't even really had a chance to play. Anyway you'll be hearing from me soon with more news on the updates. I'll try to get the needed updates out in the next week that way at least you have a whole ui even if you don't have all the new options.<br />
<br />
As for the screenshot. an ingame screenshot wouldn't hold even half of the windows as the one I have linked. it wouldn't show hardly any of the different windows. It does need to be updated though as somewindows have changed and other's are more relevant than what is currently shown.<br />
<br />
As for the cleric spoof class animation I'll check what's up on T. King's site since they're his mods and see what I can find out about why it isn't working.<br />
<br />
Preciious I'm sorry to say I have no idea what your problem is. I've read every post on every page of this thread and never heard anything like what your describing. I don't control the hosting on the EQInterface links so I don't know why you'd be getting anything like that. If you're getting this on one of the links that I host I can guarantee that it is not coming from my end. The files that I personally host are on my personal webspace through my isp. I've never even heard of PhotoParade. It sounds like you have somekind of adware in your system. You should try getting Ad-aware and some kind of virus program and check your system over for virus', adware, browser hijacks and such. I wish you the best of luck though in finding out what has caused your problem and I wish I could be more help.<br />

<br />
Changed Windows<br />
<br />
I have changed the Player window that is included in the main ui file to have the Group Leadership Exp Bar under AA exp I've color'd the fill purple cause i dont' think i could stomach 3 orange bars. I almost changed the others but decided i'd rather not. I did not add Raid Leadership bar for 2 reasons. 1 most people are not raid LEADERS ofter enough to warrent having it in the box. I know I'm not. 2 I didn't want to make the box any bigger than nessessary. Before you ask yes i've looked for % for leadership and I can not find it anywhere so it will be there once i find out the eqtype.<br />

<br />
the ticket window is the new petition system in game. /petition will now pull up the ticket window. sending petitions is now ui based. It's a GREAT improvement. It is the ONLY reason I have added the help window to the ui. The button for those who hate / commands is in the help window. In support of this wonderful new petition system I have decided to add the help window to my ui.<br />

Because i refuse to tear apart my ui and not make it all encompassing I have had to split it into 2 files. One of which the main body of the ui is hosted here the other is called Centhena UI TKing Animations patch which I host because it is too large to upload to eqinterface. You can find a link for this file in the first post on this thread. There's also a link on the download page for the main ui. :o) simply install it with the rest of the ui and tada instant animations. I update the animations file in that filewhen i update the one in the main ui zip so it should overwrite but be exactly the same :o) The patch i posted yesterday however should resolve the class animations problem with your origional ui folder.  It wasn't an animation issue they were there all the time they were just hiding behind a chunk of the inventory window. Something was changed in the way the xml was read by the game and it stopped showing up on the top and was forced to the back. So i got rid of that little piece of the window covering it up :o)<br />

ok did you extract the files from the zip into it's own folder in the uifiles folder? also did you dl the ui itself  or one of the option's files they are not stand alone and require the main ui to work properly. If did get the right file and you did unzip it into it's own folder  and such please let me know and let me know any error messages that you're getting or any information you can give me. It will help alot in trying to figure out what's wrong.<br />

Only the windows I have provided in my various options files have been tested this includeds other t. king mods. Although many others will work I'd have to test them before I could say I know that works hehe. The best thing i can suggest is that if it worked before I can make it work again :o) tell me what other mods your using and i'll try to make them work. If your not using any other mods my first suggestion is to delete your folder redownload and reinstall maybe something got corupted. if that doesn't solve the problem i'll need more information. like what resolution are you using on both desktop and in eq? what os are you using? Please keep in mind that everquest ui folders can only be one word in length. Please let me know if none of this solves your problem so i can help you get it up and running.<br />

I posted an update just the other day and have added this update to the main uifile and it's now called v1.2 so that should make it easier to make sure you have the right one. I'd also make a new folder for it. something simple like custom or celtic or centhena or even remake the one you have just take out the caps. perhaps the game can no longer read folders with more than one capital letter. Please let me know if this doesn't solve your problem.<br />

Anyway.... we're spending the evening watching the first movie and the afternoon tomarrow watching the second and then off to the theater for the 3rd hehe meanwhile i've been re-reading it to have it fresh in my mind. Since it's been like two months since I read it last. (told ya i was a big fan hehe) I have this habit of reading the entire series from first to fifth and then starting over soon as i'm done.... over... and over... *giggle* but I love it so I'm a dork and I'm happy about it hehe. Anyway this is totally off topic. I'll be sure to have the update up no later than saturday and i should have your stuff done by then too sablerose.<br />

Also noticed on the raid window, the decline button should change to disband after joining the raid and it doesn't. That's the only thing I found I have a problem with. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fireheart</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to reiterate, I do Love what you've created here, Centhena and I've recomended your UI to anyone who will listen to me blathering about it!  :D <br />
<br />
I, too, am occasionally getting the red-text saying EQ doesn't like this XML and that it would be happier with '/loadskin default', but I never listen to the thing.  It does worry me, a little, and I wish I knew what parts of your UI were causing the problem, but nevermind, the thing is beautiful.<br />
<br />
I'm returning to EQ after many months, after a sudden downturn in my RL, and I'm Amazed to see my little contribution now Immortalized as &quot;Fireheart's Target&quot;...  Really, I just found something I liked in another Drakah UI and modified it.  Still, Gratifying indeed and I'm glad you liked it enough to adopt it as an Alternate.<br />
<br />
While I'm sure you're scrambling to work in the newly Patched modifications (which I am breathlessly awaiting!), I wonder if you wouldn't look at a few more alternate options?<br />
Except for Rangers, no other tracking class can use the Sorting options, so could we have a Tracking window without Con-Color buttons and Sort-type menu?  It would just look cleaner and be easier to use.  My Bard thanks you!<br />
I don't want to argue with whatever arrangement of windows causes you (and others) to prefer non-scrolling Loot/Merchant/Trader windows, but I find they just take up too much space.  I am usually forced to switch the Default window back in and then update the Border setting to match your UI.  The Loot window, being smaller, is the only exception, lately.  Perhaps these windows deserve another look, with an eye towards designing ones that work nice, look nice, and still fit on a smaller screen?<br />
This last time around, I decided to use a different Bazaar window, and found one that is smallish, but still very functional.  This one (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/showthumbs.php?id=988) is made by Deamos.  It is a tiny bit cramped, but the long menus, reducing the need to scroll on such a tight scale, are especially nice.  Or this one. (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/showthumbs.php?id=607)  Perhaps you might update this design a little and adopt it for your UI? <br />
Finally, it just works better for me, to have stacked Buff and Song windows with text names like This One (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/showthumbs.php?id=2189) from Turlo.  The only thing I'd change is putting the buff-name Lables to the Left of the Icons - However, every time I tried it, I made a terrible mess.  I'm sure you could do much better! :eek: <br />
<br />
Those are the only changes needed to suit my own preferences, and I've managed to set them up fairly well.  However, I sincerely wish they were properly integrated into your UI - with You guarding the secrets of the coding, instead of whatever I manage to lash together on my own!<br />
Come to think of it, That may be one of the reasons I'm getting that Red-text when I log in! :o   I'm just not up to snuff on the coding.<br />
<br />
Whatever happens, I sure hope you are healing well, feeling well, and that everyone close to you is happy.  It certainly makes me happy, to view my EQ world through the lens of your GUI.<br />
<br />
Be Well!<br />
Fireheart</div></div><hr />

  I too use your Celtic interface.  Works well but I also get the XML errors.  I've made the tweaks that were suggested for it to continue to function but I've got a question.  I finally got Eyepatch of Plunder last night.  Right click item worn on the face.  I tried to edit the EQCombatAbility.xml file to replace the head slot with the face slot and ended up with the default UI.  Was there more to do than just changing the slot number?<br />
<br />
Nollid<br />
<br />
Figured it out.  Needed to scroll to the bottom of the file and change the eqtype down there also.<br />
<br />
Removed an augment last night.  I ended up switching out to default UI because of the changes to the augment container.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CVamian</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:) hope you doin ok , look forward to update when possible</div></div><hr />

With the 14Jul04 patch we now have the option to sell back LDoN purchased augs/gear to the merchants.  Unfortunatly I do not have the &quot;SELL&quot; key listed on my merchant window (LDoN Adventure Merchant Only).  I went to Default and it was fine but I don't want to have to keep doing that everytime I want to sell an aug/item back to the merchants.  Does anyone know how I can fix this?  This is not the container/aug pool, issue, but the Adventure Merchant Window issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rhynoe</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found out the solution myself, seems to work.   I copied &lt;Button item = &quot;AdvMerchant_SellButton&quot;&gt; listing from default and adjusted the anchor sets to fit in my UI then added  &lt;Pieces&gt;AdvMerchant_SellButton&lt;/Pieces&gt; between purchase and duone pieces on the bottom.<br />
<br />
For anyone else having this problem add the following after the purchase and before the done button items.<br />
<br />
&lt;Button item = &quot;AdvMerchant_SellButton&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;AdvMerchant_SellButton&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />

		&lt;LeftAnchorOffset&gt;340&lt;/LeftAnchorOffset&gt;<br />
		&lt;TopAnchorOffset&gt;28&lt;/TopAnchorOffset&gt;<br />
		&lt;RightAnchorOffset&gt;450&lt;/RightAnchorOffset&gt;<br />
		&lt;BottomAnchorOffset&gt;4&lt;/BottomAnchorOffset&gt;<br />
		&lt;TopAnchorToTop&gt;false&lt;/TopAnchorToTop&gt;<br />
		&lt;BottomAnchorToTop&gt;false&lt;/BottomAnchorToTop&gt;<br />
		&lt;LeftAnchorToLeft&gt;true&lt;/LeftAnchorToLeft&gt;<br />
		&lt;RightAnchorToLeft&gt;true&lt;/RightAnchorToLeft&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Checkbox&gt;false&lt;/Style_Checkbox&gt;<br />
		&lt;TooltipReference&gt;Sell back the selected item.&lt;/TooltipReference&gt;<br />
		&lt;Text&gt;Sell&lt;/Text&gt;<br />
		&lt;TextColor&gt;<br />
			&lt;R&gt;255&lt;/R&gt;<br />
			&lt;G&gt;255&lt;/G&gt;<br />
			&lt;B&gt;255&lt;/B&gt;<br />
		&lt;/TextColor&gt;<br />
		&lt;ButtonDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
			&lt;Normal&gt;A_SmallBtnNormal&lt;/Normal&gt;<br />
			&lt;Pressed&gt;A_SmallBtnPressed&lt;/Pressed&gt;<br />
			&lt;Flyby&gt;A_SmallBtnFlyby&lt;/Flyby&gt;<br />
			&lt;Disabled&gt;A_SmallBtnDisabled&lt;/Disabled&gt;<br />
			&lt;PressedFlyby&gt;A_SmallBtnPressedFlyby&lt;/PressedFlyby&gt;<br />
		&lt;/ButtonDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Button&gt;<br />
<br />
on bottom add the following between purchase and done pieces<br />
<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;AdvMerchant_SellButton&lt;/Pieces&gt;</div></div><hr />

Thank you all for your concern and thoughts. I thought i should post that i have fully recovered now. My ankle healed quickly but my wrist was not as cooperative. I'm SOOO sorry to keep you all waiting so long. I will be resuming work on the UI today hopefully i'll be able to get some significant work done today and i'll keep you posted with how it comes along before i go to bed. With any luck i might have it all done but i'm not promising i need to look and see what all needs work before i can promise that. I haven't really kept up with what's been changed. I haven't even been playing. Well off to work for me :) Again thanks everybody it's truely heartening to have such a throng of good wishes both posts and pm's :)<br />

<br />
Raid Window.... DONE<br />
Options Window....DONE<br />
Dynamic Zone Window....DONE<br />
PVP Leaderboard Window....DONE<br />
PVP Merchant Window....DONE<br />
PVP Stats Window....DONE<br />
LDON Merchant window....DONE<br />
<br />
what i still need to work on....<br />
<br />
Ticket Window... i know i updated it before but i'm gonna make sure it still works and that i have the right file for the patch<br />
<br />
Inventory gonna see about adding the super cool mana and endurance figures to the inventory window do they work in the player window? hmmm dunno but i'll find out and see about adding them there too maybe have to see how it fits<br />
<br />
tribute effect window - think they did something to it not sure if mine's compatible gonna check it<br />
<br />
Container Window - This one is gonna be the biggest pain in the butt... they augment container  changes are in here so they don't show up with the old container mod. The container mod was the biggest pain in the butt to make in the first place. I almost had to start from scratch with remelio's origional mod to make it have the side graphics (his had no side graphics only top and bottom) I have a feeling this one will be the major kink in the works.<br />
<br />
What I will do is work on as much as i can soon as the servers come back up and i can get online. Hopefully that will happen today if they come back up too late i may not be able to work on it till tomarrow night as we've planned on having my father-in-law over tonight. But I will try :) Either way once i get everything done i'll put up the patch. If the containers are not cooperating after a couple trys i'll patch everything else and have to get you the containers once i finish them but i won't make you wait for them to get the rest of the files. As all things this is my plan and it may not work out as i want it to. <br />
<br />
Fireheart I will work on your requests once i have gotten the container to work like i want it to... as I am sure you will understand I must get major ui elements working before i can do requests. But I'll do them up for ya and depending on how much i like them i'll either just send them to you or i'll add them to the alternatives file and post it for everyone :) <br />
<br />
Anyway I&quot;ll get back to you all when i have more news :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so i've been burning the midnight oil and I've gotten everything except the containers window done.  :nana:  :nana:  :nana: The Inventory was a pain in the butt. :eek:  but I got it done anyway. I had to completly redo the graphics on it. Don't worry it looks exactly the same just alot of very skilled cut copy and paste action hehe had to chop it up a bit so i could add 24 pixels  to the length of it in an inconspicuous ( i think i spelled that wrong) way. I did my best to preserve the continuity of the border I hope that it is to everyone's satisfaction. I'm more of a code junkie but I've done my bit of graphic editing. I'm no artist but I can edit when i need to. Anyway the rest of everything else took like an hour put together it was that stupid inventory window that took me like 5 bleh... but at least it's done... it did this realy wierd thing i've never seen before It wouldn't mount the images properly when i mapped the static images for the window they came out sometimes in the wrong place and 1/2 the size they were supposed to be.. they were only 24 pixels off of the origionals according to my graphic editor.. who knows.... anyway i had to mount them to the window using twice the amount of pixels it was supposed to be and in one spot i had to to do an overlap...... this is all according to the code the result looks seemless just like before just 23 pixles longer to fit the mana and endurance figures. I think i'm going to add the endurance figures to the combat abilities windows and also the mana to the player window.... don't really see much point in adding the endurance to the player window i think it'd be more functional in the combat abilities window. NO idea where i'm gonna fit it into the player window so we'll have to see. I'm gonna work on the containers first.Anyway now that i've written the longest run on sentence ever seen by man i'm gonna go get some sleep i'll work more on this tomarrow night while my hubby's at work and get at least this posted before bed hopefully i'll get the container window sorted out by then so i can post that along with everything else. night<br />

The ugliness with the augment window makes baby jesus cry but attempting to fix it properly has only made it worse  :confused: I'm gonna be one of the ones foamin at the mouth waiting for proper upgrades now that you've started back on it - mixed windows is just killin me but the changes have just been too expansive :eek:</div></div><hr />

Glad  to hear  you are back and  doing  well  !  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fireheart</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So glad to have you around again.  Careful, don't work so hard that you reinjure yourself!  Joint damage is tricky and needs time to heal...  On the other hand, joint damage responds well to occupational therapy, so keep working it through the full range of motion, just don't overdo it.<br />
These posts make it seem like you're overdoing the coffee...  Or you're just expressing all of the pent-up creativity!  Good to have a release.<br />
<br />
So let your friends and inspirational collegues do the work for you!  You can then focus on the code-tweaking that is your Art.<br />
<br />
Drakah has posted an updated Inventory window that works fine with your UI (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3472) although it's not as tight and polished as I'd prefer.  Good temporary expedient.<br />
<br />
Mortis has a nice Trader window modification (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=1906) although the buttons are a bit cramped...<br />
<br />
You might have to tease a bit more space into the Graphics, but here's a decent Player Window Layout... (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3329)  Just swap the Numbers into the space between bars and leave the Percentages on the right end.<br />
Personally, I'm only interested in raw Numbers under non-stress conditions, so they can be rendered in a small type-size.  Knowing that I'm only 10% Alive and had better start Running is more important!  Frankly, after all these years, I consider all of the new information feeds to be nice Features, but hadly critical to my game-play.  - Hmm, 'time remaining' on my Buffs might be an exception, that's Very useful!<br />
<br />
As for your difficult Container Mods - http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=2321 and http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3434 - Just tweak them to include your inventory slots...<br />
<br />
You might also want to take a careful look at the petition Ticket windows...  I've had some troubles with those, lately...<br />
<br />
<br />
ANYWAY!  It's so good to have you back, Centhena!<br />
<br />
Be Well!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG thank you SOOO much that container mod uses the same border as mine he must have nicked it from Remelio and modded it either that or he nicked it from me hehe far as i know i'm the only one to put the sides on remmy's container. Hehe either way though I'm SOOO glad to see it's possible to fix it the way I want it.... only thing is it doesn't have the buttons that I like so i'll have to fix it to keep Remmy's buttons and the top and bottom graphics are a bit stretch but i think i can fix that. The inventory window would have been good to have yesterday but alas i'm already done with it but if it bugs out cause I had to fiddle with it to get it to work I know where I can find one to switch to. I'm personally not fond of the trader window for my self but it'd make a nice alternate. If it works as a standalone mod and you like it just as it is I don't see any real need for me to include it in my alternates file as I will have done no work on it and since Mortis didn't submit it to me to include I'd kinda feel like I was stealing it. As for the Player window I really like mine I may just stretch it out a bit again like I did before when I added the leadership bar. We'll see. Unless you'd rather have me remove the border and add the matching one for the main body of the ui then i could include it as i'll have changed it. Let me know if you want that done. The tradeskill window I'd already DL'd and was planning to test and add anyway :) great minds think alike hehe. Anyway Here I go off to play with the container mod completely reheartened. I was really not looking forward to it till now hehe.<br />

  Glad you're back.  Don't overwork that wrist.  Looking forward to seeing your updates.  I'll have to remember to change one of the clicky slots so I can keep my Eyepatch haste up.  <br />
  Any chance you'll do a new bazaar search window in the future?  I'm currently using Grottel's bazaar window (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=607) with the drop down selection lists instead of scrolling.<br />

Did you ever do an Assist Target window from the GoD aa's?  If so, what does it look like please... I think you said you used the Raxthorne ring, but I don't remember, hope to hear from you soon on this..Cause I really want to use the Raxthorne ring Assist ring, the mark0-3 tga's, but Static... if that's possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good god it's been a rought couple days. I'm sorry I haven't been able to follow through with getting this patch posted. I haven't packed it up yet. I haven't been feeling very well. Haven't gotten a whole lot of sleep. Babies been getting up like 3 hours earlier than usual and my hubby's been working night shift so it's been a little rough. with the littlest one still not sleeping through the night I think over the last four days i may have gotten a combined total of about 18 hours sleep. last night being about 3 1/2 hours. I have  to go do dinner here in a few minutes and tonight i have to pick my hubby up from work at like 1 in the morning dragging all 4 kids with me so they won't be going to bed as usual so i have no idea if i'll get to do anymore with this tonight than type this post but I will try. Thanks for your understanding. I promise that I will get this posted soon.  Just kinda bumed about this stupid container window and how long it's taking to get it the way I want it.<br />
<br />
 As for the few questions that have been posted.<br />
<br />
I'll have to check but i can't remember which target ring is the latest one that I've posted. One was broken and the other fixed I'll have to reread my last patch post. The fixed one it really cool and I think i've posted it but I don't think it has the mark target rings. I don't think i've done them yet I'll have to look at the files and my notes. It was what I was working on before i broke my wrist but I never got the aa's to be able to test it cause I had to stop playing but at the moment i really can't remember. So I'll look into it  after I get the rest of this done. I'm going to get the aa's to unlock the rings so i can test them before I release the rings although I may update as I go along with first second and third. or at least that's my plan if i hadn't already done it. I actually hadn't thought about that mod at all till i read your post.<br />
<br />
If you want the border added to that window fireheart I can add it for you it's no big deal and should only take a few minutes for me to mock it up.  <br />
<br />
Right now my priority is the stupid container window that is giving me fits. Once it's done however I think you will all love it or at least I hope you will. I've had to edit the graphics a ton and remap all of them to the new graphic file I've made in my attempt to get this window to look the way I want it. Anyway time to feed the kids.<br />

Sorry to hear the kids are being difficult, I'm still dealing with that myself and trying to finish my bachelors/2nd associates.  It gets better once school starts for them, at least a little better anyway.

Hehe I promise i'll email you Tom if i decide to take another trip down my front steps and incapacitate myself for another couple months :p Had I known that my absence would cause such an uproar I probably would have emailed you so you could tell everyone i was ok and would be back soon as i could. Hehe i was honestly blown away with the responce to my absence. Lots of warm fuzzys :) Which of course are my favorite :)<br />
<br />
I looked into the work I had done on the target indicator and I have not gone any farther with it than what i have posted here. I will get back to playing after i finish this @#$*%!&amp; container window. Who ever decided to put that bit of code in the container window instead of creating a new window is a complete sadist.  Anyway as I gather the AA abilities I will choose the ring I wish to represent the 1 2 and 3 target marks they may be different they may be similar they may be varients of the same I don't know yet. I will first see what what I have already looks like and go from there. What was really cool is when i was re reading my post on it my hubby, who hasn't played in about as long as i haven't, says to me &quot;hey that's really nice... oh wait isn't that the one you put together?&quot; *Giggle* Well anyway i'm off :) Goonna see if i can work on the damned container some more.<br />

Well for me I was just wondering if you were better from hurting yourself then Thomus said that you had hurt yourself and I wasn't sure if that was a previous or something recent, I was more concerned with how you were doing.<br />

What I want to do is to have it the mana displayed in the player window and the endurance displayed in the combat abilities window I think that's how I'd prefer it. but then i think again and perhaps I do want to put the endurance in the player window just to keep it more uniformed. I don't know..... I'll see how i like it when I start working on it. Either way I'll probably be growing the window a few pixels and rearanging things a bit to get it to look nice. I'll be putting one out with the next patch. Right now the next patch looks like it's gonna be target indicator rings for the mark aa i've already got mark 1 just need to get the other 2 and the player window. I also want to get a 4 slot combat abilities window out there like the 8 slot one I have now. My poor hubby has had to deal with the 8 slot one being a pally since i made it. *giggle* I know I said i'd be a few weeks but hehe i'm kinda itchin' to get my player window fixed the way i want it so..... maybe i'll get a patch out sooner. I need to concentrate on playing so i can get the leadership exp for the target rings can't test what i can't see. and i don't release what i can't test.<br />
