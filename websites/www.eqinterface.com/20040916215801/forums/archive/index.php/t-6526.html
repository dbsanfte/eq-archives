<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nwinn</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I took the vert nexium mod, made it gray, and xirinia's cast spell window and modified them a little bit.  Also used someone's vertical hotbutton box.  Oh, I used a T. King spellbook and these awesome buff/spell icons that someone just put out! :D<br />
<br />
I really want a different buff window and short duration buff window so, this is still in progress.  I'd also like a more readable compass but I've yet to find, or make, one.<br />
<br />
I do really like the way my selector window came out but, I just noticed that somehow the spell book button has a J instead of an S on flyby, lol!<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to make a horizontal sdbw w/ 20x20 icons.  The buff window will also have a little smaller icons and will be much shorter, it pretty much goes from top to bottom atm.<br />
<br />
So, what do you guys think? :D<br />

I'm just silly about the icons.  I prefer the old school stuff.  Nice layout and everything is easy to look at.</div></div><hr />

Lol, I think the icons are my favorite part. :D  Really, I wanted everything important to be really bright and the rest to be that very dull gray, so I love how colorful they are!<br />
<br />
It took me a little bit to get used to them so I kinda know what you mean... you're already comfortable/adept with using the old ones and don't want to change them cause they're not broken, he he!</div></div><hr />
