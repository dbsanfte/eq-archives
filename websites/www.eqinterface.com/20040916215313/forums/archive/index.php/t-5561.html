<br />
lemme know if you want it up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Download Here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=939) .  Use INI included and resolution of 1280 X 1024.<br />
<br />
Bard song window added underneath the buff window.  It's smaller version of buff window and I really didn't test it so it might not look quite right; lol.<br />
<br />
Anyways,  I was just patching this old UI to get it to work. so here it is :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KingGeo</div><div class="date">01-15-2003, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">let's see.   For each character you have a  UI_charname_servernumber.INI  file.  This file holds the info for where each of your windows is posisitioned and such.<br />
<br />
So you would simply find your chars .INI in your everquest directory,   rename the INI that came with the UI you want to use and copy it over the one you currently have.  Of course you might want to back it up in case you decided you don't like the UI and want your last one back.<br />
<br />
Then just boot EQ and use the   /load skinname 1 command.<br />
<br />
<br />
Make sure you use the 1 in the command above it it will reset all the windows posistions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greenroot</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">love it.. but theres one prob i got that really makes me kinda like wtf..  well where my spells are shown is also where my hits are put understand?  like where it says im casting spells is also where the HP im taking off the mob is located as well.. i copyed ini file and made backup of mine.. please repost and tell me how i may fix this prob thanks.. or update the GUI thanks man later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KingGeo</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there's nothing wrong with the INI.  Make sure your at 1280 X 1024 resolution as that's what the UI was originally designed for.  if it is, then make sure you  /loadskin  name 1    after you copy the INI there cause if you leave off the   1 on there all the windows will reset to default positions in the INI making it useless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i used this whin it first came out. I dont have a use for the hit and miss boxes. A druid has no use for hit/miss. If they gettting hit there in trouble.I would rather use the hit and miss spots for more chat room. I might try it with my ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greenroot</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm..  i have done everything right,  copied the ini file and named it my name in game,  and made a backup of my old one, did the /loadskin druid 1 which is i call it (druid) and for some reaosn i don't know why it stilll wants to make my hits and misses where the spells go.  if you could maybe tell me how in an email or so to fix this i would love to fix this and have your GUI working properly for me.  i love it thats the only thing i dno't understand about it.. its a great gui thanks man<br />
