I get to the EULA with EQW on and than its like im in CTRL ALT R mode all the time.. i can see the game's arrow but all i have control over is the windows arrow.. anything i can do to fix this or just wait for an EQW patch for the login screens? The Main reason i ask is because i asked some other people who use EQW and they arent having this problem at all.<br />

Thx in advance, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celesta</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a solution on Eqwindows forums. It involves replacing the new eqmain.dll and eqhost.txt with the previous ones. Now once you do this you will have to run the patch skip until JSD has time to correct SOE yet again breaking a perfectly good running program with there wicked ways.<br />

If you don't have them talk to your friends and have them e-mail you the 2 files.</div></div><hr />

I make it all the way to the Character selection screen when I get 2 mice. One is EQ and the other is windows. When I click the mouse, EQ drops to the tool bar and repops in a small box in the upper left hand corner of the screen. The only way to get control of windows it to do a CTRL+ALT+DEL. I have 3 accounts and it happens on 2 of the 3.</div></div><hr />

How can you get to the forums? When I try to surf to his old website (www.eqwindows.com), it comes up that the page couldn't be loaded.</div></div><hr />

You have been warned so don’t come crying to me if your account gets hacked. Remember use your noggin before you download.<br />
<br />
This is in reference to the link to the post that has a link to an anglefire webpage that has a link to a dll file. <br />

Any one know or can produce an alternate dload for the fixes so that I can dual box again. Or is there any one who can tell me how to use the everquest windows mode with better speed. It seems to be very slow having to switch out using the alt shift r then bring up the other window and establish control. Please any advise on either of the topics would be  an eq life saver!!;)</div></div><hr />
