I just want something to tweak a few things here and there like changing the color maybe adding a simple graphic. There are a lot of programs out there, and I was curious if anyone had a suggestion for something under $50 that would allow me to do this.  I'm also interested in hearing what others are using. :)<br />

Thanks!<br />

This program is free. Click here to go there homepage. (http://www.xnview.com)<br />
<br />
I then can do small edits to a JPEG and convert it back to TGA format when i have finished.<br />
<br />
It isn't the best way but It does work for what I need done.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

<br />
Doesn't Paint Shop Pro let you use it for free, and only have a nag screen when you run it? (Been a while since I used it)</div></div><hr />

Check it out. If you can get by the learning curve,  it may be wonderful for you. I know a lot of people who dropped their pirated  photoshops for the Gimp.<br />

<br />
If you're really after to buy a graphic program, that's an option.<br />
<br />
I use Photoshop 7.0 myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Filex</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never could get the hang of Gimp.  It's too obfuscated for me.  For some reason, Photoshop has always seemed straight forward.<br />
<br />
But then, Gimp is free, and is nearly as powerful as Photoshop.  Just need to figure it out =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruujo</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying to use Photoshop 5.5 (yeah, I know, I need to upgrade, but dang is it expensive and I don't use it much anymore), but it just doesn't seem to save TGA files with the proper invisibility tags.  IE, when viewed in EQ, if the window piece is multi-layered, such as the compass, you can barely read the compass because as soon as photoshop saves it, it makes the center piece that's supposed to be transparent nearly black and barely translucent.  Any suggestions?  Maybe I'm forgetting to do something before saving?<br />
<br />
Also, while I used to use GIMP, I'd really rather not again.  Any other suggestions for good TGA editors?</div></div><hr />
