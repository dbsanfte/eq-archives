I assume you're using Netscape.  There are ways to stop it from auto saving fileswith the PHP suffix added  on to them but rather than go through the whole long explanation just download the file and when done go to the file loacation and rename the file. It will be something like AyaUIWhatever.zip.php. <br />
<br />
Just take off the PHP portion and you're golden.</div></div><hr />

I've never heard of any one having problems downloading with internet explorer 5+. Only with Netscape as it totaly ignores the file header info sent from the php script. Normaly for Netscape right clicking on the download link and chooseing &quot;Save target as&quot; allows you to download it and if its an older version of netscape you may need to rename the file to .zip.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and if you have any more info. on your problem please post it so we can help more.</div></div><hr />
