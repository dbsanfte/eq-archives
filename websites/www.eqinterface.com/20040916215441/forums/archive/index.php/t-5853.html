I have not tested this with any other ui's, only the default.  So please let me know if you have any problems before I upload this to the download section.  Also, if you have any suggestions or improvements you would like to see added, feel free to let me know.<br />

<br />
I can't see how much of that 20% bubble I've filled just by looking at the AA bar.  Could ya take a look at it and see if something went wrong?<br />
<br />
I'm also sending you a PM ... just wanna see what your most recent project is and if I can test it out ;) .<br />
