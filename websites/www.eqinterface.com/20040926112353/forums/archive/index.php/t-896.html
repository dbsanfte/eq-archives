<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arantius</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The group leader's name used to always appear in yellow (ok almost always).  Now, It isn't like that and you can't tell at a glance who is your leader.  I would much like this feature back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfran</div><div class="date">08-11-2002, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They added the new grouping code (the ability to change leaders with the /makeleader command, and the ability for leadership to transfer on LD, etc) at the same time they started the New UI beta on live servers.  I haven't used the old UI  since that time, so I can't confirm whether the group leader highlight still exists there, or whether or not it transfers with group leader changes.  If both of those is true, then it shouldn't be a problem for VI to add the functionality to the new UI.  If the latter doesn't work (as in the original leader is highlighted even after change in leadership), then servers might not be sending that info to the client, making it difficult to add to the info to the UI.<br />
<br />
Or something like that.<br />

Would be something to bring to VI's attention, but probably won't be a priority.</div></div><hr />
