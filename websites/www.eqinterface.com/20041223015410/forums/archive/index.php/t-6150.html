<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ridd1er</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created a decent image for the monk gui. However it only displays the first image when i change skins.. the second image loops through but it shows up blank.. Anyone have any ideas? The images were made almost identical. Just a couple small differences in the actual colors. I have gone as far as to copy the graphics from monk02.tga and past them onto my monk01.tga and save off another monk02.tga.. Still resulting in the same error. <br />
<br />
Things original files and my files both include: <br />
a segmented tga file with 8 stills inside. <br />
a Alpha channel that is White <br />
8/bits per channel <br />
RGB Color <br />
<br />
Things I have tried: <br />
I have tried renaming my monk01 to monk02.. this works so not a problem with XML. <br />
I have tried the reverse renaming monk02 monk01 to see if it is a naming problem, still results in a blank image. <br />
<br />
At this point I am out of ideas.. I am wondering if I am missing some color information or there is a limitation i dont know about for tga files to be used in this fassion (although I did my best to mimic the existing files attributes) <br />
<br />
Basically what I see is in the inventory screen it shows the first image monk01 and all its frames when its supposed to switch to monk02 it shows a blank image then rotates backwards through monk01 (as scripted in the xml file)<br />

Seemed to be a glitch with the way that Photoshop v 6.0 handled the alpha channel.. I took the files into Photoshop 5.5 and added the alpha channel again and saved them.. and Whala they worked.. after I put some info into the files that I created them.  Then I will post them.. Thanks for the help though.<br />
