I really have no idea what to look for, as I'm not well versed in this stuff.  <br />
<br />
Mainly, I want to be able to put Vert's gauges into the default window pieces file.  I tried it last night, and it seemed to load right one time, and it hasn't loaded properly since (and I didn't edit the file again after that).<br />
<br />
If PSP is useable for this, what things do I need to look for to save the file correctly?<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.</div></div><hr />

I been trying the same thing ye have. After a number of edits all I have been able to get is a wider gauge. I was able ta change the mouse pointer by placing it as a transparency but this does not seem ta work fer the gauges. I even tried cutting and pasting each gauge seperately but still couldnt get it ta work.<br />
<br />
Anyone know just how this can be done right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a short - Help Me instruction - I did this already on my bars :<br />
<br />
1) For my reference make sure you have the Tool bar showing:<br />
Go  to View - Toolbars - Check Tool bar and close<br />
<br />
2) Open the target file of choice - (Verts changed Bars window)<br />
<br />
3) Go up to Tool Bar and click on Wand - Move the wand over the window_pieces01.tga file from Vert and left click mouse - You will notice bunch of dotted lines around everything - Go up to Selections - Invert - You will notice that the larger dotted line that was around entire image is gone and only the inside dotted lines show still<br />
<br />
4)Go to Selections - Save to Alpha Channel - The Save to Alpha Channel Window then click and highlight Alpha Channel 1 - Then OK - Yes<br />
<br />
THIS WAS TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN ALPHA CHANNEL - Which basically means the image you have or select from now on is  TRUE or doesnt include some boxy or such background along with it - JUST THE IMAGE ITSELF :)<br />
<br />
5) Right click on window_pieces01.tga window - The lines disappear - Go to Tool bar and select the dotted line rectangle - Go back to image and click and hold mouse and drag over the area you want such as bars - when done release button and Edit - Copy<br />
<br />
6) Open up the other window_pieces01.tga file you want to put new bars in - Click on image to verify this is one you want - Edit - Paste - As Transparent Selection and move the Vert bars over the existing and when they line up stop and right click :)<br />
<br />
Voila now if you want the line just in between with small indents out just take the dotted rectangle box a select and Edit - Cut ;)<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
This information can be used to change the Item background box to right of bars and down - The Spell Icon Box is down - Cursor also.<br />
<br />
If you dont select alpha channel (Transparency)  like described for .tga files in EQ you end up with boxes and odd looking stuff.</div></div><hr />
