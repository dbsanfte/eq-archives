<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadrak</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(The following text is only my opinion and personal pondering, additional discussion and opinions are welcome.)<br />
<br />
<br />
I find it  funny when people start a discussion, then get mad when those discussing dont agree with their opinion and result to name calling and insults.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it seems a civilized discussion on this topic is impossible, as a number of individuals perceive it as a personal attack due to their own feelings of inadequacy?<br />
<br />
I had intended to discuss the thoughts and ideas raised by that article I happened to come across -- not bicker about something as trivial as 'You aren't better than me because you have better sentence structure'. Completely absurd.<br />
<br />
Much to my dismay I've no choice but to request that this thread is perhaps best left locked at this point -- the sooner the better.  I'll let the moderators make that decision.<br />
<br />
My thanks to those who at least tried to contribute something worthwhile on the topic.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Perhaps this are issues you need to resolve for your own well being. <br />

The only people that can lock a thread in this forum are the board ops/mods.  Trying to get around that lock by starting a new thread isn't a wise idea.  Locking this one as well.</div></div><hr />
