<br />
If they are done so they go in 1% incraments, that window would take 500 gauges, 1000 if it includes pet lifebars.  =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenney</div><div class="date">03-15-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well even if ... it will still look cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanys.Neoconker</div><div class="date">03-15-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, yeah it looks good and it is a great idea. But I know from pervious posts I've read is that the more gauges you have, the more lag it causes. So 500 gaugues is a lot more than the 5-10 most people have showing at one time.  So, all I'm saying is you may get some complaints from people who don't have very fast computers about the lag issues.  Just a heads up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">03-15-2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My UI is VERY gauge heavy. I don't know of any UI that uses more, it has probably a little over 250 gauges (100 from a vertical casting gauge, probably 80 or so gauges in the group window). Note that slowdown due to a complex UI is NOT LAG, slowdown CAN cause lag, but it isn't the same thing. Here are my framerates:<br />
<br />
All framerates are clip plane all the way down, staring at the ground in Gunthak. 1.5 GHz CPU, Geforce4 Ti 4200, 512 MB SDRAM.<br />
<br />
UI OFF (F10) - 115 fps<br />
Default UI - 70 fps<br />
Enoks UI (My UI) - 50 fps<br />
<br />
So, as you can see the framerate drop isn't MAJOR, it's significant but not unbearable, and it doesn't get much worse with more gauges. I wouldn't be too worried about how this affects performance. What I really wanna know is if he has horizontal names as it sorta seems like it does in the scrambled screenshot.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to it's release. I won't use it, but I want to see what they did coding wise (assuming they have sideways names). Also, here's a screenshot to keep this thread interesting.<br />
<br />
My group window.<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=39673<br />
<br />
First window is a healthy group, notice pet HP percent only appears if they have a pet. Second window is a beat up group. In the third window Sebbal is dead. Fourth window shows other group members have zoned.<br />
