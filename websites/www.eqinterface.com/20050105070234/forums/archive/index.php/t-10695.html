<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redius</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've looked around in the containers section and noticed a few people have designed containers for tradeskills to prevent accidental moving of the bag when rapidly clicking. I'd like to encorperate that into the containers I have designed. I have tried compareing their .xml with mine to see what was diffrent and try to pick out the line that shrunk down the area which you could click to move the bag. Alas, I have failed time and time again. I like the look of my bags all I want is for them not to move unless you click on the top bar of the bag where the close x is.<br />
<br />
Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.<br />

Im sorry, I get long winded sometimes. Just tring to be through.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Stayput containers use a clear transparent button to cover the areas they want to be unclickable.  This works because clicking (or right clicking) on a button is different than clicking on the background of the container window.  Since the button is transparent, the user doesn't even realize it's there.</div></div><hr />
