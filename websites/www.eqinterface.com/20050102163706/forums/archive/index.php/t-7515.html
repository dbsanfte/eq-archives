My friend says his default folder is called default, which makes sense. Whats up? <br />
<br />
(btw, no ui i have ever used has ever worked).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... I seem to remember that when the new UI first came out your base folder could be called uifiles\skins\default or uifiles\default.<br />
<br />
Supposedly, one of the patches about 5 months ago changed this to where everyone's setup would be uifiles\default.<br />
<br />
Looks like you slipped through the cracks on that one. ;)<br />
<br />
Do you have a uifiles\skins\default folder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalcor</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No I do not.  I have an everquest folder. Inside I have a uifiles folder. Inside that I have a skins folder, and when I open skins, bam, I see a lod of files, but not another folder to open. See my above post and tell me if you notice anything out of the ordinary (if this hasn't already tipped you off as to why I am messing up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is kind of neat - not something you see everyday. :)<br />
<br />
Let's try something... move your &quot;skins&quot; folder to your desktop (so that you have no ui files in your EQ directory) then run the EQ patcher.  See if it gives you a &quot;default&quot; folder instead of a new &quot;skins&quot; one.  If it does your problem is most likely solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalcor</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">run the eq patcher, you mean simply start up eq? I havnt manually patched something in a long while</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalcor</div><div class="date">03-12-2003, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, I think I may have located a problem thanks to your help (though I still have no clue what to do). When I tried to move my skins folder to desktop, I was given the message that my desktop ALREADY had a skins folder on it. In fact, it did. I opened it, and it DID Have a default folder inside (named default). <br />
<br />
So there's that, the question is, now what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now we're getting somewhere. :)<br />
<br />
Move the \uifiles\skins folder (if you haven't already) to anywhere outside the EQ directory (yu can toss it in &quot;My Documents&quot; or whatever)... the whole point is to have no UI folders or files in your EQ directory.<br />
<br />
Then run the patcher.  By that i mean start EQ the normal way and let it patch/download files.<br />
<br />
Once it's finished look in your \uifiles folder again and see if you have a &quot;default&quot; folder now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalcor</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">alright done. and apparently i also have two eq directories (everquest and everquest triology), which most likely contributed greatly to the problem ;) but, its working now. thank you =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My pleasure, but for gawd's sake clean that mess up!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greymantle</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do yourself a favour and run the thorough patch program as well, making sure all the appropriate expansions are ticked off. You will be amazed by what was missed.</div></div><hr />
