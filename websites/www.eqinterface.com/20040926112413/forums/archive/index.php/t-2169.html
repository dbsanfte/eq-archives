I play a caster.  I may say taht I am at FM and gtg when I am at 80m, I know how to play my class, and 80m, FM, makes no diff to me as a only mana regen counts (to a point).  Also, if a group doesn't see your mana going down, they will think you aren't doing anything.   Basically, with mana showing, peopel sill start to try to play your class, by telling you what to do.  And that is NOT cool.<br />
<br />
As a cleric, may say OOM, when really at 20m.  If tanks see cleric mana at 20, they will say &quot;cleric got mana, i will pull&quot;. Then that leads to conflicts etc.<br />
<br />
Even if they did show it, and allowed an option to hide your mana, then people would think you were hiding something and start complaining even more.</div></div><hr />
