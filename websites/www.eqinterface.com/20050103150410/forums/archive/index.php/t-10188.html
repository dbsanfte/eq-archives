I have been reading the threads and watching for a UI that works for me. Unfortunatly so far everything has been so graphic and not down to earth enough for me. So I decided to create a graphic of what I personally would like a UI to be. It is not graphiacly rich but it would funtion and thats what I am after.<br />
<br />
Here is a link to one of my bare sites with the graphic.<br />

Any help, ideas, or artists willing to code, PLEASE let me know.</div></div><hr />

Your eye will be constantly moving up and down and eventually it will piss you off and you'll move them next to each other.<br />
<br />
Other than that, seems pretty straight forward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">edward</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 05:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I set the two to show where I usually place mine. Though it is usually only 1 and I like both positions so different characters have it in one of the two.  Thanks for the insite though. Other players could easily set two chat windows side by side on top or bottom. The main problem is I hate having the bottom of my screen so jam packed, I tried it with a couple of different UI's but just couldn't get used to it.<br />
<br />
Have played around with mix n match UI's but I now want a unified screen.</div></div><hr />
