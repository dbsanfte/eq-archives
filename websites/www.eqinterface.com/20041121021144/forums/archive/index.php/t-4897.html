<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jilkscom56</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive been fooling arounnd with SidlWidl for a couple days, it is very useful, but everytime I want to add a new object as far as I know, I have to open the file in notepad, add the code in, declare it in the pieces at the bottom, and then I can edit it in SidlWidl. So Im thinking there must be an easier way, and there is this toolbox think on the side that I can't seem to make work. It looks as if it would be to add new objects, but when you press the buttons it doesn't do anything. So can the toolbox do what I think it can do? Is it for a totaly differant purpous? Was it writen in for use in a later version? any help would be nice :D</div></div><hr />

The standard build allows you to add labels and buttons by clicking on them in the toolbox area, holding and dragging to the window viewer area. The expanded toolbox will let you do the same thing with gauges, percents and inventory slots. From there, you will be able to adjust the properties as you would normally.<br />

Enjoy :D <br />
