I wanted to directly add a few of the already made UI parts that I downloaded from here.... I would copy the default UI and replace the old things with the modifications by dropping them into the copied default folder... then id rename the copied default folder something else... and place it in the UI folder...<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT... whenever i even go so far as to simply even just change th cursor and try to load up that folder it says &quot;Error loading, Loading default... and nothign else BUT that... what do i do? what am i doings that is wrong?<br />
<br />

Just simply place all the new modifications that you want in one folder inside the &quot;Uifiles&quot; folder in the EQ directory ((the folder holding the &quot;Default&quot; folder. but not IN the default folder)) and name it.  Then in the game load the ui under options screen what ever you named the new ui folder (like mystuff for example) under loadskin.  EQ will pull from the default folder what is not in yours and TA DA your ui should be a modified ui.</div></div><hr />
