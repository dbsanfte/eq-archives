<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barsham</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK - I have /petitionned this one several times with no response from Sony, so I figured I would toss it out to the interface experts here. This only happens on ONE of my 8 toons on an account, but is very annoying and I would love to fix it.<br />
<br />
In certain windows I have no ability to make a choice - the text in the window is often truncated and there are no accept or decline buttons. This occurs during the following functions:<br />
<br />
-Receiving Guild Invites<br />
-Changing video resolution (30 seconds to decide)<br />
-Destroy (only way I can destroy is by enabling Fast destroy)<br />
-Bug report (OK to send system info etc...)<br />
<br />
Have tried loading about 10 different UIs including default - all have the same problem.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to fix this would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Note: I did search the Help forum and tried some of the tips - Deleting Character_Server.ini did noty fix it - and since it is only one of my 8 toons on this account I would rather avoid the suggestions of a complete EQ re-install...<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

The problem comes up when you use two different UIs with different sized confirmation boxes.<br />
<br />
Although this is in a UI-specific thread, you might find your answers in this post about how to fix confirmation dialog size problems (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=70415#post70415).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will try this fix as soon as I log off this forum. You are correct - I have used several different UIs on this toon, Since he is my trader and I never &quot;play&quot; him I use him as my UI guinea Pig. As such i am sure that I am dealing with the condition you are describing.<br />
