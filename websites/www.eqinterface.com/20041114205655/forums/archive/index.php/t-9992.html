* Zeremus Windows: Breathe<br />
* Designed by Zeremus Honorfyre, Ayonae Ro Server<br />
***********************************************<br />
<br />
I work too many hours, I took a break, sometimes you have to breathe.<br />
<br />
Added:<br />
-Mana/End numbers to player window<br />
<br />
Changed:<br />
-New 3D Targeting Ring (spniy ?)<br />
-Updated Buff and Spell Windows (Drakah)<br />
-Compatible with OOW<br />
<br />
Steps:<br />
1. Download Zeremus Windows: Breathe and extract it into your main EQ directory.<br />
2. Make a backup of your current character's UI INI file (ex. UI_Chet_ayonae.ini -&gt; UI_Chet_ayonae.bck)<br />
3. Rename UI_zw1280_servername.ini (or UI_zw800_servername.ini) to whatever your character's UI INI file was.<br />
4. Log in and play.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Zeremus Windows: Breathe is designed for usage with 1280x1024 desktops.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice looking UI.  I did download it so I came back and edited this post a little.  <br />
Could you release an option with the target and the compas switched? Or rather, push the player info down in the compas space area and put the target window on top of the player info.  I feel that with more continuity of the gagues (being stacked on top of one another without much clutter in between) it will be easier to glance at each individual bar as well as how your health compares to your target's. I realize i can just plop the target window above the player/grp window but it becomes a little too tall on the screen, and the compass area would still seem somewhat in the way. Perhaps also place the casting bar above the target.<br />
It would be awesome if you could do this for me :) If I had a little more skill with xml and such I might be able to do it myself lol.<br />
<br />
Also I noticed that the class animation isn't visible in the inventory, it just looks like a dark grey space.<br />
I think that's all I've noticed for now. Overall i'm satisfied with this UI.<br />
<br />
Thanx,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything one would want in a UI. <br />
<br />
But I have a question: What prompted you to change from one spell icon set to the next. Only takes a little getting used to and the names boviously make it easier. But I just wondered what prompted the change?<br />
<br />
Any plans to include timers for buffs?<br />

It does not however generate any errors, so give it a try.<br />
Just rename your present file and unzip this one into your Zeremus folder (zwnitrain).<br />
<br />
 If it causes problems, just delete and restore the original name to the renamed file.<br />

Make sure it's not offscreen. Load the default UI, move the buff windows to the middle of the screen, then reload Zeremus and move them to their final locations.<br />

I get the flashing window but it looks like the Default UI on top of the custom one flashing in the upper left hand corner.  Will try swaping it out with the old one tonight to see if that fixs the issue.<br />
<br />
Zeremus, not sure if you take requests or if anyone has altered your UI at all, bubt I am looking to remove the Stats from the main window?  I am also interested in getting a larger target window with the same HP bars that change color.</div></div><hr />

I really like your group window, best I have found with the changing health colors and NO boxes! I have been able to swap out other components which I prefered a little different, but I can't get the group window seperate from the chat windows.  I was wondering if it would be possible for you to remove the blue bars from the top of the chat windows that you have.  For me personally I do not need the lables and it only takes more space away since I stack  chat windows vertically. In its place a simple boarder like you have at the bottom of your chat windows, without the chat box of course.<br />
<br />
Any help you could give me here would be greatly appreciated!<br />

I've been using your UI's for a long time now, well, actually I use your UI as a template, then I add in various other windows to compliment it, or customize it to my likings, like, Feebwins group window with the mana thing (nice work there too Feebs).<br />
<br />
I typically do not use your .ini file and retain my own.  I'm not into transparent windows, and hard to read fonts.  Also 1 of the 1st things I do is grab a different compase.  Yours is blue, and so is the line on the compase for proceeding to an LDoN.  I find these are all things I can change myself with little difficulty, and If I get stumped on something, I'm only inspired to learn more so I can figure it out.  Currently, your spell casting window shows up transparent on my screen, and i cant even see the spell book button.  I'm confident I'll figure that out as well, but any pointers would be apreciated.   Best of luck, thank you Zeremus and Feebwin for making my EQ experience more enjoyable, and keep up the good work.<br />

I modded this HoTT window for your interface but I can't get the target of target gauge to change color. The code for color changing is still in the xml. If you could take a look at the code, it would make a nice addition to the UI IMHO.<br />
