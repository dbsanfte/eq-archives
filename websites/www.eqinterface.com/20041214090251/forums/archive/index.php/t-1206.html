as an artist had everything said about my work from &quot;excellent!&quot; to &quot;I wouldnt let my dog **** on it&quot; and worse... so I am not afraid of people telling me what they think about my stuff<br />
<br />
but...<br />
<br />
if you are gonna tell my my stuff is crap at least please tell me why :D so I can make it better.  ie.  Leave comments! After a couple of basement ratings on my skins I am struggling to figure out if something needs work or someone just wasnt fond of the color green :)<br />

My guess for the low rating is that they are doing that rating on the assumption is where is the windows xml.  They probaly dont realize when you say skin their is no xml files included.  The screen shot you are using for the most part looks like the default UI with the inventory and such.  <br />
<br />
I am not sure if you want to list these Skins in a the Miscelaneous category.  Or, maybe the website owner can make a catigory specially marked skins with no XML files included.  That way people could look at the diffrent artwork that you have worked so hard on may be better appreciated.  I appreciate the artists like you and T. King (I believe is the name of the artist that is doing all the spell books) work you been doing on the skins.  I for one am not a artist at all.  I can't even draw a good stick figure person, But I can stay in the lines when coloring. :D <br />
<br />
Please continue the good work and dont let the people that may not understand that your work is a skin only get you down.<br />
