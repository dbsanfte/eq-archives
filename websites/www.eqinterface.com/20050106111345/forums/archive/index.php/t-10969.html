<br />
Red Hat pulls plugs on Red Hat Linux product line<br />
<br />
Red Hat yesterday unveiled its answer to the vexed question of what it should do about its consumer line - dump it. This is not quite how CEO Matthew Szulik put it to The Register over lunch yesterday, nor indeed did he say flat out 'oh, by the way, we're shooting the Red Hat Linux distribution when North Carolina wakes up, bye now,' but that is indeed what the company did. <br />
<br />
Red Hat maintenance and support for Red Hat linux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 8.0 will end as of 31st December 2003, and for Red Hat 9 as of 30th April 2004. &quot;Red Hat does not plan to release another product in the Red Hat Linux line,&quot; says the 'you're fired' email sent out to The Register's Red Hat Network account yesterday. Red Hat Linux channels will remain open for six months after the product's end of life date, but no new errata will be posted after EOL, and no Red Hat Network support accounts could be bought or renewed as of yesterday. So it's very dead, very soon, and Red Hat is now about Red Hat Enterprise and... Fedora. <br />
<br />
The move is a sensible one from the company's point of view because it provides a clear answer to the 'what do we do about the bit that doesn't work' question. It could perhaps have been done a little less brutally, and people who bought RH8 or RH9 both surely have good reason to be sore about how swiftly the support is vapourising (RH8 in particular - a year ago this looked like a product line with a future and a roadmap), but there really was no easy way to do it. A more honest way, probably..<br />

<br />
Personally I'd like to see more of the 'Personal' builds of Linux fold up and get off the market.<br />
<br />
Linux for servers is fine, Linux for home users is a bad thing in my mind. :)  If you are going to use an open source OS go for something build off BSD like FreeBSD or the best of them all Mac OS X. :)<br />
<br />
I know some people may not agree with this but it's just my personal opinion.</div></div><hr />

RH was a nice web server OS. I would say that RH has a good 30% of the market when it comes to web server OS's.<br />

Yah I read neowin daily too... although when I see 10 news articles of MS propaganda I steer clear of the site until it’s over.</div></div><hr />

They only pulled the consumer version off the shelf.  I don't believe too many people run webservers out of their house. (well I do, but I use freebsd).  But I imagine those numbers are still pretty low.<br />
<br />
As for wanting them out of the consumers hands, I disagree.  The more choices out there means exactly that... user choice.  Some people live and die Mandrake, some Redhat, some freebsd, some MacOS, some Windows (oh, I think I may have started a OS religious war here)<br />

<br />
<br />
Their faq will explain their aim better than my crappy english :<br />
Q: Why a project instead of a product? <br />
A:<br />
 A global steering committee at Red Hat decided that Red Hat Linux was suffering from too many compromises as a retail &quot;product&quot;, and that we should redirect our efforts at creating a community-based project. Rather than being run through product management as something that has to appear on retail shelves on a certain date, Fedora Core will be released based on schedules, set by a steering committee, that will be open and accessible to the community, as well as influenced by the community.  <br />

They released their first version a few days ago.</div></div><hr />

You'll be able to move to Fedora. It's essentially RedHat, only it's not supported by tech support. They're gonna work on it, and it's a community thing now. Very cool :)</div></div><hr />
