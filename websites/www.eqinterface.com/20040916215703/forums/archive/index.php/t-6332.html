<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">02-05-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is designed for 1280x1024 resolution with a /viewport 0 0 1121<br />
841 setting.<br />
<br />
Pure melee classes will need to do some slight rearanging to fill in<br />
the spot where the casting bar is.<br />
<br />
I finally broke down and went through the huge PITA of making<br />
custom borders to my UI to pull it all together.<br />
<br />
I finally came up with some gauges I like for the group window,<br />
they are based off some tking art, but I didn't use the full tking<br />
tube becuase its to &quot;buisy&quot; looking for my taste.<br />
<br />
I'm still looking for better spell gems for my casting bar. I'm also<br />
gona replace the book button, the thing looks kinda orphaned<br />
down there.<br />
<br />
I havn't decided what I'm gona put in the area above the buff<br />
window, prolly a timer mod or something, I'm still undecided.<br />
<br />
The compass, target and timer boxes are movable.<br />
<br />
The target box is made fromt he player window, so it gets the<br />
flashing red box in it when attack is on. The timer is made from<br />
the target window.<br />
<br />
Download it here. (http://home.attbi.com/~mbeiser/Files/Caleal2beta.zip)<br />
<br />
I included a .ini file in the zip. Rename it with your character name<br />
and server number and copy it to your Everquest directory.<br />
Backup your .ini file first.<br />
<br />

<br />
Any feedback on it is welcome. =)<br />
<br />
EDIT 2/6/03: <br />
Updated the Inventory window for the 2/6/03 patch. Added in the<br />
charm slot, graphic for the button doesn't currently match the<br />
others, I need to get the artwork done for it.<br />
<br />
Edit 2/17/03: <br />
I cleaned up a LOT of the code in the UI, the UI is now 100% <br />
ompatable with the default EQUI_Animations.xml file. The<br />
EQUI_Animations.xml file is only modified to use the custom buff<br />
backgrounds.<br />
If a patch changes the EQUI_Animations.xml file, just delete my<br />
custom one and you are ready to go! <br />
Fixed the alignment problems with spell gems in the hotbuttons<br />
and spell cast window. <br />
Cleaned up some other alignment issues.<br />
Fixed the charm slot so it has a nicer graphic and added a charm<br />
slot to the inventory tab of the hotbutton window.<br />
Added a few misc things here and there.<br />
<br />
Edit 2/24/03: <br />
Updated for the LoY expansion.<br />
Face and Dye buttons added to the inventory window.<br />
New buttons added to selector window.<br />
Consolidated some of the graphics files into one file.<br />
Reworked gauges in the group window so they are slightly longer<br />
and look better.<br />
Added F key labels to the group window.<br />
Trimmed the code in several windows.<br />
<br />
Edit 3/3/03:<br />
Moved the selector bar under the hotbutton/inventory clickies window.<br />
Created a new pet window with 3 tabs, stats, player info and pet control.<br />
Made the buff and SDbuff windows thinner to widen the viewport a bit.<br />
Added numbers for the buff slots.<br />
Made some new graphics for the buttons used on my tab pages.<br />
Changed the buttons used by the hotbutton window.</div></div><hr />

Nice Job!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks, believe it or not, the layout was somewhat inspired by your UI. When I upgraded my system, I tried your UI, but it wasn't as mouse clicker friendly in raid situations as I wanted. SO I started altering my previous UI to a similar layout, just with everything in a tight area for short mouse travel, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very impressive.<br />
<br />
The 5 by 6 grid for the inventory is kinda nice by itself -- it's compact.  But the way it splits into two tabs in the hotbutton window with that same layout is fantastic.  That is just so slick... the best I've seen.<br />
<br />
Putting all the stats in the selector window is clever too... I never would have thought of using it for anything more than a row of buttons.<br />
<br />
In the target, player, and group windows you put the percentage numbers on top of the bars instead of off to the side.  I really wish more designers would do that.<br />
<br />
I'll also compliment you on getting your work out of the Animations file.  It may be invisible to most, but that's significant.<br />
<br />
The really large main chat window is also good.  Too many designers would leave it about half that size... I wonder whether they actually play the game or just design pretty interfaces.<br />
<br />
The only concern I have with what you've made is that the buff window takes up a whole lot of space.  But on the other hand... what the hell else are you going to put on that edge of the screen?  I suppose you could slide part of the hotbutton window up there... but that might not be so good for mousing.<br />
<br />
I use my keyboard for just about everything, using the mouse only for targeting and for picking up items in inventory, merchant, and loot windows.  So I arrange things a bit differently... for instance my buff window is smaller than your spell gems window, and I don't even keep the spell gems window on the screen, nor the selector window.<br />
<br />
A timer window is an excellent idea for the upper right corner.  Since you already have a timer on the target bar you really don't need a dial timer, but a slider-timer window for timing buffs would work very well.<br />
<br />
What can I say... I like it.  Although I'm not a mouse user, I will recommend this one to friends who are.</div></div><hr />

First off, really want to thank you for your UI work. I use your first version and it's my favorite UI so far.<br />
<br />
That said.. I prefer the party window in the earlier version to this one. It just fits neatly in the corner of my screen and has everything I need to see. Any chance of updating that to include the /lfg button? I know I can bring up the screen by typing /lfg, but I get the UI interface error every time I zone.<br />
<br />
Also, is there any reason why I couldn't take the new inventory window from this version and drop it into the old version? <br />
<br />
Thanks so much!<br />

<br />
Thanks! The good news is that I decided the old version of my UI is ugly, so I'm revamping it to make it look better. The functionality and info displayed will be unchanged exept the spell bar won't slot in beside the group window anymore. I decided to move it out separate so that the UI will be more friendly to melee characters. I'll be finished with it in a couple of days.<br />

I updated the old UI to work with LoY, you can download it here (http://home.attbi.com/~mbeiser/Files/CalealUI1.zip).<br />
It was during the update that I decided it was ugly.  =)<br />
<br />
Also, is there any reason why I couldn't take the new inventory window from this version and drop it into the old version?<br />
<br />
The update in the link above includes the new inventory window. That inventory window will work in any UI.<br />
<br />
You cannot use any of the windows in the new UI in another UI unless you copy the chat window and the graphics files over. All the custom templates for the borders and various Ui2Danimations are in the chat window.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One final question.. is it possible (or difficult) to take the casting bar out of the target window?  I play a bard, and find it more helpful to have a separate casting window that pops up.<br />
<br />
In any event, thanks for all your hard work.. :) <br />

That was one thing I was working on as part of my revamp of the old UI. It now has the spell casting bar as a separate window with a transparent background. Just about any custom spell casting bar will work in my 1024x768 UI. The same is true for my 1280x1024 UI, you would have to slide the group window over and resize the chat window though.<br />

I am a mouse type person, and it is very very very clicky friendly. Only thing I would change is something for that blank spot where you have &quot;Timers here&quot; in the screenie. I dont use any timers, so I just have an empty chat box there for the time being. <br />
