What I mean is an image that I can always have stay in the same spot in the backround and just move all my windows around at will and not mess up the image. (note this would also be with transperant backround images on all windows, which is easy enough to do)</div></div><hr />

I would say no, because to have a picture you need to declare it as a ScreenPiece (like Gauge, or StaticAnimation), and ScreenPieces can only exist if they're in a Screen aka one of the windows.<br />

Just guessing though. Never tried anything like that.<br />

Then you have to deal with bringing all the other windows back on top or you can't click on hp bars etc and have it work.</div></div><hr />
