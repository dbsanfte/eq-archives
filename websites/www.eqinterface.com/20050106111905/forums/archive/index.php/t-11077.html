<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tigerosa</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone else having this prob?  when hit HOME key, which is to center view, i am now looking at knees.  have had many people tell me to right mouse look and get it centered...ummm, if you're like me at all, i hit CENTER so many times during play it's not even funny.  i should NOT have to right mouse look to get center view!  this is what the key is for after all, isn't it?  or am i wrong...<br />
<br />
anyway, ANYONE know how to fix this?  talked to a live chat help person on the Sony site...NO comment on how that went.  will say this:  i'm NOT gonna delete all my EQ operation files just to fix something that is NOT just me btw, check the tech forums on EQ site, it's common problem, not me.<br />
<br />
wondering if somewhere in some XML there is a way to &quot;FORCE&quot; the center x/y on it, cuz i'm so sick and tired of looking at knees all day long.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for tips/help/suggestions/fixes!</div></div><hr />

<br />
any help is MUCH appreciated!!</div></div><hr />
