<br />
When you select &quot;Always Chat Here&quot; for one of you chat windows, why doesn't the UI automatically get rid of the input bar for all the other windows? <br />
<br />
It's unnecessary, since the player has already said they only want to chat in one window, and it takes up screen space that could be used for one extra line of output. Also, it makes it hard to cleanly line up mutiple chat windows ( unless you want to display the empty line, or you want to deal with overlapping chat windows that keep moving focus around every time a line appears in a different one )<br />
<br />
Anyway, just something I was thinking... might be easy to do on thier side and it would be really nice for those of us with mutiple tiled chat windows ( who really only want to SEND chat from one, and read stuff in others )</div></div><hr />
