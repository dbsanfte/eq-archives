<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jabu</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been using a timer in KC.  Everything there in on a 26 min spawn timer.  I have been in the HWL room and after we kill the first Hand I hit my restart key (/loadskin rogue 1).  This restarts my timer at 0:00.  When my timer approaches 24:00 min I tell my group that the room will respawn in 2 min.  We stop pulls and med up for the four pops we will be having in the next 8 min.<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lord Najib</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 things come to mind.<br />
<br />
1)  As an Enchanter of 3 years, I generally know when my mez is about to break just because I have used the spell so much that, you get the feeling &quot;I should remez&quot;.  With a timer, I could wait until the last possible second (counting for casting time) to remez.  <br />
<br />
2)  When you are camping a spot and you either know or learn when the first mob in your &quot;cycle&quot; spawns you can then camp it.  That way, once you've cleared your cycle, someone knows that you have 3 minutes left, which might be a quick afk or even an extra pull from outside your cycle.<br />
<br />
3)  Timing certain buffs to be more efficient.  I have my Epic, so normally I'll use my Epic Haste and just rehaste in between pulls after a while, since it doesn't cost mana.  Occasionally, VoG is better than Epic Haste and with my AA abilities I know it lasts 48.3 minutes.  If I'm at full mana and 40 minutes have passed since I casted VoG on the first tank, I'll probably go ahead and start recasting VoG in between pulls.  If its only 30 mins I might wait a little longer.  <br />
<br />
Now all of this can be done with a stopwatch, some form of clock.  I used to use &quot;chess&quot; clocks to time buffs/spawns.  That requires you to look away from your computer.  Even 2 seconds is a long time when 3 mobs just entered camp (2 of which need to be mezzed, 1 which can flurry) all beating on the warrior.</div></div><hr />
