That is the coolest looking thing ever.<br />

It looks like some of the aura-thingies from Warcraft 3, but still, it kicks ass.</div></div><hr />

didnt you do the orginal version of the WarCraft 3 Icons??<br />
<br />
or did you just never post those here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raxthorne</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes that is correct and I had UI that I had tossed together.  However, that was a very long time ago. Plus there were alot of other people that were using the spell set to make their own cool versions of the spells. In fact, I have a new spell set that I am working on that I will be posting including a complete UI. <br />
<br />
Took some time off from EQ and now that I am back, I am trying to get my head out of my rear and figure out where I left off. LOL<br />

Lots of things have changed here at EQGUI since I have been gone. Site looks great and I really love the interface/features that have been applied to it.<br />

Yea, we have grown, we just passed 150,000 members. We are continuing to grow.. Our last major upgrade was servers.. we can now handle about 800 people at one time with no stress on the system (this was our max before), and about 1,200 before we seen any serious lag, and in &quot;combat mode&quot; (graphics turned down) we could get to nearly 2,000 people at one time.<br />
<br />
Send me an email with what all you have planned to release, I would like to see what you have in mind..(don't wanna drag it out here in public)...  (send any pre-release screenshots if you have some) send it to kudane@eqinterface.com.<br />
<br />
talk to you soon..<br />

Is it possible to remove the default background from this ring so that only your work is shown?<br />
<br />
I like the work you did on this and would like to get rid of the hazy background if the is possible. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I currently use the Mythal rune ring but this one looks nicer so will probably swap to it.  Just wish it rotated.<br />

I haven't had time to study the rings myself to learn their secrets :)<br />

Don't ask me what is different between the two.  I can't tell from looking and I didn't see an explanation in the text.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use version 2 of the Mythal ring meself. The difference between the 2 is that the first one has thinner runes and thicker interior borders. While v.2 has thicker runes with thinner interior borders.<br />
<br />
I also like the Majestic ring this post is about. Great work! I would think about switching to this one if it rotated. Any plans to make a rotating version of this ring?</div></div><hr />

Well that was quick! I took a look and I know how he is doing it. The VI ring bug is still there, however he has found a very clever work around.<br />

First off, I think this is very cool.  <br />
<br />
I do have a question however.  I've been out of EQ for about 4 months and lots has changed....so, Which file do I make the change in?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help ahead of time. :D <br />

I can't seem to find any info on how to install these other then copy and paste the files to a directory, which I have done, over written files and I still get the default one...</div></div><hr />

Mine just shows the runic ring and nothing outside ... it's been like that for a while, even the default one was acting up strange :/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can edit the ring yourself to be purple on even con if you really want.<br />
<br />
Open the TargetIndicator.ini file you downloaded of the flavor for your choice.<br />
<br />
Under the [FairMatch] tag (which is the white/black/even tag), scroll down to the last three Variables (The Red/Blue/Green values) and replace them with this:<br />
<br />
Red=255<br />
Green=0<br />
Blue=255<br />
<br />
That should make it purple for ya.</div></div><hr />

I've tried looking at the code but i can't figure out what's wrong with it. everything works reletively fine. it spins and  everything but somewhere in the cycle of things i get a solid thick circle flashing amidst the lovely designs it's like a pattern design design design design design solid thingy design design design design design solid thingy etc etc etc it goes on and on and is really detering from the beauty of this piece. <br />
