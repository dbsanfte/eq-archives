<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just played with the basic windows in EQ. The WDT_Rounded and the WDT_RoundedNoTitle. But, I'll share what I've learned.<br />
<br />
Here's a little Break down on what elements are what:<br />

I was gonna just pop in the names into the .tga file, but then I realized it's too small. So, I extracted the necessary elements into a new file.<br />
<br />
Do note, the Red Borders are the sizes in the EQUI_Amination.xml file, including the Border itself.<br />
If you can squeeze your graphics in there, do that. The less you alter in the Animations file, the better off you will be when it comes to patch time. ;)<br />
<br />
Borders are quite confusing in EQ. Especially the title bar. That was a major b** to figure out at first.<br />
<br />
And yes, that 17x2 on WithTitleTopLeft is a bug. It's at 99, 113 and really should be 100,113 at 16x2.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some better understand the borders and how they are layed out in the TGA file.<br />
<br />
It's late, but I might see about adding the cordinates into the picture at a later date.<br />
<br />
