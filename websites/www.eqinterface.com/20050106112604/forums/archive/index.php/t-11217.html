Having RL issues and with all new changes to the UIs I have mixed, some XML files have become obsolete and I am not that well prompted with writing them hours on end. For the questions that I have been getting for the apperance of my UIs is simple, just find the UI that woks for you. Then, change the window pieces 01-0? and the window_bg Dark/Light rock. You do not have to download another UI folder to get these files, just open and extract those files you want into the UI folder you have now. As of late, I haven't the time for make new UIs and I have no idea as to when I will post anymore. I thank those for writing back and asking me about the UI, but all you need to do is find what ya want then mix it together and if it doesn't work I would suggest asking the original (non-mixed) author for to achieve what you desire.:cool:</div></div><hr />
