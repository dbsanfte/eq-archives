<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">09-20-2002, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay this is my first shot at making a UI. I expounded in the concept that Trajen came up with for a wood elf style interface. First things first. Credits go out to the following for this interface:<br />
<br />
Jrajen for the UI outline artwork.<br />
<br />
Drakah and Oguler for a lot of the underlying code. <br />
<br />
T King for the awsome artwork on spellbooks and gems etc.<br />
<br />
Kalthanan for the Druid Epic Cursor which is sooo cool.<br />
<br />
Having said that here is a look at the product i came up with. It is written for 1280 X 1024 Resolution.<br />
<br />
Here is a link to the files<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilras</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can host it on my server if you can get it to me. No chance of it going down since it's my server. Unless I crash it again by spilling coffee on it, =o/.<br />
ICQ is about the best way I can think of transfering it to someone. Since I hate AIM.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I NEVER figured there would be that much interest in this UI.  However, it would seem that my like 5Gig bandwidth limit was hit right away after i posted it.  I appologize for that and will have to find somewhere to host it.  I have a server myself but it isnt online all the time and bacause its DSL isnt always reliable.  If someone wants to host the UI let me know how to get it to you ie FTP, email, MSN file transfer etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks and sorry for hold up.<br />
<br />
Moderator of downloads APPARENTLY doesnt want to post it since its still not up there.<br />
<br />
Probably my fault for modifying soo many files.  and then posting the whole directory.  But hey im a newbie<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilras</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll host it. My server runs T3 has only gone down once in the 4 years I've had it and that's cause I spilt coffee on it/in it. <br />
<br />
Computer insides and liquids do NOT MIX!!<br />
<br />
You have my ICQ and MSN try to catch meh when you can, I'll upload it and give you the addy fer it.</div></div><hr />

I uploaded it to my server. Hopefully you guys don't kill my poor lil puter. <br />
please people lets PLEASE try not to kill my server.<br />
<br />
http://spitfire.mavericksworld.com/EQGUI/druidui.zip<br />
<br />
I've decided to put it in the directory I use for my web pages so it stays out of my way. As with all downloads from unknown sources follow the easy simple common sense rules.<br />
<br />
D/L it.<br />
Virus Scan it.<br />
Double Check it's what you want.<br />
Enjoy it.<br />
<br />
If it's corrupted let me know and I'll reupload it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually yes... I'm looking at doing one for my troll warrior right now with a very similar layout because its easy on teh eyes and encompasses almost everything worth seeing....  I just need to come up with the right garphics for the dashbaord so to speak<br />
<br />
Keep an eye peeled <br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byzandula</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GREAT UI....however...you can't winimize windows :( and you can't drag them around....I sure do wish that could happen....since I have 5 windows open at any given time :) and I hate having to rezise them.....hopefully in next release it will be tweaked...but thats me....or of corse if you do custom fixes...email me...

Otherwise greap UI.<br />
:nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chat windows are kinda specific to the layout.  Which ones would you want to move?  The hitsmodes are locked into their viewbox and the main chat is also.  They can be moved by unlocking them but the remainder of the stuff in the UI is tied to the layout on the bottom moving them would be.... well ugly.  The spam window opn the left side can also be moved by being unlocked...  I set the background alpha to 0 so the frames cant be seen and it will be transparent but all that can be changed as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am also currently working to change the inventory container windows to something more liek the rest of the interface.  What is there is borrowed from techno donuts which is an awsome mod but it doesnt fit with the rest of the UI so Im working to make them the same as the rest of the UI.  Also putting in a set of pet controls in the next release.  Problem im having with the container windows is that I'm an idiot when it comes to masking etc on teh graphics so I can't seem to get them to work right.  Madly studying how to mask images etc and understand different layers..  I use PSP 7.0 to make graphics and I'm kinda new to all the graphic work heheh.  I'm also working on warrior class and evil class mod os the same style layout.  Something about the dashboard layout that just appeals to me.  Ayway will keep yaz posted and will post updates to druidui as I complete them.<br />
<br />
Back to studying graphics UGH :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wanna let ya know you've done great job on the skin.<br />
<br />
LOVE it except that you really need to modify some really necessary things:<br />
<br />
1) Enable create, resize, move and close chat windows<br />
<br />
2) Enable pet controls.<br />
<br />
PLEASE...this will make it all perfect!<br />

Kudos.</div></div><hr />

All my chat stuff goes to the small hits screen and i cant even scroll up to see it.  Can anyone offer any solutions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with chat windows is not related to the UI. This is something caused by the patch itself and is not something that can be fixed in the UI. Just go in and reset all of your chat filters to the way you want them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fezzig</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I loaded this prior to the 10/16 patch and everything was beautiful... Then the patch hit.. Whammo! Crash to desktop every time I try to load it... So after much trial and error. (ended up adding each file individually while switching back and forth to verify the effects) I finally found that the UI_CastingWindow.XML file is what's causing my Crashes.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else running into this problem? I pulled that file out and it's running great now with the default SpellCasing window. If you know anything, let me know :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Few comments.<br />
<br />
1:  Please come out with a 1024x768 version.  I run a lot smoother at that reso.<br />
<br />
2:  Noticed when I had a full group, you can't see the name/health bar of the final person in the group, just the %health.  looked through the file &amp; think I found the fix.<br />
<br />
 &lt;Gauge item=&quot;GW_Gauge5&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;ScreenID&gt;Gauge5&lt;/ScreenID&gt; <br />
- &lt;!-- &lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt;<br />
  --&gt; <br />
- &lt;TextColor&gt;<br />
  &lt;R&gt;240&lt;/R&gt; <br />
  &lt;G&gt;240&lt;/G&gt; <br />
  &lt;B&gt;240&lt;/B&gt; <br />
  &lt;/TextColor&gt;<br />
  &lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt; <br />
- &lt;Location&gt;<br />
  &lt;X&gt;22&lt;/X&gt; <br />
  &lt;Y&gt;206&lt;/Y&gt; &lt;--------------------  This line here was 2066<br />
  &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
 <br />
I just went in and deleted one of the 6s.<br />
<br />
3.  You can modify the chat windows and the buff window to suit your needs.  Just requires that you move the custom ui files out of the directory to go back to standard.  It does change the look, but then you can resize and change the filter on them.  With the hitsmode windows, you need to unlock the right pane, move it up off of the chat windows, and then you can resize &amp; select your filters to go to those chat windows.<br />
<br />
That's what I saw that needs tweaking.  Overall, well worth the download though :D</div></div><hr />

ps spiritwalker, you made a badass ui here soon as it gets working</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritwalker</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it is actually the animations file that broke it guys.  I was doing some things that are booboos in the last patch so Im working on 4 new UIs based on WC3 right now.  Watch the complete sets section over the next week.  I'm trying to see if I can get a subcvategory for them so they can all be obtained without searching for them.  2 resolutions 1280x1024, and 1024x768 are in the releases.  I wont go lower as it simply makes arranging everything impossible.<br />

See yas soon<br />

Absolutely love the UI and I have NEVER posted about a UI before....  This one ROCKS !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ryuuko</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey 8~) I downloaded this a few days ago, (spent 2 hours trying to figure out how to get it to work). I originally downloaded the normal one (not the mirror) and put it in C:/programfiles/sony/everquest trilogy/UI files/ Druid UI (made a folder for it). Didnt work. Tried it again with the mirror, copied all the files into my druid UI folder, and it worked....once. Beautiful UI......but now everytime i log into my character....it loads....and then drops me to my desk top! Unfortunately....I had to delete it to log back in 8~(.  Any way of fixing this? I'd really love to use this UI!<br />

From what i saw......8/10<br />
