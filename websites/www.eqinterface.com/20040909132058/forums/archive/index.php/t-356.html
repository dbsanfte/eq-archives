<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/skyknights/Oguler's%20Spellbook%20Mod.jpg<br />
<br />
This mod makes the spellbook no longer a book, but rather a tanned animal hide.  It would probably be best for Beastlords, Druids, Rangers, and Shamans.  This is a complete modification of the window and it's layout, so it may take a moment to get used to.<br />
<br />
1. replaced the spellbook graphics with an animal skin.<br />
2. rearranged the items on the spellbook (spells, buttons, gauges, etc) to fit on the skin.<br />
3. did away with the window totally.  all you see is the animal skin, adds an interesting overall effect.<br />
<br />
Note: some of the text for the spell names may occasionally &quot;leak&quot; out off the skin, but not much (only 3 spell slots I know of have this problem, and that's only if they have really long names).  Best option for this is to move spells that run into this problem into another slot.<br />

Click your browser's refresh button to see the new screenshot, I got the text to be more legible, by making the artwork on the animal skin to be more faded (lighter).  this should make life easier for everyone :)</div></div><hr />

This just goes to show things to come from people are going to be looking good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very nice.  Very unique.   It's things like this that make me wonder what the future will hold for UI's.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe I submitted the mod to eqinterface.com a couple days ago, just waiting till they finally get to it there, I'm sure they are swamped with mods coming in all the time :P</div></div><hr />

If you could post here how to get rid of them it would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'll post one without buttons soon then.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm also going to check the &quot;mem page&quot; buttons and see if they actually got those working yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starshelle</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am SO using this for my troll beastlord. :) My eyes nearly popped out of my head when I saw this. I would be very interested in a version without the buttons. I don't think a Done button is even necessary. I just press ESC when I'm done with my spellbook. I liked your other skins too but a background with bears on it didn't seem right for a troll, so I'll be holding out for something like that. Again..WoW :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizzestra</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In reference to the buttons. How about making them look like rune stones or rocks or something? That would go much better with the whole theme and still retain total functionality.<br />
<br />
Just my humble 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been thinking of making them look more like some tribal artwork that is on the skin, but I dunno.  the buttons can be made hidden, if you modify the XML to make the left and right (page up and page down) buttons 0 width and heigh (cx &amp; cy respectively), and you make the done button's bottom a larger value than the top (or was it top larger value than bottom, I forget...).<br />
<br />
I've been playing the game, as opposed to tweaking it for a couple days, to kinda take a break from the mods, but I'll get back to this eventually :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is one of the coolest spellbook changes I've seen :)<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion though (This is coming from the opinion of a shaman =P)<br />
<br />
Maybe there could be slightly different versions for different classes (probably too much work to do it though).<br />
<br />
But for shamans I would take out that circular(sp?) Design in the background and maybe replace it with the look of the shaman epic. That look ring thingy around the end of the spear.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Here is an awesome pic of the epic.<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion though. I'll probably do something like that..soon as I learn the first thing about doing something like that :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Awesome though, keep up the great work :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I got the design by taking a picture of the animal skin with my digital camera, and then cut it from the background, then lightened up the design so the text could stand out better, it would prove to be difficult, at best.  my artistic skills are not that great, unless I have something tangible already done, I do image manipulations, not drawing from scratch :)</div></div><hr />
