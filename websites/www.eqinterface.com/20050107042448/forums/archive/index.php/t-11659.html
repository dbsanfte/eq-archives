4.) logged on and tried to upload it, but didnt work.<br />

<br />
When you right click on the link and choose “save as” rename the file to  something.zip and you should have no problem. Or upgrade your internet browser to the latest version and that should fix the problem too.<br />
<br />
Once you get the file renamed as a .zip you should be able to follow the directions in the faq.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tried the zip file download- when i right clicked on the link and hit save as, the only thing other then ram that it can be saved as is &quot;All files&quot;. I tried this, but it just ended up saving it under ram anyways. any pointers on this?<br />
<br />
Updatin internet browsers- hehe didnt even know you could do this, any links to any sites where this can be done? <br />
<br />
<br />
once again thanks for help and sorry about my lack of knowledge</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry... I didnt see this.<br />
<br />
To open rar files you need to use the program winRAR.<br />
http://www.rarlabs.com<br />
<br />
I'll be contacting the author to make it a zip since most people dont know what rar's are. The file shouldnt of been aproved by us for download.</div></div><hr />
