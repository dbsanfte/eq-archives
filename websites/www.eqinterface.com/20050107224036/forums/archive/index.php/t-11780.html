<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moriza</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night after triggering the 8th coldain ring war and killing the chief, I sadly discovered that my confirmation box was broken.  I was unable to loot no drop head, because confirmation box came up with no Yes/No buttons.  It was also missing minimize/title/close in the title bar.<br />
<br />
This is happening using default UI, with freshly repatch /default files.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions... kinda makes raiding/questing a bad thing to do if I am unable to loot no drop items.  Less important, but equally annoying I am unable to drop/destroy items due to the same bug, unless I turn on fast drop/destroy.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
2. if this is happening in the DEFAULT UI, there isnt anything I know to suggest. search on SOE's tech forum and see if they have posted anything about it. nothing we could suggest would change the default UI, it repatches evertime.<br />
<br />
3. might try using a FULL UI, and see if you get the same issue.<br />
<br />
Good Luck..<br />

The fact that it is only affecting a small amount of people makes me believe its some common denominator between those affected's hardware.  Make sure you /report this bug to Sony in game as they are the only one who can fix it and wont until they are aware of it.  <br />

same problem here with my main but i could accept resses <br />
<br />
I was told to reinstall and i did and now i can't reload any UI skins that i like</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elyias Steefang</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same exact thing happened to me.  Even looked at the xml code in my default UI compared to my brother in laws.  Nothing was different.  Ended up taking a complete reinstall to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trouble may be in one of your .ini files.  I think it is related to the No Drop Conformation toggle setting (Always/Only if can use/Never).<br />
<br />
Try renameing your &lt;charactername&gt;_&lt;servername&gt;.ini and your eqclient.ini files and see if that solves it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaazek</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same thing happens to me every once and awhile. What I do is just reload my UI using the ini files to keep all my window settings. Works everytime so far for me.<br />
<br />
I use SARS4, Drakah Integrated Steel, and the Drakah SWG skins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">catterly</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I deleted everything that had to do with catterly, this  was suggested here on another thread:<br />
<br />
Delete eqmain.dll<br />
Delete eqgame.exe<br />
Delete eqgfx_dx8.dll<br />
Repatch Full File Check.<br />
<br />
In some cases, you need to go further.<br />
Delete *.OPT.<br />
Delete EQClient.ini<br />
(you'll need to reset a lot of options after this one, but has led to a fix many times.)<br />
<br />
I did all that, and deleted my UI. Also deleted anything that said Catterly_rathe etc etc in my files. Then re-patched with full file check.<br />
<br />
Not sure which of the above fixed it, but it did fix it. I had to re do all my socials, friends list, and options. Also had to re download my UI but it was worth it.<br />
<br />
So if you are at your wits end this may help you.<br />

<br />
I had an old ui (about a year old) that included a confirmation box file in it.  I copied that file to my new ui.  Now all is fine.<br />
<br />
What didnt work:<br />
<br />
Deleting eqmain.dll, Deleting eqgame.exe, etc etc- in short, following the recommended fix.   (I didnt try deleting the *.opt nor the .ini files because that just didnt make sense- because my old ui worked fine. )<br />
<br />
I also tried deleting the confirmation box file from the default ui and re-downloading it.  I tried a full file check.  <br />
<br />
What I noticed-  loading the default ui didnt work.  *BUT* reloading my old tried and true ui worked.  I got those nasty red messages about it not conforming but sheesh! that was better than not getting rezzes!<br />
<br />
I checked the folder for my old ui, and it included a confirmation box file!  My uneducated guess- something about the confirmation box file in the current default is messed up.<br />
