<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2771<br />
<br />
Go take a look... now the question is... <br />
Is there anyone capable of making this grafic image smoother? less pixilated?  I downloaded the Gimp program... to find out I am extreamly lacking in any artistic talent (well I do know what looks good, but just cant make it happen).<br />
<br />
Is there anyone who could possibly modify the tga to make the font look smooth and sexy?   This presently is my favorite 3dTarget, but honestly looks iffy when you have something targeted near ya...<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time... oh and Thank you Blackhorse for making it.</div></div><hr />

I downloaded it as well and, having a Radeon card, have thus far been disappointed...can't wait till someone figures out how to make it work.  Not knowing anything about graphics, that person will not be me...<br />

(Have a Nvidia card)  The issue is with the specific graphic in this ring.<br />
The Font looks very pixilated... and in the end there may not be any fix... <br />
<br />
When attempting to edit the image... it appears that there is no way to smooth out the pixilation with my skills and knowledge.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a suggestion?</div></div><hr />

You would probably have to redraw the image at a higher resolution.  <br />
<br />
Ok, on that note, are there any requirements on the TGA file?<br />
<br />
Min / Max Resolution?<br />
min / max # pixels?<br />
min / max file size?<br />
<br />
If not any min / max requirements, is there a point of diminising returns, or even a point of degrading returns on FPS when using a TGA, of such and such size?<br />
<br />
Thanks, and as usual, your time and insight are appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pontus</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My two cents would be.....rasterize the text, then zoom in and patch it all up as best you can. Just remember, there seems to be a pretty high zoom factor built into the way EQ reads the target ring file, so this might be something we just have to live with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aridale Belmont</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If theres no pixel wise size req on the file then you could just resize it to be larger and redo the text with the tengwar(sp?) font at the larger size.  Its more memory for the texture but it will look better ingame.  1024x1024 is a really good rez for high quality ingame textures.  Im not sure EQ supports higher than 256x256 tho.<br />
<br />
On the topic Im workin on basically a recolor of the default window parts.  But even tho its just a recolor it shouldnt effect the speed at which that ui loads and cause the fps to drop.  But I DO notice a very major difference when I load my ui.  I save the images at the same rez as normal and 16bit 256color tga files.  Any idea whats up?</div></div><hr />
