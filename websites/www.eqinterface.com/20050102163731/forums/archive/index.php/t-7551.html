<br />
just install desired UI ..and change the UI_&lt;charactername&gt;_&lt;server#&gt;.ini file to that character or you nad /loadskin &lt;uifoldername&gt; in game with logged in character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amberle_saryrn</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I loaded NightElf 2004c (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2995) for my ranger, and after a couple of tries, we got it to work beautifully. I even changed the filter spam on the three windows to the left and got everything to my liking. Liked it so much, in fact, that I decided to go ahead and find another UI for my monk.<br />
<br />
That's when the trouble started. I couldn't decide between  Vehlsmonk (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3183)and Monk UI for GOD (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2015)  so downloaded them both, unzipped them (made sure they weren't in subfolders), then headed in game to try them both out. Did Vehl's first and liked it, but decided to try the other one, and it didn't load properly. The windows were all over the screen and the graphics looked like the Vehls graphics, so I tried to change back to the Vehls UI. <br />
<br />
I now can't get the .ini file to load the windows in the correct order/placement for the monk, and furthermore, it has now also messed up the window placement on NightElf for a different character! Nothing I try seems to work, including unzipping the original download and renaming the included .ini file (which I then copy to the EQ directory, overwriting that characters .ini file) <br />
<br />
The errors text log says pretty much the same thing for nightelf and vehls. Would appreciate ANY help! <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
PS I don't have two different EQ directories.</div></div><hr />

Given that the ini file included with the UI worked once, I am going to bet that you made an error when you tried to use it a second time.  Some possible errors are:<br />
<br />
1) You were logged in as that character when you tried to copy the file and EQ overwrote it immediately.<br />
<br />
2) You got the ini filename wrong.</div></div><hr />

I camp out to char select before making changes to the ini files, and the file name error might happen once, but not repeatedly, on both characters. <br />
any other ideas?</div></div><hr />
