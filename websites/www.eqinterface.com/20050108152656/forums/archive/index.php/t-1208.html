I can't load any mods... According to the error log, I couldn't load my mod because of CompassWnd.xml or something... Help? Anyone? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you change CompassWnd.xml file at all?  If not, delete it from the folder that you have your mod in, it will then use the standard one from the default folder, which is patched to the correct version every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rinnloch</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried that... This is the message is shows in the error log...<br />
<br />
[Sun Aug 18 22:25:29 2002] [Line:5 Source:UIFiles\Default\EQUI_CompassWnd.xml] Couldn't find class:item 'A_CompassOverlay' reference in FieldParseItemOfClass()<br />
<br />
[Line:19 Source:UIFiles\Default\EQUI_CompassWnd.xml] Couldn't find class:item 'A_CompassStrip' reference in FieldParseItemOfClass()<br />
<br />
So in other words, I can't load a mod with the compass IN the folder and I can't load a mod with the compass DELETED. Grr... So frustrating. :(<br />
<br />
[Thanks for tryin' Muse...]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tagarog</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sounds like it is looking for the updated TGA file. Copy the window04.tga (something like that) from the default to the mod directory and it should work fine, unless the mod you use changed that TGA file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rinnloch</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That didn't work either.<br />
<br />
I'm using Slim Jim's Player Window and Geddine's Buff Bar. Those are my only modifications to the new UI... <br />
<br />
I think my problems lies with the compass. Sigh. I'm about ready to just screw all mods and just deal with the things I don't like about the new UI... Like the buff bar. Pfft. :(<br />
<br />
Thanks, though. I appreciate the input, Tagarog.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkDragoonX</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your problem is with the buff Window,the AnimationXML for it,will not work with the Compass.<br />
<br />
To Fix this,copy the AnimationsXML from your defalt Folder,and place it in the folder of the skin you want to use.I had the same problem and this fixed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try this then.  Am I right in guessing that this is a mod that you got or set up prior to the last patch, or maybe hasn't been corrected?  Sounds like with that error message, it's looking in the EQUI_Animations.xml file for those items and not finding them.  If you have an old EQUI_Animations.xml file in your mod folder, that will happen.  Just delete that as well.<br />
<br />
As a rule, only include the files that you absolutely need (i.e. were changed for the mod) in the mod folder.  If the game wants it and can't find it, it will look for them in the default folder and nothing bad happens.  If you try and keep them all in the mod folder, the game could patch them and then cause crashes because it's reading the old one out of the mod folder and not the new one that it needs.  You should never need to copy files from default to the mod folder to get it to work correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rinnloch</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It worked! I simply deleted the Animation.xml!<br />
<br />
