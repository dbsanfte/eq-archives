&quot;Your XML files are not compatible with current EverQuest files. Certain windows may not preform correctly. Use &quot;loadskin defult&quot; to load EverQuest defult skin&quot; <br />
<br />
I did the EQUI_animations patch fix. I did a search for the other files that were changed in the patch but I do not have them except in my Defult Skin.<br />
<br />
Everything seems to be running fine. My UI is looking good but I get the message above and this is the error in my UI errors txt...<br />
<br />
Would someone please tell me what this means and how to fix?<br />
Thanks for listening. :D<br />

I am sorry this post is so long. :(<br />
EDIT: Forgot to add that I used the Kaori4.0/mods to build my UI.<br />
EDITAGAIN: Took out all that stuff that was not errors. :D Nothing but a bunch of spam now that I was taught what real errors look like.</div></div><hr />

The rest are not really errors... its just saying you dont have that file in your custom folder so its going to use the default file. In Martha Stewarts words &quot;Its a good thing&quot;.<br />
<br />
You can perform the updates listed by Cairenn here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?threadid=5314) to update your xml. Or you can search the forum (useing the name of your interface) and see if some one has a downloadable patch.</div></div><hr />

 I updated everything but I can't load my UI. Puts me straight to the dulfult. <br />
 I looked around for info on  this but couldn't find it. :( <br />
Here is the error. ..<br />

Thanks again for directing me to where I need to look for the fixes.  :D<br />

<br />
Unless you really like your petwindow you could always remove EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml (just rename it or move it away dont have to delete it) from your custom skin folder and see if it loads up ok.</div></div><hr />
