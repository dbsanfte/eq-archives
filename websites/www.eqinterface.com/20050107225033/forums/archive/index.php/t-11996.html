I have been having trouble with the new Thomus King class animations i downloaded the file from the Featured Section and ran the installer from within my Custom UI Folder and when Remmy.exe ran if came up with this Message, &quot;&quot;MSCOMCTL.OCX or one of its dependencies not correctly registered a file is missing or invalid&quot; i figured it may be because of the Microsoft(r) .Net Framework program you needed so i downloaded and installed that and tried again but with no success so can anyone please tell me where i am going wrong.<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I can say is do a search on www.microsoft.com for that file, it's a common file that is typically on all Windows based systems, however I'm going to see if Remelio can make it without special .ocx controls, I don't think listboxes are necessary for the patch program, and I believe there is a way that he can compile it to have the needed resources built into the .exe itself, making seperate dependencies uncessary...sorry thinking outloud LOL<br />

I'm not entirely sure, but this might work:<br />

Wow i never expected Thomus himself to actually reply to my problem i feel so honoured hehe :) anyway i tried your idea Thomus but when i ran the download it said i actually needed Visual Basic 5.0 in order for the Patch to work and i dont seem to have that on my system :( i am not sure where i should go next i guess i have to find that on MsN oh well.<br />

I think I'll try to get the new remmy.exe out sometime Thursday.  I have a combat window I need to get posted as well.</div></div><hr />
