*groans*  Ok, I tried to pull down just a compass mod by itself to play around.  I copied in the compass xml and the image.  Short story it did not work.<br />
<br />
I recopied the Stone Grey xml file back in, reloaded the UI and it works.<br />
<br />
Problem fixed.<br />
----------------------------------<br />

Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I have been using various UI's from here and loved many of them.  I recently started using Stone Grey 1.4 and I have noticed the compass is not accurate.  For example, when the compass is telling me I am heading north and am in fact heading NE.  When the compass says NE, I am heading E, when the compass says heading South, I am really going SW.<br />
<br />
I did not want to post this until my sense heading was 200, which it is now and the problem continues and I verified this by watching the arrow on my LoY maps.  I do not have this problem with the default UI.  <br />
<br />
I have also noticed I cannot trust the blue line from LDoN.  <br />
<br />
Everything else about the custom UI works fine.<br />
<br />
Thank your for your time.</div></div><hr />
