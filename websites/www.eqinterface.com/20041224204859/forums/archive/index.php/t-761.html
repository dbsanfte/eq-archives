Anyway, Ive been fooling with trying to tweek the graphics of some of the great mods already out there just for personal preference. The problem is when I load them the graphics don't change. Ive tried looking through the XML files but all I've seen is links to the graphic files. So in my mind, they should work. But they don't. Obviously im missing something or I wouldnt have this problem hehe. Anyone know if there is a simple way to change the XML or whatever it is so that the graphics I tweek will load? I can pop open notepad and change the XML around, I do HTML so Im not totally stupid.<br />

Any help would be great, thanks.<br />

I have simply changed the two background tga files.  I have changed nothing in any XML.  One of the two (happens to be the dark background) does not change from the default, while the light one does change to my update.  I have verified that the files are both my updated files.  I have tried just putting those two files in a custom UI directory and have tried putting them in a directory with a full copy of the default UI.<br />

Any ideas?</div></div><hr />
