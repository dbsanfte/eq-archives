<br />
and have known about eq interface since day one <br />
<br />
i myself much prefer eq interface over eqskins <br />
<br />
was easier to find and view the stuff then eqskins and i also found that it seems most stuff on here is on that one as well <br />
<br />
i will continue to use this site instead <br />
<br />
thanx for all the hard work you are doing for us <br />
<br />
please keep it up its wonderful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. The way EQ Skins developed their website is a bit comfusing.<br />
<br />
Top of that, they used a script that's more for news based sites, making it even harder for an interface download site.<br />
<br />
Just don't go with an idea like their, and you'll be set. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran across EQSkins, too.  And I'll take EQInterface over them any day.  My biggest concern was that they just post the downloads w/ player ratings.  I like how you have Tested/Untested/Needs Update.  That makes those of us who want a &quot;finished&quot; product and not something that may very well crash our computer more willing to download and give it a shot.<br />
<br />
Besides that, the layout is not nearly as easy to scan through and decipher as yours.  This is new to a very large number of people and you've given us a way to feel more comfortable with taking it on - by making it easy and user friendly.<br />
<br />
Keep up the great work!<br />

<br />
I get a white &quot;under construction&quot; page for the last few hours.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use this: http://newui.technosapien.net<br />
<br />
Some reason he is having problems with the domain forwarder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed your using a forwarder. Why not just park the site on the domain?<br />
<br />
Web server not allow it or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kudane just had it forward becuase he wasnt sure if the server he is on is a perm. solution. I dont know if his current host has domain pointers or not.<br />
<br />
Although in a couple weeks things will be changeing soon :) *zips lip*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha .. Well good. Can't wait for the switch. :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, as Dolby said, i was not sure what i would need when i started this project, sooo i set it as a simple forward.<br />
<br />
and the DNS company that does the forwarding for my registrar is having some problems..<br />
<br />
not to worry these things happen and get solved<br />
<br />
<br />
and yes... as Dobly said, things will improve/move quicker in the next few weeks including a parked site..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brian over at EQSkin and I are working out a deal where EQInterface will host the mods, and he will continue to host Character profiles. this will conincide with the new EQInterface.com Download section which should go live next week.. (if all goes well)<br />
<br />
He has a good site,  He is just doing alot and its taking a drain on his resources..<br />
<br />
SOOOOO EQInterface.com to the rescue!!! (hehehe)<br />
<br />
He is a decent person and offers some good things there.. and had kindly asked/offered to let us do what we do best.. you should see links to EQGui and EQInterface pop-up there in the next few days..<br />
<br />
