Any one else been having this same problem. I've only had this since the last patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the problem you are having is based on the new graphics bug... er, feature that is that they implemented recently.  My game was working fine in windowed mode until they put that in, then it was running slowly in windowed mode.  Since then, I upgraded my video drivers (NVidia).  Since then, more than half the times that I try to go into windowed mode I get a black screen and can only free my cursor.  I end up having to end the program.  Not exactly crashing, but probably a similar problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just crashed trying to get back into full screen mode in EQ from being in windowed mode (Alt+Enter). I too got the black screen when I went into windowed mode, and as soon as ALT+Entered back - CRASH!<br />
<br />
Guess I'll just have to wait to be able to get into windows mode till they get this issue resolved. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
Windows running at 32bit + EQ at 16bit = black Screen, or different color dephts in the whole make a black screen.<br />
<br />
As I said, I dont know if its really the cause, but I hope this can help you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your UIErrors file is fine. Those are just files that the custom skin did not customize, so it is pulling it from default. Not really an error. In any case, I would doubt the UI is your problem from crashing as the EQ Tech Board is full of client crashings not being UI related.</div></div><hr />

ATI has as many if not more issues with the DX 9 patch than nVidia. 99% of the crashes I've heard reported were from ATI Radeon 9XXX series users</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brenlo stated the following:<br />
For the Alt Enter crash, try deleting your eqclient.ini.   It may be that you are trying to change to a resolution that is no longer supported by your card driver combo.  (This actually happened to me and was fixed this way)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.. I haven't tried it yet... But will soon when I log back in.</div></div><hr />

I resolved it by playing with the EQ resolutions and the resolution I was running my desktop at. After that I never crashed any more... usually have to reduce your destop resolution to get it to work.</div></div><hr />

Logged on today Monday same problem crash after crash went back to old EQ interface still crashing then I read the post here about rolling back the video drivers.<br />
<br />
I rolled back my drivers and it worked great been playing for almost 3 hours no crashes, no video blips, no disappearing mobs and I can target mobs again.<br />

I am not a computer wiz in fact if my computer had a sharp edge I'd end up cutting myself on it.  What I dont understand is why the folks as Sony didn't know this could be a problem or at least if you were suffering from these symptons why they didnt say, hey why not roll back your drivers.<br />
<br />
I am expecting too much from the Sony programers, not trying to be a butthead but isnt that what they get paid for?  Ok I've ranted enough and I must say I am generally very pleased with EQ and I suppose for all the lines of code and various computers and all I shouldn't complain.<br />

Rolling back drivers did work for me.<br />
