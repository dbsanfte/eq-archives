<br />
I recently got PSP 8 and have been having fun using it to fiddle with images, so thought I would try out fiddling with UI stuff by messing with making a new inventory picture for my UI. <br />
<br />
After reading tutorials and figuring out how to make an alpha channel, my image FINALLY shows up on my UI, but it has colored lines through the top of it that aren't in the saved version.<br />
<br />
Version saved to UI file:<br />

<br />
How it shows up in EQ: <br />

<br />
Does anyone have an idea why the lines might be showing up in EQ?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Etain</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I haven't figured out the why, but I was able to fix the problem by letting the first few pixel lines of the original inventory window show through the image. <br />
<br />
To make the image, I took the original inventory box, put the frame and the background on two different layers, and fit my picture in on a layer between them. To fix it, I added a masking layer over the picture layer, but under the frame layer, and let the first few lines of the background show through.<br />
<br />
Just in case anyone was wondering. ;)</div></div><hr />
