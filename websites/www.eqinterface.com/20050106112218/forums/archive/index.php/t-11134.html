<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geneze</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using Astryne's auto-strech target window (found here: http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=297 ) for quite some time, and I absolutely love it. <br />
<br />
I've also been doing a bit of my own modifications to various files with varying degrees of success. <br />
<br />
What I've wondering is if you have any plans to modify your target window to include the new /con-colored background that's available with the default target window (the current background is transparant). <br />
<br />
Or if not, maybe some hints on how I might go about doing it myself. As I said, I've done some modifications on my own (I have no experience in XML, just using common sense and trial and error). Some mods I've downloaded, I have been able to make a bit of sense of and figured out how to change them to be the way I wanted them, and even figured out how to fix many of them to fix errors that crop up from patches from time to time. This particular mod however, has me stumped. The code is quite complex, and I'm having trouble figuring out just how it works. <br />
<br />
Thanks much</div></div><hr />
