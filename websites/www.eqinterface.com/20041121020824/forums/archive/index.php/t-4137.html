<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manic Moocow</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to use the WDT_Inner template in various UI mods I'm doing, and I'm having a problem with it fading to 50% opacity when the mouse cursor isn't over it.<br />
<br />
It's not readily apparent to me which property of WDT_Inner in the templates form controls the behavior of it's opacity/alpha.  What confuses me more is the fact that the template is used in things like the color picker and DOESN'T appear to fade.<br />
<br />
(a) How can I control the opacity/alpha of the template?  I want it at NO opacity at all times.  (At least, I don't want it's opacity behavior to be independent of the overall form.)<br />
(b) Is there a document somewhere that explains in detail the usage of the various parameters in the Template form?  Fiddling is all fine and good, but it's not the best use of time.<br />
<br />
.moo.</div></div><hr />

The is the SIDL.DOC which does explain the most of various screenpieces and concept of the interface operation at the time of its release.  However, this document is severely lacking in identifying limitations and has not been kept updated as the default UI has been modified by SOE.  In short its a good starting point.</div></div><hr />
