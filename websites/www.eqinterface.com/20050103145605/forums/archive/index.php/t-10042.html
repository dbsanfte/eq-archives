<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blossom</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have started putting an assortment of items together to get the type of screen I want but I have a few requests and a couple changes to some already great Uis.<br />
<br />
First off on requests:  I would like to see a horizontal buff bar that is 1. numbered, 2. first buff starts on the left-right 3. is small but does have text ( not to small on the icon).  There are a couple that I have tried to DL that looked ok in the pic but I cannot even get them to load, badly.  It defaults every time.<br />
<br />
Ok now here is some items I would like changed a bit if anyone could please.  If its to hard or not possible that is fine, I dont know what is needed to change this stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pet window (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1495) <br />
<br />
This is almost perfect, but anyway to flatten this out and can the buttons be moved?  Maybe something like this<br />
<br />
[ (go away) (guard) (sit) (taunt) {pet name/bar with % in the middle of the bar} (back) (follow) (attack) ]<br />
<br />
All on one line with default size buttons but maybe some space between them?  Also oversize the pet bar a hair? Reason for changes is this:  attack is always by the bar, in heavy lag I often get what I call floaty mouse syndrome which allows me the wonderfull opportunity to accidentally click on my pets bar before I hit attack.  This take precious time to go and retarged my mob.  Also horizontal becuase I use a horizontal spell bar and when I have a pet, I would like to stack this right on my spell bar for quick access.  <br />
<br />
Ok change number 2, ugh :)<br />
<br />
Group window, this is the one I am using and it is great but needs just a few changes to be perfect for me.<br />
<br />
Group window (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1413) <br />
<br />
There are a few group windows that are almost the same as this, but this is the one that would load with no errors so I chose it.<br />
<br />
Ok for changes to it, can we move the % to the middle of the bars similar to the default and skinny up the box?  (skinny up is technical term)  Also move the pet bar and person bar closer together so there is more room between players, but you are still able to aquire the pet bar easily.  Get rid of the Group label at the top and just cut it off completly.  <br />
<br />
Change 3<br />
Take the target text and area off the default target bar, maybe make the bar a bit wider with the extra room.  Just get rid of the target text and that area would be nice though.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok well that is it for now, any help on this would be great.  I will probably be back posting more as I try different things but all the stuff I am choosing is sleek and usable and that is what i am looking for here.  Thanks again for any info or help on this :)<br />
