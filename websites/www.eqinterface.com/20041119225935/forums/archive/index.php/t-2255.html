I am trying to use a combo box in the UI, and I can figure out how to display one and fill the list with choices by copying examples from other UI files like the option tabs, but I am not sure how to connect the choice to a text window or animation.<br />
<br />
Say I create a combo box called &quot;skills&quot; and in the list of choices I have Warrior, monk and SK.  And I create a display area on the same page to display some text.  How do I associate the selection in the combobox to the display of the text.  I thought perhaps I could use the index of the choice. So if monk was selected that would be choice[1] so something like choice.index might be available, but that is not in the SIDL doc as an element of a combo box.<br />
<br />
SO the question in short is ... if a combo box is selected how do I access what choice was made?<br />

As far as I know, it's hard coded.<br />
<br />
However; you can play with it and see if it will work?<br />
<br />
VI's netorious for hard coding tons of things, this even includes options that are given details to make but no possiable do to UI limitations.<br />
<br />
The most I can say is to play with it and see what happens. If you get it working, post it! I'm sure others will be interested in your new found knowledge. <br />
