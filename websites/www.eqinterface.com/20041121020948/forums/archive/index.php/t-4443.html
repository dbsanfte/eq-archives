<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elycion</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using a mod that I whipped up (borrowing from a few other sources) that combined my Group, Player, and Target windows all in the Group window.<br />
<br />
I decided today to move the contents into the Player window instead, mainly to increase the visibility of the flashing auto-attack reminder.  Everything moved fine, except the pet health bars.  All the other group member gauges vanish when not in use, but the pet health sub-bars do not.  I'm a bit confused as the gauges worked properly in the group window, and the code was a straight copy and paste job.<br />
<br />
Here's what it looks like:<br />

Hopefully someone can spot what my issue is so I can make the darn things invisible when there's no pet like it should be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elycion</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried that actually, what happens is that the pet health bar &quot;mutates&quot; into a line 1 pixel high that extends past the player's health bar.<br />
<br />
I've no clue why removing the background texture causes that, but it looks like total crap. :(</div></div><hr />

I just learned to ignore the Pet Bar when I am using my warrior alt. Im would rather see the bar as it is supposed to be with my mage.<br />

Kind of a little bug Verant has yet to fix, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Elycion, the background for the gauge forces the fill area to match the backgrounds dimensions, when the background is removed, the guage is free to stretch, so, if the gauges dimensions aren't, lets say 100 wide by 8 tall, it won't look like a normal gauge, instead it'll look like whatever the gauge dimensions are set to.<br />
<br />
Try fixing the gauge size and removing the background, and see if that's better (if it's not you're doing something wrong, I know gauges inside and out).<br />

I was unaware that the background graphic was acting as a size constraint on the gauge fill.  Fixed the size tags and it's just how I wanted it now.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
