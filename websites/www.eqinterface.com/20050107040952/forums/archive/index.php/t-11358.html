<br />
I just moved and am using a pc of a friends and for some reason I cannot go to www.magelo.com it prompts me to save or open a document(which I believe is HTML).<br />
<br />
I cannot get to any magelo profiles at all.<br />
<br />
I am thinking there is a component of WinXP missing, but I really don't have the experience to fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Any ideas???</div></div><hr />

That or lack of standards enabled. You running a Proxy? If so, you need to make sure Enable 1.1 HTTP thru Proxy is enabled.<br />
<br />
Here's the full cut and paste from Magelo's forums on how to get it working:<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer 6<br />
<br />
There are few things you need to check with IE 6... in no particular order:<br />
<br />
- Make sure you keep up with the latest IE 6 with critical updates from Microsoft (Tools -&gt; Windows Update -&gt; Scan for updates). Make it a habit to check this at least once a week for maximum compatibility.<br />
<br />
- Make sure Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Use HTTP1.1 through proxy connections is checked ON (ie. checkmarked). Use HTTP should also be ON.<br />
<br />
- You should have your Security and Privacy levels set to medium. If it's higher or custom, make sure you know exactly what are the consequences (trying to set back to medium is a good idea to be sure it doesn't come from here). Medium high should be acceptable. Magelo does use a cookie to automatically log you in whenever you visit.<br />
<br />
- If you are using something like Norton Internet Security or Zone Alarm (its privacy settings), make sure you configure it properly to work with Magelo (see Zone Alarm or Norton HOWTOs in the library).<br />
<br />
- Clear your browser cache when you suspect IE is messing up (eg. displaying an old page or an empty dropdown list). Here's how: Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Delete Files.<br />
<br />
- To keep IE's cache manager from outsmarting itself, set Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Every visit to the page. This will go a long way towards allowing you to see the web content you've selected all the time, and not something else.<br />
<br />
- Finally, make sure you don't disable Javascript in the Advanced section of Tools -&gt; Internet Options. (hmm, where is it?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw -- You can fix all this by just using Moz FB (http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/). Works right out of the box, with correct web standards. ;)</div></div><hr />

I dont know if I'll switch to it though just because of pure lazyness. However I'll always use it to check my sites in to make sure they work in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-30-2003, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, you definatly gotta be lazy if you can't hit 'Yes' to set Moz FB to be your default browser! :D <br />
<br />
I've been using it since 0.61. It's the best browser out there. Upto date on all HTML standards, including some CSS3 formatting. I highly recommend any IE user to switch to it. Moz FB is just a webbrowser, just like IE. And in most cases, much faster than IE.</div></div><hr />
