He shot a signal flare into the air hoping someone would see him.  California has had no raid at that point for 175+ days and being it is like a desert out their all the wood was very dry.<br />
<br />
I also pray for those out their that have lost their lives and houses.  I have been lucky so far my brother, and mother are all fine still down in Southern California.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for the pictures.   I'm originally from Los Angeles, and I've not been &quot;home&quot; in over 5 years.  I miss it, and I was amazed to see the effects of the smoke.   Thanks again. <br />
