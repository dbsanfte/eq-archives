<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">insomnlac</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">an example: i try to put my health stats (current/max) in the player vitals box. it works, but then the inventory stats read 0/0. <br />
 so far everything i've made a copy of works the same way. why can't i use a variable more than once?!? any way around this or do i need to ask for a patch?</div></div><hr />

Something to the effect of Absor saying we're getting a beta UI or something and the guy hoping it will be one of the things fixed if we get a finished version of the UI. I'll edit this post with the thread I'm remembering this from if I can find it. Hope that helps, and yea it sucks that we can't duplicated stuff like that to show in multiple places (as far as we know)<br />

edit: ok here's the thread, not as much to it as I thought there was<br />
