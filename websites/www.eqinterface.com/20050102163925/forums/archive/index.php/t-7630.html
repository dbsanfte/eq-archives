Maybe I shouldn't be trying this on right now but I have a UI that I absolutly love. It's the slayer UI but it at least as far as I can find on the slayer site has not been updated to include the now LoY additions. Well I tried to simply move the default bank files and such to it that didn't work. So I decided to try this program out for it and boy is it ever confusing. Not only can I not figure out how to use it but it crashes more often than EQ itself.<br />
<br />
Well if anyone knows where I can find an updated slayer skin that would be awsome but if someone could write a brief intro on how to use this program that would rule. I know xml is not for starters and all but now that I've tried the program I don't think I'll be quitting anytime soon so better to try and have a clue then to try and mess everything up :).<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. I DID download the .NET framework so that can't be the reaosn it is crashing.</div></div><hr />
