Basically looks the same but the spellbook icon is offset a bit...I have a habit of picking spells from the bottom up, so the 8th slot spell I was consistently hitting ALT-7 thinking that was the second one from the bottom.  Offset the book a bit and I don't have that problem.<br />

<br />
And Wolfran - I LOVE that spellbook.  Very very sweet.  :)<br />

Let me know if anyone wants the xml. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfran</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice, nwinn.  I was actually working on the same thing last night.<br />
<br />
Since I got frustrated and quit, I'd definitely like to see the XML :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nwinn</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">here it is, still not exactly the way I want it, but I like it so far. :D<br />
<br />
Was thinking about making it smaller and doing something about the spell icons... either editing them, I don't like the cut-off corners, or figuring out how to use the buff window icons... not sure how that'd work though :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have any other ideas, this is very not done! :D</div></div><hr />
