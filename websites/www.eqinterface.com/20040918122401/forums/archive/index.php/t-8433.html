<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally decided to do a complete UI.  I'm placing it here in the Beta forum because there are a few things I want to fix yet, but figured I would let anyone try it.  I have not uploaded this to EQInterface yet though, so I will link to my Tripod site for anyone who wants it.<br />
<br />
Remember, this is a Tripod site...so you might get an extra pop-up window and there is a bandwidth limit.  Just try a little later if you have any problems.<br />
<br />
Specs:<br />
<br />
   -  The UI was designed at 1280x1024, but the type can be a little small at that size (I like it like that!)  Should work on other sizes.<br />
<br />
   -  Two timers included: 5 and 20 minutes  - These are part of the Target window and are the slide timers from Arista's Webpage (I just modified the code to fit the window)<br />
<br />
   -  I tried to make as much as I could be see through.  The chat windows can be transparent or have a background color.<br />
<br />
   -  Included are t.kings G2 spell icons<br />
<br />
   -  There is a fixed mana bar on the player window, so this may cause a problem for the pure melee players.  (I'm working on this)<br />
<br />
   -  The UI &quot;should&quot; be up-to-date with the upcoming patch (May 14th)  I have changed my naming convention to that of the test server, so unless that changes, it should work.<br />
<br />
   -  I have included a custom EQUI.xml file, but that should be a lot easier to fix from a patch than making changes to the Animations.xml file.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope everyone likes it, but let me know what you think.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I forgot to mention...the background of the player name (in the player window) is the stamina bar.</div></div><hr />

Nah I really like your UI, tested with fraps at 71FPS very nice rate.</div></div><hr />

Glad everyone likes it so far.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Oh to have a free file hosting site with fewer restrictions...I'll check back in an hour or so</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.  I moved the files onto a new server (Not Tripod anymore).  It is my wife's new account and I'm hoping I don't go over the band width :p   You can now see the pictures and zip at the following (I did change the link above, but not the message.)<br />
<br />
Screen Shots and Zip (http://forryweb.net/forry) <br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I did update the zip to have a melee player window.  I'm going to upload the UI to EQInterfaces as soon as I know tomorrows patch didn't break it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reedok</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow -- I really like this.   The only thing I would like to see, is that the name of the buff show up along side the buff in the the buff window.  <br />
<br />
I dont know -- I just like to see the actual names of the buffs I have (I cant keep em all straight ;))<br />
<br />
Would this be hard to implement?  If it is fairly routine, perhaps with just a little guidance, I can edit the xml myself.<br />
<br />
In any case, very nice!  I might have to start a mage cuz of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adding names to the buff windows isn't the easiest thing to do, but I will see what I can do.  This isn't real high on my to do list though.  If you press the alt key, you should get a list of the names :p (EDIT - and have your mouse on the buff window)   I'll see if I can work on it at some point though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow that's a very interesting UI. I might just have to go against my better judgement (which is to stop messing with my UI's already before i break another one :D ) and download yours to try out. I dunno if the HP bars will be large/bright enough to catch my eye quick enough but we shall see.<br />
Very nice work, one of the best, most original ones I've seen in a while.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Edit: OK after loading onto my alt it looks pretty good, although I am quite used to having vital stats and xp on screen, whereas with your UI I wasn't able to locate an xp bar anywhere! Dunno if I'm missing something or what on that. So perhaps if I'm not the only one requesting this you could rework a window to include your stats or make a stat window out of the friends/pet window or something? Also if you feel like it you could include some directions on how to personalize the right clickies/inventory slots next to the hotbuttons...I know how to but others might not.<br />
OK think that's it for now, real cool skin I look forward to any improvements you make and the final release :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the review.  I'm not the best at writing directions, so for me to tell someone how to change the clickes would be hard.  Also, I only really made 5 mini backgrounds for those, although it wouldn't be hard to make the other ones.  I will try to work on that though.  <br />
<br />
Exp bars -  The 2 yellow gauges on the player window are the exp bars. (top is regular exp and bottom is AA exp.)  One thing I don't like is the yellow just doesn't stand out to me, so I may be making them a little darker.<br />
<br />
It shouldn't be too hard to make a stats section on another window.  Maybe even make the friends window be the stats.  I don't want to use the pet window because I'm a mage and I use that all the time.  Only problem with using the friends window is that it closes everytime you zone -- that is why I put the timers in the target window, so they would always be on screen.  I'll see what I can come up with on this.<br />
<br />
Again - thanks for the feedback :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL go me i thought the yellow bar was my stamina! Teach me to load it on a noob that's out of drink! OK i gotcha on that one, and you're right the yellow seems wrong for the color, I'd suggest good ol' orange for that (think that was what threw me off in the first place).<br />
As for the stat box I think you could just create it and name it one of several names, for example a melee or non pet caster could name it PetInfoWindow to replace the existing one, and a pet class could name it a different unused window, but i'm not sure, it may be more complicated.<br />
One more thing i noticed is that you can't autoequip from the inventory. If there's any way you could throw that in it would be appreciated.<br />
Tata for now, and thanks for listening :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't think the renaming thing would work...certain windows need to have certain things in them.  If I made the stats window, and someone renamed it to be the pet window, the UI would break because the pet health gauge would have to be in the code somewhere.  I'll come up with something though.<br />
<br />
There is an auto equip box in the inventory...it is the open box between the 4 small buttons (face, tint, etc.) between those buttons.  I'm going to see if I can label that in some way, but its there :) <br />
<br />
Thanks for the update, oh and I think I will be going with orange!<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT - oh yea... and by the way...the stamina is the background of the player name...jump around a little and you should see it move ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forry I am VERY impressed that you didn't modify the Animations or Template files, good work! The tweaked CS_Buttons.bmp file is impressive too, glad that you know how to make it work for you. =)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much.  I figured that changing the animations.xml would just cause too much trouble when patches came around.  The only major file I should need to change is the EQUI and that is a very small file.  Figured this was easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually you can make a patch proof EQUI.xml file using this code:<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;?xml version = &quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- Monolithic Parameter File --&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- The composite section must come first and be followed by the schema --&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;!-- defines for gauges set the EQType tag in Gauge definitions to one of these numbers --&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- GAUGETYPE_HP                1 --&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- GAUGETYPE_MANA              2 --&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- GAUGETYPE_STAMINA           3 --&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- GAUGETYPE_EXP               4 --&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- GAUGETYPE_ALTEXP            5 --&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- GAUGETYPE_TARGET            6 --&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- GAUGETYPE_CASTING           7 --&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- GAUGETYPE_BREATH            8 --&gt;<br />

&lt;!-- GAUGETYPE_HP_PARTY2         12 --&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- GAUGETYPE_HP_PARTY3         13 --&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- GAUGETYPE_HP_PARTY4         14 --&gt;<br />
&lt;!-- GAUGETYPE_HP_PARTY5         15 --&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;XML ID = &quot;EQInterfaceDefinitionLanguage&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Composite&gt;<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;..\default\EQUI.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_Forry.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
   &lt;/Composite&gt;<br />
    &lt;Schema xmlns = &quot;EverQuestData&quot; xmlns:dt = &quot;EverQuestDataTypes&quot;/&gt;<br />
&lt;/XML&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
I HAVE NOT tested this, but I believe this was the way to do it...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Enok!  I will attempt this at some point, but just don't have time today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No problemo, also, just thought of something, might wanna try reversing the load order so it would be:<br />
<br />
<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_Forry.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;..\default\EQUI.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
So your graphics would load first thing...<br />
<br />
<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;..\default\EQUI.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
is the important part, but I'm pretty sure that's the correct format. If it doesn't work, try changing the \'s to /'s.<br />
