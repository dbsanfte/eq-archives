Read before you post! 	Post# 1	    When asking for help in trouble shooting a problem you are having with a skin/mod please include this information in your post.     1. What is the name of the mod, provide a link to where its located on our site. If its your own home made dont worry about it.    2. What steps did you take to install the mod?    3. Go to your everquest folder and find the uierrors.txt file and copy and paste the errors. You should always have errors or warnings in the text file. If you dont you may have two everquest directorys.     4. Be as descriptive as you can. Just posting you cant get xyz mod to work will result in no responce to your help request. The more information you can provide the faster some one will respond.    Thanks. <br />

But you are still getting the red in-game message that some of your files may not be compatible?<br />
<br />
There's nothing there to indicate anything needs updating ... *confused*</div></div><hr />
