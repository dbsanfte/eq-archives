The first is the trade window.  I was trying to make it more compact, like my other mods.  Well, when I open it up in game, all the features of the window are exactly as I designed them, but the window itself is the same size it used to be...which is NOT the size I scripted it to be.<br />
<br />
The same thing is happening with a mod of the new Tradeskill Window I have been trying out on test now.<br />
<br />
Anyone know why this is?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EricLongsten</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First guess is to check your UI_Character_server.ini file, look for the entry for the window you are working on, if width and height are defined in this file it will override what is defined in the xml.  You can delete the entire entry or just the width and height lines to make it use the default xml size.  Also be aware that there are sometimes mulitple definitions for diferent screen resolutions, they they will take the form &quot;width###x###&quot; and &quot;height###x###&quot;.  Or if you are doing alot of work on the UI you can delete the whole file and it will be recreated the next time the character logs in and use the the position and size as defined in the xml.<br />

Now to figure out why the tradeskill window on test is suddenly showing the wrong components for a recipe, and if its because the interface on test is bugged or because I screwed it up...</div></div><hr />
