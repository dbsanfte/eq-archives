<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jayzan777</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering what other people think about what makes a good guild.  In my Guild we have alot of Fun, but seems that we are constantly recruiting and still only have between 5-15 members during prime-time hours and on weekends.  We have a decent website and a forum.  All the normal stuff that other guilds have.  Seems like people just get bored and disband or disappear from the eq world all together.   Maybe if you are in a Really Uber Guild you could give away the Secret =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I think that FUN is what makes a guild. In my guild we have alot of chatter going on, even if there's only 5 people on. Alot of us take breaks from EQ, but still check up with the guild site. <br />
<br />
Another thing I think is important is that the WHOLE guild get involved and do raids and stuff like that. I have never been on any kind of official raid before until this guild. They took me, even though I and another member were only in our lower 30's, into Keasora to try to get everyone Keys. It was alot of fun!<br />
<br />
Another thing that makes me think highly of my guild is that they invited me to trak to get parts for my Seb key at L40... even offered to escort me (been playing Iksar SK's since RoK came out... I'm all too familiar with getting myself through higher lvl zones, especially with my Sssissy Lallaa Necro... hehe!)<br />
<br />
Alot of people in my guild get together for xp as well... any more, the only reason I group is to go hang out with my guildmates (actually, they seem to be the only ones who know a necro's worth!)<br />
<br />
I'd have to say that FUN and conversation makes a guild good, but also a good guild is an interactive guild. I've been in guilds that basically use the /GU as a private chat so they can keep in touch across zones. Those guilds suck. A good guild is one that you can help, and expect help in return, and have fun doing it!<br />
<br />
Man... I never write this much for my papers in college! LOL!!! Wonder if my prof will accept this as a Western Civ essay...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me a good guild should have an extremely strong background of Roleplaying... Its very difficult to find such a guild... many advert that they are primary roleplay but it turns out that only 10-20% of the people on actually roleplay, the rest just roleplay when they want something and try to stick to the feel then and only then... tsk tsk tsk...<br />
<br />
I am not fond of guilds that specialize primarily in twinking and PL'ing... I prefer to enjoy my levels, allowing myself to perfect my skills to its max for the level, so I will be a peak fighting machine for the level. Before anyone decides to throw in, thats not for me or to that effect.. remember this is what I think a good guild should be.<br />
<br />
I think if a game advertises itself as a MMORPG, there should be roleplaying as the MMORPG stands for.. It is a massive multi-player online ROLE PLAYING GAME. Kinda wish there was more on it... And yes I do have a character on FV, but alas there isn't that much RP'ing there either. Sigh.<br />
<br />
So if you are part of a guild whose prerequistes are roleplaying on either Firiona Vie, The Nameless and Veeshan.. Please feel free to let me know, because I seek such a guild. Thank you in advance! Journey well my friends..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelric</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got to agree with both of the above.<br />
<br />
Our guild, Solus, is first and foremost a Roleplaying guild - always in character unless in a private channel. More importantly, the founders designed an over-arching storyline fo Solus, a reason for being. That gives us a purpose, something to rely on and return to when the lure of XP and loot get to be too much. ;) <br />
<br />
But we do that because we think it's FUN. We also get together with whomever's online and go PLAY. Most of us have multiple alts, some guilded some not, so we rely on a chat channel to keep the conversation going. We have members whose main is 60 and members whose main is under 20. Sometimes we're all over the map, sometimes we're all in the same place.<br />
<br />
We have a lot of the same issues you mentioned, Jayzan - small numbers, different time zones... it happens. It's become a lot easier once we all decided to not get so worried about it... when we can play together, we do, when we can't, we don't. RL takes priority, things happen... all in all, we have a very low attrition rate, and the few that have gone still stay in touch daily.<br />
<br />
I think a big part of our success (the way *we* define it anyway) is that we've decided to be close... we're all friends now outside the game as well, having a couple get-togethers a year. Much like ingame, not everyone can always come, but those that do have a great time hanging out.<br />
<br />
In addition to all that, we've made 'alliances' with a few other guilds that have a similar outlook, whether it be RP or what. If there's not a guildie on, more than likely there's someone from one of these guilds doing SOMETHING we can join, or they come join us... or is just someone to chat with while soloing or doing tradeskills. That's gone a long way in keeping everyone involved and enjoying themselves.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, is everyone having fun when they ARE on? If so, awesome! If not, ask around and see what they think would be fun to do, and do it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya know, I've been alive under Zebuxoruk's care for 52 seasons now, and have yet to join a guild. Oh, I've visited a few over the years, but never found anything that really sat well with me. I too love the yearn to roleplay. Heck, I think it's the only thing keeping this old wizard alive anymore. (Would have given up on this class long ago if it wasn't so fun roleplaying a wizard.) <br />
<br />
Problem is, for atleast the past 20 or so seasons, people have stopped and asked why I wasn't 'guilded' or hadn't joined a 'family'. And all I can say is, &quot;I haven't found one that I like.&quot; I have yet to find a guild that truly plays the game in character, playing a role. Oh sure, I've seen a few try, and I've also seen a few in those same guilds who would have no idea what roleplay was if it came along and swatted a bare twig across their arses. Then I've seen my fair share of the guilds who do nothing but hunt and raid, and raid and hunt. I say give the poor beasties a rest once in a while. Makes everything so much more fun when the bad guys have had a chance to regain their strength and become a challenge again. Besides, this old wizard can't be expected to be everywhere for everyone (not that anyone ever asks a wizard anywho). But I like to sit back and relax sometimes.... wander around the community taking in the sights and smells. No, the continual raid guild is no place for me. Nor is the one that is concerned with little more than being the best and getting that top level or that most impressive member. I'm sorry, but where I come from you keep your most impressive members out of sight and under wraps... unless it happens to be an especially powerful wand or truly stout staff, or maybe a hefty sword if you're in to that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
No, I'll take my 52 seasons of lone wandering across the face of Norrath over a family like those. And if I reach my 65 cycle without having joined a guild, it just means I ain't ne'er found one that suits m' tastes.<br />

I do have to agree that Roleplaying is a good part of a good guild. One of my favorite guilds (also one of the most powerful for it's ranks, and unfortunatly gone) was Lords of the Undead. Since it was an ALL Nec/SK guild, it was basically a constant roleplay. Hard NOT to with a guild like that!<br />
<br />
A few of us dedicated Iksar tried forming an all Iksar guild for RP purpose, but alas, only a few of the members even understood the point of RP. It's annoying to have another Iksar ask you &quot;Why do you hisss like that?&quot; or &quot;Where the hell is New Sebilis anyways?&quot; &lt;sigh&gt;  I've had more Inkies laughin at my Sarnak cracks than Iksars! Makes me sad, really... fortunatly I have made friends with a few other Iksar who feel the same as I do. Definitly have to say that Ogre, Iksar, and Barbs seem to do the most roleplaying. I say barbs because I have been forced to duel many Barbarians trying to pillage the fruits of our landssss!!!<br />
<br />
I think that making it easier for other races to get faction in Cabilis killed roleplaying for alot of us Iksar. As well, since they are the only other Monk race, alot of people who have been playing softskinned characters want to make an Uber monk, and they usually don't RP. When I started EQ (right before RoK, killed my L2 barb warrior to make a badass scaleskin SK) there was ALOT of roleplaying. I remeber fighting in the Field of bone with my guild (then, all Iksar) and seeing a softy go flying overhead. There would ALWAYS be shouts about &quot;Softskin in zone!&quot; and everyone would follow like they've never seen any characters but Iksar.... was pretty kewl times!<br />
<br />
As well, I remember the day that the first lizard from our guild actually made it to Antonica... we were all proud!</div></div><hr />

I wish I could go back 2 years... I miss my first guild!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melosa</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with defining what a &quot;good&quot; guild is, is that you'll get as many answers as you will people. Some people love to roleplay. Some people love to raid. Some hop on just to socialize. That's what makes it hard to have that &quot;perfect&quot; guild. One thing I'd suggest is that you keep it fresh, especially if you prefer a raiding guild. When you've raided the Planes 800 times, it gets a little old. So, strip off your gear and do a naked raid on Blackburrow. Get everyone together and have drunken races acrossed Greater Faydark. Team up your lower levels with your higher levels and do a kite race acrossed West Karana (i.e. level 20ish gets partnered with level 50ish. Level 20ish gets levitated and auto-follows level 50ish. No sows, just a kite race:)) Set up teams and do scavenger hunts. Those are a few things my friends and I have done or have wanted to do. And I'm not taking any credit for these ideas, most of them were &quot;borrowed&quot; from guildmagic's forums. <br />
I guess the key is to find out what your members want most. <br />
<br />
And I'm shocked! Dolby remembered the whipped cream and forgot the cherries.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jayzan777</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far it seems that Roleplaying seems to be a biggest factor to keeping a Guild Strong.  I was wondering if anyone knows of any websites that have a Guide to Roleplaying  or something like that.<br />
<br />
  I played on the FV server for a while and learned somethings there.  I met some girls that would not go through a door or gate unless you opened it for them. hehehe.  They would stand there and say &quot;ah Hmm..&quot;  hehe,  It was cool.   Most of the roleplaying I did was in battles and during hunts.   I really like to roleplay, but I noticed as some of you have said that not many people are into that anymore.<br />
<br />
  I know that what it killed on the FV server was when SoL came out.  It added the new chat commands and chat room making features making the FV special Language features such as limited shout range, City only auction commands, Tribal Languages and no OOC usless.  You can do /chat tell &lt;name&gt; (I think that's it)and it  doesn't use the persons language so people would just do that instead of Learning the other Languages.  So they added the normal chat  features back to the FV server making it just like all the other servers without the common tongue.  What they should have done is not added the SoL chat features to the FV Server.  I remember how hard it was on FV to sell an item or find a group.  Most of the chatting was done through face to face meetings of other players.  It was so much more realistic, and fun.  Elfs could not speak human language so they had to learn it and vice verses.  Oh well,  Let's not stand in the way of Progress...</div></div><hr />

So far it seems that Roleplaying seems to be a biggest factor to keeping a Guild Strong.  I was wondering if anyone knows of any websites that have a Guide to Roleplaying  or something like that.<br />
<br />
Why as a matter of fact I do know of a site that is dedicated to EQ Role Players.... the site is<br />
<br />
EverQuest Roleplayers! (http://pub92.ezboard.com/beverquestroleplayers) <br />
<br />
I enjoy this site alot. People keep the roleplaying continous and the OOC areas are deep and interesting.<br />
<br />
Just tell em' Zantaklawz sent ya!  :nana:<br />

Journey well my friend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadd</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the roleplaying thing, KINDA, I think it is a good mix of BOTH Roleplaying and Raiding. I belong to Spirit Guardians on Syryrn. And to my knowledge it is the oldest existing Guild on that Server. We have a family atmosphere,and NBG looting on Raids,only ppl thatcan use it and its an upgrade for them roll on the item. We dont raid everyday. mostly only on the weekend. Have daytime exp and night time exp groupes that meet 3 days a week. You never hear arguing in guild chat. AND I mean never. We are cashual Raiders not hard core like Order of the pheonix or Heaven and Earth. and dont use the points system for loot. Dont be fooled we are not small by any means. we raid ToV/ HoT.<br />
<br />
Ultamatly it comes down to what you look for from EQ.<br />
Uber loots and live online. or Friends and a good time playing your char,lvling and hanging out,<br />
<br />
I prefer having fun raiding cashually. and hanging out with friends(i have no life )..LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfhugger</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest requirement for me is that a guild is doing something. Anything. Off to get keys, collecting parts for the gnomes to tinker, having a PvP event, etc. It's nice to see in guild chat people describing the new Planes to the rest of us, or arrangements being made to form groups. Activity is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kungpo</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO I think what makes a good and succesful guild would have to be a strong foundation ..Guildstructure basicly..and a good leader.. Thats what it would have to start with ...<br />
<br />
 Roleplaying seems to somewhat be an issue for some but ..not to others ..but i thing a little mix of both dont hurt =) <br />
 And aye ..Fun would have to be another factor .. Even if all your guild does is raid...maybe take out some time once in a while ...and just throw like a guild meeting party ..so people within the guild new and old members get a chance to learn more about each other...Which leads to my Next point..<br />
<br />
 Trust...I think another important aspect too a good and succesful guild is trust ..If you dont know the person ..how can you trust a person ..In my many yrs of Playing EQ ..I have seen and Heard of Many people being IRL friends and one ripping another off of Gear /items etc ..So i think that too plays a big part.<br />
<br />
Respect... This i believe is another value that makes a good guild ..if members dont respect each other ...then you have the problem of them not wanting to be around each other ..be it a raid or any other Guild event .. <br />
<br />
 These are just a few values i can think of off top my head ... but i think these are some of the main Values ...that is what makes a Good Guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wumadce</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What makes a good guild... Well, to me, it's the fact that everyone in the guild (no matter the size) can have fun and get along.  I'm on the Rodcet server, and in a small guild, but everyone always seems to have fun, and on our raids it doesn't matter what the results, as long as people can have fun.  When a guild can act as a family, that's when you know that the guilds the right place to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that tightened up the guild I'm in now was our arena get-together. We all dueled and had fun... and got to meet other people that we hadn't met yet! Even though Esch (necro, onlyRL friend in guild) took turns spanking everyone, including the 6 season older GL, we all had a great time! btw, Esch finally got took down by one of the druids coming back with a vengance, LOL!<br />
<br />
There's a couple guilds on our server that are hardcore raid guilds... I see alot of people take like 3 months to get in, go on about 5 raids and quit. Fortunatly, there's an orginization on our server called Organized Raiders of Quellious (http://pub9.ezboard.com/borganizedraidersofquellious) who put on raids. It's REALLY nice because you can have your cake AND eat it too! Basically, you can be in a FUN guild who is more social and just group for xp, etc etc... AND you can become part of ORQ and get your raids in! I think that it definitly keeps alot of guilds from falling apart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenney</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:(  well my guild was a good one in the beginning now it strating to suck ,they dont want to group with you or anything like that ... Alot of times i get on asking for groups and not one guild member says anything to ya... even with the new /raid window there is no such thing as we are full, you could use a 7th guy with you....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jayzan777</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, It would be nice if our server had an organized raiding community.  There are some uber guilds that go on raids, but so far every Pick-up raid I've been on has been poorly organized, rushed, and total failures.  Of course, I've only been one about 10 raids 3 of them were trying to kill Lady Vox. <br />
<br />
Raids are hard to come by on the Saryrn Server.</div></div><hr />
