<br />
I downloaded a mix and match UI and everything works but the target ring. Got the upgraded one the first time I checked the new UI but now it has defaulted back to the original one and I have no idea how to get the new one to work.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas as to what the problem is?<br />
<br />
I am very new to this so I'm totally clueless as to what to do to get the new target ring to work.<br />
<br />
Anyone help me out here?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help offered.</div></div><hr />

Don't put them in the '\uifiles\default' folder. You will want to put the files into a different sub-directory and load them from there.<br />
<br />
I've actually loaded a target ring and it worked. The next time I logged on it didn't. Then after that it worked fine.<br />
<br />
If these suggestions don't apply, throw out a response. One of the more experienced users here will be able to help you better. I'm rather new myself but catching (at least I think so =)<br />

<br />
Did not load anything into the default folder.<br />
<br />
Worked fine the first time I loaded it but after I logged and came back later it had defaulted to the original target ring. Strange.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply I really appreciate the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MikeStah</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok...  so what steps are you taking?<br />
<br />
Normally, you would want to login and type &quot;/loadskin [.\eifiles\[foldername_of_mod] 1&quot;<br />
<br />
So if I was gonna load a folder named 'tking', I would type:<br />
<br />
<br />
/loadskin tking 1<br />
<br />
<br />
Are those the steps you're taking? Or are you loading it from the options menu? Hope it helps!</div></div><hr />

I cannot for the life of me figure out much of anything with the Target ring.  Editing the INI file does change some of the appearance but changing most of those numbers doesn't do anything.  After editing the INI file, typing &quot;/indic on&quot; gets it to update and show the changes.<br />
<br />
It seems once you edit the TGA file you have to camp out (probably all the way to the desktop) to get it to refresh correctly.<br />
<br />
SoE seems to have either a lot of non-functioning &quot;functionalities&quot; with this or  they haven't explained how to edit this correctly yet.</div></div><hr />
