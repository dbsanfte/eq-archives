Here's the inventory pic for a set I'm currently creating. I'd love to have people's opinions of it.. it's NOT completely finished - I'm intending to make the inventory items background in a dark red/brown colour, not the dark grey it currently is..<br />
<br />
I'd really like some feedback - would anyone like to see more of this type?<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Napata</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course, I haven't actually posted the complete inventory look, just the background picture (D'OH) so you can't see what I'm talking about. I'll take a screenshot tomorrow and post it. But I think you'll get the idea :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaasper</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is a great graphic I hope you can build a skin to match it.<br />
<br />
Suggested places to put that graphic:<br />
- Spell book pages - Best place to Display art.<br />
- Pet butons : Earthscum did a great pet button window for necros with the use of a spector as the center piece. You could use your graphic to do the same for a shaman by having the center piece of your graphic as the background for a great pet box</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Napata</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Jasper<br />
<br />
My actual use for the graphic is in one of the already designed inventory layouts, and I hope the designer will forgive me not remembering who did it. Before I &quot;publish&quot; my skins, I'll dig out the correct info and credit the person accordingly. It appeared on a Rogue setup on eqinterface, with a round inventory. I just loved the look, and thought it would fit with my shammy.<br />
<br />
Other mods in the design stage are a dreamcatcher gem bar, wolves in the background spellbook, and red-brown windows. I'm not ashamed to say I've copied other ideas I've seen, but when finished, my layout will hopefully be something slightly different, and pretty, anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Napata</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the completed (I think) inventory shot. <br />
<br />
MANY thanks to Abattoir (on the eqinterface site) for the basic layout - I loved it so much I adapted it for my favourite class, the Shaman.<br />
<br />
Feedback please ?<br />
<br />
I'm looking at doing an entire skin based on a similar look &amp; feel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks good. Only problem I happen to see it has is the picture seems to be a bit fuzzy. Or maybe it's just my eyes, lol. I'm tired :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, :nana: for a job well done! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its fuzzy because its not the original pic.   That is Laurel Austin's work and the original pic can be found here : http://laurelaustin.com/WinterCabin.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Napata</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never claimed to be the artist :rolleyes: (heck, I wish I *could* draw as well as the person who did this). Actually, I couldn't find out who the artist was - I got the pic from another website, just loved the look. It wasn't from the Laurelaustin website, now I've looked at it, as my original didn't have all the &quot;sparkly&quot; bits that his one does.. - unfortunately his link to his homepage appears to be broken so now I know who he is, I can't ask his permission as I can't contact him :(  - I'd always try to do this, even though this skin is &quot;for my own personal use&quot; etc and I don't intend to distribute it without at least giving some credit to the artist (and won't distribute it without his/their permission). I've tried to track down the website I got it from, but can't as I do lot of searches for artwork I like, and I have *no* idea where I picked it out from.<br />
<br />
All I'm doing is trying to get my shaman UI looking the way I want to.<br />
<br />
It's fuzzy because it's a jpeg and I often get fuzzy screenshots. If you are referring to the way it's faded, I wanted to get a slightly &quot;watermark&quot; image so that bit was deliberate.<br />
<br />
I wasn't after praise for the picture, but feedback for the UI part of it, so please can you refrain from other types of comments. I realise you were perhaps trying to help, but it came over as rather negative.<br />
<br />
Thankyou.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tadashya</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you said<br />
<br />
I'll dig out the correct info and credit the person accordingly<br />
<br />
so I supplied the info  - ie .. the website from which the original work came.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kaenil said :<br />
<br />
picture seems to be a bit fuzzy<br />
<br />
to which I said yes.. 'its fuzzy because its not the original pic'.  (The original was a bit of linkware art made into a sparkly GIF.  a single frame blown up from that small pic would be fuzzy.)<br />
<br />
that's all I meant.. nothing more.. nothing less. :) <br />
<br />
as for the UI.. abattoir's inventory with that pic looks very nice. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Napata</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for that clarification :)<br />
<br />
sorry if I came over a bit harsh myself, had some bad news this morning, and re-reading my post, I was a bit brusque.<br />
<br />
Apologies for *my* tone now :)<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
<br />
sheesh;)<br />
<br />
*giggle*<br />
<br />
Anyone notice that picture was a little fuzzy?<br />
<br />
JUST KIDDING!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Armengar</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:nana: THERE IT IS!! :nana: <br />
<br />
Thanks for the Laurel Austin link. I used a couple of elements in my shaman spellbook skin but I didn't know who the original artist was in order to give credit. I noticed a bit of a bug in my spellbook graphic display so I'm planning to post an update shortly and I will site credit at that time.<br />
<br />
I found the artwork on a web graphics site but the image host of that site didn't know who had created them. Now that I know who to ask I will also seek permission to use them.</div></div><hr />
