<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khitajrah</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thangor was the origional creator of the UI it went with.  I believe Kudane fixed it and uploaded it to work with LoY.  I don't know if Kudane has kept up Thangor's UI to work with the new patches and such, so you'd have to get in contact with him.<br />
<br />
Glad I could help :)  I've only started messing around with UI's since the last patch broke every single UI I had installed.</div></div><hr />

rebuilt/fixed the delta2.2 w/ the ldon ....and that was a @#$ ...the faq didn't correspond the .xml I was looking at.  Hours later success.<br />
