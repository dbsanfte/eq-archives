<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well we need to wait for the new name servers for my dedicated server to propagate (about 24hrs) Then we can update the eqinterface domain with the new name server information and that takes 24 - 72hrs.<br />
<br />
So if all goes well... 3 - 4 days.<br />
<br />
although I'm expecting problems with my name server as they didnt work for my reseller account. So we will see what happens.<br />
<br />
You should be able to download all attachments on the forums though... just the eqinterface.com download script is down for the count.<br />
<br />
Also this is posted in the wrong forum... I'm gonna go ahead and move it to the correct one.</div></div><hr />
