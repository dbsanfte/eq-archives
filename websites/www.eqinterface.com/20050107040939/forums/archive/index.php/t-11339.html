<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">UIErrors.txt contains over 6 thousand lines of: [Mon Jan 01 00:13:35 2001] Warning: file UIFiles\vert-mod\ not found in directory UIFiles\vert-mod\. Attempting to use file from Default skin.<br />
<br />
I run a self modified version of the Vert mod, starting from 2.5, but I've never ran into this issue before. Any thoughts as to what's causing it?<br />
<br />
Just today I deleted a 93meg UIError.txt file. Thing was too big to even load into Memory to take a peek at it.<br />
<br />
Add onto that a texture.txt file containing thousands of lines of: _t3dLoadBMInfo: unable to load &quot;UIFiles\Default\&quot; (not found)&quot;.<br />
<br />
This file was 63 megs in size. It contained 12 lines for ever 1 second I was online for 5 hours. That's a lot of lines of junk.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I downloaded a fresh new copy of Vert 2.6e and redid the mods.<br />
<br />
After slowly copying files over I managed to locate the main problem being my ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml. Apperently it was attempting to look for a windows file that didn't exsist, I think, but it worked w/out lag. (odd, eh?)<br />
<br />
I also noticed that Vert2.6e, fresh install with the latest patch, will give me that same error above 3 times. Very amigous error, no clue what's causing it but it is present in 2.6e, fresh install.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way... nice to see you guice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey there Dobly! Nice seeing you too. Been doing on the site I've seen. Nice improvements, I like. Although you need to get on Kudane about the Preview Picts for the Vert UIs. They still using Vert2.4 picts. At least they do for me (I can tell by the Invetory window).<br />
<br />
<br />
I've just tried Ocean Spray. As it's currently past my current bed time, I hadn't done any farther testing trying to figure out why my custom version of Vert mod was causing a 96 meg UIError file.<br />
<br />
I'll have to play with the mods another day, maybe Tuesday night or something when I'm off of work (after I've watched X2 like 50 times).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So it is a bug in EQ. Gotta love it.<br />
<br />
I saw three lines, spellbook01, 02 and 03 where not referenced. They were changed to solspellbookXX in the Animations file. I added them as blank references, and no more errors.<br />
<br />
That would also explain my 96  meg UI file. <br />
<br />
All well, all fixed now; I hope.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But now with this last patch, I'm hitting it again, and it's not the spellbook stuff. <br />
<br />
It's definently in the EQUI_Animations.xml file. <br />
<br />
I'm using vert26e-cannibis.<br />
<br />
UIErrors.txt looping on:<br />

	&lt;TextureInfo item = &quot;TargetBox.tga&quot; /&gt;<br />

As indicated in the link above, but that didn't work.</div></div><hr />

Fixed it! Finally after 3 hours of trying!<br />
<br />
Well... that fixed my massive frame loss... but I'm still getting my texture.txt and UIErrors.txt file growing infinitely....</div></div><hr />
