<br />
I unzipped it, put it in uifiles w/ its own folder.<br />
I found some things that I would like to add to that folder, a cursor selection and list of spell icons, both of which i found from the search engine here.<br />
I unzipped those, did ctrl+a and moved them to the UI folder<br />
I reloaded the UI folder in EQ and nothing happened<br />
<br />
How do I make it to where i can keep the UI that i have now, while doing an upgrade changing the cursor and spell icons?</div></div><hr />

Basically...I took a fresh UI, had it loaded, worked just fine. I did my alt tab to windows into ui files, click dragged cursor and Icon files into the new UI. and hit Load soandso UI, everything went to default EXCEPT For the new icons and the cursor didn't pop up. The cursor stayed at Default</div></div><hr />

There are your errors.  You can manually update your EQUI_Animations.xml file (yes, I know, it says Templates, but it's actually an error in the Animations) using the information in this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10083) thread.</div></div><hr />

Click on the link for EQUI_Animations.xml.  If you can use a text editor (Word, WordPerfect, heck even NotePad works) then you should be able to do this.  I think that most folks are able to use those threads of mine fairly well and find my directions pretty easy to follow.  It seems intimidating at first, but it's really not that bad.  Make a back-up folder of your UI, then go for it.  Frankly, other than a bit of time, what have you got to lose, right?  You can do it, give it a whirl. :)</div></div><hr />
