This would be a nice layout for the wpell bar for a UI that had a square space open to place it in.  For my ui's I like to try and keep things as far back from the view area as I can so this would not work for me, but I do like the layout for some of these other ui's that are out there.  In fact now that I think about it this layout would probably fit in the UI I have except for the background graphics I have in the UI would be offset by it.</div></div><hr />

I wanted it in a corner out of the way. Thats why it is where it is.:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it looks neat- but since you mentioned it would be for a caster UI, I have to point out, most casters don't really want their spells out of the way, or at least that's not their primary consideration. Imagine trying to memorize spells on a slightly laggy computer with the castbar laid out like that- or trying to click-cast in the heat of battle; although it is nice and compact for minimal mouse movement, it would be really hard to always click on the right spellgem.</div></div><hr />
