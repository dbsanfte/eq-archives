<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Odibil Lauxes</div><div class="date">09-01-2002, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question(s): I'm really just wondering if we will see any of the following features return to the new upload script:<br />
<br />
- The ability to edit the files and descriptions which you have uploaded when a new version or more information becomes necessary to update.<br />
<br />
- The ability to name your mod, instead of displaying the generic file name (eq_ui_inventory_mod.zip); it's not very pretty. :P<br />
<br />
- The number of files available per section, illustrated such as &quot;Inventory [6].&quot;<br />
<br />
- The ability to list files by popularity, author, etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestion(s): The following are suggested features which did not appear in the old script, but might be beneficial:<br />
<br />
- Adding a &quot;Popular Mods&quot; section which automatically lists 25-50 of the most popular mods. An alternative would be to display the 5 or 10 most popular mods in their respective sections.<br />
<br />
- The ability to add a thumbnail to your description, in addition to the clickable link to view your image, making it much more visually appealing. Possibly restricting the thumbnail file size and/or dimensions to cut down on bandwidth.<br />
<br />
- Font Bug: The current script defaults all descriptions to the &quot;Times New Roman&quot; font, which doesn't go with the rest of the site's Verdana appearance.</div></div><hr />

It will take me some time as I'm going to be takeing a short break once I get the server load issues under control.<br />
<br />
I have not been able to play EQ since the start of this site. I want to get back and start playing. I've also put off a great deal of things in RL I need to attend to as well. ;)</div></div><hr />
