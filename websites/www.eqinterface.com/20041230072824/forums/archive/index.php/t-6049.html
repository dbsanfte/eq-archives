<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">talionjustice</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a mod for the pet window that uses half of the TKing Celtic cast bar (The round one). It no longer works, broke a few patches ago, and i switched to the default pet window. Would really like to get it back, as it matches the rest of my mix and match UI. I can't post my uierrors log, as i am at work. What is basicly said was the buttons were missing? It loaded up anyway, but I haven't tried it as of the 1/28 patch. If anyone has fixed/can help me fix this, let me know. I will try and post the uierror log when I get home and load up the skin with that in it. Will also post a screenshot of my UI. Mostly Tking stuff, with a few others thrown in for good measure. <br />

I appears you either have a wrong tag or an open tag.  If you can't figure it out, just post lines 1 through 10 here.</div></div><hr />

Ok, that file was supposed to have been replaced and I think it was for a while, I downlloaded it myself to check anyway... you can find a good copy here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=27415#post27415)  Make sure you say 'yes' to replace existing EQUI_PetInfoWindow.  If you want to fiddle with the xml file.  The line with my name in it has a hidden character generated by Word.  Delete this line and voila, problem goes away.<br />

Did get an updated file (an hour or so difference) trying it now, and I am sure it will work. I really like this, as it  matches everthing else, Thanks for the good work.</div></div><hr />
