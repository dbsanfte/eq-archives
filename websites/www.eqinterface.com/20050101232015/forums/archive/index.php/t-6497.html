<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spooks</div><div class="date">02-08-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone tell me where I can find a vertical spell window for Vert2.2 Nexium?  I used to have one, and I've been having a lot of problems with the spell window disapearing. So I tried to reload the skin (just reload, didn't dl it again) and now I have the stupid horizontal spell window with 2 rows. I just want the vertical one that has each spell icon on top of one like I used to have.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!</div></div><hr />

There was a bug in the last patch that was causing windows and gauges to displace, which *should* be fixed now... check this thread (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6413) for info, to see if that fixes the problem.<br />

If your reload the UI and a different spell bar is showing up, you may want to double check what folder you're telling it to load... the best way to reload your UI is the command /loadskin foldername; adding a 1 at the end will keep all windows in their current position (which may not help); leaving off the 1 will move all windows to their default position - you would have to move them all back where you want, but at least you'd be able to see them all.<br />
<br />
Again, about the spellbar, it wouldn't hurt to unzip that downloaded file into your custom UI folder again, just make sure the right one's in there.<br />
<br />
It's always a good idea to check your UIErrors.txt file; if you're still stumped, post it here.</div></div><hr />
