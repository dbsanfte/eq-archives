<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will see a filter section called Melee which will open a new window where you can choose which melee text you want to go to the new window. You will have to repeat the process a few times to get what you want in the window. Plus there is a filter which you can also choose how you want the text to be (i.e., Your misses: Abbreviated, Number only, or Full [or whatever its called] so your text during combat will look like this:<br />
<br />
Full: You pierced the mist wolf and do 130 point of damage<br />
Abbreviated: You damage the mist wolf for 130 points of damage.<br />
Number only: You do 130 points of damage.<br />
<br />
Same thing for misses:<br />
<br />
Full: You attack the mist wolf but miss.<br />
Abbreviated: You miss the mist wolf.<br />
Miss Only: Miss<br />
<br />
This feature can also be applied to others attacks including the creatures.</div></div><hr />
