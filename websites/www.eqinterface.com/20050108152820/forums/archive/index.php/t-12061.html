I need some assistance. This is a very very old UI, I think one of the first out there back from June 2002.  Clearly there have been upgrades since that time and usually I find little ways to fix them. Now I&quot;m at a road block.  In the second image you'll notice that it lacks a lot of those little buttons (map key, song box key, guild manager keys). I've found a way to modify to add the buttons but now the colors don't match.  It's colored default UI gray. How do I color them to match?<br />
<br />
Second, the second image shows inventory window pieces.  My charm slot still lacks a colored slot with a name such as shown above.  How can I add one?<br />
<br />
Lastly, my hotkeys need color. How do I fix that?<br />
<br />
Any help is most appreciate thanks much!!!!!<br />

It should be a matter of recoloring the sections in that graphic and placing it in your custom ui folder.<br />
<br />
I've attached a quickly recolored version that might get you where you're wanting to go.  You would of course need to resave it as a .tga file to use it as is.</div></div><hr />
