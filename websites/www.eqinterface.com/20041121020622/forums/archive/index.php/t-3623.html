I was curious if I could have those show in 2 seperate places.  Like in my spell book as well.  I have tried a couple different things, but have yet to get them to show up.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling you can't clone things period.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance to any and all that reply with suggestions or advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mykill</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried movin' things around from 'window' to 'window' a couple times also.  I use SidlWidl for my editing, BTW.  I have been successful with moving an attribute I want in one window to another, but this isn't 'cloning' it's just moving.  I do believe cloning is possible tho.  I'll give an example.  I currently have (2) casting guages.  One is embedded in my target window, and the other is the default stand-alone window.  This came about by looking at the code for the default and finding out what 'EQ_Type' was used for the gauge.  I then created another gauge object in my target window and changed the 'EQ_Type' on it to match the default.  So, I now have 2 casting gauges.  Granted, the objects' names are different, but the effect is a 'clone' of the original.<br />

Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a quick rundown of what can and can't be moved:<br />
<br />
Gauges, inventory slots and labels have EQTypes and can be moved or cloned. <br />
<br />
Buttons, spellgems, scribed spells and autoequip must remain in their original windows with their original names or they will not work. <br />
<br />
Some strange things like class animations can be moved out of their original window but will not work unless the original is open. These still cannot be cloned.<br />
<br />
Other limitations on moving stuff: <br />
<br />
If you take the breath gauge out of the breath window it will always be visible, even if you're not underwater.<br />
<br />
If a window is tabbed by default (hotbuttons, spellbook, actions window) you cannot move buttons between tabs, nor can you make two tabs visible at the same time. However, if the tabs are user-created, you can move things between the tabs as you please.<br />
<br />
Certain windows require certain components. You can't remove these components but you can shrink them to 1x1 so they are invisible. For instance, the Player window has to have the PetHP gauge and the CastSpell window has to have the book button.</div></div><hr />
