<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orpington2019</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, so i dual box on a 533mghz 512 ram with a 810 intel chip set...the computer can not run in windows mode for eq...<br />
<br />
anyways...<br />
<br />
The problem I have is I can set the brightnest until it almost white but when eq starts to create graphics such as on the character select screen it is dark and in game it is almost impossible to see anything in a dark zone...<br />
<br />
I was starting to think that it is a problem with either some setting in eq or with how direct x is set up to display...the latter I think is more likely as it seems it is over-riding my current graphics settings...and yes the Gamma is all of the way up in eq...in fact I went in to the eqclient settings and changed it from the setting of 8 to 50 and 20 and 12 and no change...I was hoping someone knew a little about how to change direct x settings to display brighter...but any help would be appreciated...thanks...<br />
