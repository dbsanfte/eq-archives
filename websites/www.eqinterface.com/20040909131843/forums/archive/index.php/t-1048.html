<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizzestra</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to the addition of the compass feature the old Reaver skin is broken. I updated it with this new one and added a few additional mods from Dalink, Rombus, Kudil and Larch. I also have a Necromancer skin (similar to the Reaver one, but a different color for those who didn't like the purple) and the Shaman skin I have been working on. Here are some screen shots below. As soon as eqinterface.com can start receiving emails again I will get these to them so you can download them there too.<br />
<br />
Feel free to modify these in any way you see fit you don't have to ask me for permission to use or modify them in any way. Have fun with them. <br />

I use the Necro one for my SK (I know, I'm kinda partial to blue).  I am D/Ling your Shaman skin for use with my BL and Ranger.  I was wondering if you were perhaps working on a Mod of your skins for Rangers, maybe a green tone to it?  <br />
<br />
Great work!  Thanks!!<br />

I am moving from California to Texas first of September so my time has and will be pretty limited for a while.</div></div><hr />

i made a folder like am supposed to and in EQ i typed/loadskin Necro and it loaded the default one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ballin_povar</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having the same problem myself with the Shaman one. I have been able to get other ones to work, but I'm pretty bumed out that this one won't... I really liked the look of it.:(  Going to delete it and try to DL it again and hope I can get it working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizzestra</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not having any issues with any of these working on my system just as they are. However I am getting a message that they are incompatible every time I zone. I know that is because they are changing the xml files with every patch still.<br />
<br />
   I am not ,unfortunately, going to make a new set of these every few weeks while VI pulls their heads out of their sphincters. I am going to wait a few more weeks to see what other changes to the UI they are going to make since it will undoubtedly change with the release of Planes of Power yet again. They are going to add Raid windows for xp and loot to Planes of Power so that will break all UIs yet again. Once that Stabilizes, I will redo these Skins with all updated files.<br />
<br />
   Till then, be well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizzestra</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not the author of that skin though it looks like he used a few of my graphics like the skulls on the buttons and such. I think the author of that skin can be found in the forums located here. http://www.eqclasses.com/forums/ Best of luck to you but as a side note, as of the PoP release patch, all custom UI's are broken and will need to be updated. Many authors will be waiting a few weeks to update these skins too, because SOE/VI will be breaking the UI's every patch for a few weeks while they work out the bugs. Most skin authors will wait a while for the UI to stabilize before updating them.</div></div><hr />
