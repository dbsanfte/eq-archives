<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">falwith</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi again, it's been a while since I've had a request for the gurus, but here I am.  I am generally pleased with my UI now, but I have seen a few little items that I like and I have tried to add them with no success.  The biggest one I like is a new window for my spells, however, for some reason it is erroring out and going to the default UI.<br />
<br />
Below is a link (I hope) to a copy of the window I like, taken from the SARS UI.  I'd like to steal the look and size, and just add this look to my current mix of pieces.  I have the spellgems I like and such, so just the altered background etc is all I need.  I kinda like Mav's pet window too, from the Mav Ranger UI, but I'm willing to live with the old default pet window for now.<br />
<br />
Any help in fixing this window would really be appreciated, though, as having tried my hand at changing stuff in the XML and seeing ERROR every time I try to load has shown me this is beyond my skills.<br />

Thanks in advance, as you guys continue to boggle me with speedy replies and outstanding results.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">falwith</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think it's Sars.  Now that I'm going through them, I could be wrong.  Either way, I have looked at a lot of different stuff and there's only this one that catches my eye more than what I have now (robbed from yet another complete set)<br />
<br />
If there's a way, I wouldn't mind using it.  Maybe if I knew what to change in my animations file?  I don't use one currently, so it's the default one being grabbed.  <br />
<br />
I was wondering why all the other mixes I've done worked but this one flopped.  Any further guidance is a bonus at this stage I guess.  Sure would look nice hangin there tho, heh heh.</div></div><hr />
