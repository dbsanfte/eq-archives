<br />
I cant wait to get the ring working.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure they are working on finding a definate answer and fixing it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roger Sewell</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is one issue that we are currently looking into, and that is with the Radeon 9600, and a few other ATI cards as a test, but primarily the Radeon 9600.   In most cases, not being able to see the 3D Target Indicator it is due to unsupported hardware.  Feel free to shoot me an email and I'll do my best to answer your questions.  I apologize I don't have more time to post on this forum, but the EQ Tech Boards keep me pretty busy most of the week.<br />
<br />
I look forward to hearing from you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am hoping for the parsing fix so we don't have to put these same files in every custom mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI,<br />
<br />
When the indicator is turned on, this ini file is reloaded and exiting the game should not be required in order to tweak settings or images to your satisfaction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both files are in a Custom test mod folder:<br />
<br />
~ no change is shown to the ini file when the indicator is turned on and off in-game, not reloading.<br />
<br />
~ no change is shown when camping to the Character Select Screen, then back in. The settings must had been still in memory.<br />
<br />
~ supposedly you can camp to Sever Select, and back in-game, however this gives an unstable error and exits the game.<br />
<br />
~ change is only shown when exiting out of EverQuest, then back in-game.</div></div><hr />

Go figure. Although it did seem the default ring was rather dim so I switched to one of the mods (enoks) and it's fine now.</div></div><hr />
