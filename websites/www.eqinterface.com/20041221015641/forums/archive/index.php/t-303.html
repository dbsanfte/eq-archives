<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ryn Darkwater</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As you can probably guess from the title I'm a Paladin.<br />
<br />
From time to time we all hit the wrong hotkey and it gets annoying but for some it matters less then others. It could be a cast you can duck out of, the wrong spell. Normally in everyday situations you can deal with it.<br />
<br />
But I am tired of hitting Lay Hands by mistake. Thats an hour I have to wait. To that end I shifted my lay hands button to page 6 and made all 10 hotkeys LH so I could slam the keyboard.<br />
<br />
The upshot of this is that Im a little slow with my lay hands. <br />
<br />
Is there any chance that somebody could put this in a window for me that I can have it available quite quickly yet not have to worry about losing a hotkey.<br />
<br />
Possibly this could be a small button to the right of the hotkey buttons. I'd also like the window to be of the smaller variety with no title but otherwise remain the same.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

We do not have the ability to add buttons, or even to remove them (i think) because of the way the UI has been coded.  Only the original button as it is placed in the default UI (meaning, in that window) will work.  And, I believe, attempting to remove a button will also fail, you must leave at least the definition which includes the ScreenType.<br />
<br />
As for your problem, make your hotkey a short macro:<br />
<br />
/gsay Laying hands on %T!!<br />
/pause 5<br />
/doability X<br />
<br />
Adjust the pause how you like it .. and if you didn't mean to hit it duck before that pause is up.  You cannot lay hands while ducking.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is a short pause.  But you already admit to a pause in your current use :)   That's the method I chose to save my lay hands when I played a pally though.</div></div><hr />

I've seen a screenshot of a rangers set up where there are 10 hotkeys and then a track button.<br />
<br />
The EQclass is there for combat abilities so I know it can be added but I dont really know how to modify the files to give the correct distances and all. Nor do I know how to shrink my hotkeys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arantius</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oooh Ryn I stand corrected...  I got so used to churning out the &quot;can't add a button&quot; response.  Perhaps it is possible if you figure out the right EQType/ScreenID/whatever this would take.</div></div><hr />

I know that hitting Lay Hands was part of the risk, but it no longer has to be. Thats like saying dying is one of the risks of driving so we shouldn't fit seatbelts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">buzweaver</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but driving is reality, the game is not. Dying in the game is hardly a life changing, family friend and societal event.<br />
<br />
Here is an Idea taken from a Tank UI, you could just change it to Lay of Hands: http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/potusvz/fullsize/warriorui.jpg</div></div><hr />

<br />
Resizing the button and moving it would be all I needed.</div></div><hr />
