<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaenarinEQ</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey there, a friend of mine (also a Paladin, on the Tallon Zek server.) directed me here thinking that maybe I could find a neat (and efficient) UI for the 2 of us.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not the most computer literate person on the planet (*cough*newb*cough*), and a LOT of the stuff I've seen here blows my mind, really excellent, but I really don't want to go mixing and matching stuff with my limited knowledge of..well..anything to do with this medium.           <br />
<br />
My question is this: Where can I find a UI mod that has the following features,<br />
<br />
Basics: Compass, chat window, spell gems, HP/Mana bar (percentages would be nice) *Target window*, Hotbuttons, spellbook, cast bar, inventory, buff window etc.<br />
<br />
and the frills! &quot;Clickie box&quot; (saw one in another UI, GREAT idea) Resist monitoring bar, Some kind of timer for a class ability? (LoH timer, /disc timer)<br />
some kind of /loc thingy...you know, stuff that could make life a little easier and free up some space on my 7 full hotkey menus.    :D <br />
<br />
If any of you Pro's have any suggestions, or know of a Fully compiled mod that you'd wanna post here...that would be *amazing*! Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />

<br />
 - first of all , your /loc thingie , is just not possible, sorry , XML is about desing , it can't execute commands like /loc ( so no loc , no time ) <br />
<br />
 - you should be able to get that wix mix and match really easily: <br />
<br />
 right clickies should be found in the download section,<br />
 extanded player window, with percentages and stats/resists, should be there too<br />
 timer can be found here : http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp, arista made an awesome job on those <br />
 for pvp, you should get a modded buff window too ( geddine one is great, if i am correct)<br />
 <br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply though :)</div></div><hr />
