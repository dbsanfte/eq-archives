<br />
For example Window_Pieces01.dds can be moded to a UI and still have Window_Pieces02.tga function correctly. <br />
<br />
The confusion is if a file calls wnd_bg_light_rock.tga and you converted it to a DDS you must change all the files it's in. <br />
IE.  EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
and EQUI_Templates.xml<br />
<br />
Now if you have an exisitng Mod that still references it as a TGA it will crash.<br />
So alot of the Custom Mods out there will be incompatible. That was why the warning was there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">because the icons are not part of the UI for solaria (or shouldn't be) you can use any TGA versions by just throwing them into the folder with the rest of the files.</div></div><hr />

I use the Solaris UI on 3 comps (2 at home and 1 at work) I just put the new one on my work comp and it was loading twice as fast as it used to both through zones and into the game.<br />
<br />
Was also wondering if you (Sokol) have a feedback thread for the 2.0 Experimental yet or if I should just e-mail you any bugs i find?</div></div><hr />

Emails or PM's work best :) My hours at work very every day and are usualy hectic so there are often times I'm unable to check boards for a couple days at a time.<br />
