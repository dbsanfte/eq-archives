Also, getting TONS of visual lag with both the caster and melee player windows. Not sure of the cause.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guessing (just a guess!) that the visual lag is because it is looking for the mouse.tga picture.  Once you get that it should fix the lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thelonstormeyes</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, popped the mouse.tga from old Vert mod and it still lagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goah</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG I love Vert UI, I have used it since Vert1.  The new UI you guys are doin is very great work.  Keep it up :D<br />
<br />
I have a question tho.  I attached a pic of a UI I saw on my Guild's MB.  If you look at the buffs they have timers on them.  I would really really really love to see this incoroporated into this UI if possible.  I am not to keen on the 2 names on each buff, if you could maybe make it so that only the color changes as the buff wears and not have 2 names?  I dont know how difficult the coding is on this or anything.  I hope you can get a mod of this running on the UI.  I will look forward to your response!<br />
<br />
Another Mod I would like to see if possible is chat boxes w/o the header boxes.  I dont like clutter and do see a purpose to them  :)<br />
<br />
I also get the lag, I just made a folder and copied all files into it, I copied the melee player window to main folder then ingame I just did /load vert3 1 to save position of window.  I had no mouse what so ever and was very very laggy.  Again probably laggy due to missing Mouse, I did not try to place old mouse file into new UI.  :D :D</div></div><hr />

The faded buffs are bard songs that are just faded. There is no way to have timers that are directly connected to buff time.<br />

<br />
2. Please post your UIerror.txt files attaching them in a zip is a great way to do it... cut n paste it also works.. we can not tell you any solutions for problems without seening what the UI thinks is wrong..<br />

3. If you get lag there are a couple of extra things we would like to know.. CPU speed/ram/video card/video ram we want to see if there is a patern to those that see lag.<br />

here is a patch file that will fix it if you have already downloaded the 1.0<br />
<br />
i am updating the orignal with the same files so it should be fixed for now.. <br />
<br />
Sokol will have to go back through the code and figure out what was missed in the calls for the mouse.. and what is still calling 08..<br />

... and it spams the file like mad, that's where all the lag is coming from is because of the file system usage to spit that out.<br />

I reverted back to my Drakah DAOC (with self mods) and *poof* gone.  Have to love those -really- descriptive error messages, eh? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

i will investigate this window further, but with it up, it lags like no tomorrow with it closed it doesn't. the odd thing is, yesterday there was 0 lag with all windows open, but I will look into it further.<br />

We will take it out ine the next beta release after you all can try it w/o the lag :)<br />
<br />
Another one, toss in buff.tga and that will help to, for now let me fix the changes and upload a new version.<br />

EDIT:<br />
Try this for now and let me know overwrite ALL files,<br />
Remove window_pieces08.tga<br />
Remove Buff.tga<br />
Remove Mouse.tga<br />

NOTE: the above fix is still being tested.<br />
sorry for the problems, but thats what betas are for eh?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raijuta</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just D/L and tried it out a few moments ago I got to say it looks great! But there was a problem. I don't know if this had anything to do with the earlier mentioned problems but when I loaded the UI in the mouse suddenly started to move slower than normal. Not by much mind you but enough to notice. I wasn't really on long enough to do anything else, really just wanted to see what it looked like in game. Overall I would have to say that this is going to be a great UI once it has been bug free and finalized. You guys do great work!! <br />
I did however get some UI errors and I've sent them along for you to look at. Also this is the full version and the patch all installed before I logged in. My system specs are as follow,<br />
|GeForece 2 MX400|<br />
|AMD Athelon K7 700mb|<br />
|192 mb RAM|<br />
Yes my system is sorta low end but it runs EQ with no problems and haveing a fast cable connections seams to make it all worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Patryn</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just started using the beta and thought I would point this out..  if you try to align all the status bars ie: target window, player window, group window, etc the one that displays player statistics along with the tab for pet commands and statistics does not align correctly.<br />
<br />
The compass used to be the same size as all the other windows as well but I can understand they new size for the compass.  Just thought you would like to know about that player / pet window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">only the following windows were revamped in this release and are set to the same size..<br />
<br />
Player Window<br />
Spell Window (with text)<br />
Buff Window<br />
SD Buff window<br />
Group Window<br />
<br />
<br />
we have plans to make sure the target window/pet window get an update soon too.<br />
<br />
and as the compass is actually 1/4 bigger than it was.. its not loading a ton of dead space..(look at screenshot for vert) and you will see what I mean<br />
<br />
with the new maps out in game there was no need for the red and green dots to be on the Compass anymore.<br />
<br />
and Murdercrow, with that system almost ANY UI will give you a tiny amount of lag over the default..<br />
<br />
try it and try the vert 2.5 see if there is a difference between the two .. if so what.. (get back to me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raijuta</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no i found out why the mouse was lagging. appearantly a popup from a program i forgot to close caused EQ to lag thus makeing it seem that the UI was lagging. After that I went back and tried it again and no lag the only problem is that it still writes a UIerror.txt file. Other than that everything seems fine ,no bugs.<br />
well unles you count the error file</div></div><hr />

It is because not all graphic or xml files are included in the custom UI, so it is going to look in the default folder for the missing ones.  These lines in the error file are not actually errors...more like warnings telling you that it didn't find such and such a file so it is going to use the one from the default folder.</div></div><hr />

I used Solaria 1.x for about 4 hours last night, and lemme just say I love it. :D  You guys did a great job with this one.<br />
<br />
That being said, I noticed one slight oversight... the player select screen shows Vert Mod version 2.4 instead of the Solaria text that was there in version 0.9.  Did you guys include the wrong file?<br />
<br />
Otherwise, fantastic!</div></div><hr />

ALL custom UIs should write a UIError log... its just telling you that it didnt find those pieces in the UI and that it went to the default folder for them. those errors are nothing to worry about.. as a matter of fact If your not getting those something is very wrong...</div></div><hr />

After the patch though, this ran smooth.... not one error or any lag.<br />
<br />
  Now for my opinion: <br />
<br />
   The Spells window is a little big say compared to Vert 2.5, where it was the say height as the Hotbutton window. <br />
<br />
<br />
 Other then the opinion I had I loved the UI. The player and group windows look great and I love the fact that I don't have &quot;bubbles&quot; for bars anymore.<br />

Perhaps you could provide two sizes of spellbars as an option, sorta like the melee and caster player bars?</div></div><hr />

<br />
though we are looking at some &quot;add ons&quot; that might be a little simplier. and shrink it a little.<br />
<br />
also if we dont add the on/off button we will be shrinking it by 20 pix or so from top to bottom.</div></div><hr />

Here's my wishlist for mods after beta:<br />
<br />
- bigger target bar<br />
- casting bar in chat windows<br />
- compass with +/- indicators<br />

Also, maybe I missed it but what happened with the button on the spell bar to turn names on/off?</div></div><hr />

Well tabs happened, and theyw ay they work as compared to the way we wanted them to work. were still lookign into it, but it's on the back burner.<br />
<br />
There is a mod I made in the Vert sectino with a casting bar on the chat window that will work with this, BUT we will be upgrading it to solaria.<br />
<br />
+/- should be easily added, and kudane already had a a TGA for me, so well work on it soon, we need the core UI done and tested before we work on mods, but we realy realy appreciate the feedback!<br />

<br />
One thing id change though<br />
<br />
In Player window for S (stamina) P (pet)  When you move the cursoe over any one of the Letters have it say Stamina and pet.<br />
<br />
:-) Just an idea.  Id do it but havent messed with UI in a while or id do it myself<br />
<br />
Also,<br />
<br />
Make the Spells Memed Window Smaller if possible same with hot buttons.  Less Eye candy...more Viewing Window :-)<br />
<br />
Otherwise I love it.<br />
<br />
If i figure out the Cursoe thing for Playerwindow Ill post it</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) The font size is waaaaaay to small to read at 1600x1200 on a 17&quot; monitor, a minor issue I know but is there anyway to do a slightly bigger version using font size 2 instead of 1.<br />
<br />
2) The disabled button image for the inventory is currently set to use the destroy button image, which looks a bit wierd. This shows up on the 'dye' button if you dont have LoY enabled.<br />
<br />
3) I agree with others, the spell bar is a little bulky compared to the other windows.<br />

Otherwise I think it looks fab, and I havent had any lag issues with it so far.</div></div><hr />

HOLY COW! 17&quot; monitor and 1600x1200... .try a REALISTIC rez... I have a 19&quot; and wont go over 1280x1024...  change your rest 1152x768 and see if things are not much easier to read..<br />
<br />
I will tell ya right now.. the font size is not a problem.. and we wont be changing it.. I have got a lot more feedback liking that we got the whole buff name in there.. and at 1280x1024 on a 19&quot; it perfectly readable..<br />

Actualy changing this requires less info, or large window sizes, which is soemthing alot are against, we've discussed this before, and there were afew mods with larger font on specific window, and I will once again release several mods once the Core UI is done, but theres not alot of play room with fonts.<br />
<br />
Will look into the disabled button.<br />
<br />
Lag issues were fixed and were caused by a minor oversite on ym part which resaulted in horendous lag.<br />

Thanks for the info... watch for a patch from Sokol some time this afternoon..<br />

this is a glitch that stemmed from Vert's conversion of some graphics.. we have used a different style of graphic... sooo now we need to re-code the animation file to put the book in correctly..</div></div><hr />

Try it again today.. see if you get lag..<br />
<br />
and make sure your running 1.3 the most recent version..<br />
<br />
also if you zone more than 8 times its a good idea to hit ALT-ENTER to enter window mode, and hit ALT-ENTER right back in to full screen... there is a video lag created by multiple zoning that is cleared up with that little trick.. (nothing to do with the UI)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the fact that the health bar is *RED*.   Do you know how long I've looked at a green (or white) health bar?  Thanks for bringing red back to health!<br />
<br />
I love the &quot;tiny vertical bars&quot; look on the Health, Mana, and EXP bars!  Very nice<br />
<br />
<br />
There would only be a couple of mods I'd like to see for this, and I mean only a couple too since its damn near perfect for what I'm looking for. <br />
<br />
1) + and - Compass thats extremely easy to read :)  .. My favorite has always been<br />
www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1312 (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1312) <br />
<br />
2) A right-side buff bar.  Example: www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1447 (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1447) <br />
<br />
3) And finally Bigger health readout at the bottom.  I'd like the player window to be a little bigger horizontally and have that extra space used to make *huge* health text I want to proudly see my 8800 hitpoints :)<br />
<br />
(I couldnt find a good example, since all I'd really like to see is the font increased in size and visability I'll give an example of how big I'd like to see the xxxx / xxxx Hitpoints readout to be relative to the other information)<br />
www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1948 (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/picture.php?s=&amp;id=1948) <br />

we are actually working on a new spell gem lay out, we have had many feedbacks both here and in PMs that have said it was a little long..<br />
<br />
current SpellBar is 350x155 (tallxwide) the one I mocked-up for Sokol to look at last night was 280x155... a full 70pix smaller. <br />
<br />
Waiting on him to get back to me on what he thinks of the look.. once we have that we will show it to the beta crowd.. <br />
<br />
but to answer your question.. Both the Spellgems and Buffs will be offered in a LEFT and RIGHT format.. once we are getting out of beta.. (which shouldnt be too long)</div></div><hr />

Any way I'm working on the XML files for afew things, and experimenting here and there, even though it's a Beta I am trying to have as few bugs, and as little Lag as possible, yet still offer all the features and then some that you all want.<br />

Here is what you need to do...<br />
DL the file atatched to this post, then extract it to your Solaria Directory. then enter the Solaria directory and remove the following files.<br />
<br />
REMOVE:<br />
EQUI_BookWindow.xml<br />
spellbook01.tga<br />
spellbook02.tga<br />
spellbook03.tga<br />
<br />
You should NOT have a spellbook04.tga but if you do remove that also.<br />
<br />
That's all there is to it, you should now have the standard book back.  (except for the spell book which is our new one)<br />

<br />
1) a mod that increases the size of the buff icons and descriptions a bit. i am old, my eyes not what they used to be, and my glasses misplaced. not overly larger, but some.<br />
<br />
2) a mod based off of the 4x2 spell gem set. if you use the vert 2.5 2x4 mod you will see the problem. it works but is a bit messy, the boarders (colors etc) are a smidge to large for the gems.<br />

other then that, the UI is awsome and works fine, i have seen no problems yet.<br />

<br />
We are NOT accepting request for &quot;custom mods&quot; at this time<br />
<br />
We WILL have a whole thread for tweaks, and customized items AFTER we get out of beta.. <br />
<br />
What we are looking for now are Bugs, Glitches, and Other things that will cause errors in playing (such as the book problem, or lag problem from earlier)<br />
<br />
We are tweaking a few things such as the spell bar from the feed back of &quot;seems a bit long&quot; that we got..<br />
<br />
and we enourage feedback of &quot;this is clunky&quot; or &quot;this seems to big&quot;<br />
<br />
But requesting any of the following is just being redundant and not helping us :(<br />
<br />
Buff Bar Reversed<br />
Spell Bar Reversed<br />
4x2 Spell Bar<br />
Horizontal Spell Bar<br />
Hotbutton Mods<br />
Bigger Target Bar<br />
Bigger Player Window<br />
Bigger Group Bars<br />
A Bagel with Cream Cheese<br />
Eggs Benidict after 1pm<br />
A woman's pump in size 15<br />
<br />
I am not coming down on people for giving feedback.. but we have had FOUR people request the same thing, and we keep saying &quot;we are not taking those type of request right now&quot;  and no one seems to be listening..<br />
<br />
Sooo please, go play EQ, break the mod.. take a screenshot and come back and post the picture so we can fix it!<br />
<br />
When it goes into final release we will post in the Request Forum that we are willing to make tweaks for people<br />

I always like to place my group, player info and target windows on top of each other (not on top on top but like a tower). To me it looks like they aren't equally wide (I think it is the player info that is a little too wide).<br />

<br />
The Lag from solaria was caused by a frew last minute changes that Kudane and I though would be nice to make, and I inadvertently left a few calls to some removed TGA files which I was no longer haveing Solaria use, and that caused the lag. We extensivly tested all changes each time, except for this one as it had no real function other then to speed up the UI Frame Rate wise. Which DID work after I finished the changes properly, and thats what the &quot;LAG fix Patch&quot; is just my actualy completeing what I started before I ziped up that file.<br />

Now as for your problem, try using the Windows Application Compatibility Toolkit from the widnows site. <br />
<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/appcompatibility/toolkit.mspx<br />
<br />
I HAVE to use this for all the UI stuff I do, so I can alt tab out of EQ to make changes to Vert, and now Solaria.<br />
I've even managed to have this fix afew issues with other games that wouldn't run in WinXP (Although I've been kept so busy lately with all the different Solaria Ideas/changes I havent been able to Play anything, for every thing you guys see, theres atleast 2-3+ other versions that didnt pan out like we expected)<br />
<br />
Any way try that and see if it works, you should be able to ALT+TAB when it blacks out, and then re-enter EQ from that.<br />
<br />
another option hit CTRL+ALt+DLT then just close the Windows Task Manager and click in the EQ window, this sometimes unsticks Eq and shows you your screen again.<br />

Love the mod.<br />
<br />
But (isn't there always one??!?)<br />
<br />
I always like to place my group, player info and target windows on top of each other (not on top on top but like a tower). To me it looks like they aren't equally wide (I think it is the player info that is a little too wide).<br />
Don't know if they where ment to be equal but I hope they can be made that way.  <br />
<br />
<br />
What you see in the screen shot at the begining of this post is so far the ONLy changed windows for Solaria, were testing them in Bulks, when we find otu they work were moving on.<br />
In other words, the windows will be stackable and the same width when we get to moding the other windows...<br />
<br />
Which is now a good time to explain some things about Solaria..<br />
Solaria is not just an &quot;eye candy&quot; Mod I have toyed with this idea for ALONG time, and Kudane and I joined forces to make Solaria, it's just taken longer for us to finaly settle down to like thinking.<br />
If you guys could just see our cell phone bills as were in different states :)<br />
<br />
Any way Solarias #1 purpose is to reduce UI related Lag caused by frame rate, and still allow a good asthetic look, AND maintain all the information I have in vert.  This we have accomplished allbeit fairly slowly only because some things didnt work like I figured they would, or some things did, but not to top efficiency.<br />
<br />
Any way we will be continuing with the Core Solaria UI, which involves changing ALL the default viewable windows. IE. those staring you in the face on your screen at all times...<br />
<br />
We will then go thorugh the other windows and see if we feel there is a need to change them for performance, or asthetic purposes giving priority to performance. We will NOT change something astheticaly if it causes a performance hit. You notice we dont have tabs for the spell casting window like we had planed? The performance hit and the way tabs work just did not fit into the Reason behind Solaria, so there on tha back burner untill I can figure a away if there is one to include them without the performance/functionality hit.<br />
<br />
I Hope this helps you understand were not beign rude when Kudane says no requests, it's just that we have an inumerable amoutn of mods planed, as I remember the myriad of request I got/get for the Vert UI ever since I began with Vert at Ver 1.0<br />
We will finish the UI, and then begin the mods based of what my most requested was, and the feasability for these mods.<br />
<br />
And as Always thanks for the great posative feedback and emails I've gotten, it's always nice to here from people who genuinly love what I do, and kind of exciting knowing I've litteraly impacted so many of your lives, Eq may be a game but lets face it it's a big part of our lives!<br />
<br />
Take Care,<br />
-Sokol<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: The target window has not realy been modded astheticaly yet (Word for the day) only for performance.</div></div><hr />

I know you're still working on the windows lining up and such, so I won't say anything about those.<br />
<br />
My input:<br />
<br />
I'm undecided about your new gauge bars... I have to pause just a wee bit longer when looking at my exp bars when I'm trying to tell someone how many yellow or blue &quot;bubs&quot; I have left to ding. Yes, petty, I know. :)<br />
<br />
Also, it seems that the last icon on the spellbar is maybe 1 pixel too low and doesn't line up with its corresponding box.<br />
<br />
The thing I've always loved about your mods is how modular they are. It makes it very easy to modify or mix and match components to get what I like.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all you do.</div></div><hr />

Any way I thought of this too as my wife uses &quot;bubles&quot; not percent and when I say 5% she says &quot;That meens nothing to me.&quot; But I've found for my own personal use, I've found that it's MUCH easier to see actualy gains, as there are (um never counted) little sections now making keeping track of actual gains much easier.<br />
<br />
BUT We could see about adding a Marker of some sort in 4ths to simulat bubbles, let me talk it over with Kudane and We'll figure something out.<br />

I've been testing with 1.3 since the weekend and have only come across one &quot;potential&quot; bug.<br />
<br />
Its hard to say if its the game or the UI, but I seem to be experiencing some latency when adding and removing group members (or disbanding entirely). I don't experience it when disbanding from a raid, only group level command.<br />

Hard for me to say if its specific to the mod, but I have noticed it since I installed it. I will try and switch to default to test if I see a diff there but figured I'd go ahead and post it.<br />

I think the issues you're seeing related to the various /group and /raid bugs that have been plaguing people since the last patch (not the one on 6/24). I'm hoping that Sony will be able to figure out the issue and correct it. I'm willing to bet that when they do the latency you're seeing will vanish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually they smaller text boxes on the right side of my UI have the text imput boxes, they are just hidden, the botton one is just moved off the screen and the top one is just moved so that once you click on the bottom one it conceals the top input line.  tedious - yes, good looking - for sure.  I just snagged the chat box XML from Hobben's UI from www.afterlifeguild.org.  I am hopping that Sokol will make one tho after Solaria goes live and they start mods.</div></div><hr />

that was not our intent.. it was a glitch with one of the earlier versions.. Sokol has since fixed this..<br />

download the file again, and reinstall from scratch and see if its not fixed.<br />

I would love to have chat boxes with no input.. this is hard coded on the serverside, a chat box &quot;will&quot; always have an input box unless SOE codes a &quot;no chat here&quot; feature.. which we have asked for many times.. I have brought it up at Fan Faire and at E3.. soooo who knows.<br />

The number one thing that bugs me about Solaria is the fact that spell gem hotkey colors are a little difficult to differentiate.  For example, using the default UI, targeted AE spells have a green gem, point blank AE spells have a blue gem, single target spells have a red gem, self-only have yellow...etc.      Sometimes spells of different types may share the same icon, so the color coding is important (to me, at least).  I honestly didn't realize how much I relied on the color coding until Solaria made it hard to use :D   If this doesn't make sense I can post screenshots to illustrate.<br />

The only other complaint I have is that I wish the stats in the player window used a teensy bit larger font.<br />

did you download 2.0?  With 2.0 they redid the Spell gems over so that the color behind the whole gem and name of spell is now the color of spell type.  Make sure you dont try to use the old spell gems with out names or with names, the new one ONLY has names and you can not use the old ones from beta 1.</div></div><hr />

Sokol and I are still addressing two additional items before we do a full release in all colors..<br />
<br />
1. Hotbuttons with Clickies.. we want to see if we can make this the same width as the rest of our windows.<br />
<br />
2. Pet window, we are working on switching the tabs, so that those with pets will get the pet commands first instead of stats..<br />

once we get those two items finished and tested will should be ready for a full release.<br />

<br />
I know you said no request issues but wanted to point out a weird thing i noticed... Personally i hate the spellbook in solaria but that just me... so i added Tkings spellbook for my class... Undead animated.... And it works great with one small issue it shoes black outlines on the spell icons in the spellbook instead of the color of the spell that shows if i use it in say Drakah UI instead.<br />
<br />
Small issue and shouldnt make me stop using it.   <br />
<br />
IM really excited about the pet changes.  Can you also look into making the Attack button doubly big for the pet users... Just twice as high... or twice as high and wide would be great.  just a suggestion.</div></div><hr />

Correction:  all i really care about is making the buff window icons bigger for 1280x1024.  They're too hard to see/read as it is now.  <br />
<br />
the buff window is set at 155pix and it is set to show the entire name of any buff you have on you.. The Icon's are errealivant, especially with the whole name showing.<br />
<br />
I have no trouble reading what buff I have on me, or what buff I am losing and i play at 1280x1024.<br />
<br />
I do not forsee any changed to the buff window, as this UI is now you can play at 1280x1024 and have a 996x772 viewport set and everthing fits on the left and right side. <br />
<br />
I have gotten many feedbacks about the buff window and even people at 1600x800 love the buff window. <br />
<br />
It might depend on the monitor size. as one person posted they were on a 17&quot; monitor and playing at 1280x1024. of course its going to be tiny.. on at 17&quot; monitor i would not go above 1152x860 because its all going to be tiny..<br />
<br />
here is the part people forget..<br />
<br />
the only thing that doesnt change size with your resolution is the UI, sooo if the UI looks toooo small, then change your resolution down one click.. your getting the same amount of game screen (ie what you see in game) the only difference is the UI is alittle bigger.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. I am evaluating the Spellbook feedback, that has not been as positive as I had hoped, it may get a revamp, but not sure yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At these settings, I have to squint to read the words on the buff window using 1280x1024 resolution.  I'm not willling to try another viewport setting because it's set exactly that way to fit my personal preference of how I position my windows.<br />
<br />
I guess my only option then is to try a lower res and if that doesn't work, stop using the UI alltogether.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have tried to keep make solaria not only lag free but truly modular, being able to use any of the existing vert spell gem windows is one, and the spell book the other, I'm glad so far theres no problems there except the Tking book version stated above which I'll look into.<br />
<br />
The existing chat cast mod will work 100% error free.<br />
<br />
Please understand there are MANY more things I'd like to do, especialy making things more modular/path proof, but I am taking each and every step slowly as the main goal is to combine this with a lower lag UI.<br />
<br />
I'm very pleased with the feed back thus far, and it has been very constructive and informative.<br />
<br />
As for the buff's I'll talk it over with Kudane, see next post for more info.<br />

I will after solaria is released make a Buff window mod, Kudane is refering to the Default Buff window, which most people like and it is deserving of it's status as the default buff window for Solaria, but don't Fret I'm here and will work somthing out after Solaria is up an running.<br />

hmmmmm <br />
<br />
1280x1024 on a 21 inch monitor should be big enough to read..<br />

try rotating down to 1152 (the next size down) and see if you dont get view you want..</div></div><hr />

Sokol and I are still addressing two additional items before we do a full release in all colors..<br />
<br />
1. Hotbuttons with Clickies.. we want to see if we can make this the same width as the rest of our windows.  <br />
<br />
I wanted this sometime back so I did it.  Basically I made the inventory items smaller.  No idea about a performance impact but I've been using it for 6 months with no issues.  Attached is what it looks like next to the buff window.<br />

FYI it is in the current zip.  I just delete spells01.tga - spells06.tga to remove it as I like the default icons as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Might I also make 2 suggestions for the final release? <br />
<br />
1.	Make the compass the same width as the other windows.<br />
2.	Make the casting Window the same size as the HP or Mana bar for example.  I liked a mod you did putting the Casting bar under the Target bar.  Now I'm not requesting a mod at this time, just to follow some of the principles you stated for Solaria. Personally I keep my casting window next to the HP bar of my Target.  You gota know if that CH is taking to long without allot of Eye movement ya know!</div></div><hr />

The one thing thats difficult for me is that the &quot;select&quot; areas in the player window and group windows are too small to hit quickly.<br />
<br />
It would be better, for me at least, if the entire area in the player window would select myself, and the entire group window was allocated to select one player or another rather than just the health bars.<br />

Since I raid 100% I spend a lot of time trying to quickly move from the hot buttons (assist heal), the mob (to find who has aggro), and players in my group for quick heals.<br />

Large select areas are a big help for this, the large cast gem bar is great for this.</div></div><hr />

The compass window is actualy a VERY old compass window designed for Vert by kudane, which we never released, soa lthough it looks new, it's still un moded for solaria, and we will get to it, but thanks for the reminder!<br />
<br />
I agree I my self have a set up to allow my eyes to stay focused in a very tight area, and allow my mouse tor emain in an even tighter area, so I will be making many mods along these lines when Soalria releases, officialy.<br />

Yes thats apart of XML code, and the EQ client so you will always be able to change the fill colors.<br />

This was addressed before, you will absolutly not be able to change the color, of the background, as it's actualy transparent.<br />
What you see is an image, and you can't tint those. Sorry for the inconvenience, but that is the way it has to be to get the look we want on some of these windows, IE Spell casting window.<br />

the mouse is called from window_pieces01 .tga if you copy it over your other window pieces, it should work. I think I belive the dimensions need chanegd just a little aswell, but it's easy to do.<br />
<br />
Copying it over will give you a couple pieces with the blue color however.<br />

the small blank square will have something filled in, we just havent decided exactly what. (maybe a solaria logo)<br />
<br />
*this is the default Hot-Button that would come with Solaria, other &quot;modded&quot; versions of the hotbutton window after release.. soo those that want a different one will see other versions.</div></div><hr />

I love the look and feel of it all and I can't see how I can ever again use some other one with large kludgy buttons.  You guys are Great!  Please keep up the good work, and I'll spread the word of your wonders.<br />

that being said (you know this was coming right?) I've looked around and I can't quite seem to fix this...the compass in my sol UI is essentially unreadable.  the letters are small and greyish, and even with my glasses on the difference between a W and an N is unclear unless I stare at it to the point of eyestrain.  I've gone out and tried to grab another one of those ugly but easy to read compasses (larger, ugly light backgroup, clear dark letters) but when I drop them in it seems like it gets ignored and I still just get the SOL compass.  HELP!  Is there a clearer sol compass out there.  Here is an example of what I see as clearer and easier to read (though perhaps not as nice looking)<br />

Maybe I'm just doing it wrong (likely) but any help either finding a new compass or in helping get the one I have to read clearer would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
