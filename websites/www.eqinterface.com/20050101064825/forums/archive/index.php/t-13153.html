<br />
Now the good news is all of that is correct.  The UI loads and works just fine.  <br />
<br />
My pet window has been gutted and turned into a player  info window.  I do intend to add a tinting button to my inventory window, but its not in yet.  I'm not going to bother with face pick.  No idea on the group window errors, as far as I can tell all of those elements DO exist in my group window.<br />
<br />
So is there anyway to get EQ to just ignore the errors?  They aren't really errors, just elements of my UI that have been customized.<br />

Place them way off the edge of your winodw so they can't be seen, say 1000 or more pixels, and EQ will find them there when checking the XML files. That stops the errors from being reported and still lets you have the window the way you want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ezrick</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bleh, SOE needs to include a command:<br />
<br />
&lt;IsCustomUI&gt;<br />
<br />
Then just don't error out if it parses that.  Frankly I'm not going to include 50 off screen elements in my UI.  Its just .... dunno, just not elegant.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the answer though :)<br />
