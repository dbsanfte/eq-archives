<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had recently had to reformat my computer, of course meaning all my games were deleted. Today I got the urge to play Diablo 2..one of my favorite game, only to find out that they patched it...<br />
      To me, they practically turned the game into EQ. Now don't get me wrong, I like EQ a lot. But if I want to play EQ, I play it, if I want to play Diablo 2 I expect Diablo 2, not EQ. Here are just a few things that tick me off about the patch:<br />
1)Monsters are now approx. 10x harder, every regular monster fights like a unique. Normally that wouldn't bug me but read number 2.<br />
2)They are so hard, that NOONE can really solo(not even at the newbie stages) unless they are a Barb or Paly that is leveled up exactly how the guides say..That means the other classes are stuck grouping all the time.<br />
3)The rare-unique mobs now rarely drop a rar/unique/magic item..whats the point in fighting them anymore?I at least expect a single junky magic item for the trouble i went through to kill them.<br />
4)the amount of expirience has been lowered. So now it takes longer to level.<br />
5)The new ladder system. Ok, thats a good idea which deserves this patch, but it should only be done when playing ladders. Not the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
The new patch has completely ruined the gaming concept for me(especially Bnet). I no longer want to play D2 anymore because people are forced into parameters that they must follow, or else their S.O.L.<br />
Am I the only one that thinks this is bad? If I am I'll just bite the bullet and switch back to Diablo 1, which remains the way it has always been, and will probably seem a lot more fun that D2 right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winamyen</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also used to play D2 alot but since the last patch, I have noticed that even higher level HELL characters (92 Amazon) no matter what the difficulty setting, can be killed faster solo than a newb on the game at normal level. It really is annoying to get to a point where you can finally go out and magic-find or gold-farm only to find out you cannot because you die every time you are attacked. For example, the cow level used to be fun and profitable. Now, it is a major waste of time. You die, you have to leave the game instantly or take the risk of &quot;popping&quot; and losing everything on your toon. I had 4 accounts, some with uber gear and high cash reserves. Since then, I do not play it anymore but have switched to full-time EQ play. I had EQ when it first came out several years ago and the subscription rate was $8.95 a month or $48.00 for 6 months. I played 6 months and gave it up because it was so new it was hard to find anyone who wanted to join you. There were no expansions yet. I really like the way EQ plays, the community spirit and the experience gains they have changed it to. As an EX- D2 player, all I can say is, Thanks Sony. Battlenet and Blizzard suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried D2 after the patch and found it a relief that they did something worthwhile to the game, however its hacked all over again.  The reason i play everquest is because i left diabloii for secure servers.  I was happy with dii (after the new patch) for about 3 weeks, just long enough for the servers to become over run with hacks yet again.</div></div><hr />

With the latest 1.10 patch I actually found myself saying &quot;self, this is a little easier than after the last round of patches.&quot;<br />
<br />
It had gotten to where you had to moth the bosses to continue, now you can gear up and fight them with tactics again.<br />
<br />
I only play LAN games and with people I know.  That's been how I played since the beginning and its enhanced my enjoyment of the game because of it.</div></div><hr />
