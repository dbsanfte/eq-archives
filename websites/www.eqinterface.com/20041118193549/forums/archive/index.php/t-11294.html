Does anyone know how, or have an example of one that uses animations (not just the scrolling, but actual frames).<br />

Thanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">* Texture : The prefix of the texture to use. &quot;.tga&quot; is appended before opening. If FrameCount is above zero, it will format the filenames as &quot;Texture%d.tga&quot; to allow you to load any number of frames of animation to use for the indicator. Please note that this is a fairly memory intensive way to animate a texture so limiting the number of frames is a good idea. Performance may vary dramatically for various cards.<br />
<br />
* FrameCount : How many frames of texture to try to load.  <br />
<br />
That help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tephrox</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I read that and I was confused as to what the Texture%d.tga meant. Do I have to create things like Texture01.tga, Texture02.tga, etc? Or will it create the frame animation files I need on its own somehow? Or does it work like other EQ animations (like the class symbol thing in the inventory) where it splits the texture up into like 8 pieces and animates that?<br />
<br />
That's what's confusing me, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">markrebec</div><div class="date">11-30-2003, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i could be wrong, as i have not done anything with the target animations yet, but.... <br />
<br />
from reading the paragraph quoted above, I would assume that it works like this... lets use an example:<br />
<br />
i want to create a target circle<br />
i want my target circle to be animated<br />
<br />
use an image editor to create an animation file.<br />
<br />
make sure its a .tga<br />
<br />
when your creating this file, make it just like you would a normal animation (with frames)<br />
<br />
also note: apparently this is very memory intensive.. therfore logic dictates: fewer frames = better performance<br />
<br />
so i create a .tga animation with 5 frames in it named myAnimation.tga<br />
<br />
when the game (or whatever) loads this myAnimation.tga it checks to see if it has multiple frames (ie it is an animation)... IF there are multiple frames, it automatically creates the files it needs, entitled myAnimation00.tga, myAnimation01.tga, myAnimation02.tga, myAnimation03.tga, and myAnimation04.tga (or whatever their naming convention is)<br />
<br />
atleast I THINK thats how it works  :-P hope that helps</div></div><hr />
