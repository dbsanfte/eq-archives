This way you could actually have more than one stretching element if you want to stretch more than one direction.</div></div><hr />

I think it would be ALOT better, and would make skins that are made for larger resolutions more able to work with the smaller resolutions as well. Some windows could be a fixed size, while others are sized based upon a percentage area. Locations would be alot easier to deal with as well. Plus, us losers that skin with smaller resolution (hey, I'm a broke student... can't afford a good pute yet) wouldn't have to worry as much about someone with a higher res not liking our skin JUST BECAUSE OF THAT REASON! Oh well... maybe someday...</div></div><hr />
