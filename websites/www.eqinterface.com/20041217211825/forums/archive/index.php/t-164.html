<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathara</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to request a small change to the Player window I found on eqinterface called Compact Player Window.  I like the way it is set up now... but I would really like to see a few other things included.<br />
<br />
The way I would like to see it set up is<br />
<br />
HP bar #current HP<br />
Mana bar %current mana<br />
STA bar %current sta<br />
Pet bar<br />
Casting bar<br />
Air bar(would be great if possible)<br />
<br />
Name, xp, aa xp or anything else is not important and I would rather it not be included since my main char is in 59 hell and it hacks me off to watch it creep seemingly going no where... <br />
<br />
Thanks so much in advance for any help someone can give me... I wish I could figure it all out myself but I tried to just make some simple modifications and confused myself so badly I gave up.  Since I have so many char's I play I am really looking for somthing that I can use with all of them... and most of the ones that include most of what I want have xp on them and that would drive me batty... as I said Thanks again for any help )</div></div><hr />
