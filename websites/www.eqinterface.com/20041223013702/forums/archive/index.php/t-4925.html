<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suric1</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically when I download a set of Spell icons, there are 7 targa files.<br />
<br />
5 of them are for the big spellbook icons, and 2 are for mini icons.<br />
<br />
I can make the icons np in Lightwave and Photoshop, however what im looking for is a template tell me in what order i have to make the icons in for each targa set.<br />
<br />
Unless there is a way to extract the original EQ Icon set, and then just modify it?<br />
<br />
Any help in making new Spell Icon sets would be extremely helpful, cause i wanna get started on that asap =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well those 7 files are in the default folder too.. as the orginal icons..<br />
<br />
I too want to work on a custom set of spell icons, but so far no one has made a &quot;key chart&quot; to what each one is used for, mainly because most are used for more than one.<br />
<br />
I will talk to someone at SOE and see if there *is* a Spell Key Chart.. hopefully one will turn up..</div></div><hr />

Look up any spell and then look at the &quot;RAW DATA&quot;<br />
<br />
For instance here is the link for Spirit of Wolf (http://lucy.fnord.net/spellraw.html?id=278&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
You'll see a bunch of attributes - for this you are interested &quot;BookIcon&quot; and &quot;GemIcon&quot;.<br />
<br />
Finally, you can right click the icon of the spell being displayed at the top and that will show how Lucy mapped it.  <br />
<br />
Someone enterprising could whip up a quick catalog for easier reference to how they are organized in the UI file.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">12-28-2002, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not quite complete but heres a good start.<br />

I still dont understand how ALL the icons work or where they are used.  My main experience has been a chanter.  Anyway, if you're looking to create a new set of graphics, this catalog should help.  <br />
Fortunately, SOE took pity on us and made the SPELLS_EN.TXT available as an ASCII text file.  <br />
<br />
My recommendation is to import SPELLS_EN.TXT into a spreadsheet.  Column 2 has the Spell names and column 132 has the SPELL ICON value being referred to in the attached JPG image.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;just remembered that the _EN means &quot;english&quot; so if you are using EQ with a different language, then the it may have a different suffix&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />

That map is a big help.  Imported the spells_en.txt into excel and I can see exactly how the icons are picked out of the tga files now.  Deleting all the columns 3-131 made it real easy to pick'em out of the map.<br />
<br />
Now, does anyone know which column shows the mapping of the gem icons and/or have a map for the 2 gem icon tga files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL - sorry I should have posted that info as well.  <br />
<br />
Book Icon = Column 45<br />
Gem Icon = Column 46<br />
Casting Animation = 108<br />
Spell Icon = Column 132<br />
Spell Animation = Column 133<br />
<br />
Like I said, I've still not satisfied myself with how these are valued.  But attached is a chart you can play with.<br />
<br />
side note - I've already noticed one error by Verant using my first icon catalog - the Spell icon for TELESCOPE is incorrect.  This effect is shown when using a tinkered Spyglass- it should be 106 instead of 161.</div></div><hr />
