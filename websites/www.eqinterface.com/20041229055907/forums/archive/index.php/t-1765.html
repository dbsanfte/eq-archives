From Today's Patch:<br />
Please note: there are a lot of changes going into the game with today's patch.  Some of these changes (such as the changes to resistances and spell stacking) will change aspects of the game that may make gameplay different.  Keep this in mind when you log in.  With system-wide changes like these it is entirely possible that there are still bugs.  Please report these bugs using /bug, and know that we will work to fix them as fast as we can.  But also note that some intended changes might appear as bugs (perhaps a spell no longer stacks with another spell).  Feel free to report these as bugs if you are unsure.  But please keep in mind the changes listed here as well.<br />
