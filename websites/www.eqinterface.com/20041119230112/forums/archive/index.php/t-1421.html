<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sparr</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not possible.  the way the compass is rotated is hardcoded.  same reason we cant have non-linear gauges.</div></div><hr />

In that animations move from 1 still frame to another.  Is it possible to Map the linear graphic is such a way to 'animate' a series of still frames?:eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
To make a compass? No.  The graphic is moved left/right and wrapped at the ends  It's not an animation in the sense you're thinking.</div></div><hr />

If you could somehow make it move 40 pixels per step instead of one, you could indeed make an animation, with each frame 40 pixels wide.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mentl</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think if you get the sizing of the window right, and if you have the overlay face just have a narrow ring that the scroll shows through, and the scroll just have marks, one starting at the vertical half point and going up(north), and one at the vertical half going down(south).  then you sort of would have the effect of a needled compass.  As you face south, you see the mark on the scroll showing at the bottom of the ring, as you face east/west the mark moves around the ring, at directly east/west the marks on the scroll swap, and as you turn north, the mark on the ring moves north.  Kind of ghetto, and you may end up having an ungodly big compass, but, it's a circular compass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GrottelTemp</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was a well discussed topic to which I was made quite a few posts.  It *seems* as though some posts may have been lost during the site reorganization (spent an hour searching and cant' find em).  But fear not - my files are safely saved on my other work computer which I'll be back to on Monday.<br />
<br />
While you can't make a perfect/true circular compass, it is possible to simulate one without too much headache (custom graphics aside).<br />
<br />
The Compass gauge is made up of a single horizontal image like:<br />
-N---E---S---W--<br />
<br />
Conceptually, we need an larger image like the one below.<br />
-N---E---S---W--<br />
-N---E---S---W--<br />
-S---W---N---E--<br />
<br />
There are two approaches after this point: 1) use the single large image as one image for the guage or 2) use each image for a seperate guage that is lined up the in the same manner.<br />
Now since, this whole thing is fairly unsightly, you need to create a graphic that will lay over the top of it and have some transparent areas to see the guage images underneath.<br />
-------O-------<br />
--O--------O---<br />
-------O-------<br />
The O's above would be the transparent area to see the images.<br />
<br />
That's general concept anyway.  I&quot;ll post files on Monday.</div></div><hr />
