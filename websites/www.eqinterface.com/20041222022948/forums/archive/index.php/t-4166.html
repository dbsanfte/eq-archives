<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">birdboydowns</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am just about to start working on skinning, and came here for info.  In order to &quot;give back&quot; I am gonna try to explain what Alphas &amp; Masks are.  (I work in TV graphics, so I have explained this one countless times):<br />
<br />
&lt;This is gonna be real Tech-geekish, but bare with me, it has a point&gt; An image is saved using three different integers: Red, Green Blue.  For simplicities sake, I am just gonna work with 16 bit color, so any color you use will actually have 3 values from 0-255(one for each of these three). <br />
<br />
For example:<br />
Red is R 255, G 0, B 0<br />
Black is R 0, G 0, B 0<br />
<br />
Now, if you have Photoshop, open an image and goto the &quot;Channels&quot; Tab (next to Layers).  You will see that there are seperate channels for R, G, and B.  Now, click on R (Red). Yyou will see a black&amp;white image.  This represents the Red value ONLY.  Black equals a value of 0, and white equals a value of 255, and the various shades of gray are every thing inbetween.  Nifty, eh?<br />
<br />
Now, this is all fine and dandy, but what about if you want transperancy?<br />
<br />
Well, that is what an alpha channel is.<br />
<br />
<br />
An alpha channel is EXACTLY like the red, green and blue channel.  black equals completely transparent, white equals completely visible, and the various shades of gray are every thing inbetween.<br />
<br />
So, if you want a certain part to be 50% transparency, you should fill it with Pure Grey=127     (256 x 50% = 127)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, just play around with it... it is a weird concept, but once you get it, it is VERY simple.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Well, I hope this makes sense... if it doesnt, sorry but Alpha channels are weird to most people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunetly, this type of transparency (actually should be called translucent cause it's partly visible, partly non visible) isn't supported, which sucks. The images that eq accepts need a single defined Alpha channel for transparency, and only supports ON or OFF levels. You can't have part of the image completely visible, another completely invisible, and another 50% visible.</div></div><hr />

 Honestly, I've been guessing about what the Alpha channel is, but now I know. And Knowing is half the battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilcure</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beg to differ :)  but the cursor I made has 3 different transparency levels and they all work.  Outer part opaque, inner part about 75% visible and a center line totally visible.<br />
<br />
Seems to work fine for me.</div></div><hr />
