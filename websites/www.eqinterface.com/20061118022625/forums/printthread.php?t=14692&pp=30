v1.7.1<br />
  * Integrated the Quartz Blue background pack by Tadayasha.<br />
  * Integrated an all new DS Blue background pack by DarkSir23.<br />
  * Rewrote a lot of the instructions.<br />
<br />

  * Minor tweaks to make the UI compliant with the current requirements (Got rid of the &quot;Your XML files are incompatible&quot; error every time you zone).<br />
<br />
v1.6<br />
  * After the Jan 9 2003 patch the selectorwindow and pet window had to be tweaked slightly to comply with something verant changed (this was causing the 'your everquest files to not match' garbage to  come up every time you zoned.<br />
  * Made changing mods easier, and removed the config.bat that doesn't work on XP.<br />
  * Added in a Quartz mp3 player mod :) looks nice!<br />

  * Gave the Short Duration (songs) buff box a texture.<br />
<br />
v1.5<br />
  * Fixed the Stablity (Likelyness for verant patches to NOT break UI) by a large amount by reconfiguring how Quartz gets its graphics/templates, the only way it should break is if verant adds in a new 'required' window like RaidWindow.xml, which is a quick fix.<br />
  * Quartz should now easily work with other mods (such as the spellbook graphics mod :)<br />
  * Fixed the Non-Caster spell casting bar thing that made me thing those emails were from crazy people.<br />
  * Improved the GUI memory useage: This should cause Quartz to lag alot less on those systems with poor videocards that don't adapt to alphatransparency all that well<br />
<br />
For more information on how these changes will affect other mod's and/or how Quartz gets its attributes (all UI makers should follow this design) please goto <a href="http://skins.machin-shin.net" target="_blank">http://skins.machin-shin.net</a><br />

  * The actions window is Moveable but has a light border around it (i had this removed at one point, i don't know why its back)<br />

			<div><strong>About the coming soon stuff:</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>Ok, last post I said there were a few things that are &quot;Coming Soon&quot;.  I would have just implemented them in 1.7, but I wanted a bit of input first...<br />
<br />
1.  Quartz Inventory Window.  I'm going to try to come up with a matching inventory window for Quartz.  I'm open to suggestions on how it should look...<br />
<br />
2.  Combat Skill Window.  I'm thinking that the combat abilities window could be set up in two possible places.  In the lower left corner (Replacing the spellgems), or in the upper right corner (Replacing the Pet Window).  Given that people may have different tastes, I'm going to make both, and let you choose which one you want.  By default, it will replace the spellgems, but you will be able to switch out that one for a smaller one that takes the pet window.<br />
<br />
3.  Pet Window.  Statix's last update on his site included a new pet window, with the pet-buff window relocated to a second and third tab on the player buff window.  However, this has proven to not work completely (Icons and buff color won't carry over).  So my thought is to make the pet window extend down where the Actions menu is now, giving pet buffs a place to show up.  ALTERNATIVELY:  I've also toyed with making a separate pet window that isn't part of the dashbar.  I'd like to know what you all think...<br />
<br />
4.  UI Installer.  I plan to make an installer that will copy the UI's default window locations over to your individual UIs.  Originally I was going to make this very generic, so others could use it with their UIs, but I think the initial installer will also let you choose which UI options you want (Letting you choose which type of combat abil window you want, which buff window you want, which MP3 player, etc).  Again, I'm open to thoughts on the matter.</div>

		<div>For the inventory, what I see in my brain is this:<br />
<br />
A window that sits in the buttom right of the screen just above the dashboard. It would NOT have any of the stats in them or the AA/EXP bars, seeing as we already have them. It would have the money along the bottom and the actual inventory kind of waving (like the guages on the player window) above that. Would also be nice if the buttons (skills, dye, destroy, etc) were all iconified. Like small icons out of the way.. Again wavy like the player window along the edge of the window. Not muli colored perty icons.. just.. hmm.. how do i say it.. Like the icons you see on the menu in a macintosh computer running OS X. The whole window wouldnt be square. It would be square in the bottom right and then wave in and blend to the rest of the dashboard. <br />
<br />
I hope I made what i think clear. Not very good at describing things.<br />
Again.. Thanks for keeping this up to date for us. I love this UI<br />
<br />
For the pet window.<br />
<br />
Im not sure if this is even possible but ill say it.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to add a whole new window to the EQUI? Like add a buff window like the ones that already exist but for pet buffs? maybe put it off in the left? If not, I personally would like it better if an extension to the pet winder were above the dashboard for buffs. I use the actions window a lot and dont want to lose it or have to go digging for it.</div>

Whether or not you can create a new window is irrelevant because the pet buffs MUST go into the pet window.  It could be a tab page withing the pet window, but must ultimately be in the pet window.  <br />
<br />
However, there is a way to kind of cheat and achieve almost the same thing.  Most screen elements have a &lt;RelativePosition&gt; setting, and for most elements this is set to true.  What this does is make any location settings for the element relative to that element's parent window.  For example, if a pet buff icon is defined with a relative position of true, and location of 20,20, then the icon will appear 20 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down from the upper left corner of the PetWindow.  But, if &lt;RelativePosition&gt; is set to false, the any location settings for that element are relative to the entire visble area of the screen.  So, in the above example, with relative position being false, the buff icon would appear near the upper left corner of the screen, regardless of where the parent PetWindow is.<br />
<br />
So, if you do this, it is possible to have the pet buff icons appear in a neat row or column anywhere on the screen you want.</div>

		<div>Interesting thought.. I don't like making anything that people can't move, though...  It would be difficult to align something like that to the right side of the screen, without limiting the resolution that the UI is released under.  One thought has been to make the pet window separate from the dashboard, perhaps making the whole thing look like one of the buff windows, with small controls at the bottom.  <br />
<br />
If I do that, then the pet window area is available for a combat abilities window, or maybe target of target, or a compass... I dunno, there are a lot of possibilities.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of making the inventory screen be similar to the hotkeys window, and have it superimpose over the hotkeys, similar to the way Night Elf does with some of its windows.<br />
<br />
Always open to suggestions,<br />

<br />
My version is attached if you want to just grab it!<br />
<br />
For combat abilities, I replaced my pet window with Tevin's warrior minimalist combat ability window (<a href="http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3114" target="_blank">http://www.eqinterface.com/download...nfo.php?id=3114</a>). Something along those lines but that &quot;fit&quot; better in Quartz would be awesome.<br />

		<div>Ok, I've designed an inventory window that can superimpose over the hotbuttons.  It only includes the main body inventory, money, bags 2,3, 4, 7 and 8, the Autoequip area, and the 6 Inventory screen buttons (Face, Dye, AA, Skills, Destroy, and Done)<br />
<br />
The only problem I have with it is: While the rest of Quartz is usually 40% transparent, it is not.  If it is, the hotbuttons shine through from behind.  So it doen't match perfectly, but it does pop up in an inconspicuous spot.  Since space is limited, the boxes are rather small (The same size as the inventory boxes below it)<br />
<br />
This will be a possible Mod for Quartz, and not part of the default, unless I get a lot of positive feedback about it.  Next step are the two Combat Abilities Windows.</div>

This is just a normal inventory window that's the same size and shape as the hotkeys button.  When you hit the inventory hotkey, it opens up right on top of them.  Like I said, it's optional, and will be in the next release, but not as a default.</div>

		<div>What is the status on making a target of target window for the UI?<br />
Same goes for updating the chatwindows so they can more squarely fit into the UI theme and removing the &quot;type here&quot; part for the top 2 windows or shrinking it to just a thick line so you can right click it to set up filters and such... thus giving more viewable text area...<br />
<br />
Is a version of the &quot;player window&quot; in the works that leaves out mana for the pure melee? <br />
<br />
Food for thought, you are working on the combat abilities window.. could make it 2 button wide and have it vertical... So it could slide down in and replace the pet window spot for us pure melee?.. having the timer bar on top...</div>

Combat Abilities:  I'm making two different combat abilities windows.  One that can sit in the bottom left corner, where the spell gems goes, and one that sits in the upper right corner of the dashboard, where the pet window goes.  Both will be available for the next release.<br />
<br />
Chat windows:  I've not given it much thought, but I certainly will.  I'm not sure the input fields can be removed or shrunk, but if they can, I'm all over it.</div>

<br />
as for the chat window &quot;input boxes&quot; as it is now, i take my middle chat window and extend the top of it up over the other 2 chat window's input boxes... <br />
<br />
I been using stratix's quartz since UI's were available and his came out... I've yet to find a better one with the form and function of this one... So glad to see someone taking it over and working on it... Thanks alot!</div>

You're right, they would work well, and I recommend them for anyone that likes to organize their containers.<br />

I may work on a small container option, as well, but I'd like to start from scratch.  Kinda enjoying the crash-course in EQUI XML I'm giving myself. :)</div>

Another idea for the interface... a tribute window... quitepossibly use the very same idea as you use for the inventory...<br />
<br />
Or.. a trimmed down version that just shows time left, current favor, and Activate button,  that could replace the pet window or overlap it when turned on...<br />
<br />
More food for thought:  I see most put thier spell buff stuff on the upper part of thier screen, but i like to nestle it down next to the dashboard... perhaps a mod that has a the &quot;arch&quot; part of the windo on the top.. kinna flip flopped for versatility...<br />
<br />
And i'm sure you already know this, but the &quot;short duration buff with names&quot; has extra stuff on it that needs to be trimmed.. <br />
<br />
I'm still blown away by the new inventory and how flawlessly it switches back and forth.. pure genius...<br />
<br />
<br />
Stuff for future: rumored that with AA's you can get 5 additional buff slots and 2 more spell gems... might be something you want to start thinking about for OOW... <br />
<br />
<br />
And for those that dont know or explored this, it's very easy to cusomize yer color for this mod, simply by right clicking and window &gt; background &gt; tint color... you can change the grey to whatever color you desire...  I'm currently using a dark purple of 10 red, 0 green, 25 blue... <br />
<br />
You rock man, keep it going</div>
