<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weiden</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whenever I play my Shadowknight lately, my client crashes whenever I zone.  I use the same UI on all my characters, and I can play my Ranger and Monk just fine!!!  I don't know what the deal is, but it's super frustrating.  I'm not using any particular UI, it's bits and pieces, but almost all of them are TKing/Remelio.  I think the other thing is the TKing/Drakah chat windows.  omg, any help would be appreciated before I take an axe to my computer. =D  Here's what my UIError file says:<br />

Would this cause my client to crash?  I followed the directions for adding stuff that I found in another post, but it doesn't seem to have worked =(  Again, any help would be awesome.  Oh yeah, I'm using Windows XP, if that means anything.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weiden</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't remember if I mentioned it in my last post, but this had happened before about 2 weeks ago.  I finally had to just uninstall, and reinstall EQ, and that fixed it for a while, but now it's back to the same thing.  I set it to the default UI, and it STILL crashes whenever I zone.  Checked the UI error when it was on default, and nothing was there.  I'm getting really frustrated with it, hehe.  I don't understand why it's ONLY on this character.  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it doesn't happen on all of them =)  I just don't understand what it is about the Shadowknight that makes the client crash.<br />

There is a thread about it here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11644).<br />

You really do want to get your target and player windows up-to-date, however, as sooner or later those errors will cause you to crash/load default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenney</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup thats for sure get them fix as soon as you can .. later on you will have trouble...<br />
<br />
And yes that can couse your client crashes..</div></div><hr />

And, um, please excuse a stupid question, but how do I update my player and target windows?  Do I just have to download new ones?  Or add some text to the files?  Thanks again =)<br />
