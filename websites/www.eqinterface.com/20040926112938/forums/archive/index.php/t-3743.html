<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aviendha101</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, well I tested out Gimp last week.  It seemed like a really great program-- especially for a freebie!<br />
<br />
But I ran into a HUGE problem.<br />
<br />
It completely CRASHED my Windows 2000 machine.  To the point where I had to reinstall.  I uninstalled Gimp once I started having problems (it had to have been related to Gimp, because right after I installed it none of my other Graphics programs would work on that machine).  At first I suspected a virus, but McAfee and Norton both said &quot;No way!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sooo... I reinstalled Win2k (total format of hard drive) and installed all my software (except Gimp) and of course everything's working great...<br />
<br />
Sooo, the moral here is:  Be careful what you download and install on your computer.  :P  Gimp seemed like a great piece of software, I liked the interface a lot.  But it just didn't seem to like Win2k.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried it on my Windows XP machine, and I won't.  I'm just going to cough up the money and get PSP 7 (my favorite program so far).<br />
<br />
Just my little warning to you all!<br />
<br />
NOTE:  The version of Gimp available for download is a BETA (says so on the website).  This article is by NO MEANS a means of slighting their software.  Like I said, it looked great and performed well.  But for Win2k users at least, you may want to wait til the full version comes out instead of trying the beta.</div></div><hr />

However are you sure its Gimp related? I have been using Gimp in Win2K (not to mention Linux and 98 for quite a while and have never had any problems real major problems... In fact my 2K install seems to be the most stable of the 3 OSes when running it. Sure it crashes some, but much less than explorer. Then again it might have been conflicting with something else you had installed or else you could have gotten a really unstable release.</div></div><hr />

oh yeah GIMP was made to run on a unix platform. Dont try and use freebies unless u try it on the correct platform. GIMP on Mandrake 9 rocks</div></div><hr />

It clearly says GIMP beta on the download page, with a link shortly below to the stable (yet old) build.<br />
