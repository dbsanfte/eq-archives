[Wed Mar 19 19:02:43 2003] Error loading skin: loading default skin instead.<br />

From what I was reading in another post:<br />

[Wed Mar 19 19:02:43 2003] [Line:6 Source:UIFiles\Default\EQUI_InspectWnd.xml] Couldn't find class:item 'A_InvCharm' reference in FieldParseItemOfClass()<br />
<br />
That is the problem but what do I have to do to get it to work?  Buy LOY?  choose an older UI?  Go in there and tinker somehow?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the guidance.</div></div><hr />

You need to make the changes to your custom EQUI_Animations.xml file as outlined in the 24 Feb patch message in the Patch Fixes forum.<br />
<br />
It isn't actually your inspect window (although if you do have a custom one, you should update it as well, same thread), but your Animations file that is causing EQ to gack.  &quot;FieldParseItemOfClass&quot; almost inevitably indicates an outdated Animations file.</div></div><hr />
