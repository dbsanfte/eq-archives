<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blat</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking about writing my own tradeskill window, but then I ran across Kathara's skin.  After using it, I noticed that it had all the information that I was looking for, I just didn't really like the window that the skin was using.  So, I made a few changes so that it would work in the pet window.  I am attaching that file here, if you want to use it.  You will still need Kathara's mod, because it contains all of the image files that have the tradeskill information.<br />

Feel free to post any questions, problems, or complaints with it.</div></div><hr />
