<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Denise</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When the UI change over first went live, I gleefully came here and downloaded lots of nifty mods created by all you XML geniuses out here.  I successfully installed them, and happily used them...<br />
<br />
And then the July 31st patch hit.<br />
<br />
*cries*<br />
<br />
Ever since that STUPID patch, the damn skins dont work the way they are supposed to.  I fell in love with the colors and backgrounds in the druid skins package.  What can I say... I like green.<br />
<br />
Before july 31st everything worked just as it was supposed to.  After the patch, my chat windows have the right background but all the outlines are grey instead of green.  My Windows selector buttons are the right color but the outlines and background are grey... the recessed windows for inventory and items slots in my inventory screen are the right color but the background and outlines are all grey/stone default ****... and none of the other windows (target, group, player, buffs, etc etc) are the right color at ALL.<br />
<br />
Can SOMEONE tell me what the HELL is going on and how to get my pretty green windows back, please?<br />
<br />
And yes, I have tried reloading the damn skins and doing the /loadskin command again and then logging out and back in.  No change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I take it no one knows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's really no way to fix it, but a patch from VI.<br />
<br />
There is two alternatives, nither I really suggest unless you don't plan to edit UIs:<br />
<br />
1) Change the line 'UISkin' in your eqclient.ini to point to your druid skin<br />
<br />
2) Copy over the wnd_bg_light_rock.tga and the window_pieces[01-03].tga into the Default directory.<br />
<br />
Problems with these:<br />
<br />
1) If you're editing files. EQ will not have any 'default' skin to fall  back on in case something goes wrong.<br />
If your druid directory is missing a file, EQ *might* not load, that's unknown.<br />
<br />
2) These files will get patched everytime you start-up EQ.<br />
<br />
That's it .. Only work arounds, imho. Nothing I would suggest leaving as a 'default' setting. Just until VI gets the bugs fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, change the name of all the files that want to load from the default directory. For instance, change window_pieces01.tga to Druid_window_pieces01.tga<br />
<br />
Second, ADD, don't overwrite the texture info to your EQUI_animations.xml It needs the filename and the size. Example:<br />
<br />
                &lt;TextureInfo item = &quot;Druid_window_pieces01.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;256&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;256&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
	&lt;/TextureInfo&gt;	<br />
<br />
Third, go through EQUI_animations.xml and EQUI_templates.xml, and change all mentions of window_pieces01.tga to Druid_window_pieces01.tga EXCEPT for the first part where you tell it the texture info, which I mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Repeat the process for all the files that want to load from the default directory.<br />
<br />
WARNING: You will go insane trying to do this manually. Use a text editor with a search &amp; replace function. If nothing else, use DOS Edit.<br />
<br />
WARNING 2: The XML files are case sensitive. Make SURE you have the exact same capitolization as the actual filename or it won't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizzestra</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">make a copy of your default skin directory but with the name &quot;druid&quot; then copy all of the mods you want into that folder. Open your eqclient.ini file and scroll down a little ways till you find the line that says &quot;UIskin=default&quot; and make it read &quot;UIskin=druid&quot;. Save the file and log back into the game. Once in the game type /loadskin druid true and camp out of the game to your desktop(the true command retains your current window position settings). Then log back into the game ad your new skin will be fully active. Note: there is a bug in the Bazaar with non-default skins. If you are in the Bazaar using a non-default skin and you type /bazaar, you will crash to the desktop. To remedy this remember to type /loadskin default true before you use the /bazaar command. Just type /loadskin druid true when you are done shopping and log out of and back into the game from the desktop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason it crashes is because you're not using the updated files. If you follow my instructions you can use any skin you want, as long as you're adding the texture info to an updated version of the files I mentioned above.</div></div><hr />
