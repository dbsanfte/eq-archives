<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lokorin</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently completed a project aimed at displaying EQDKP’s DKP standings inside EQ through a UI window (currently the feedback window). I figured that maybe this would be a good place to post in case others were interested.<br />
<br />
The projects itself can be found at http://www.lokorin.com/dkplu/<br />
It can be downloaded at http://www.lokorin.com/dkplu/download.php <br />
A readme that explains how it works (with pictures): http://www.lokorin.com/dkplu/readme.php <br />
<br />
It’s a program that (once correctly configured) downloads the EQDKP standings, converts it into an UI file and (optionally) launches EQ while closing itself down. All in all it causes no extra work/clicks (once configured) and always provides an up to date DKP list that can be accessed at any time through one of many different UI windows.<br />

<br />
The program has received some improvements concerning its ability to read modified EQDKP listings. The current version (1.0c) is able to read most sites but not all. If it produces an error then it's probably because it's having trouble reading the EQDKP page. If this happens then you just have to send me a mail with debug info (read the readme for more info) and I will teach the program to read the page properly.<br />
<br />
So if you had an error with a previous version then there's a high chance that v1.0c will have fixed it for you. If not then please send me a mail and I should have it fixed quickly.<br />
<br />
P.S. by sending me a mail I mean using http://www.lokorin.com/contact.php</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lokorin</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Version 1.1 is out. To make a long story short it adds the ability to generate the DKP list in different UI windows and enables the user to manually override the programs search algorithm if needed.<br />
<br />
Anyway a longer list of changes is located at: http://www.lokorin.com/archive/news45<br />
The readme has been updated with the new functions: http://www.lokorin.com/dkplu/readme.php<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pinkfloydx33</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">any way to get it to show current AND total?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lokorin</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is possible in the current version but it includes a bit of extra configuration.<br />
<br />
The simplest way in the current version to get both lists at the same time would be to make two instances of the program (in separate folders). Then set one to list the names and current DKP and the other to list the names and total DKP in the EQDKP reader tool (select the row with total DKP instead of current DKP). Then make the two programs write into two different windows (i.e. bug and feedback) and make the first instance automatically start the second one and close itself. Then set the second instance to start EQ and automatically shut down it self.<br />
<br />
It would all result into something like this:<br />
The first instance starts. --&gt; The first instance writes current DKP list into the feedback window. --&gt; The first instance automatically starts the second instance while shutting the first instance down. --&gt; The second instance writes the total DKP list into the bug window. --&gt; The second instance automatically starts EQ and shuts the second instance down.<br />
<br />
So it would involve an extra bit of configuration but no extra work running it. I will keep it in mind for the next version though so a user can add additional columns to the list.</div></div><hr />
