<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorano</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a few small offerings for the community. First is the new Target Window :<br />
http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Lorano/fullsize/targetwindow.jpg<br />
<br />
Thanks to Vampire the Masquerade for the neato ankh I used for the fill :)<br />
I've included this as targetandcast.zip below under a directory called target. I set the window normal alpha to zero to get it disappear, otherwise you'll see a gray see through version of it on your screen.<br />
<br />
And the cast window I will take down so I don't get sued in the meantime :) I'll be dealing with Amy Brown in a little bit to see if I can post it if people want it but in the meantime Cast window is unavailable until further notice.<br />
<br />
As far as the errors go.....Here's the fix and my apologies. <br />
<br />
I apparently had the targfill defined in EQUI_Animations and not the file. So it's fixed now my apologies<br />

[Wed Oct 30 23:56:49 2002] [Line:150 Source:UIFiles\test\EQUI_TargetWindow.xml] Couldn't find class:item 'targfill' reference in FieldParseItemOfClass()<br />

I haven't tried the casting window yet, but is there anything I can do to fix this for now?</div></div><hr />

I have to agree with Tadashya on the Dragon though.  May want to look into it before Amy Brown does.</div></div><hr />
