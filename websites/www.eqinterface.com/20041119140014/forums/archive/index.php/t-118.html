<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ageous</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know how to set properties of a second chat box, or is there only one set of chat box properties that they will all use?  I would like to make a second chat window and turn off the scroll bar, chat entry window, make it transparent, and turn off the boarder.  That way I could filter to only have melee go there and achieve close to the same effect as having hitsmode command.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows how to use /hitsmode with the new UI, I would love to hear that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morphy</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too have yet to find a substitute with the new interface.  I know i can create a second window with melee only.  The problem is that i want to seperate &quot;others attacks&quot; from &quot;me getting pounded on&quot;.  I'd like to have me getting hit in the main chat window instead of with the other melee spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merieltha</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd very much like a more detailed filter for the different windows too.  I play a 60 ranger, and the battle spam from a max-hasted, double attack, dual wielding class is, um, impressive.<br />
<br />
What I often do is send the melee text to a window and minimize that window, but (unlike the old hitsmode) the new UI sends things like &quot;ENRAGE&quot; messages there too :mad: .  (Enrage means the mob auto-ripostes when it is very low in health, which means monks, rangers, etc. want to turn attack off and / or be behind the mob so we don't get pasted by something that hits for 300+ a pop.)<br />
<br />
Grunt. Mutter mutter mutter.</div></div><hr />

Anyone find a good source to answer the above questionsd?  I can't seem to find anything clear on setting up a hitsmode window.  Need to get rid of battle spam in my chat window. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunakin</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Filtering 'my hits' and 'me getting hit' to two different windows can be done, and I believe enrage and rampage are also filterable, so they can be directed to a different window than hits, I have them going to my spells window.  The hitsmode option on the bottom of the chatwindow right click menu lets you change the damage messages to full message, abbreviated message, and just the damage number.<br />
<br />
The window properties are pretty much set, and they affect all windows. But, you can find some interesting ideas to cheat this in this thread:<br />

Hope that helps<br />

filter the melee hits to one and the other,<br />
filter the disciplines and spells and wahatever to yet another window if u like<br />
<br />
Change the size of messages in the menu options<br />
<br />
Then just set the fade to / normal to 0 percent, the chat text stays on, the chat input box and window frame disappears<br />
<br />
Size your window or move it so the chat input bar disappears out of the screen, and stack your 2nd window on top , since the window frame will be invisible anyway<br />
<br />
then Lock them and rename title to ' ' a space if you like<br />
<br />
Also use ' always chat here' on the main woindow and you're set<br />
<br />
I didnt shorten the dmg message in this old sshot of mine,. I like em like that (ps : dont rub the wrong side of a Halfling Warrior Lass :) )<br />

<br />
ps: also set the colours to red / green, with the misses in a slightly darker and les saturated shade, VERY intuitive I would think</div></div><hr />
