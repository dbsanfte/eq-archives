From the Everquest Live Site:<br />
 <br />
You voted and so it is. Thanks to everyone that voted, we appreciate your participation. I'm impressed and pleased by the number of people that have shown interest in playing on the new server. This should afford an opportunity for folks to resurrect old relationships and forge new ones. Remember as you play on Stromm that you are the community for your new server. Have fun. <br />
<br />
I've been getting a lot of questions about when the server will open. I can't tell you that exactly, but we will be opening it up shortly (or as the old-schoolers here like to say, &quot;soon™&quot;). <br />
<br />
Alan <br />
<br />
Sooo &quot;soon™&quot; we will see the newest Server STROMM go live, remember that it will be a non-transfer server. It is the first of it's kind to my knowledge in that most would allow a /movelog or transfers after 6 months.<br />
<br />
Happy EQ'ing!<br />

Sooo your skipping over the part where SOE said &quot;You voted and so it is&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenney, you didnt vote, and posted before They announced the name that you didnt care, so you didnt vote. <br />
<br />
then they announce the name you post enuendos that you think SOE rigged the whole thing, and they already had the named picked out. <br />
<br />
So, what part of me posting the announcement made you not vote? because that is what your using as an excuse.. BUT as  I said, the post Dolby linked you posted BEFORE the announcement.  And where do you get that they already had the name picked out?<br />
<br />
Also, I can tell you for a fact they they did not have the name picked out, that they were true to their word of letting us vote on it. I was talking to someone at SOE about it on Friday.</div></div><hr />

I honestly think this is awesome.  It was pointless with those new servers that allowed char transfers. The whole point of goin to a brand new server is the fact that everyone is low level, everyone has started out with nothing, like a fresh start.  <br />
I'll probably be making a character on there, though I have so many alts it's not even funny lol.</div></div><hr />

It's already full of KS'ing newbs...and let me tell you...It's strange to see 100+ peeps in WFP or QHills (200+ in Gfay) and only 4 in the nexus. If you are a budding shaman or druid, the PoK is now YOUR money making spot- people are paying for a SoW and for ANY buffs at all.<br />
<br />
It is kinda refreshing and yet, oddly like an EQ Twilight Zone!</div></div><hr />

What server does the real Stromm play on?  What class / race?  Kinda sounds like a dwarf name to me. ;)</div></div><hr />
