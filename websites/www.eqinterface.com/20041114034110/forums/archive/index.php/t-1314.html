Included in this newest updated version is the artwork of T.King. The spell book is greatly modified, to turn the pages simply click on the edge of the pages, you can close the book by clicking in the middle of the book, the scribe and memorize gauges are only seen when used. The Hotkeys are revamped into a vertical arrangement with your eight inventory slots and main and secondary directly below them. The spell casting window contains the casting timer and you only see it when you cast a spell. the buff window is sized to fit excatly fifteen buffs and backlight the spells blue for beneficial and red for harmful. The player bars including group and target include the percentages(not hard to make but i haven't worked on them yet look for better ones in the future). you can download this wonderful new skin at Walen's EQskin (http://guardiansofforever.com/downloads/skins/walen082102v1.0.zip)</div></div><hr />
