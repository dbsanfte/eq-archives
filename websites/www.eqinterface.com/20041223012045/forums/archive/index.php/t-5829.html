 I think I need a Bigger Box! Announced at The Legacy of Ykesha (http://www.legacyofykesha.com):Each day in the world of Norrath, on the moon of Luclin, and in the many Planes, more treasures are discovered. With such an abundance of loot, eight bank slots just doesn't cut it anymore. So, we're giving everyone who purchases EverQuest: The Legacy of Ykesha eight additional bank slots, per character, to store their treasures. That's right, a total of 16 bank slots for your character!<br />
<br />
Just think how much easier it will now be to store those extra trade skill ingredients, build that guild arsenal, or have enough room for 3200 bone chips. (That's 16, 10 slot bags containing stacks of 20 bone chips!)<br />
Developers may want to take note - no word yet on how this will affect UI's, or how subscriber and non-subscriber files will differ.<br />

Due to the HUGE number of patch fixes required lately, I'm *not* going to list specific fixes in the Update - it would take hours just to scroll through! Instead, if you need a fix for your mod or UI, see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5673#patch&quot;&gt;Patch Fixes&lt;/a&gt; area for assistance!<br />
