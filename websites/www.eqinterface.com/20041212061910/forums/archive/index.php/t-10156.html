<br />
Beta Solaria Users Please Note: You must do a fresh install of solaria. We redid a lot of the code and several of the TGAs were merged together. Simply overwriting your Solaria Beta will cause major errors<br />
<br />
You can download the file Here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2464) Please remember to check the Solaria download section for patches that are released<br />
<br />
Note about Colors from Vert:<br />
No. Cannabis,Ocean Spray, Nexium, and Pepto will not be making appearances in Solaria (name or shade of color). Neptune got uses only because the name fit, All the colors were tweaked slightly from the ones in Vert.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Current Version: Solaria Version 1.1 <br />
(Production IE. NON-Beta)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Changed some file names for TGA's that caused lag on soem video cards. If you experienced no lag you do not need to upgrade to 1.1<br />
<br />
==================================================<br />
Color Packs:<br />
==================================================<br />
Untill we add a program to auto install color schemes, you will manualy<br />
have to goto the color packs directory, and choose which one of the 9 color schemes<br />
you want to use.<br />
<br />
DEFAULT = Mercury<br />
To use, just copy the TGA files into your Solaria directory<br />
over writing existing files.<br />
<br />
==================================================<br />
Options Folder:<br />
==================================================<br />
Located in the options folder are the following:<br />
<br />
- Melee Player window (Removes the mana gauge)<br />
To use, just copy the XML files into your Solaria directory<br />
over writing existing files.<br />
<br />
- Caster Player window (Adds the mana gauge) &lt;--DEFAULT<br />
To use, just copy the XML files into your Solaria directory<br />
over writing existing files.<br />
<br />
- Cast Spell Window without the names (Removes spell names <br />
from the default casting window)<br />
To use, just copy the XML files into your Solaria directory<br />
over writing existing files.<br />
<br />
- Cast Spell Window with the names (Adds spell names <br />
to the default casting window) &lt;--DEFAULT<br />
To use, just copy the XML files into your Solaria directory<br />
over writing existing files.<br />
<br />
- Organized BigBank window (Adds catagory labels above bank slots<br />
divided into various sections)<br />
To use, just copy the XML files into your Solaria directory<br />
over writing existing files.<br />
NOTE: To remove this mod after installing, simply delete the<br />
EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml file, and Solaria will load the DEFAULT Bank window.<br />
<br />
==================================================<br />
Ccake Manual:<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
1) Copy the EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml from the Solaria directory to the Ccake directory<br />
(Do this only if your using a Hotbutton mod compatible with the Ccake program)<br />
(The Default Solaria HotButton is already included in the Ccake folder)<br />
<br />
2) Run the ccake.exe choose the changes you want.<br />
<br />
3) Click inject.<br />
<br />
4) Save it to the solaria directory overwriting the hotbutton window there.<br />
(DO NOT I REPEAT NOT over write the one in the Ccake Dir via this method)<br />
<br />
5) Reload Solaria, and enjoy!</div></div><hr />

Clean install means extracting the .zip file into a new directory.  This is what I did (as they requested) and I'm getting the color packs all grey.  <br />
<br />
The DEFAULT color when you unzip it is Mercury (as stated above) you simply open the folder Color Packs/Venus/ and highlight all the files in there... select COPY then go back to the MAIN Solaria folder and select PASTE when it ask you to &quot;overwrite&quot; select YES<br />
<br />
this works for EVERY COLOR <br />
<br />
Just as the instructions in the file say....<br />
<br />
it works... and it is suppose to be in grey to start with.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a dunce and I know how to work with zip files.  I know the default is grey, but i was looking at the .tga files directly and they were grey!  I SWEAR IT!<br />
<br />
I was doing a million different things at the time tho, so I must have been looking in the wrong solaria folder.  I have like about 7 different ones now.  Not because of the colors, but because of the melee vs. caster options and older versions.  I need to clean it out so I don't get confused again.<br />
<br />
Next time I will double check when I'm not raiding/CRing/Scouting and trying to use the latest version. :p</div></div><hr />

be sure your extracting with paths.. otherwise it will not have the Color Packs folder or the Options folder. and that could be bad.</div></div><hr />

Use this, it makes the secondary &quot;floating&quot; gauge invisible. Ie. Size 0.<br />
<br />
It will be an option in future Solaria Releases.<br />

PET health... when you summon a pet.. the bar attaches..<br />

there is a NON-caster version that changes the large mana bar to Stamina in the &quot;options&quot; folder if your a melee type.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solaria looks good so far. The harder-to-accidently-click-off buff windows look good. I'm going to have to hand-edit my .ini file to get the handles back (they are off-screen from my Vert positioning), but no biggie. I'm looking forward to playing with it more. Nice not to have that annoying incompatible-XML message (apparently from TargetWCastv1).<br />
<br />
I think having the pet health in the Player window is nice. I will still probably go ahead with my earlier plans to patch it so I can see my resists in the Player window at all times. Need the Pet pane open so I can click taunt and back while casting, as needed.<br />
<br />
Guild window seems bugged -- not sure what is up with that. People don't show up, sorting messed up; may be an EQ problem?<br />
<br />
<br />
Some suggestions, based on not enough time with the UI:<br />
<br />
I miss TargetWCastv1 -- incorporating the casting bar in with the target bar. I am trying to get the couple patches you have for the &quot;stock&quot; casting bar to load so I can get the same effect with Solaria. (TargetWCastv1 is not currently-compatible XML.)<br />
<br />
I'm not a huge fan of the &quot;caterpillar stripes&quot; on the health/mana bars. They seem to make things harder to see, rather than easier. Running at 1280x1024, full-screen mode.<br />
<br />
Health/mana bars -- I stack Target, Player, and Pet windows on top of one another. It is always good for me to be able to compare target health, mana (all the time), and pet health (especially when soloing) at a glance. Right now, these do not line up vertically, and may even be different lengths. If/when you revise these, I believe it would be generally useful if they aligned. <br />
<br />
Cursor -- visually, I see the lighter colored triangle more clearly than the darker. (Which is the hotspot?) Somewhat distracting at the moment. No clue if/when I'll get used to it.</div></div><hr />

I miss TargetWCastv1 -- incorporating the casting bar in with the target bar. I am trying to get the couple patches you have for the &quot;stock&quot; casting bar to load so I can get the same effect with Solaria. (TargetWCastv1 is not currently-compatible XML.)<br />
<br />
<br />
works keeping me VERY busy, but I'm slowly getting most Vert mods Solaria compatible. this will be done by the weekend.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not a huge fan of the &quot;caterpillar stripes&quot; on the health/mana bars. They seem to make things harder to see, rather than easier. Running at 1280x1024, full-screen mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm this is my favorite part, as it makes it easier to judge just what gain your getting. However with soem minor xml changes and a tga change it could be made an option via just swaping out a TGA. I'll look at this. (No promises)<br />
<br />
<br />
Health/mana bars -- I stack Target, Player, and Pet windows on top of one another. It is always good for me to be able to compare target health, mana (all the time), and pet health (especially when soloing) at a glance. Right now, these do not line up vertically, and may even be different lengths. If/when you revise these, I believe it would be generally useful if they aligned. <br />
<br />
<br />
Your using the full release of solaria? Pet, Player, and target are exactly 155 pixels in width.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cursor -- visually, I see the lighter colored triangle more clearly than the darker. (Which is the hotspot?) Somewhat distracting at the moment. No clue if/when I'll get used to it.  <br />
<br />
Well the very point of the mouse is the hotspot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">itchyban</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, using release installed in a fresh directory. The windows are all the same width, however the bars themselves do not vertically align when the individual windows align.<br />
<br />
IMHO, the target bar, player bars, and pet bar should all start and end at the same X coordinate on the screen. This allows one to see at a glance if any of the three is lower than the others. Mana or pet lower than mob health -- generally something needs to be done :(<br />
<br />
I'm ok without the cast bar in the target window -- I just edited the stock one to show a border and drag it in place.<br />
<br />
I'm ok with the caterpillar effect too -- provides me different info in that it is &quot;fun&quot; to watch mob health go down. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't screw around with the pet window just yet -- there are hints on Test that there will be pet buffs visible. Finally! Now for a pet mana bar so I can see just how gimp that Fire pet is :(<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your creativity in the free space of the hotbutton window. I may throw Int/resists in there myself for now. I tried them in the player window, and it is too &quot;busy&quot; for me so far. Still tweaking...<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the hard work on this.<br />

Guild window seems bugged -- not sure what is up with that. People don't show up, sorting messed up; may be an EQ problem?<br />
<br />
<br />
  <br />

The Guild window clears when you switch UI in-game. It regenerates when you zone. People who zone while the window is open reappear at the bottom of the listing. Just click on the name column to reaphabetacize(sp) the list</div></div><hr />

Now that we have a full release, I hope see a lot of mods to this UI. The one thing I miss the most from the Vert UI were the large target bars that people created. Especially the one's with half the bar showing your health and the other half showing the targets health. I would love to see something like this using the Solaria bar.<br />

I play at 1600x1200, so you can imagine UI objects can tend too look pretty small.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please be detailed, and email them to sokol@eqinterface.com<br />
Please be patient, as not only am I in the begining stages of a 2 1/2 year project which keeps me busy, I have also just started a guild on ayonae ;) (had to get a plug in &lt;Council of Steel&gt;)<br />

With that patch, you should see a ring around your targets feet, and a color changeing rectangle to the left of the target bar. If your Options settings ingame and make sure everything is turned up and on.<br />

You should just be able to place the current right aligned buf mod inside Solaria and it should work just fine.<br />

I also prefer the right-aligned buff window so I copied the buff window xml file over to the solaria window and it doesn't quite work right.  The graphics don't line up right and there are no numbers to the buff slots.</div></div><hr />

Wow email is slow, just notified me theres a response to this thread! Any way,  Eq defaults to green numbers when something is buffed/enhanced, and red when something is beign negativly affected. This is why you cant change them.<br />

There IS a patch for Vert and Solaria (its the same patch) for Pet Buffs Jart, you may have to do some digging for it since it was released in Feb.<br />
<br />
For solaria, <br />
<br />
if you dont want a tabbed pet window simply remove EQUI_PetWindow.XML from the Solaria folder and you will see the default.  <br />
<br />
Spell Icons are interchangable with any set, WC3, ID2, Visagee was the default we added.. but any will work<br />
<br />
and for the help window.. sounds like you missed a patch.. mine has it.<br />

Just a couple questions. 1. on the window selector thingy mine is missing the help window button is that normal?<br />
<br />
2. is there anything new in the works for solaria? like new spell icons or additions? :D  <br />
<br />
Ok, first I have been busy with other projects like goeq2.com an EQ2 info site dedicated to classes and races in EQ2. (So if your planing on playing EQ2 drop by! Not alot of info there yet, but as time goes on there will be more information gathered; and if you have info go ahead and feel free to post it, or ask questions and I'll try to find the answers) the site is under a week old and I'm still tinkering with it; so it's still taking alot of my time.<br />
<br />
Second we were developing an autoinstaller for solaria which is why we were waiting to increment it to solaria 1.1 as my time is devoted to goeq2.com I've stoped working on the auto installer program. SO we should be back on track with solaria soon.<br />
And then there is omens of war, which I'm sure will require an overhaul on solaria's part so we may just review changes people want and add them to any oow changes.<br />
<br />
As always thanks for your patience and understanding.<br />

I just came back from a 6 month EQ vacation, updated all that I could.. but the container's have yet to see an update.. and, myself being limited on my XML know-how, I can't fix the mod on my own.. yet, I can't find another container window that supports the new augmentation sealer window, yet has the sleek, small container windows like Solaria's.. I myself being a 'minimal' space kind of person, really enjoy the small container windows.. any help with this at all? Or news on the next release of Solaria, with full patches?</div></div><hr />
