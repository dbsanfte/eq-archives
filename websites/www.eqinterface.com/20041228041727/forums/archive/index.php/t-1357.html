...sniffs the fresh paint and passes out.<br />
<br />
It has been a stressful week for Kudane and myself but I’m pleased to announce that our dedicated server is up and running.<br />
<br />
We are currently waiting for our new nameserver to propagate and when that happens we can transfer the domains eqinterface.com and eqgui.com to this server. Unfortunately because the way the download script is written I can not offer any downloads on eqinterface.com until the domain switches to our new server. However I can enable attachments again on the forums! Another plus doing this move now is that you will no longer get that stupid “server busy” message YAY!<br />
<br />
Until eqinterface.com is pointed to our new server I have to keep the eqinterface downloads section offline. Some good news is that I can &amp; have enabled downloads and uploads on the forums. I hope to get everything back up and running soon so I can relax for awhile.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for your patients every one!</div></div><hr />
