<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ortrillian</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1)   Is there any way that an assist key could be put on the group window instead of the invite/disband keys?<br />
<br />
I know how to take the invite/disband keys off but not how to add a key.  I monkey'd around with it but having to log in and out each try gets frustrating.  <br />
<br />
I thought there might be 2 ways to go about adding &quot;Assist&quot;.  First using the same code that is used for the sit/stand key on the actions window or #2  using the code for socials/hotkey.  IE making a hotkey for assist and having a spot just like on the hotkey window where you could click and drag your hotkey to the group window.<br />
<br />
<br />
2)  Those stupid, stupid blue boxes that pop open when you put your arrow on an item (saying what the item is) or a player (their hp %) are driving me insane, I hate them.  Is there anyway that I can get rid of them from items and group members but have the group member hp % to the side of the players name instead?<br />
<br />
3)  I want to be able to minimize my main chat window but I'm not sure which file that is in.  Any idea?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never looked through all the options in the new UI, so it might still be there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose you could remove the tooltips by taking out the tooltip references in the XML files, but I personally don't mind them.<br />
<br />
Just go into a file, like for instance the playerwindow file, and everywhere you see the word tooltip, just take out that line. I doubt this will work though, since EQ doesn't seem to like it when something is removed completely.</div></div><hr />
