<br />
#1 Not that I am going to stop using all these amazing UI's, but does the increased amount of over all UI file size, make any difference on in-game perfomance? Granted these files are still very small, but many are dubble there original size.<br />
<br />
#2<br />
I guess I have lost my children???<br />
I don't have any in-game problems but I just want to make sure that all this is normal and not corrupting any other files. These are the only errors in log (copied my default to custom folder and just pressed no when prompted to replace files, thinking that it may speed up the UI load. That is why there are not alot more error notes.)<br />

Lastly, <br />
Anyone know how to stop holding shift when trying to move the curser forward and backward when not in-game? I also find myself hitting enter before I type. Oh, and my girlfriend doesn't understand when I say &quot; LOL&quot; instead of laughing. Any help you can find whould help! =)<br />
<br />
P.S. <br />
Thank you all for your efforts to improve, and give game players options in gameplay, and look, you are trully talented.</div></div><hr />

I tested it by making a UI that was as small as posable, then I compiled a UI useing the largest files I could find from here.  When I ran them both, they ran just about the same.<br />
<br />
Your errors are just saying those items are not defined in the bugreport window.  As long as it causes no problems, I would not worry about it.  Please do not EVER AGAIN copy the default directory to your custom fold.  When patch time comes around, this causes untold headacks.<br />
<br />
As for holding the shift key while alt-abed out of EQ, Just click the show desktop icon, which will minumize EQ and make it not necissary to hold shift.<br />
<br />
Give your girl time..she will learn all the EQ lingo.</div></div><hr />

BTW I re-installed the UI w/ out the default folder files, thanks for the info!</div></div><hr />
