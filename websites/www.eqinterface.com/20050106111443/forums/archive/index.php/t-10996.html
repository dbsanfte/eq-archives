<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheRhino</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imagine that?  Anyways!  My problem is pretty simple, my UI wont load.  Got in game today (after doing all the changes to my UI) and the default was on.  So I hit /load &lt;ui&gt; (like normal) and it doesnt load it.  It doesnt give an error either, it just doesnt load it.  Anyone know why it would do that?  I thought I might have done something wrong with the changes, but I checked them over and I did it right.  <br />
<br />
Anyways thats my question, thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheRhino</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres the Error Log: At the end those items were from the last patch and havent worked since then, but the UI still worked.  Thusly I dont think the problem lies with the items starting with the dragitem errors.  When I looked over it I saw one area that caught my attention (Which I have bolded), though I have no idea what that means or how to fix it.  The rest of the error's seem like the normal errors from not using those files as custom files (no? Im not too good with ui's so im trying to learn lol).<br />

I was told that the old UI's may not be compatible with whatever it was they did with this latesy patch.  Anyways, I'm stuck with the crappy default UI until I find out how to get my old ones back.  Oh yeah...and my default one doesn't seem to have a target window either.  Grrrrr.<br />

They only changed a couple of files and yet NONE of my old files will load....very frustrating.<br />

Those errors go back to the patch on 14 May.  You can find the thread here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8467).<br />

phionamcree - a) start fresh, without making a copy of your default folder.
