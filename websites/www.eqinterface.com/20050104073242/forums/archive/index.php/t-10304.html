<br />
I have not been able to play EQ since Monday Sept 15, due to my UI not loading or displaying.<br />
<br />
Now, I can load EQ fine, then get to Server, choose a Character, then the standard screen pops up, music plays, then goes to Black screen.  After this screen, I would pop into the world.<br />
<br />
Not now, it locks up and I have to manually power down computer and reboot.  Now, I know for a fact that my character has made it into Norrath, because when I try to log in another one after re-boot, it says I currently have an active character !<br />
<br />
I am using an ALL-DEFAULT UI, except for 2 files from this website:<br />
Hotbutton one- trilhotbutton.zip<br />
Player Window- Turlo CasterPlayer.zip<br />
<br />
Now, I checked my UI FILE ERROR log, like people said, nothing in it except the current date and time I tried to log in to EQ.<br />
<br />
So, I read also that maybe I have 2 EQ directories ....How is this possible, and how do you check for this ????<br />
<br />
I tried to go into my Characters UI settings, and change all back to Default, but it does not help !<br />
<br />
Please, someone help, as I am very frustrated, and have never had any EQ problems until now, been playing 4 years.<br />
<br />
Thanks all, and this site is very helpful :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try opening your character's UI ini file (example, mine is UI_Cairenn_eci.ini), look for:<br />
<br />
[Main]<br />
UISkin=XYZ<br />
<br />
Set that to Default instead of XYZ.<br />
<br />
Now open your eqclient.ini file, look for:<br />
<br />
UISkin=XYZ<br />
<br />
Again, set that to Default if it isn't already.<br />
<br />
That should hopefully make it so that you can at least log in.<br />
<br />
After we get to that point, we can move on to next steps to try to get this sorted out with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magnacor</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the quick response Cairenn :)<br />
<br />
But, alas, I tried what you suggested and it did not help.<br />
<br />
I changed all 8 of my characters UI-profile, file, back to Default from what it was set on.  Then I did the change in EQ Client, nothing helped.<br />
<br />
The wierd thing is................no matter what character I choose, after the computer lock-up, I reboot, go back to EQ, get to character select screen, and that character will be WEARING his Helm !!  Now this has not happened to me since the BIG patch in JUNE or JULY.  Since then, very rarely, I mean rarely will my characters ever have their Helms on after camping.<br />
<br />
Just thought it was interesting side note.<br />
<br />
Hope you or someone has some more ideas for me to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MooingMidget</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feel lucky, I haven't been able to log in on my computer in several months now, the patcher says I'm not using DirectX 8.1 or higher (I'm using 9.0b)... I can play it fine on my parents or sisters computer, but most of the time they are using them, so that screws me over.  But, good luck getting your EQ fixxed... if I was a bit more knowledgable about what the heck was going on technically in EQ as of late, I'd prolly be able to help you, but I'm not.</div></div><hr />

I would recommend a thorough file scan, after making sure all your expansions are checked.</div></div><hr />
