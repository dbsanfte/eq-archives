I was trying to set up a new chat window and saw something that said &quot;rename window&quot; so I clicked it, and was immediately sent to desktop and EQ closed.  Only mods I've downloaded have been a spellbook mod, and the advanced targeting mod.  Anyone know what could cause this?  I remember reading a thread from someone elser having this problem but can't remember where.  <br />
<br />
It would actually be kind of a nice option since it was a very clean exit and took all of 2 seconds to close EQ completely.</div></div><hr />

If you got the mod from someone else, then you need to get them to do it! *grin*<br />
