<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catx</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i have tried everything... and cant get it to come up...I am refering to the skills window which shows 1hand blunt etc...<br />
With a current char, new char etc, it wont come up. I have even attempted deleting the default UI to get it and then patched. IT still wont come up. I have even searched and posted on EQ boards about this and they wont help. I have even gone through every size screen in attempts to find it with out any luck. This happens on both my dell computer and my sons home made computer. On my sons computer it now comes up with another UI but not with default. All of the things listed I have done on both computers. Except on my computer with a new UI the skills window will not come up.<br />
IF anyone can help me I would be forever in your debt.<br />
I will take any suggestions any comments anything. <br />
PS there is nothing listed in the UIerrors.txt file also...<br />

Help me please.<br />
