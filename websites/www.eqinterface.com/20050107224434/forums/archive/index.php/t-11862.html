<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rykahna</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to some issues with my UI and the recent patches, I had to wipe out my custom folder and begin installing my UI components again one at a time.  One of the steps to doing this was reinstalling all my TKing class/spellbook/spellgem animations, and the Spell Gems really gave me a bit of a nightmare.  Here's the problem...<br />
<br />
STEP ONE: Installed G2 SpellGem TGAs.  No problem.  However, spellcast gem bar and hotbuttons looked funny with square icons in round spaces.  Sooo...<br />
<br />
STEP TWO: Attempted to run the Remmy.exe dated 2/2 that is downloadable off Remelio's site which purports to fix display issues with the TKing G2 icons.  Reload caused UI to fail and load up default UI.<br />
<br />
STEP THREE: Restored backup.  Attempted to run Remmy.exe dated 9/10 with the patch .txt. files for the G2 icon fix.  Again, UI failed and default was loaded.<br />
<br />
STEP FOUR: Restored backup.  Attempted to run remmy.exe dated 11/10.  Had a very long delay while it &quot;repaired EQUI_Animations&quot; file.  Tried to patch with the G2 patch .txt files.  Got a strange Error 802: File Not Found message.  Reload of UI had me back to Step One, where the correct TKing icons were visible, only were not displayed properly in castbar and hotbutton windows.<br />
<br />
STEP FIVE: Attempted to run remmy.exe dated 2/2 again.  It worked.  Icons displayed properly in castbar and hotbuttons.<br />
<br />
I am assuming that the &quot;repair EQUI_Animations.xml&quot; function of the 11/10 remmy.exe is necessary to make the patching of the icons to work with the spellcast bar and hotbuttons work properly.  However, I imagine it would be a mite confusing to a lot of folks to have to run the 11/10 remmy.exe to REPAIR the animations file, and then the 2/2 remmy.exe to PATCH the icons.  Or, maybe I'm just lazy and would prefer &quot;one stop shopping&quot; on my remmy.exe, lol.  I imagine the way it should work is that remmy.exe repairs the file, then patches it properly, without having to unzip and run and OLDER version of remmy.exe after a newer version, no?<br />
<br />
At any rate, I thought I would bring this issue and its workaround to Remelio's attention, since I know he is hard at work ironing out a lot of issues with the remmy.exe patcher (and BLESS him for it!)<br />
<br />
Also, a question...for those who want TKing spell icons AND class animations, has anyone ever considered a TKing/Remelio &quot;ALL IN ONE&quot; bundle?  I have characters of several different classes, and originally, I was installing one class animation, then unzipping another and installing it, then another, then the gems, etc.  Like I said, I'm kinda a &quot;one stop shopping&quot; gal.  So I created a .zip file with ALL the TKing Class animations and the latest (11/10) remmy.exe, which I am attaching here just in case anyone wants it.  However, it would be great to be able to include the spellgem patch in there as well.  I just don't dare touch that one until whatever the issue I mentioned above is worked out.<br />

<br />
Do I just need to run the patch fixes or something?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this is frustrating for people, the reason I left it as-is, is that it works for most like it is without the new Remmy.exe patcher, and then there are some who have problems with it, Remelio came out the newest patcher right after I had already made all the installs, I plan to redo them all this Friday/Saturday, but this week I'm still looking into alternative solutions, so we don't have to keep patching everytime Everquest does, it's just frustrating to have to revisit the same thing so frequently, it is as though the animations are being broken purposely every patch, that would be far fetched now wouldn't it? heh</div></div><hr />
