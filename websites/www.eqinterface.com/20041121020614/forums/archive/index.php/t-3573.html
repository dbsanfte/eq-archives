<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanctum</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am the webmaster of Oracle Of Virtue a guild based on the cazicthule server. I dont have money to spend on this and nothing to offer in return. I have a screenshot of the pieces of skins ive put together. I know nothing about XML and have painfully gone through starting up and shutting down EQ recently to get what i needed for our guild. After the last patch the painstaking work ive gone through is now out of order again so here i am. I would like ( if anyone would like to ) to have a skin made for our guild. Nothing fancy no frills or eye candy stripped down bare bones and a little tweaking. I have a link to the screenshot below of what i have and from that i just need soem additions and/or changes.<br />
