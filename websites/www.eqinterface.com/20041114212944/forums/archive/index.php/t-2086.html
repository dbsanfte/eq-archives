Haven UI is heavily based on the Quartz UI.  The key differences that Haven carries are:<br />
<br />
- Frequent updates to keep pace with Verant\'s UI changes<br />
- A built-in graphical config utility<br />
- Smart updates (part of the config utility)<br />
- Ability to toggle the Help icon (especially useful for some plugins such as Timer) and pet information<br />
- Ability to toggle buff names and character class configurations graphically<br />
- A revised buff window<br />
- A stable pre-built INI<br />
- Executable installation (and patching in the future)<br />
- Start Menu shortcut for the config utility and readme<br />
- Revised (easier to read) server list (part of the config utility)<br />
- 100% lit compass by default<br />
<br />
<br />
New in v1.1:<br />
<br />
- A revised installer that should work for everyone.<br />
- Ability to toggle pet info.<br />
- Config Utility v1.2 that works with the new installation format.</div></div><hr />

Install it and then move your mods over into the uifiles\haven directory.  It should work :)  If it doesn't please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aruvius</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey man,<br />
<br />
Downloaded the file, ran the installer, followed the prompts, and nothing happened. Moved the file to the folder I have EQ installed in, repeated, still nothing happened. Do you have it hardcoded to only install to C:/program files/everquest? Cause my path is different...<br />
<br />
There was no folder created, no UI file, etc....<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm.. that's very odd.  No, it's not hardcoded - it gets your EQ dir from the registry.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you get a couple popups that asked you questions about the config and told you it was installed successfully?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vixyn</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I have the same problem with nothing happenin' sides it makin' a new UI-Vixyn file... I got the pop-ups, got the prompts, did 'em all... nada</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... at least only 2 people seem to have this problem.  That's not bad out of over 300 downloads ;)<br />
<br />
Here's a fix for you two to start with:<br />
<br />
1. Open the HavenUI.zip file and drag'n'drop Haven.exe to your desktop.<br />
2. Right-click Haven.exe and select &quot;Extract here&quot;<br />
3. Cut'n'paste the &quot;haven&quot; folder from your desktop to Everquest\uifiles.<br />
4. Browse into Everquest\uifiles\haven\data and right-click on &quot;hconfig.vbe&quot;, and &quot;Send to\ Desktop (create shortcut)&quot; (hconfig.vbe is the config utility)<br />
<br />
That's all you need to do, and hopefully the config utility will work for you althohgh I'm concerned that if the installer didn't the config utility won't either.  :\<br />
<br />
To help me figure out what went wrong for you two please PM or email me with the following info:<br />
<br />
1. If you know how to use regedit please browse to the key &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\Everquest.exe\&quot; and tell me what's in the &quot;Path&quot; value.  (should be something like C:\Program Files\Everquest)<br />
<br />
2. What the name of your &quot;uifiles&quot; folder is, as in is it &quot;uifiles&quot; or &quot;Uifiles&quot; or &quot;UIFiles&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
3. What operating system you use including any service packs and what version of Internet Explorer you have.<br />
<br />
4. Who your ISP is and whether or not you used a download manager/accelerator to get Haven UI.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aruvius</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll double-check all of these answers tonight, but from memory:<br />
<br />
1. d:/sony/everquest trilogy/<br />
<br />
2. uifiles<br />
<br />
3. Windows ME IE 5.0<br />
<br />
4. Optidynamic (small dial up in my area) and no download managers/accelerators.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I'll double check them tonight when I get home from work, as well as try what you said and see if that works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That may happen.  The reason it picks it up as malicious is because it manipulates files on your machine, and it's written in VBScript.<br />

I assure one and all that it's not malicious, and most anti-virus programs that are up-to-date won't think it's malicious.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bleedingedge40</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must be a idiot, but I cannot get the skin to work.  I've downloaded the skin and the 1.1 config update and installed both.  I ran the install utility to create UI ini files for 3 characters on 2 different servers and verified that the name/server match the character's ini file.  I checked the UI ini file and it has the UISkin set to haven.  I checked that the skin is actually in uifiles\haven and it is.  I run everquest, load one of the characters and get the generic UI.  I hit F10 to switch UI and I get the default skin, then no skin, then back to the generic skin.<br />
<br />
I try /loadskin haven and /loadskin haven 1 in the game and nothing happens. (for that matter /loadskin fjfjfjfjfjfj doesn't do anything either)<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
I'm running XP, and the version of the game is the freebie downloaded from www.everquest.com.<br />
<br />
I've only played a couple of times so I know just enough to be dangerous, so I'm sure I'm screwing something up, I just need to figure out what it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andarien</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get that installation problem too, and the reason is quite easy:<br />
<br />
I do not have those registry-entries ..... Why? because when I reinstall my system, I just copy the old eq-folder to a backup and replace it from there, so that I do not have to use the CDs and repatch everything! Saves quite a bit of hassle and time!! EQ does not need the registry-entries.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be that if you do not find the registry-keys, open a input-box, requesting the position of the EQ-Folder to be input manually and then save it in your ini.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm with you on that and thought of that last night, too.  I don't have time to code a new installer today but I'll do one tomorrow.  Until I get the new installer released please follow the alternate directions I gave about 5 posts about 8 posts above this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackhorse</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice work, looks like the crystal one i used to have before.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bleedingedge40</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried doing the manual install you outlined in earlier, and it didn't work either.  (looking at it I didn't expect it to as everythign appears to be correct, on the surface anyway)<br />
<br />
All the files appear to be in the right place and the UI ini file looks like it's correct, but the skins don't load.  I checked the registry and it's got the correct path, &quot;C:\Program Files\EverQuest&quot;.  The uifiles directory is &quot;uifiles&quot; (all lower case) and I'm running IE 6 (6.0.2800 to be exact) with Windows XP &amp; XP SP1.<br />
<br />
I tried using someone else's skin (Albattior) and following the manual instructions he included with his skin, and it doesn't work either.  Does the freebie download lock out this feature? (I would guess not since it supports the canned skin)  Does your installer do anything other than create the UI_&lt;character&gt;_&lt;server&gt; ini file?  Are there reg entries or eqclient.ini entries that should be there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure about the free version's status.  The only thing I know for sure that affects the new UI is whether or not your video card supports anti-aliasing.</div></div><hr />

I just released v1.1 of Haven UI that includes a new installer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The v1.1 installer has you browse to your current EQ directory and then uses that location from then on. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bleedingedge40</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found my problem, [NewUI] was set to FALSE in EqClient.ini.  I figured this out as I was reading the extended documentation looking for anything that might have been causing the problem. :nana: <br />
<br />
You might want to add a comment in the readme telling users to check their eqclient.ini file and make sure that NewUI is set to true.  This may benefit other EQ neophites like myself who don't know the ins and outs of the game that well.  If I had known this I would have been up until 7am this morning playing instead of trying to make the skin load. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pallydelving</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya.<br />
<br />
Downloaded the file and extracted as to h:\uifiles\Haven<br />
<br />
Run it and get the direction to locate Everquest files, do so and get error message:<br />
<br />
This installer cannot locate your Everquest Files. Please run it again and verify the Everquest directory you select.<br />
<br />
The problem seems to be the fact that I use an entire partition for EQ. As such, there is no Everquest directory.<br />
<br />
Am I right/wrong? A fix?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advnace :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ROFL!  I knew this was going to pop up sooner or later, but I really had no choice.  If I allowed root drives to be selected and written into the installer you wouldn't believe how many peeps would do it unintentionally. lol<br />
<br />
That's why I included the Haven folder itself in the zip.  :)  <br />
<br />
You can drag-n-drop that folder to your eq\uifiles directory and then you should be able to run the config utility from your start menu.  If you don't have a Haven UI folder on your Start Menu or the icon bombs out you can right-click the &quot;hconfig.vbe&quot; file in your uifiles\haven\data folder and Send to\Desktop (create shortcut).<br />
<br />
That oughta get you running.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; If you can't run the config tool after trying these things let me know and I'll send you a personal patcher :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pallydelving</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for all the problems, but ...<br />
<br />
WinZip extracts - HavenUI 1-1.exe and Readme.txt.<br />
<br />
No Haven folder and no data folder because the app can't find anywhere to put it.<br />
<br />
Back to you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok - start by extracting HavenUI_1-1.exe and then right-click on it and select &quot;Extract here&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pallydelving</div><div class="date">09-15-2002, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have extracted the app in C:\, H:\, H:\uifiles, H:\uifiles\Haven.<br />
<br />
No problems with the extraction, just when it runs it won't accept H:\ as a directory.<br />

:(<br />

Gotta go out - will be back and try later, thanks</div></div><hr />

The hotkeys would be more useful closer to the spell gems and group window but I'll just bind them all to keyboard keys instead.<br />
<br />
Keep it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">09-16-2002, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do that if you'd like, Fildo.  It won't look as &quot;smooth&quot; as it does by default, though.<br />
<br />
To move the items around right-click on them (some of them are tricky to find the right-click spot) and select &quot;*Lock&quot;.  Then left-click drag-n-drop them where you want them.<br />
<br />
The chat windows aren't draggable but can be resized several times in any direction to move them.<br />
<br />
Once you get the boxes where you want them make sure to right-click and &quot;Lock&quot; on each component you unlocked initially.<br />
<br />
Knock yourself out. :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
And kirashi, everything is locked by default because this UI, like the UI it's based on, is designed to have a certain look, feel and functionality.  If the windows are unlocked when you first install Haven, at your first login they're all scattered around the screen like jigsaw puzzle pieces.  So, in essence,  they're locked to maintain the integrity of the design and to ease the use of it &quot;out of the box&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i found a little bug... or problem.. not sure if i can call it a bug =)<br />
<br />
The EQUI_GroupWindow.xml  points always to the DrawTemplate WDT_Group.  When i want to setup a pure Melee with the vbe script like a warrior and then run eq and load the skin, it uses the wnd_bg_group.tga instead of the wnd_bg_noncaster.tga.<br />
<br />
During my search why always the wrong tga file is used i saw an other thing.  In haven/mods  the melee.xml points to WDT_Group and the caster.xml points to WDT_Group_NonCaster. Perhaps there is the Problem that the setup script isnt working right.<br />
<br />
Atm i edit the xml file by hand...  but would be nice if u could look into it =)<br />
