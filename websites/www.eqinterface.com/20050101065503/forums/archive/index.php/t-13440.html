Okay...when you open EQ the first thing you do is download any new files and whatnot due to patches...if you have autoplay clicked...unclick it.  Go to Advanced options and check all of the left boxs except the first one and download the package extras with the expansions that weren't introduced in with the patches.  Mine took 33 minutes to complete...but it took care of my 2 week problem!!!  I can now download any UI skin and upload it into the game...YAY!!!  So for all of those who keep having UI troubles...try doing this and see if it works...GOOD LUCK!!!!<br />

What extra packages?  Where do you Download them from?  Okay...when you first log into EQ...you get the download screen where it scans for new stuff to be downloaded in order for the game to run smoothly...there is a button named Advanced buttons...click it.  There is a list on the left of packages...click all of these except the first one...and that should help :D</div></div><hr />

Thats the Patcher.  You Run EQ. Patcher Come up. Checks for Patches/missing files. Then, a, waits for you to hit play button, or b, &quot;auto-play&quot;s which is basicly clicking the Play button w/o the actual physical doing so.  <br />
<br />
He is saying to stop &quot;Auto-Play&quot; if you have it on.  Click Advanced.  Select all the expansions.  This will download anything you don't have.  This makes sure you have all the EQ files.<br />
<br />
I believe the First one is Legends files, so u cant use tehm unles u pay the $40+ a month.</div></div><hr />
