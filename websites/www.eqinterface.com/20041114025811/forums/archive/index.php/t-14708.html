<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a beta release of my resettable timers.  Just a few examples to show how the timers work.  I've used the music player window this time.<br />
<br />
The first one is a tick timer.  It changes color every six seconds.  By adjusting the slider you can set it to match the ticks in your current zone.<br />
<br />
Knowing exactly when a tick ends can be useful for pulling, or for sneaking past a mob without it seeing you.  It can also be useful for short duration spells like Word of Morell.  It's useful to know whether WoM will last for 6.5 seconds or 11.5 seconds... without a tick timer it's hard to predict.<br />
<br />
The next three are 20-minute timers.  I chose 20 minutes because that's the respawn time in Droga.  The idea is that you adjust the timer so the bar is solid white.  Then the red bar slowly drifts across.  When the bar is solid white again, 20 minutes have passed.  I made three of them to show that they can be be set independently, even though all three use the same animation.  I've included an editable field with each one for descriptions.<br />
<br />
The final one is a 6-minute timer.  It's basically the same idea, but a dancing banana-man is riding the red bar.  Adjust it so banana-man is off-screen... he'll dance across the timer and six minutes later he'll be off-screen again.  You can use it to time less than six minutes too... the tick marks show one minute increments.<br />
<br />
I've shrunk the scroll buttons to 15 pixels wide instead of the standard 22 for good reason.  At that size, each pixel movement of the slider has exactly the same movement of the picture: 4 pixels on the ticker and 3 pixels on the timers.<br />
<br />
Enjoy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's another version.<br />
<br />
I've added another 20 minute timer, this time you set it to all-white and the red bar moves across... when it's all-red 20 minutes have passed.  The catch is that it takes another 20 minutes for the timer to transition back to all-white.  This is a bit more similar to Arista-style timers so people might like it better.<br />
<br />
On this one the slider ratio is 4-to-1.  That means each movement of the slider advances the timer by 40 seconds.  The other three 20-minute timers with the small bars have a resolution of 24 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">08-01-2004, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok banana-man was amusing, but now I'm making them more polished.  I've used the music player window again.<br />
<br />
First, I got rid of the arrow buttons and the gutter altogether.  Who needs em anyway, I just slide the thumb.  This looks better, simplifies the xml, and improves the resolution.<br />
<br />
Next I switched from a two-color timer to a one-color timer with a mark.  This reduces the size of the graphics, reduces the size of the xml, and improves resolution again.<br />
<br />
Now my proper two-color timer has a 3-pixel resolution.  A simple two-color timer like my tick timer gets a 2-pixel resolution.  My one-color timer also has a 2-pixel resolution.  The marker on traditional timers has a 1-pixel resolution.<br />
<br />
Finally I imitated some of Arista's graphics for better comparison, and threw in some vertical timers too, to show off.  The circle moves all the way across every 20 minutes, and you can reset it by moving the thumb.<br />
<br />
Does this look good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">08-01-2004, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice work, Sylphan. :) If I may, however, I'd like to provide some feedback based on my past experiences with a similar timer design, hope that is OK with you.<br />
<br />
Originally, while brainstorming for version 3 of my timer (my first bar-style timers), I had experimented with an idea somewhat similar to this. I started out by putting the bar animation on the scrollable area, and had the user scroll the animation in order to &quot;reset&quot; the timer, so to speak.<br />
<br />
However, after some testing, I found it easier and faster to &quot;mark&quot; the bar instead of moving the bar into place. With a movable bar, due to scroll area boundaries, the user had to choose the direction that would allow full movement depending on where the animation was at the time. This is not a huge deal, but since timers are often used during frantic combat, not having to decide which way to go saved a bit of time for me. Marking the bar (instead of moving the bar) also had the additional benefit that users can more easily make a mental note of where to place the marker if they are too busy casting, etc. and set the marker later when they have more time. Thus, I opted to go with a movable marker instead of a movable bar animation.<br />
<br />
While designing version 4, I re-visited the same idea once more but eventually abandoned it again, for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
1) Ease and speed of use were the first priority for my new version. With the new button-style marker in version 4, which can be set with a single click, the choice was even more clear than before. There is no clicking-and-dragging involved, as would be required with a scrollable animation. With the new marker, the user simply clicks on the dot to begin timing.<br />
<br />
2) The second priority was conserving screen space. Putting the animation in a scroll area would require a bit of extra room for the scroll bar, whereas the markers can overlap the bar animation, allowing the timers to be more compact.<br />
<br />
3) A third consideration was to allow a single timer to time two instances of the same event. By placing markers at two different points on the bar, it is possible to time two separate mezzes using the same bar animation, for example. This would not be possible with a scrolling animation where the bar itself has to be moved into place.<br />
<br />
The above explains some of the reasoning behind the choices that I made when deciding on a timer design. Even though having a movable timer bar that could be visually &quot;reset&quot; was nice, in the end I personally felt that a marker-based timer was easier/faster to use and provided more benefits for the user.<br />
<br />
I do like what you've done here, though, and I hope you'll keep enhancing and exploring these possibilities further. Your norrathian day timer that is based on the same concept is very, very cool. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's interesting that our timers developed somewhat along the same path.  First with a 2-color timer, where the bar starts as one color (or blank), and gradually fills up with color until full.  Then we both decided to try 1-color timers where a little mark moves from start to end.  Also we both started out with arrows at each end of the timer and later got rid of them.<br />
<br />
1. You seem to be more concerned with the ease of setting the timer.  I'm more concerned with the ease of reading the timer.  Now that you've got the marker to a single click, that's unbeatable speed... click-and-drag can never be as fast as single-click no matter what.  But that little marker is tiny, making it kinda hard to see.  It doesn't serve as a reminder unless you actively check it every few minutes.  I used a set of seven timers for a long time... when each bar and each slider is at a different position it's difficult to tell at a glance if one of them has run out, or will run out soon.  Quite often haste would run out on the group or an illusion (like NDT) would wear off on somebody because I simply hadn't noticed that that particular timer was getting close to its marker.<br />
<br />
I play an enchanter too, so I fully understand how nice it is to set a mark quickly when mezzing stuff.  In fact, that's what I use my dial timer for -- a single click highlights one of the ten numbers.  I also added an extra button to the center of mine, so I could highlight none of the ten numbers.  But I want longer-duration timers to serve as reminders.  Until timers gain the ability to 'ding' or play a sound, the only way to do that is to stand out visually.<br />
<br />
2. Yep the scroller takes extra space for the thumb.  It's unavoidable.  I've experimented, but there's no way to make any part of the timer overlap the scrollbar.  I might find a way to make it blend in with the background better, or even make it transparent and put something behind it, but technically it'll always take up that extra space.<br />
<br />
3. Screen space again.  This is the same issue.  But I wonder how much space it saves.  Your new bars with their double sliders are twice as wide (or should I say tall) as the old bars.<br />
<br />
By the way, there's no reason that a timer couldn't have both a slider AND a marker.  All it takes is a little transparency, you can have both.<br />
<br />
But in the meantime I'll concentrate on the strengths of this style: visibility.<br />
<br />
One thing you can never do with a non-scrolling timer is have the circle go off-screen.  It always has to be visible so you can place the marker on it.  So I'm thinking of making my timer much wider than the bar.  Then the circle won't even appear on screen until the last quarter (or possibly third) of the time... the timer won't catch your attention at all until time is almost up.<br />
<br />
Second, I'm considering a way to turn a timer off when not using it.  It could be as simple as having an overlapping non-transparent control.  Click in the right place and the timer is (mostly) hidden, click someplace on the timer again and it comes back.  In cases where I have seven different timers but I'm only using two of them, that'd help a lot.<br />
<br />
And I'm still trying to figure out layout boxes.  So far they seem to have some odd restrictions, and don't want to scroll properly, so I haven't been able to use them yet.<br />
<br />
BTW:<br />
It took awhile, but I finally figured out the mathematics that determine which timer widths are suitable.  If you want a timer that A) is any number of seconds (even 1 second), and B) has the same delay for every movement, there are only sixteen possibilities.  1, 2, 4, 8, 5, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1000.  I'm pretty sure I'll settle on 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, or 250.  A few more choices are possible if you're willing to restrict the timer to a multiple of six seconds (seeing as how everything in EQ is done in ticks).</div></div><hr />
