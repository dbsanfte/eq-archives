<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.technosapien.net/images/box-art.gif&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Sony* has announced that:<br />
<br />
1.  That Planes of Power will be release Monday October 21, 2002!! It won't be in stores till Oct 22nd, this is just the day THEY released it to be shipped (sneaky little @##@$)<br />
<br />
2. There was a patch early Monday morning and that the servers will/were down for 5 hours. Read Patch Message Here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3194)<br />
<br />
Please Note:<br />
That in anticipation of another POP patch., late tonight  we will be disabling a few features that we turn off to help server load.  these include &quot;most recent post&quot; and &quot;most recent uploads&quot; <br />
<br />
If it appears that the UI is not effected, and we are not slammed with over 400 people at once. we will turn these items back on. (as usual)<br />
<br />
I wish everyone luck with the new game, if it lives up to Sony's* promises it will be a blast.<br />
<br />
*notice there is no name Verant anywhere now, not on login screen or box art <br />

 The only thing great about it is Bazaar, the stones, and a new KEI center :P <br />
But when I hit lvl 46, i expect to think this is much better, because i will actually be able to put this expansion to better use :) <br />
   Well, my parents are beginning to nag at me, good luck everyone, and keep leveling.<br />
