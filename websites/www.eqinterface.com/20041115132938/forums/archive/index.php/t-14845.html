<br />
The UI has been tested stable and no issues thus far have been found. There are plans for it to include the extra spell slot and additional buff slots. I expect to have it in a final state with the release of OoW. For now I'm calling it Beta despite its stable state.<br />
<br />

<br />
NemesisUI is designed to be used at high resolutions. It was designed under 1600x1200 but will work at 1280x1024 and lower depending on window arrangement.<br />
<br />
In all windows, there are parts (such as title bars) that are opaque and other elements (backgrounds, inside chat windows, etc) that are set to a permanent translucency.<br />
<br />
All windows have been modified to have a dark, sleek feel, and to fit well together. They can be placed in any order and still fit together.<br />
<br />
The Hotkey, Chat, Target, Group, Spell, and Player windows are designed to fit on the bottom of the screen. The Short Duration Buff, regular Buff, Music Player, HoTT, Pet, and Combat Ability windows are designed to &quot;dock&quot; as it were into the upper right hand corner.<br />
<br />
There are two versions of the UI in the one download. A Caster/Hybrid version and a Pure Melee version. The Caster/Hybrid version shows a mana gauge with numbers as part of the Target window and has the casting gauge as a sub gauge (similar to a pet hp gauge) of the Mana gauge only on top, and includes five discipline buttons on the Combat Ability window.<br />
<br />
The Pure Melee version replaces the Mana and Casting gauges in the Target window with Endurance (with numbers) and Discipline time remaining gauge, as well as having the full eight buttons on the Combat Ability Window.<br />
<br />
<br />
An alternate Hotkey window with vertical buttons is included.<br />
<br />
The Group window shows your HP and hit point numbers as well as that of your group, and includes function and percent labels.<br />
<br />
The Player window has none of its normal elements and instead includes Exp and AA gauges, All stats (excluding HP which are in the group window), and has 7 clickies.<br />
<br />
The Inventory window is similar to the Velious era one, with new elements added (Mana and End numbers, charm slot, dye button, etc)<br />
<br />
<br />
Batch files are included to convert the UI between Caster/Hybrid and Pure Melee versions, as well as for the alternate hotkey window.<br />
<br />
A text file, README.TXT, is included that explains how to switch between the versions, how to change the clickies, and lists a few additional notes.<br />
<br />
The download and screenshots can be found above. Questions or suggestions can be sent to shaidui@cox.net, or sent to Shaidtan on the Quellious server.</div></div><hr />

It's been fixed. The current version (0.61) no longer has the issue and the cast meter should be working fine now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crackmaster</div><div class="date">08-15-2004, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very clean looks great.. maybe I'll have to switch to a higher res so I can use it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good work!<br />
<br />
Would like to see the mana bar under the HP bar, like normal.<br />
But great work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaazek</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this UI. My only problem is that there is no button to Accept or Decline group invites. I had to use Control I to accept. Is there a way to load one? Or was it not included? Other than that this is the best UI I have used. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moonnie</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice UI trying it out now. Small comments <br />
<br />
1) Same as the person above me, a way to accept groups would be really nice <br />
2) Me as a priest i like the HoTT near my target window so i can switch fast. It looks very pretty this way but is kind of annoying for a priest. Is there a way to make a alternate hott that can fit a bit closer to the target ?</div></div><hr />
