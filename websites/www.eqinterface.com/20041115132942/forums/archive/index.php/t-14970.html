<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Centhena</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so I was thinking I made this mod so everyone could use it right? But I posted everything in my ui thread. So I thought to myself how are people who don't use my UI gonna know about this thing? The answer was obvious.... start a new thread. The purpose of this thread is just to basicly advertise this mod. I've never made a post whose only function was to show off a mod before heh. I of course have a thread for my ui so people can comment make requests and let me know if something's not working. But I'm especially proud of this mod and I wanted to make sure everyone got the chance to see it. <br />
<br />
This mod is fully functional and standalone. It does not require my ui to work. This mod contains no stretchy ugly mutilated graphics and should go nicely with any celtic\medevil\druid ui's. See thumbnails below. It is only tested at 1024x768 however.<br />
<br />
This one took me longer than any mod I've ever made... a week and a half. I had to redo the whole thing 3 times trying to get it the way I wanted it. I learned many things about xml that I didn't know before. Prior to this it's never taken me more than 2 days to get a window finished and that was the previous container of Remelio's that I put the sides on. Aside from container mods the longest I've ever spent was a few hours on a window. I am fully convinced that whoever decided to put the augment sealer code in the container xml is a total sadist. This window reminded me why I quit programing. But it's done now and I hope you all like it. If you have questions comments or feedback you can post them either here or in my UI thread which i usually check daily. You can find the UI thread here (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9433)! Feedback is what motivates me to keep posting new things so lemme know if you like it or have a suggestion.<br />

The following screenies are pretty self descriptive. remove.jpg is to show you where the button for remove delete and insert is positioned. I didn't like that you have an empty box display when the buttons are disabled so i removed it.<br />
