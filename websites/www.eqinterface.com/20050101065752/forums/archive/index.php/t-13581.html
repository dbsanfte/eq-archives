I keep getting the same error regardless.  Kernel 32 crash whenever I try to use msconfig in Win98SE.  This is the only computer thats doing it.  I've tried 3 different source disks for the installation so I know that it can't be a corrupt installation issue.  Anyone have any ideas?</div></div><hr />

My problem turned out to be a dead hard drive....it could take some data but not all so got errors.<br />

Might want to see about having it checked out or get a new one.</div></div><hr />

But here's the true question.... Why still 98SE?</div></div><hr />

I ran one pass of standard and one pass of thorough.   I'm going install one device at a time until I get a kernel crash.  Then I'll install everything but the one i got the kernel crash on and see if thats the trick. Below is the exact error in case it means something to anyone:  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem I had was that scandisk said everything was fine too..but if there are corrupted (ie totally un-usuable) sectors they will not show up...it will be as if your hard drive lost some space. At least that is what happened to me. When I took it to my techie buddy he checked it...his scan siad the drive size was 23.9 gigs...it was a 40gig drive...so the bad sectors were not even showing up in scandisk....once I got a new hard drive(120gig hehe ) everything was fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The culprit was the 56.64 nvidia gfrorce 4 drivers, I've since reverted to the 53.04 drivers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axeion</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been 323 days since i had to reformat my hard drive. Learned some tricks an havent had to reformat since.<br />
<br />
Read about virtual memeory an partitioning the hard drive into sections.So i partitioned mine into 3 sections, 1st one was 5 gig just for windows an programs that work closely with windows (like ontrack system suite 3 or nortan stuff).2nd one was smaller 2 gig section just for virtual memory.3rd section was for rest programs eq included.<br />
<br />
Best part about this set up is if/when windows acts up an cant be fixed i just nuke c drive , reinstall windows an drivers an my registry.The rest stay right on the hard drive .<br />
<br />
This set up also helps prevent hard drive thrash ( which wears out hard drives fast), but also cuts back fragmentation alot.<br />
<br />
Recomend partition magic if any one is gona try this , an system suite 3 (not 5 the new one ) for win 98 se .Both programs have helped me alot. Hope this helps some because reformating is a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have two partitions on every computer.  One is the &quot;backup&quot;, where i store the install applications and a drive image of the system.  The main partition is the c: drive.  <br />
<br />
Now you may ask, if i had the backup image saved, why not save yourself the hassle.  Frankly i didn't know what the issue was at the time and i feared the backup image had backed up whatever was causing the issue as well.  Had i known it was a simple driver issue, i never would have formatted.  <br />
<br />
What was happening is, everytime id run specific programs, i would get the kernel 32 error.  On top of the kernel 32 error, I would get a windows exporer error any time i would hit the close x on a window toolbar.  The third type of error i was getting were memory errors.  Programs were failing to unload.  I'd keep running out of resources even though i had 300 mb free.  This was getting extremely frustrating to work with.  With those 3 problems my first thought was, hmmm, virus.  So i formatted,  thinking i had something that wasn't being detected.  However, after 7 installs later and a clean scan, i realized it wasn't a virus issue.  Then when it wasn't a memory issue, i was pissed.  My thoughts are, if you download legit drivers that they couldn't be the issue.  They are tested thoroughly before they are released.  So you can see why my thoughts didn't go to the driver issue til the very end, after someone recommended that track.</div></div><hr />
