It works quite well; it doesn't take up much room, and gives you everything thing you need in the small amount of space it uses.  This is entirely thanks to Aviendha's Group/Player/Target windows, since I know hardly any XML :).  I just stole everybody else's hard work and made it pretty.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you can find the downloads and screenshots here...<br />

Credits:<br />
-The Player, Group and Target windows are from Aviendha.<br />
-There's a crapload o' stuff from T.King/Remelio, but I'm sure you can all recognize that anyway, so I won't list it all.<br />
-Hotkeys are by Robynn.<br />
-I got a few things from Mavarien's UI, including the background texture, the tracking window and probably something else I can't remember. (I think the tracking window may orginially have been made by Sean...if anyone knows, please let me know :))<br />
-I used Casa's mp3 window with the dancing girl in short-shorts, because those shorts are oh-so-short.<br />
-Maps in the Help Window.<br />
-The window_pieces_03 file was taken from Daellig.<br />
-Took the Compass Bar from Drakah.<br />
<br />
Think that's everything...if you see something in there that I stole from you, let me know and I'll give you proper credit.  If you have any requests...I probably don't know how to do what you want, but ask anyway; I'm sure someone here knows what they're doing :).<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />

Most of them I couldn't move.  I loved all the stuff you put together.. just wish I could move the windows around.. <br />
<br />
Or am I/Did I screw something up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuririnsama</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The resolution in the screenshot is 1280x1024, the .ini file is only set up to have the windows in the right places for that reso.  Like I said, I know ~very~ little about XML, and I think that to make the windows movable I'd have to have the sizeable option in the XML file set to false.  Judging from the skim over the chatwindow XML I did in approximately 15 seconds, I think doing that would mean that the chat windows would both have to be the same size.  Or they could have borders, but then they wouldn't be as pretty :p.<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can get around to trying it at some lower resolutions, but I'm not sure how well it'll turn out.<br />

It was ~way~ too big to be useful in 1024, even with some other changes and some crunching that made it less pretty :(.  I may make a 1024 UI at some point, but it doesn't look like it would be anytthing at all like the 1280 version.<br />
