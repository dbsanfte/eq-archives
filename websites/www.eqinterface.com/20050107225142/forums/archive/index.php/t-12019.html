<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nift</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the adition of the new Combat Abilities window I find I would like a new way to dispay the count down gauge timer. Would it possible to convert this to a digital timer?  The guage bar fills to full once a Disc is activated and unfills as the time passes.  I would like to instead make it set the digital counter to the max and count down.<br />
<br />
Since I am not very familiar with XML I am not sure I am explaining this well enough so I will try to draw and example.<br />
<br />
Disc Remaining<br />
____________   normal when no disc time<br />
<br />
Disc remaining<br />
||||||||||||||||||   Full bar right when started<br />
<br />
Disc remaining<br />
||||||||______  Partial bar after time has elapsed.<br />
<br />
Would like to change that to a simple<br />
<br />
Disc Remaining<br />
00                       normal when no disc time<br />
<br />
Disc remaining<br />
05:00                 Full time right when started<br />
<br />
Disc remaining<br />
02:30                Partial time after time has elapsed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know there are alot of limitations on changes so if this is not possible thank you for the info, but if it is could someone recommend what to change please.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the time.</div></div><hr />

All that we have control over as skin creaters is basicly inanimate objects.  We can move and place things there that do nothing until we assign them a predefined EQType that now allows that object to retrieve data from their hardcoding.  Currently, they only provided a EQType for a gauge, and in order to have a counting timer is a label EQtype pre-defined by sony in order to display the desired info.<br />
