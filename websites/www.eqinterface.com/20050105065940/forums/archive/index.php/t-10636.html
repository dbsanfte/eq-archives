<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bellena</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gave my first run at this new interface thing just this morning while they were patching the servers.  I did one of Drak's for my enchanter and it worked peachy.<br />
<br />
My two problems are this : First the one I DLed from Drak is fine except when I zoned my pet/stats window went black... and will continue to stay that way until I cast a pet.  Any way I can fix this? Here's the link to the UI.<br />

<br />
Second : I wanted a UI for my cleric and found one of XMY's.  I downloaded it, unzipped in my UIfiles for EQ and it did nothing but give me the colors of the UI.  Didnt change the boxes at all same old UI just tye dye colored.  Did I unzipp wrong? Do I need to rename a file like Drak's? Did I DL the wrong file? Heres the link.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can answer the second question.  What you downloaded was a color skin for my UI.  You need to download the main Xym UI files (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1232) and then install the purple tie dye thing on top of it.  Until I get the main UI patched, you will also need to go to the discussion thread (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3671) and download the latest patch (http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=56005).</div></div><hr />
