<br />
First, I would like to adress the users of my former skins. A HDD Crash a few month ago resulted in the loss of all <br />
project files of my old versions. Because of that, I decided to call it a day with UIs. Now I found I couldn't leave my hands<br />
of it. So if you have a zip file with an old StoneAngel 2.0 or 3.0 lying around somewhere, please tell me. Don't send me the file<br />
right away, send me an E-Mail that you have it. My E-Mail account doesn't allow much storage, so I don't want it to crash because <br />
6 people send me the same file. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is about the UI at hand.<br />
<br />
====================================<br />
          INSTALATION<br />
====================================<br />
<br />
Simply unzip the file to a new folder in the Everquest/UIFiles directory. Make sure it's not a double folder.<br />
Once thats done, rename the &quot;UI_Lysiander_10.ini&quot; File to &quot;UI_&lt;yourname&gt;_&lt;your servernumber&gt;.ini&quot; and copy it into your generall<br />
Everquest Folder. Then Start EQ and enjoy the skin.<br />
<br />
If you don't know your server number, simply check your existing ini file in the generall everquest folder. If you have never<br />
used the new UI before, load up eq, log in a charakter, log out again, go to your EQ folder and do a search for the name of<br />
the charakter you logged in with. The number at the end of the UI_&lt;yourname&gt;_&lt;your servernumber&gt;.ini file is your servernumber.<br />
<br />
<br />
====================================<br />
	      VERSION<br />
====================================<br />
<br />
While this skin is pretty much complete, Im sure it needs some minor tweaking here and there. Im also allways open for new Ideas.<br />
Currently im especially after feedback of where to put the Pet Window.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
====================================<br />
	      CREDITS<br />
====================================<br />
<br />
The target window and the Window Pieces belog to the Drakah/ Jysin UIs. They deserve the full credit for their work.<br />
The WC Icons and the Druid Epic scimitar shown in the Screenshot are not available with the UI, however, they can be<br />
downloaded somewhere at the eqinterface.com site.<br />
<br />
<br />
===================================<br />
       NOTES FROM THE AUTHOR<br />
===================================<br />
<br />
The basic layout is pretty common these days and since I like it I decided to use it. I was never a fan of changing <br />
things if they worked in the first place. <br />
A few things to be noticed:<br />
The Backround Pictures are locked to those positions. The UI is coded for 1280x1024 resolution and will only work in that<br />
resolution. While the windows will load in others, the backround pictures will be out of place. Because of this, it is pretty<br />
important you use the *.ini file delivered with the UI.<br />
Basically I suggest to use the UI the way it is in the screenshot. I will work in other ways, but you won't get the pictures. <br />
Currently, the skills window is not movable. I know how it can be fixed, but I'm too lazy because noone uses that window anyway. :P<br />
<br />
Well, enough of this, enjoy the skin. :o)<br />
