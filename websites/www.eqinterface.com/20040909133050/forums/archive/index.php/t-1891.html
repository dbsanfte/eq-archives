<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I wanted to announce the release of the GUI XML Creator for use with maps.  You can download it from my site at http://www.eqatlas.com/gui .  I've left it on my site to spare this poor site's download section.  :)  This is a Java program that will create a EQUI_HelpWnd.xml file (Help Window mod) that includes those images.  It reads the size of the images and generates the file automatically, so you don't need to know a thing about XML or creating these things for it to work.  You just need to know how to follow my instructions.  ;)<br />
<br />
The purpose of this program is to allow people to have a Help Window with a tabbed pane that will show images (jpg only right now) in the game.  Please download the images you want from my site or any other to use.  I do NOT want to see people passing around zipped versions of my maps, so keep that in mind.  I require that you still go to my page and download them yourself for your personal use.<br />
<br />
I've also set up a message board section for talking about this on my site as well.<br />
<br />
Download and enjoy!<br />
<br />
Version 1.3 Available since 9/22.  This fixes some sizing issues, and lets you put fixed-width tabs in a scrollable pane.  It also has some beta-level code for Voodoo3 users to see it correctly.<br />
Version 1.2 Available since 9/10.  This lets you resize the whole window, and corrects the tiny map problems in version 1.0.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The next version I make will have a &quot;scale images&quot; feature to make these things bigger.  Right now they're set to be the actual size of the image, and since most are narrower than 600 pixels, on a 1200+ resolution screen they start to look pretty tiny.  I'm still not sure, though, why the text itself looks so grainy on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">part of that is my scaling.. i reduced it from 1280 to 1024 for both file size and not to be rude to everyone who reads forums.. but yea... can barely read the text..<br />
<br />
also anyway you can make &quot;packages&quot; of the map jpgs.. (ie.. luclin cities, luclin outdoor zones, luclin dungeons, or Antontica, Fadyewer, Kunark, etc) so we dont spend 3 hours getting JPGs together?<br />
<br />
still an AWESOME mod thought!<br />

cuz there are those days when things are not going well that i just need HELP.. and and If i hit the help key and a /gucomic popped up!!!<br />

<br />
I'll think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you were eager to scale them ahead of my modification, you could go in and make adjustments to the &lt;Size&gt; attributes manually.  Basically you need to scale up the Size Attributes in both TextureInfo and Ui2DAnimation sections for each image, making sure they stay the same.  If you want to double them both to make it twice as big, that's fine.<br />
<br />
No plans for image packs.  I need people to keep visiting my site for it to continue to exist, so I figure I spent enough time making this little creation, people can spend the time to come get the images and make me 0.5 cents as well.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Help file is NOW in the UIFiles folder as EQUI_HelpWnd.xml<br />
<br />
that means it falls under the set rule of &quot;any thin int he UIFiles folder&quot;<br />
<br />
I was worried too but they patched it into the UIFiles in the last patch I believe.<br />

ps Muse, will try your suggestion..</div></div><hr />

<br />
worked, but there are 4 places you have to double the numbers..  sooo that should make it easy to write into the program to just double all incoming jpg sizes..<br />
<br />
Thanks again.. great Mod.. and yea.. I totally understand and support your need to have people surf eqatlas.com for the jpgs..<br />

I think your forray into javascript may inspire others to come up with windows that write themselves.  :)  I also will let you know that I will definatly swing by your site to DL whatever maps I need.  Heck, I've allready printed them all out.....hehe<br />
<br />
Can't wait to see the next version with scaleable images (I'm too lazy to change em myself....hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grygan</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like a great addition!<br />
<br />
I am definitely going to try it out tonight...<br />
<br />
Just one question: I plan to use pretty big (200 - 300 K jpeg) maps covering a whole continent. Would it slow down my system dramatically? Or only just when I open the Help window (which I can live with...)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your answers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grygan: huge images only slow down the initial load time (like when you click on the tab the first time).  After that it's fine.  I'm not sure if you had a huge number of them in memory if you'd see some problems, though.<br />
<br />
Tauros: you can't put them in other folders right now.  I'll consider that for future versions.<br />
<br />
Kudane: ya, I forgot about the other places I have to change it.  The coding itself is easy for the calculation, it's the user interface in java that's a pain to put in.  Did they get any better or worse looking when you did it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramsus</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you can create folders that hold a subset of maps for each continent. Yu would have to type /load kunark or /load fay   etc each time you want the differentmaps, but it does work.<br />
<br />
Map files do have a size limit. They can not be over a certain size to be used as a background (by size I mean like 512x512, not byte size.  As far as byte size goes, just remember that once you load a picture it is using up memory.  For me, 200k would work fine, but I can tell you, that will cause issues on some folks computers.<br />
<br />
If you want to make your own set of maps, I would recommend that you save them  all to a set LxW and use the same setting (16 or 32 bit) for them. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, lot of folks have the same ideas and some folks actually implement them, and other people just steal others ideas, relabel it and try to charge money for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grygan</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a problem...<br />
<br />
I dimentionned all my jpg files as 1600x1200 images, before running the EQAtlasGui program.<br />
<br />
But now when I open my help window I notice 2 things:<br />
<br />
1. The map doesnt seem to be 1600 wide... but smaller<br />
2. The map is distorted vertically: it looks like it is being squeezed smaller on the Y axis.<br />
<br />
Now i have looked inside the xml file generated, and all the sizes seem to be correct at 1600x1200...<br />
<br />
Waht is wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure why it's tweaked vertically like you mention, I'm assuming you kept the images' aspect ratios the same when you changed their sizes, but if not that could cause them to look funny.  If they looked fine when you saved them, though, then I'm not sure.  It should work correctly.<br />
<br />
As far as the images appearing smaller than they are, that is indeed strange.  I noticed that myself and have been trying to figure out why they do that.  An image almost 600 pixels wide that I used during my testing only filled up about half of the page in 640x480 mode, which doesn't make sense.  It's like that all the way up through.  I don't know why it does that, but when I get the scaling command into it, it should fix whatever it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramsus</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh..  I could tell you why it does that, but I wont. We spent alot of time figuring it out and getting it to work when we released the map mod.  pretty funny.<br />
<br />
Anyway,<br />
<br />
try 128x128 or 256x256 or 512x512 or 1024x1024 or 2048x2048.<br />
<br />
2048 is the limit I would use, and many folks have issues displaying even that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramsus</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To make this process easiar for folks, I have made a script that will automatically download the maps from EQ Atlas for ya.<br />
<br />
Here what you have to do:<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
I removed the script that downloaded the maps because muse asked me to. It seems he doesn't like someone writing a script that grabs his maps and cuts him out of making money when someone clicks on his page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mischief</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow Woody and Muse in here... how cool is that.  :D<br />
<br />
Cant wait to try this out.<br />
<br />
Oh and I've been half hoping a Gu Comics skin to come out.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The program by Ramsus is exactly what I do NOT want to see going on.  The point of this tool is to allow people who have gone to my site (or others), saved a map, and then use it in the game.  I'm releasing this as a way to help people out, not a way for my server to start getting pounded with no money coming in through ad views.  Please don't make me have to remove my program entirely, although I will if I see this happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramsus</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You mean you dont like that someone could make a script and take away any credit etc you should receive for the work you have done on something?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me suggest a middle ground..<br />
<br />
Muse, someone could/would/ and can write a script to grab only the maps... even if they dont use your VERY COOL MOD, they could do it..<br />
<br />
Ramsus, You can't Hold it against Muse that he wants credit and payment for the work he has done. Hits on his pages give him that on both..<br />
<br />
Sooo why not work out a program (java maybe) that will hit each page and pull the jpg from it.. that way both Muse is Happy, and map happy fools of the world are happy.. Cuz we get a &quot;pack of maps&quot; and Muse get 142 hits from every use..<br />
<br />
Kudane<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramsus</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just making a point. I have actually exchanged emails with Muse regarding exactly that.  The next version of the Mapmod is quite a bit more advanced and allows for folks to specify maps of their own. His map set is one I plan on pointing folks at, along with several other. There is a new program we are using that generates maps directly from the world files and those maps will be the default but you will be allowed to use the maps you want.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have removed the link to the script and all should be well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kudane: What you suggest would be fine, except that advertisers frown heavily upon fake hits, which is what that program would create.  It's simply not an option.<br />
<br />
I think actually that Ramsus is implying that he deserves, in some way, credit for the script that I created.  Feel free to take a look back through my prior posts to see that I've been working on this for a while, and I had been working on it prior to my first post, however the whole project was delayed until after my exams.  Ramsus is certainly the first one to put maps in a mod, I'm not denying that.  I'm just unclear as to the source of the apparent hostility for my creation of this application, and the lack of respect for my clearly stated request to not essentially hack my site to get maps.<br />
<br />
&lt;shrug&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You were also sounding like an ass. Which isn't ever a good thing, so I shan't say &quot;no offence&quot;.<br />
<br />
I realize you were simply trying to help, but the program you've made is a workaround to a system that muse has created for the exact reason of maintaining what he's built up over the years. Not only does it place a huge strain on his server, without the benefit of ad-hits, but it does take away a good deal of credit from the man. They are his maps, which he took the time to assemble, so naturally, he has every right to determine their use--If he wants us to whistle Dixie before we download them, then i'd gladly do it (i like Dixie anyhow ^.^). If you're unhappy with it, make your own maps. :mad: <br />
<br />
Mr. Grumpy says goodbye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vynre</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried the first map mod, while a GREAT idea, it was virtually unusable - you guys did amazing creating it but realistically it was difficult to use in game and so hit my recycle bin pretty fast.<br />
<br />
To be able to just load the maps I need is great have less to flip thru to get to the info I need.<br />
<br />
But my major point is that I am AMAZED that anyone would begrudge Muse for wanting people to go to eqatlas to get the maps.  Eqatlas is one of the most valuable eq tools on the web, has the best quality maps in one place that you could hope for.  Providing this service and trying to make money off it isn't bad, although I'm not sure that the site actually makes money because of how much bandwidth must cost.  Frankly, I really apprecite the site and that its been made available in game and I really don't mind paying someone who comes up with such quality work.<br />
<br />
If we want to keep people putting great information about EQ on the web, at the expense of their own time and energy, it's also really a good idea to support them if you can.  It's not hard to go to the site and download the maps, don't begrudge them this request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramsus</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im not saying in any way that we deserve credit for the script. None what so ever. That script is  all yours. All you did was automate the method to add tabs and maps to the userinterface. <br />
<br />
In no way did I attempt to &quot;hack&quot; you website. All i did was provide URL's directly to publicly available maps on your site. And automate the process of getting them. <br />
<br />
You asked me to take it down and I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Works for me, thanks for taking it down.<br />
<br />
Technically it's called &quot;leeching,&quot; but whatever it's called, I don't allow it.  Thanks for resolving it quickly, things like that can (and have) almost crippled our servers before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalthanan</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Technically called &quot;leeching&quot;?<br />
<br />
No, I think Ramsus' script merely illustrated how easily the average site that relies on &quot;content&quot; can have its main source of income removed by a very short and cleverly conceived script.<br />
<br />
I think things like this will eventually cause servers to be redesigned, and &quot;content&quot; to be hidden away from direct access by URL.<br />
<br />
A lot of places already do this for downloads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramsus</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">theres a very simple command you can enable that restricts this and doesn't allow folks to access http thru anything except a valid web browser.  This would stop programs, like my script, from just grabbing the maps and not loading the pages that generate ad revenue. <br />
<br />
Other &quot;pay sites&quot;  currently out there charge you to access their main site but have nothing in place to stop folks from sucking down their content (like item databases, etc).  For instance, the same script could be generated in minutes to download all the available files from this site and use it to set up another site. <br />
<br />
Like it or not,  it's out there. If this is a concern you or anyone else has, protect yourself against it. It's quite simple and worth the effort if you generate revenue from ads etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
About 20 people downloaded the script while it was.  Please don;t redistribute the script.  Muse has put alot of works in to his maps and he doesn't wish for his maps to be obtained this way.<br />
if you have already used the script to grab his maps, go to his site and spend about 10 minutes clicking thru to where the maps are. It won;t hurt you and it will help him.<br />
<br />
Have a good one.</div></div><hr />

Turns out I was not clear on how it read in the sizes and so had them coming out very tiny.  Hopefully this will make them big enough that people won't need a scaled version.

Great work. One request and it would be perfect, now you've fixed the size problem. Can you make the window sizeable as current;y when I get a large map I can't resize to see without scrolling.<br />

I figured out it would be something like that myself so after forcing the size to be 1600x1600, and still finding it 30% too small, I put 2048x2048 remembering a post by Psykorene about backgrounds, and it turned out to be perfect...<br />

Thanks again for your wonderful program Muse, and to Ramsus for your tweaking tips ;)<br />
<br />
The maps I am using are continents (I dont use maps online for every zone, I prefer to use the detailed paper version when I am in one zone, and be able to check on zone connection maps, or rough zone outlines when playing).<br />
They are available from www.geocities.com/mapmaster255<br />

The most simple way to have those maps is to get my mod that I just uploaded on the main download section. It will post the link as soon as my files are approved by Kudane and Dolby and actually put on the website.<br />

Then you will just have to grab my UIGrygan.zip file and either use my whole mod, or just copy the files<br />

Would it be possible for you to make it so the tabs dont get smaller than a certain size, when you have many maps?  For example, I have every map for Velious and Luclin in my directory, but the tabs are VERY tiny and I can not read the name on any of the tabs.  <br />

Is it possible to set a certain size on the tabs, and have a scroll bar to access the ones that didn't fit on the main page?  Does that make sense? =)</div></div><hr />

If you size the &lt;TabBox&gt; element so that it accomodates all your tabs at the size you want, you can then horizonally scroll to access those tabs.<br />
<br />
What I mean is:<br />
Set the &lt;CX&gt; of the size of &lt;TabBox&gt; to the following:<br />
<br />
(number of tabs) * (desired size of each tab)<br />
<br />
So for example, if you have 50 tabs and you want each tab to be 40 pixels, then you would set the size to 2000.<br />
<br />
As long as &lt;Style_HScroll&gt; is set to true in the window, you'll now be able to horizonally scroll to each tab. Of course this will also scroll all the contents of the window, but you can now have lots of tabs, while keeping all of them at a width that is readable.<br />
<br />
Edit: forgot to mention that the above only works if the tab box is not auto-stretched to the size of the window, that is, set &lt;AutoStretch&gt; to false.</div></div><hr />

The maps appear on the screen at their actual size, so if you are running at 1600 width, a 400 width map is only 1/4th of the size of the screen.  If that's not it, make sure you have at least the latest version, in the first version they were much smaller than they should have been.  I actually didn't make it so that the maps could be resized, I made it so that the map window itself could be resized.<br />
<br />
Aandiian: I saw Arista's comment.  :)  I have to check it out and see where it places the actual images in each of the scrolled tabs to see if that might work.  My fear is that when you scroll over a few pages worth and click the tab, the image for that tab is way back on the left.  If that's the case (and I'm pretty sure it will be), then I have to adjust the location of every map to fit under its tab.  The problem then is that now, for every tab you click, you also have to scroll because it won't be at a fixed position.  For instance, when you load it up, if you want to pick, say, the 4th tab out of 6 on the screen, odds are the map will fall off the right side of your screen so you'd have to scroll it.  Then if you wanted to pick the 1st, you have to scroll back.  I'm not sure the change would help very much.  I still think it's easier to just load up the maps you want before you play or, if you prefer, set up a couple of folders with different maps in them and /loadskin between areas.  The boat ride between continents gives you more than enough wait time to load a new skin.:D</div></div><hr />

Yes, if you simply increase the width of the tab window, the map will still be on the left as before. For me personally, I would say just leave the map on the left, instead of doing extra work to position the map under its tab. I don't mind scrolling back to the map, as long as the tabs are wide enough to be identifiable. This also has the added benefit of keeping the map in a fixed spot for people who only have a few maps. Of course that's just my personal preference; different people will most likely have different preferences. Maybe leave it as an option, so people can choose?</div></div><hr />

You could have hundreds of maps in the file, but they only get pulled into memory when you actually use it.  Other than that, though, it will be cool.  :)<br />
<br />
SupaThrax: as far as I know that can't be done.  What those pulldown windows do is hardcoded into the client, so you couldn't have it bring up a different window.<br />
<br />
MyWynd: not sure what you mean by &quot;different&quot; but, as Arista suggested, I will probably make a version where you can scroll the tab pane if you want to see more tabs.  It's still gonna be ugly, though.  My suggestion if you actually log in and have no idea where you're going to go and have to have every single map in the game is to make multiple directories for them and load them up if you need them.</div></div><hr />

I know when i try and look at the ones i have (mainly Warrens and Unrest) the right and bottom sides are cut off, and others ( OOT and IC ) are to big and cut off.<br />
I'm using a Voodoo 3 so i don't know if that has anything to do with it. <br />
I thought it said in the readme.txt that the program sizes the map to the resolution that you are using at the time but it doesn't seem to be doing that for me, so I tried making the maps smaller but all that did was make them blurry and the ones that it made a size that i could see, like the warrens, it cut off the right side and in unrest manor it cut off the bottom.<br />
I guess im just wondering if there is a way to fix this so they look right.<br />
<br />
Fao</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">09-13-2002, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faorna:  I think that problem is directly related to you using a Voodoo-based board.  My program makes an assumption about how you load up the images into memory, and that may only work on nVidia-based boards.  I'd be interested in getting more feedback from Voodoo users on how this works or doesn't work, and if nVidia users have a similar problem.<br />
<br />
I think what I'm going to do when I get time to make some changes is post up a voodoo-test version that sets the size differently to see if that helps the situation at all.  If you could post up a screenshot or send me one (please turn it into jpg or something small first, please, no bmp's) showing what you're describing, it would help me track this down.

Could someone else try this map?<br />
Thanks,<br />

I'm still not sure about the scrunched maps problem, although I honestly haven't had a lot of time to look at it.  Is it that every map is scrunched, or only one particular map?</div></div><hr />

For me so far it's only one map, the &quot;Lost Valley of the Dreadlands&quot;. It seems that the height of the map is twice what it should be as reducing the height by 50% makes the map look pretty good.<br />

<br />
Muse,<br />
Yes that worked...but I would think you would need to edit the xml file everytime you made a map set that included the LV map. Probably easier to just resize the jpg image.<br />
(Thank goodness it's not too vital a map).<br />

<br />
Conen: I think you're referring to the modification that Arista suggested a few pages back (at bottom of page 4).  I haven't tried this, but I think the size she's talking about is higher up than what you're showing above.  It's the CX of the TabBox element, so it would be above &lt;/TabBox&gt;, between the tags &lt;TabBox&gt; and &lt;/TabBox&gt;.  That doesn't exist in the files my program creates, so you'd have to add it yourself, where it goes is unimportant as long as it's in the TabBox group.  What it would look like is:<br />
&lt;Size&gt;<br />
&lt;CX&gt;2000&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
&lt;CY&gt;1024&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
Put into CX what you need the width to be to hold your tabs.  CY should be the largest dimension of CY for all the images in the file (if you're using all my files, it will 1024).<br />
<br />
Then change the AutoStretch within TabBox to false and Style_HScroll within Screen to true.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is all theoretical.  I haven't tested any of this, but I'd be interested to hear if it works.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if that will work. I've resizes the image to 307x256 (I think) but it still didn't display correctly.<br />

 There is an outside border that just does not need to be there. The only way I was able to get rid of it was to set the &lt;cx&gt; &lt;cy&gt; numbers so high that the bars went off the screen.

<br />
Hey Muse I luv your site and I luv the maps :) but I am still having a problem getting them to work in game.  When I sent you that Message before it was cutting off the maps, and I DL'ed the new version and that fixed it, and I can scroll down, but it is squishing everything (left to right) or stretching it( top to bottom).  Is there anyway to make the maps smaller to fit the screen or are you working on one?  BTW I am using a DooDoo...er I mean A voodoo3 :P and can not afford a new one yet ... I will try it on a different size to see if that works as it is I am on 600x800.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. no fancy picture... have not figured out how to do it yet... I know how to turn computers on... not much more :P but working on it :).. Thanx for any help I can get :)</div></div><hr />

Conen:  Could you post the section where you're talking about setting the tab size?  I'm not sure where you would do that.  I'm also not sure about the border or what you're talking about with that.<br />

Vandyl:  The problem is with the Voodoo3 card.  It doesn't load textures the way the other ones do.  Hopefully I'll get a chance to update the program to take this into account.<br />

 Ok not the Right and Bottom Borderer I am talking about are for the actual tab window.

<br />
I've put up the newest version of the GUI XML Creator to download on my site.<br />
<br />
Changes: <br />
-- Put in some beta code for those Voodoo3 users out there to try out and see if it works for them.  Let me know!<br />
-- Added in an option to put in fixed-width tabs of your own size choice.  A good number is 100-150 or so.<br />
-- Fixed some sizing issues with very small or very large maps.<br />
<br />
I want to thank everyone here for all the help on tracking down the issues and a big thanks to Conen for helping to work out the scrollable tabs.  I think I got it figured out and managed to get those pesky borders to disappear altogether.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Well the map does not seem squished... but for some reason it is still cut off.  I tried re-downloading the map but it is still cutting off the right sides and the bottom.  Anyone have any sugestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Vandyl,<br />
<br />
Could you post up a screenshot of the problem you're having with it being cut off?  I have an idea for what might be happening, but still not sure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, great, thanks Vandyll.  This is still stretched and cropped.  If you can, email me the EQUI_HelpWnd.xml file that you put in this folder (the one my program made) and I'll make some changes to it and email it back to you to try out (or maybe a couple of versions to try).  I'm also assuming you tried it with the Voodoo3 texture setting selected?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vandyl</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok Muse sent it to you :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have some bad news for Voodoo users.  I've been doing some tests with Vandyl and his Voodoo board, trying to get various combos to work.  It appears that Voodoo boards will never be able to show these things correctly, because of the way they load textures.<br />
<br />
I plan on tweaking the GUI so that voodoo users will not have their maps cropped, but they will always have them distorted.  What happens is that Voodoo cards are stuck with 256x256 texture spaces.  Not a huge problem, because they can allocate more than one to fit a larger texture.  The problem is that, in doing so, they stretch the texture to fit that multiple of 256x256 space (like 512x768 or 1028x256, whatever it is).  This causes distortion that I can't fix through any manipulation short of creating maps that all fit some multiple of those dimensions (which I have no plans on doing).<br />
<br />
Sorry for the bummer news.  Hopefully this doesn't affect too many people.</div></div><hr />

Verant stated that no mods can be made fomr the help window. It would be great if you could make this mod for actions window (as i have seen others, but not the greatest maps as you have:), but i dont want to get banned for using this mod cause it uses help window. Just a warning to all your people out there.</div></div><hr />

Im too lazy to download them all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boladornis</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">btw ill still use it till Verant makes the rule more obvious... Im sure u had to search for the rule.  Until it says this on my login screen or patch screen they arent gonna ban me.. or at least ill get a warning</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh... Please read the message boards before posting something like that.  SOE has stated specifically that putting maps in any window is fine.  The alteration of the html files that they use in the Help window is illegal, but this mod doesn't do that.<br />
<br />
BTW, please let me know if you have any problems with this after the last patch.  There shouldn't be any, but you never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lc3Burne</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great addition to a UI Muse, <br />
<br />
I was wondering if you are planning to attempt a dropdown box.. I've noticed using 'SidlWidl' there isn't very many options but under the browser, there is a button draw template and a BDT_Combo, But if you try to drag it over it doesn't drop anything (booo can't it be like visual basic? LOL) <br />
<br />
So I'm wondering since you've done this great job on what you have now.. Do you plan on attempting a drop down menu?<br />
<br />
Kunark    , Fv   , LOIO<br />
btnName, Zone, zone, etc.. <br />
(and when an option is picked it pops up on the right) some sort of... fvmap.visible=true) I'm not very good at visual basic or XML but I love to pick around a lil bit and see what I can do lol..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I spent probly an hour snaggin all the maps I could of your eqmaps site got them all too.. I believe and with a width space of 150-200 they all show up lol (scrolls to the right a long ways), Your site is the best source IMO for quality maps (although I wish they all of them had a legend on the maps for when your in game.. lol) &lt;-- LAZY <br />
<br />
I Enjoy the map program though and Thank you for the effort you've put into it!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muse</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Molz: are the map files in the same folder as the EQUI_HelpWnd.xml file?  They can't be in any other folder or in a folder within that folder, or it won't show the images.<br />
<br />
lc3Burne: the pulldown bars are not something that you can modify for your own uses.  Only certain windows have them (although I could suppose you could put them in any of the windows) and their functions are hardcoded in the client.  It's not like a web page where you can make them take you to someplace.<br />
<br />
Sorry, been busy for a while now.  Hopefully the utility is still keeping up.</div></div><hr />

When I move the cursor over the map area it shows the name of the map (i.e. dreadlands.jpg).  I have the maps placed approapriately I believe (eqatlas folder in my UI folder). I have tried adjusting it and moving it around without any chages.<br />
