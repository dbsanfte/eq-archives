<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenix182</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm completely new to this, and have been puttering around with existing UI's to get a feel for it.  My biggest question is &quot;What's involved in modifying a UI from one resolution to another?&quot;  For instance, I use a UI that only runs at 1280, but that's wasted on my 24&quot; monitor that can run up to 1920.  I understand I'd have to change the sizes and locations of the various windows, but is there any 'master setting' in a UI that says rather it's run at 1280 or 1600?<br />
<br />
It seems to me that if I increased resolution from 1280 to 1600 that the existing windows would appear smaller and out of alignment, but instead when I do that it completely hoses the UI.  That tells me that there has to be more to it than that.<br />
<br />
I'm also wondering what effect eq window resizing will have on these UI's.  For instance, if I were to run 2 instances of EQ side by side on the screen, a resolution of 1600x1200 would be very 'squished', but if I modified that UI to run at 800x600 (1/2 the screen size for each instance) it should appear normal and usable when multi-boxing.</div></div><hr />

So, could some nice mod delete this and I'll post in the general.  Thansk.</div></div><hr />
