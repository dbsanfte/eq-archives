<br />
Anywho... as I stated in my other thread (find it HERE (http://eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1296) ) I have made several changes to make my UI compatible with LoY and also to make some minor (much needed) improvements. <br />
<br />
I have but to make a few small changes (allowing for various color selections), then I will get it packed up and online here. But for the time being... have a look.<br />

P.S. If any of you are anxious to download a working copy of this, you may find it by clicking on the picture above, atleast until it's available in the download section here at EQGUI. However, please bear in mind that the site hosting the above link does have bandwidth restrictions as it is being hosted by a client company.</div></div><hr />

First of all, I somehow managed to 'head-shrink' the compass. I really don't know how I accomplished this, but I immediately fixed it. There were also a few cosmetic changes that I had on my list of things to do, but somehow missed them the first time around. <br />
<br />
I don't know when I'll be able to upload an updated version here, so for the time being, just click on the link in my previous post to download the fixed version of this skin. And enjoy.<br />
