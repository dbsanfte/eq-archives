<br />
I'd like on that has the exp shown in the player window. I'd also like the names of spells shown next to them. Another thing I'm looking for is the backpack section of the inventory to be shown but not the armor unless there is a way to change the armor slots that are pre-chosen. I also like when there is &quot;F2&quot;, &quot;F3&quot;, ect. written next to the corresponding group member.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much the stuff I'm looking for. If you know of a UI that has all of that, or just most of it, you'll make me a happy druid/enc ^^.</div></div><hr />
