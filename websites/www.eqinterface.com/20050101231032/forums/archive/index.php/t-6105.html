<br />
1. &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_BodyTintWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
2. Downloaded the file from Cairenn and unzipped into my Default directory<br />
<br />
3. Tried the new Thoth file - It crashes while I zone<br />
<br />
4. Tried the Old thoth file - It crashes whille I zone<br />
<br />
5. Try the old thoth file - updated with your fix. It crashed while I zone.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? And thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as suggested in the &quot;READ ME FIRST&quot; post<br />
<br />
POST YOUR UI ERROR LOG<br />
<br />
we can not tell you how to fix the problem from the symptom, we need to see what the UI is say is wrong..<br />
<br />
untill then, i would suggest not making random changes.. and deleting the EQUI.XML is a very BAD idea if it came with the mod.<br />
<br />
soooo post the log after you add that back in.</div></div><hr />

I am very unfamilier with this puter lingo and deleting files, so it will have to be dont in layman's terms. I have be searching for a UI since i started playing and this one is awesome. Any help for me to fix would be great, I DONT WANNA USE ANY OTHER UI....Tanuursk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kharzhoul</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - my first venture into custom UI's and I have spent several hours of dismal failure. Hopefully someone more experienced than I can figure out if the problem is (a) me [very possible] or (b) this mod.<br />
<br />
Any and all help is greatly appreciated, otherwise I guess I will go back to the custom UI. Thanks again for any help in advance!<br />

<br />
Check back.</div></div><hr />

Just to be 100% clear, you have nothing to be sorry for .. you spend your time making strangers kick ass UI's and we are all very appreciative of your work. With that said, it is a very good chance that due to my absolute lack of UI knowledge, that your UI works perfectly and I am the one screwing it up.<br />
<br />
Thanks again  =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thoth93</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, the ui is 100% operational again...<br />
<br />
A few side notes;<br />
<br />
I also took the time to replace the original ragebringer curser. If you would prefer to not use it please read the readme file for instructions on how to remove. I like it, so I put it back in.<br />
<br />
I also fixed the issue with the mysteriously disapearing pet &quot;stand&quot; button that would hide itself when you told your pet to sit down :) Sorry for the error. <br />
<br />
Download the new working version here... (replace the old version)<br />
<br />
http://users.starpower.net/winter-haven/thoth.zip<br />
<br />
Note: You &quot;may&quot; still need to add the three files Cairenn mentions here... http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6012 ... into your defualt folder. Just download her zip if necessary and then extract the three files to you DEFAULT folder. Not the THOTH ui folder.  Thanks Cairenn!<br />
<br />
If you have any questions let me know!<br />
<br />
Good hunting and thanks guys!</div></div><hr />
