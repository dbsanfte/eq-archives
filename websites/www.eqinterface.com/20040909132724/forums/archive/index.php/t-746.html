PS: Make sure you keep a detailed 411 on your changes. Would hate for VI to update wnd totally wax everything. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nibbuhlz</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks :)<br />
<br />
I have a separate folder with all graphics/xmls in it, so nothiing VI does will destroy it.  Only thing I'm worried about is them jacking around with how things work :)<br />
<br />
Also, just a thought...since this skin is so...GNOMISH looking :p i was wondering if people would want to see me do a skin fer each race...so far i thought of this:<br />
<br />
Gnome - Mechanical metal<br />
Dwarf - Heavy metal/stone/gems<br />
Wood elf - (duh) wood<br />
High elf - Marble/gold<br />
Dark elf - Dark marble, rough metal<br />
Ogre - crude wood, misspelled words, some skulls<br />
Troll - crude metal, misspelled words, some skulls<br />
Barbarian - Cold steel, wood, maybe some fur<br />
Erudite - ?<br />
Iksar - ?<br />
Human - ?<br />
Halfling - ?<br />
Half Elf - ?<br />
Vah Shir - ?<br />
<br />
oh well, like i always say, 'too much time on my hands' :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaprotu</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestions:<br />
<br />
Euridite: misty/foggy/&quot;etheral&quot; like thoughts, or clouds?<br />
Iksar - Bone/dragon scale.  Maybe just dragon schemed<br />
VahShir-fluffy pink?  j/k may tiger/leaperd/lion skined<br />
<br />
the 'er?' category:<br />
halfling - agri/farm based. plants/fruit/vegitables<br />
human - brick<br />
half elf - half 'human' half 'elf' - so brick and wood.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and the dark elfs should have some neon, maybe in the health/mana bars.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1)  I dont know if tihs is possible, but maybe replace the spinning man graphic in inventory with a picture of your char?  Not a standing still pic, but one that would like view it IN the inventory in like 3rd person or somthing.<br />
<br />
2)  As a druid, I would love to see those circles maybe be leaves, and the things that hold em up could maybe be vines?  <br />
<br />
3)  Finnaly, an actions window, or a good place to put it so it would be were it used to be.  Im used to going to hit sit/stand and stuff - even tho I do do /sit and /stand occasionaly :nana: <br />
<br />
Thats all, I just thought it would be really cool :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately impossible at this time :(<br />
<br />
2) As a druid, I would love to see those circles maybe be leaves, and the things that hold em up could maybe be vines?<br />
<br />
I'm planning on doing racial skins, with TD being the gnome skin (all tinkered looking).  The leaf/tree thing is exactly what I had planned for a wood elf skin.<br />
<br />
3) Finnaly, an actions window, or a good place to put it so it would be were it used to be. Im used to going to hit sit/stand and stuff - even tho I do do /sit and /stand occasionaly <br />
<br />
Yea, i gotta figure out tabs and whatnot, then i can skin the actions window.  Personally, I use Ctrl + S for sit/stand, find it easier than clicking stuff (I HATE the mouse, i use ALT + # for spells, # for hotkeys, etc etc.)<br />
<br />
 First I wanna say that you did an AMAZING job on that skin. <br />
<br />
Thanks :)  It was my first dive into XML, and turned out better than I thought.  Was a great learning experience too...</div></div><hr />

I can't use it now , but hope that soon you will make it useable in  1024 screenmode as well as 768. MOst of my sikins were made for 1024, so I won't change it over for this, but I sure would like to see it usable by more than just 768.<br />

And I'm hoping that the other  windows/icons also get that nice rounded look and feel to them...<br />
<br />
I'm still astounded by the mod, and can't wait to see it get completed.  oh, BTW.... there were a couple bugs in the UI I had to adjust, things like the group members' pet health still showing in the group window (as well as the player window), I just made the y positions negative for the pet HP's, and poof, they were gone.  the AAXP bar still shows on the inventory, but I did a simmilar trick to get that gone.<br />
<br />
Also waiting on the female inventory window, as I have a few female characters that the spinning male graphic just doesn't look right for them :)</div></div><hr />

Really nice looking UI, with great changes... could you do an alternate spell &quot;donut&quot; that looks like the one in this thread :  http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=909 ? the exploded one you did is too disturbing for me :p . <br />
<br />
Aye, I like that one too.  maybe rotate it clockwise about 8 degrees or so, so that the tootips don't overwrite each other.  possibly have an outer ring like the spellbook, and then a inner disk with the  spellbook icon on it?  then hook it to the upper right corner of the screen like you did the player and hotbox windows.  Hell, I might do something like that myself, as a modification of your mod :p<br />
<br />
Edit: I've taken the liberty of modifying the spell gem window to be rounded now (plus the hotbuttons are round too), a screenshot is shown under my post in the Released section for &quot;My totally redone UI...&quot;<br />
<br />
If Nibb likes the changes, he can have them, if not, oh well.  If he could make the grapics clearer than I did, yay :)<br />
<br />
Oh, I did try to make the containers look more like the inventory, however, due to their nature, you can't get the bottom picture to display correctly - containers shift sizes and gain/lose pieces without any way for me to compensate for it, from what I could tell.  Maybe Nibb figured out a way to go around this problem.</div></div><hr />

Top-notch job, wish I could help ya with it, but alas I'm not too great with graphics.  Maybe the XML side tho...  Or debugging? I knocked out about a half dozen bugs in the first rendition,  plus tweaked around a few things to make it more appealing to me (like the spell gem bar, and I made the hotkeys rounded instead of blocky)<br />
<br />
Circles are definitely the way to go on the design.  Are you breaking the image definitions out of the animations file, and putting them into their respective windows XML file now?  would make keeping this up to date with the latest patches/changes easier, and more modular for those people who want &quot;just the inventory&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
Oh, I think I just figured out how to get around that annoying little problem I was having with the container window:  have the done and combine buttons be the full graphics for the bottom section of the container, in pieces, so that it still lines up correctly if the combine button isn't there...   hmm... anyway....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had always thought of your donuts design being the &quot;default&quot; design, which is cool, but then to branch it out accordingly.  I'd be far more interested in a skin that was for beastlords than ogres, but I guess it would REALLY have to depend on what you have in store for ogres.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. copy the inventory XML file to your mod<br />
<br />
2. copy the graphics files for the inventory to your mod<br />
<br />
3. take out the parts that are for the inventory from the animations file, as well as possible stuff that is in the templates file, and place them in your mod's ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
That last part's the killer.</div></div><hr />

I definitly agree. I *might* be starting my shaman over as an iksar so an iksar ui would be awesome :nana: <br />
<br />
<br />
Im thinking either lots of scale textures with a dragonish theme, or a dark tribal design interface. <br />
<br />
I'd like a tribal kind of design myself, since I like shamans and ikkys :p  Dragons are cool and all but the tribal design would own it :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koraniz</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As an iksar, I completly disagree with skins or scales on the UI. That would just look weird. As Iksar, I pictures cracked, dull stone, maybe some moss; ya know, like ancient ruins or something. I also love the idea of a class based skin, though also as an iksar monk I dont think bamboo really fits (I cant really think of what would). If you REALLY wanted to put in alot of time and effort, make different skins for race/class combinations. A high elf cleric, for example, might have brass, gold or silver edges, where as a dark elf cleric would have onyx or obsidian colored edges. Just a thought ;) <br />

Oh, and killer UI, I cant wait for version 2.<br />

Also, just an idea (I know how time consuming this is... I'm doing a Necro skin based off of game graphics... probably be faster to just render than to clean out the background and stuff, lol!) Maybe do a realease with different models? Be kewl if you could extract the Iksar, ogre, troll, etc. models and make some kewl naked animations from those! Not that I'd really want to see a naked troll, but might be kewl idea for option releases  :-)</div></div><hr />

It really is just a beautiful skin. I think I may tweak it a little though, the color scheme needs just a little bit of work to make it all fit together better.
