<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kagetan</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just finished this today, I'll be uploading soon if I can get a couple little bugs worked out. It's exactly what the subject says: a music player window with vert-like button graphics. (Note that the windows in the pictures are shown using Vertebrae's mod, if you put it into another skin the windows may look a little different.)<br />
<br />
Here's some pictures:<br />
<br />
(full version, with progress bar and combobox)<br />

<br />
(compact version, took out combobox and progess bar to save space)<br />
http://home.attbi.com/~ryouken_kageru/music2.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
Included in the zip are both the 'compact' and the 'normal' window files. <br />
<br />
By default, the 'normal' (top image) music player window will be unzipped into your mod directory, but you can switch to the 'compact' (bottom image) window by renaming 'Kagemod - EQUI_MusicPlayerWnd COMPACT.xml ' (found in the subfolder called kagemusic\) to 'EQUI_MusicPlayerWnd.xml' and dropping it into your mod directory. (For example, C:\...\ Everquest\uifiles\vert)</div></div><hr />

Looks a great mod though :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was also wondering is it possible to put more than just the music buttons and lables and the such on that?<br />
<br />
Like can you toss on a casting bar, or lets say put the whole thing in a diffrent window?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could add a casting bar, item slots, other gauges and info to this window, but you can't move most of the objects from this window to another. The times labels, and gauge you could though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kagetan</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Changed link so it actually works.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chrysm</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read the readme file.  I extracted the entire archive to C:\Program FIles\Sony\....\uifiles\vert<br />
<br />
When I load my character, and hit ALT-K(even tried CNTRL-K) the music window doesn't pop up.  I had looked in the UIError logs and it doesn't say anything about the music window etc etc.<br />
<br />
I am using Vert 2.2 Meth.  What am I doing wrong?<br />
I tried copying the original EQUI_Music...xml over from the default dir to the vert dir and still no dice.  same thing with no xml file at all hoping it would try and get the correct one from the default directory.  Anyone else having this problem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make sure you have Sound turned on in EQ, and make sure that EQUI.xml (exact file name) in your vert folder has these lines in it:<br />
<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_MusicPlayerWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
           &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_FileSelectionWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
Put these right before the &lt;/Compsite&gt; tag in that file and you'll be all set.<br />
<br />
As, if there is no EQUI.xml/you fixed your XML, and turning on sound doesn't work ( this option can be found in eqclient.ini... Sound=xx), I would /bug it.<br />
<br />
Otherwise that should do it.</div></div><hr />

Thanks alot!  That was the problem =)  The EQUI.xml was missing these lines.<br />
