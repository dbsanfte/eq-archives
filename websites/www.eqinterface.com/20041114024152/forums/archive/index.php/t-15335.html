<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">soran</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has been a work in progress for quite a while. I started off with Ortin UI and modified it heavily. I guess I would now call it a minimalist version of Ortin with a few bells and whistles. I'm having trouble deciding where to put things in the lower left corner. So I thought I would post a pic here to maybe get some feedback as to how to organize things better in that corner.<br />
<br />
Ok so I went nuts and went back and made some substantial changes...<br />
<br />
Here's the new look. I'll be putting it up soon for download. I just have to iron out a few more bugs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Filamarie</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a really nice UI... I like the fact that everything is in one corner.  And that the HP and Mana are in big numbers.  But I would never use it because of a few reasons. if you could change these reasons I would defiently be using it.<br />
<br />
1) could you put F1 with the others ... so much easier watching your own health that way.<br />
<br />
2) have the pet's health next to or below members name.  this helps keep charmed and normal pets alive ... grouping with chanters where they use charm pets as major melee is a plus. Unless you already have this using the circles next to the name<br />
<br />
3) Having it so that you can read what spells you have mem'd (9 slots) this is bacause I usually end up changing at least 3 of my spells around often.</div></div><hr />

 My main suggestions are - <br />
<br />
Exchange the spell icons with the hotkeys. This way I can alt and see what spells are memmed easily. Spells in that vertical lineup, hotkeys horizontal.<br />
<br />
Also, if you could sneak in an extra health bar in the group window. Your health. Just makes it even easier to pay attention to six health bars right on top of each other than to have to look somewhere else for your own.</div></div><hr />
