The only question I have is about the chat window. In your original screenshot, there was a more stylized no-title chat window, but that didn't seem to make it through to the rest of the screenies or release. Is there a chance of obtaining that window code and its graphics to use? Or was it just a mock-up?<br />

Any chance you could stick the see thru windows in this ui like drakah has in his warcraft ui? <br />
<br />
The UI is pretty customizable.. you can adjust the transparency of any window by right clicking on it. Also the ini file doesn't *have* to be used, you can set it up any way you like, all the windows are movable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AloneStarwalker</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, its what i did for now, but gonna try and transfer the windows i am thinking off, and will post a screeenie later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The windows are rearranged to a layout that I am used to. I added a yellow cast bar to the target window. I adjusted the hotbar image to list the stats in an order I was used to. I added a breath gauge for melee where the mana gauge would be (just so it wasn't blank). I changed the compass window a little. I also adjusted the inventory slot backgrounds and made the class animation the autoequip box. Finally, I added the TGA and code from the WoW UI for the semi-trans chat windows so that I could use it as a background for the story, raid, guild, etc windows.<br />
<br />
There are still some things I want to do, but this is what I've done so far. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyrssi</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My latest addition...a new chat window design. Basically I took Drakah's Simplistic chat window and modified the border to reflect that of the inventory window. Here's a screenie:<br />
<br />
http://www.twilightguild.org/images/soesd2chat.jpg<br />
<br />
It uses the dark/light window background files to create the actual window bg (it's not that dark ingame). The minimize button would be a yellow rectangle and the close button would be a red rectangle (just recolored from Drakah's original file).</div></div><hr />

Can we get a percent on xp?  <br />
<br />
There wasn't really much room to do that because those gauges are so small (ala Diablo 2), so I put percentages in the inventory window. I figure most people just check their XP percent when they're close to leveling anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Missing HP/MaxHP numbers in 1280X1024 versjon.<br />

Cant live without it.<br />

Perfect spot would be to rebuild the exp/aa/endurance to fit the hp/maxhp.</div></div><hr />

something like this mockup is what I was thinking..<br />

<br />
http://www.twilightguild.org/images/soesd2targrp.jpg<br />
Target and Group windows. I used my chat window border for them (and the combat abil/pet wins), and made a few changes. I altered the con indicator and its placement as well as the font size of the target name (so I could see more of it) and the hp%. In the group window, I condensed the group HPs abit and added 3 labels. Top left corner is regular xp, top right is aaxp, and the middle is CurHP/TotHP.<br />
<br />
http://www.twilightguild.org/images/soesd2splbar.jpg<br />
Just a simple condensed spellbar that doesn't take up a whole lot of room.<br />
<br />
http://www.twilightguild.org/images/soesd2newsplhb.jpg<br />
I changed the hotbutton spell gems to look similar to the new spellbar gems.</div></div><hr />

Question...  How hard would it be to add the spell names to the right side of the gems?  I've seen this in a good many UI's and have grown more than a little used to it.  With the new icons makes this a little harder to use. ;)</div></div><hr />

Nice work, Soes, but without the HP/maxHP numbers (in the 1280x1024 version), and the lack of the bag slots in the actual UI itself without having to open my inventory, I'm content with your original UI, which has been my UI of choice since the original release.  And for that, you get a 'naner...  :nana:  :)</div></div><hr />

1) It has the Mana and Endurance counts in the inventory, along with Hitpoint and Mana counts on the bottom edge of the baubles (HP/MP gauges).<br />
2)  Fully compatible with the Omens of War updates, as of today...I've added the extra coding needed for the extra five buff spots and extra spell gem slot that are bought with AA points.<br />
<br />
Not to highjack soes' UI, as it is of his creation...just putting in updates that I've needed to get ahold of myself, as they've been patched in.  You can download my version HERE. (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3669)  As for soes' updated version, you'll have to hold tight until he can get it ready.<br />

Hopefully this will be of a bit of help to tide you over.<br />
