<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KelricStormwolf</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi... this is my first public mod... I've been messing withit quite a bit and I'd love some feedback. I intend this window to be modular, in the sense that all one will have to do to make it appropriate to one's class is comment/uncomment Pieces and possibly adjust some Y locations on gauges.<br />
<br />
And I decided it needed a little color ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: This would be the basic hybrid version, FYI, or what I would use with my Ranger... for Melee I (personally) would lose the Manabar and move STA and EXP up, for Caster I would lose STA and add Casting bar, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kweil</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO I think there is too much stuff.<br />
<br />
Alas your screenshot doesn't give all the info.  I'm not sure what the 0000/0000 or 000/000 is above the resists.<br />
<br />
Do you intend for this to be a general purpose MOD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KelricStormwolf</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, sorry... should have explained better. The 0's above the resists are HP/MaxHP and Wt/MaxWt, respectively. I used full sets of 0's to make sure I had enough room every which way. ;)<br />
<br />
As far as there being too much... I can see that. Of course, the default Window is fairly simple, really... I personally like to see (what I consider) important info without having to access my inventory all the time.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping it's general enough to be useful to a variety of players, yes, which is why I *tried* to make it as modular as possible (meaning, requiring as little XML changes as possible to adjust it for different classes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kweil</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I follow the KISS method which is why I think its too much.  I would get rid of the Stats and weight since the stats don't change that much and most people don't really have a need to allows know their weight.<br />
<br />
But thats just me, its your mod so do as you please :p <br />
<br />
p.s.  For anyone how doesn't know...KISS (in this post ) means:  Keep It Simple Stupid.  Which are very good words to live by :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitaru Sensai</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is nice for monks to see there weight and the ability to see it at a glance without changing screens is a nice change.<br />
<br />
There does seem to be alot but once a person was useto it. it would be a nice reminder that a buff dropped or a debuff was on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shainaen</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would love to use this Player window.   Where do i download it though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's perfect except for 2 things.<br />
<br />
1) Add an aa exp gauge and aa exp %<br />
<br />
2) Maybe it's just me, but I have a hard time seeing blue on dark colors like that. Maybe make the blue lighter?<br />
<br />
Other than those two it's great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelric</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks! I made some changes (including lightening the blue) but haven't had a chance to get back to it in quite a while. If I have time, I'll break out my laptop and upload a new pic. <br />
<br />
I didn't display the AA XP bar because all my characters are &lt;40... the original idea was modularity, where the user could switch gauges in and out just by commenting/uncommenting Pieces and tweaking the locations... not 100% that'll work as intended though, since it seems 4 gauges is as much as I have room for. Still, one could take out the Fatigue gauge and move things up... I'm not totally happy with it, but I may have reached the limit of compromise. ;)<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can't get a new SS up, and maybe even get the file uploaded for moderation (in which case it would be available by Friday, I'd think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onker</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a very similar mod out there at one point, and after reformating and reloading EQ (Decision to quit lasted 3 months :p ) I can't find it anymore. I'd be very interested in the mod you've got. <br />
 I like to keep an eye on all that info as I'm playing, weight, hps stats, etc. all mean alot to me as a Shaman. Nothing sucks quite like trying to run and then finding out yer encumbered just that little bit too much to escape.</div></div><hr />
