<br />
Xirin, when you save the TGA, make sure you have a transparent background and then save in 32 bit mode.  This image is 24-bit, which is the image itself.  The other 8 bits are the alpha-channel (the part that defines what is transparent and what isn't.)<br />
<br />
I don't know about other paint programs, but Photoshop will automatically make the alpha channel for you when you have a transparent background and save in 32 bit.</div></div><hr />

Anyone care to use that image for their new window selector?</div></div><hr />

Not only was it a problem with the lacking alpha channel, but also in the code I loaded just the size of the image, not 256x256 :) That would be why it was squashed</div></div><hr />
