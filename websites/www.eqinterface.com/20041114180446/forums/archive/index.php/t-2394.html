I have taken a very popular UI mod Called Vert (steel 2.0) and shaped it into what i think is a sophisticated and fully functional UI. This UI will work for both melee and caster types. <br />
<br />
1) Hot Keys (standard bank of 10)<br />
<br />
2) 20 inventory/armor slots, Vert has included a program called Ccake with his mod that allows you to put any combination of inventory and armor into these 20 slots without having to know XML code. It is very easy to use graphical interface and it is painless, it also works 100% with with my modifications.<br />
<br />
3)Player / Pet window self explanitory window with a player stat tab and pet tab<br />
<br />
4) Player window this entire box flashes red when in attack mode, it also houses vital stats, HP, Mana, Stamina, Large number HP, weight, etc..<br />
<br />
5) &quot;The 4 pack&quot; currently i do not have nice graphical tool to let you modify this 4pack but i will put explicit code in xml file for it to be simply modified by the xml illiterate. I currently use this 4pack for my pouch of quellios, as seen there is 1 inventory slot, 1 bracer slot, ranged, and ammo slot (currently used in this photo for easy access to mod rod for dropping during fight). You can modify this any way you see fit eg. Melee type; a quick weapon change area, have two inventory slots primary and secondary slots<br />
  <br />
6)Group Window Currently in the works but fully functional. I will be adding pet slots to the window with a % health for all 5 group slots.<br />
<br />
7) Buff window with 15 slots numbered<br />
<br />
8)Target Window also another project im workin on. I would like to get a Large target bar in this window for an easier visual on mob health.<br />
<br />
<br />
let me know what you think</div></div><hr />
