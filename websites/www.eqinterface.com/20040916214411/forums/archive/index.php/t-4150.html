It SHOULD work with any other skin out there, just unzip into your UI directory.  (And, I'm wondering... am I the first?  :D<br />
<br />
The buttons are from winamp, until I get around to drawing my own.<br />

Lemme know what you think!<br />

I want to change the text-buttons to graphics, I just dont have the time at this moment.  How are you futzing with it?  Just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked the graphical buttons, but not the layout. So far I've made a resizable music window, haven't actually put your graphics into it, but I'll post the XML here so you can see it.<br />

P.S. - So this code I'm posting is actually all mine, it doesn't include any of your work, but I plan to add your graphical buttons in eventually =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">11-20-2002, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The layout isn't bad, in my opinion. We could do with some prettier buttons, but those will do for now. But I can't stand that banana. I mean, really, does anyone not get bored with it anymore? :mad: However, you bring up a good point--this window offers a great opportunity to put in one of your favourite little animations to dance around. For example, I could easily live with this little girl: <br />

or this one:<br />

That's right..dance dance. You can even pretend they're dancing to the beat, even though they're really just mindlessly cycling through a series of frames. You could also attempt to make some pretty swirls, ala Winamp:<br />

<br />
 Sure, it's not really an AVS Preset, but it can be just as seizure-inducing!<br />
<br />
I really am serious about this, though, I'd love to see some of these translated to .tga so it could be played in the window, especially the first one. I'd do it myself, but i'm a lazy d0rf, and don't altogether know how. Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?</div></div><hr />
