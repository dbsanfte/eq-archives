<br />
I play a necro, and to make my life easier when I am on a raid or in a group.. Could a mana bar be shown below each group members name (like the pet bar) or when I click on a person and target then in my target window could a mana bar be shown below there name there as well? The reason I ask this, is as a necro twitching is a pain in the ass and since most people never let us know when there mana is low UNTIL its at 0m.. Being able to monitor mana via a bar would be soooo sweet. THink about it, being able to monitor a cleric's mana during a raid via the mana bar below his name. No more having to say in /group OOM or 10m etc.. Why Verant never add'ed this feature is beyong me.. <br />

In your example, you're acting as a healer for blue bars instead of red. It's probably the most honorable reason to want to see other people's bars, but twitch spells are vastly inefficient. I won't even get into a discussion on why I think this is a complete waste of your mana in combat. Let the greedy clerics use mod rods and watch their own mana.<br />

But hey, what do I know? If you want to see what others think about this, try the search function. I'm too lazy to hunt down posts and link them for you :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jile</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a necro too, and in a group situation I generally will only twitch when they're below 30% mana and I don't want to risk them missing a heal and the group wiping or whatever because I was being stubborn. Secondly, if you don't think necromancers should be twitching on raids you need hit in the head with a tack hammer.  If a cleric misses their spot in the rot, you're generally screwed. You could join the healer channel where the clerics are supposed to call their mana percentages, but that's largely just a lot of superfluous spam because clerics tend to not call their mana because they're afraid they'll miss their spot in the rotation.</div></div><hr />

There are two notable exceptions coming with the patch on 14 July 04:<br />
1 - Mana (yours) will be able to be shown as a number (both current and total, just like HPs)<br />
2 - Endurance (yours) will be able to be shown as a number (both current and total, just like HPs)<br />
As always, EQ evolves and in the future what you are requesting may be available. Unfortunately it is not available currently.</div></div><hr />
