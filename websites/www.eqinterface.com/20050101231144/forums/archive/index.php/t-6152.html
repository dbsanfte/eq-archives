<br />
Charactername_Servernumber.opt file<br />
<br />
  in my case the character name was nechron and the server number was 86 so for me it was:<br />
<br />
nechron_86.opt<br />
<br />
From the Everquest directory.  Once I deleted that file everything started to work again.  And I have not had a problem since.</div></div><hr />
