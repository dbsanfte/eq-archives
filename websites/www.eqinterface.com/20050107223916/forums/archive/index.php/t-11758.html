I also cant play Online games cause patchers and updaters don't work.Any Suggestions?<br />
Stupid hackers...I've always wondered why they do it. <br />
<br />
All I can think of is trying to access an online scanner, like one nortons provides, but i cant reach the site. If anyone knows a way around this, I would be extremely grateful.<br />
<br />
Edit: Rule out that last statement...anysite about viruses is automatically closed..please tell me if there is another way other than installing windows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
www.trendmicro.com<br />
<br />
If you can get there try the Housecall. Its a good free online scan, regularly updated with definitions etc., I've always been impressed with their products (I use 'em personally and professionally).</div></div><hr />

Hate to say it, but whoever made this is smart.</div></div><hr />

You just need to put the CD when your computer boots up.  You may need to go into your bios and set the CD-ROM to boot first if it isnt already.<br />
<br />
Just boot off the NAV CD and have it scan and clean. Hopefuly it will remove the virus.</div></div><hr />

Said it needed a floppy disk with a list of definitions on it, but mine did not come with that. I have Systemworks 2003, which has everything, just an FYI.

Especially if you have high-speed (cable) that is always on... UNPLUG it. Besides the annoying things that the virus is doing to your computer, it may also be communicating with the internet, accepting commands from a hacker, or even harming other people's computers and networks.<br />
<br />
Try booting in safe mode. If you have windows 2000 or xp, hit F8 during the startup process, and select boot in safe mode (not with networking). See if you can get to the task manager and add-remove programs that way. If you can you can start looking for the virus files or folders. You may even be able to start anti-virus manually and run a scan. If you still can't access any system tools in safe mode, you probably need to start thinking about reformatting. If you back up files, remember to scan the backup before you get it anywhere near your new install.<br />

<br />
try Dolby's suggestion..<br />
<br />
If you dont own Norton antivirus, spend the 30-40$ and get the CD.. then boot from the CD and the virus will be dormant (since your systems boot files are not being used) Norton can then remove it..<br />
<br />
Booting in to SAFE MODE will not get it. that is still accessing your system files, and the virus has put it'self where it.. sounds like the mblaster virus.. or at least the symptoms... see if you can right click and save this file here (http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/FixBlast.exe) and run it..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying that fix you posted. For some reason booting from the cd doesn't work, because it has no access to virus definitions, it keeps looking in the A:/ and I cant change this. Also I tried running antivirus from the cd, but the option is not given, and when i try to manually open the antivirus file located on th cd, it shuts down the entire folder.....<br />
<br />
Maybe the fix will work, if not I may have to seriously consider reformatting, even though it will take a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">when you computer first starts.. hit the DEL key to get into your CMOS setup... find &quot;boot order&quot; and make sure 1st is CD and 2nd is Hard Drive..<br />
<br />
its prolly set to A: Drive 1st and HD 2nd currently<br />
<br />
then you can boot from the CD..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This sounds slightly familiar... do me a favor. Do a search for a file called TESTING.EXE. There may be an exe and a txt file. Delete them both if you find them and then reboot.<br />
<br />
Kudane, there's no way to know if the virus will start or not in safe mode... depends on where it lodged itself. It is just another thing to try. He was able to run a virus scan in safe mode, which it sounded like he couldn't do normally... so obviously at least part of the virus was unable to act on the system in safe mode. Also, it sounds like what he is saying is that he is booting to the CD, but when he does the Norton CD is looking for virus definitions on a floppy. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are booting off the CD and the program on the CD is asking for virus definitions it’s possible you can download those from NAV's webpage and save them to a floppy on a &quot;clean&quot; computer. If you don’t know any one that can help you check out your local computer shops and see if they can put the latest virus defs onto a floppy for you.<br />
<br />
If you know the name of the virus your computer is infected with you can also look it up on NAV's webpage to see if there are additional steps to take to clean it. This would have to be done on a clean machine of course.<br />
<br />
Also if you own NAV you can call them up and get help too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx for all the advice. I did a search on Testing.exe, nothing. Gonna go on the other comp in the house and see if i can download definitions onto a floppy, sooner or later something has to work. Just gotta figure out how i need to put the definitions on the floppy.</div></div><hr />

        Sorry, this page is down and cannot be accessed, or it does not exist. <br />

Grrrrr, and on a working computer too(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thx, i'll pm u the email to my working comp, don't want you getting anything i got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thx for the definitions, i'll test them in the morning. Man I hope they work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if its in your MBR and NAV cant remove it (NAV should get it) you will need to  fdisk /mbr before you format the drive otherwise it will come back.</div></div><hr />

Then i scan whatever i saved to an isolated disk with a virus scanner....</div></div><hr />

Not the best comp man in the world</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I got the definitions but not enough floppies, gonna buy more tonight. then hopefully i can do that emrgency scan and see if I can find anything. thx archerphate for the defs i hope this will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have a virus that has caused you this much grief the best thing you could do:<br />
<br />
format C:<br />
<br />
Install zone alarm fire wall<br />
<br />
Install norton antivirus<br />
<br />
Never let any one else download on that pc to prevent allowing a virus in.<br />
<br />
<br />
All the work you have done so far is admirable...but it is time to break-down and format. Its not a fun thing to do but this your pc is essentially a restet and you will see everything that is put on it. This makes maintenace very easy since you put everything on yourself you can identify right away when something is going wrong and take care of it quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well I guess I have to, I bought a new set of disks, but they semm to be specific for AVG and I got Norton. nortons no help either, I can only get info how to make 2001 disks not 2003. Which means they probably wont work, I just have to burn my files I am sure are uninfected...and put save games on a floppy. I am getting FFXI soon :cool: and i wanna make sure my comp is clean to put it on.<br />
<br />
But before I do all that I'll try the provided norton 2001 definitions. After that, I give up:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright time to give up. The thing scanned for approx. 3 sec then said nothing was wrong. I have to reformat. Just gotta go online and figure out how to do it right and figure out what Dolby meant about &quot;you will need to fdisk /mbr before you format&quot;, cause I have no clue what the means and I don't want that virus ever again. <br />
<br />
Thx for all the help you all provided.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your going to re-install windows2000 or windowsXP just boot off the install CD and when it asks you what drive and partition to install it on choose to remove the partitions and then re-create one and then choose to format. Then continue with installing.<br />
<br />
If your going to re-install win98 boot off your win98 floppy and at the command prompt type  fdisk /mbr (http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=fdisk+%2Fmbr)  (wait a few sec) it will finish with not much of a prompt. Then format the drive and install win98.<br />
<br />
Now if your really paranoid you could try doing a low level format (http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=low+level+format).<br />
<br />
Then the first thing to install after you’re up and running would be NAV or some up to date virus scanning software.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just fyi with all of the above options all data currently on your harddrive will be lost. I just want to make sure you understand that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even with the partitions gone, theres a chance, small that it may be, some data may still lie on the drive...If you can, i'd write 0's to the drive then set up the partitions...Just me being overly cautious probably.</div></div><hr />
