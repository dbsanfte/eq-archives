<br />
so here I am announcing &quot;Project Coffee&quot;<br />
it will be a UI and forces you to think, it will be very distracting from the game itself, and now that I have figured out how to make colour changing gauges..  I will create colour changing backgrounds..  ~insert evil laugh here~<br />
<br />
well I hope everyone is enjoying Lunix_Pro, I have a few updates on the way, but the biggest will be after the November 20th patch. ( patch date heard from dev on test, not sure if a solid date or not )</div></div><hr />

<br />
and cream and sugar for cast spell and casting gauges<br />

I downloaded a fractle generator and am planing to use it to my some really psychedelic backgrounds and graphics.  I'll include a screenshot of some of the mexx3 fractles.<br />

hmm..  maybe I should call in 'Project Tripping'</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've decided since the playerwindow in Lunix_Pro is disabled due to redundancy with the gauges also being in the player( buffs ) window..  I shall put the Coffee project in the player window when I finish Service Pack1 of Lunix_Pro..  hope everyone thinks this is a good idea..  if not..  I will make a standalone version...  but it will take longer to do a standalone rather than a plugin.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steppin</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i told him he has to make one with COFFEE POTS and COFFEE mugs, and cream and sugar bowls for the gauges and windows <br />
&lt;grin&gt;   that way i NEVER have to leave my chair again to get my coffee when my cup runneth empty<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just thought I would let everyone know it's going to take much longer than I first though to finish this project.<br />
  after I got the research on how the human brain reacts to colours and colour changes, I had to rework what I had allready built.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While no one looks forward to the end of good things, I like to get them out in the open and out of the way.  just as a friendly warning   :D<br />
Lunix and all mods created by me will no longer be updated as of 4/20/04<br />
<br />
however Coffee will be added before the UI is closed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1/5/2k4<br />
<br />
that is the day I am putting Coffee into Lunix, delay is due to having SOE take a look at the mod.  The mod has a chance of causing epileptic seizures due to how the patterns and colours in the UI affect different parts of the human brain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">looks like a mass destruction weapon you are building here :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">¥oJimBo</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me try!.. Lol, need a good ui for the long nights</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm glad people are still looking forward to this long overdue mod to Lunix, however last word from my friends at SOE was &quot;tone it down&quot;  and if I tone it down anymore it wont have the affect I want.  So unless I can figure something out, I'd call this project &quot;dead untill furthur notice&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't get why your asking SoE anyway. They can't not let you publish your UI. You should just go on with it and put a warning on it. Also did you ask them just &quot;is this Ui ok&quot; or &quot;is this UI ok because I don't want people getting sick because of it&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I asked them similar to the second question.  The last version I sent them was to &quot;high risk&quot; as they say, I have a new one that I should be able to send them on the 28th.  So we are looking at a january launch of coffee, if the risk is &quot;medium or light&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the thing is every video game pretty much has risk to give people seizures. As a matter of fact I know every PS2 game booklet comes with a warning for seizures as well as EQ. <br />
At the very least I hope you offer all working versions at request after use of a public one. You probably already will but you can just put a warning on it too.</div></div><hr />
