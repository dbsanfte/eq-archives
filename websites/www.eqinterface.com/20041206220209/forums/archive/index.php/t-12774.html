<br />
I know that site hits are a big issue for you in that they can at times melt the server. Especially during periods like this after major client patches that generate massive UI failures.<br />
<br />
Is there any way that the downloads section can show which sections have new uploads without actually opening the section? Something like the forums do? <br />
<br />
I see theres an icon attached to the name of the section  Is there a way to make that change if say the Mimimalist Section has a new upload? <br />
<br />
For the people just looking for updates or something new an indicator would help immensely. Being able to see at a glance where new files are rather than have to open each and every folder to read the listing would not only save time on the site it would also reduce hits. <br />
<br />
Rather than 10 hits to Complete Sets looking in every sub folder you'd have just one or 2 for the sections with a new file to view<br />
<br />
Just a thought.  :)<br />
<br />
Keep up the great work.</div></div><hr />
