<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">... on posting my usual Patch Day thread.  I've been on the run since 7 am this morning, and am only just now getting back in the door (2:30 pm my time) to start work on it.  Bit more patience folks, and I'll have it posted.<br />
<br />
Again, sorry 'bout that guys and gals, but ... life happens. ;)</div></div><hr />

I really appreciate what you do and we have been spoiled silly with you always posting the fixes early in the morning. Theres no reason none of us cant wait a little while. Heck this is something you do with out even being asked to help people. We are lucky to have you. :)<br />

Thanks Cairenn for all the work you do for us. I tried going through the updated files and compared them to the old un-updated files and it can be quite daunting to say the least. A great many thanks for your contribution to the whole UI community. You are truly cherished!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the understanding and the kind words guys.  And Dolby, you are correct, no one has asked me to do this, and it's not like I get paid for it or anything, it's pure volunteer work.  The fact of the matter is, however, that I chose to take this upon myself to do as I know how frustrating it is when your favourite UI stops working and I genuinely like to help people too.  So, I would be letting myself down as well as everyone else were I to not get it done. ;)<br />

It's posted now. :)</div></div><hr />
