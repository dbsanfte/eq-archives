<br />
Second you might want to Find out if anyone installed a crappy little program called.... GameXP.  When you turn all it's optimizations off it trashes your DirectX.  <br />
If this happened just reenable the optimizations and everything will be fine.<br />
Crappy coding from the morons who wrote that program.<br />
But I doubt it since it's a business computer.</div></div><hr />
