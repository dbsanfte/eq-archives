I went on the chat for a bit and this guy was asking about why his name had to be changed.  Chat moderator was telling him that his name means a bad word in german, and there was nothing that could be done.  The guy talked about how he created the name in one of his own Roleplaying languages &lt;blah blah blah&gt;.<br />
<br />
Then the moderator went over a bunch of german, really annoying actually.  Then, he posted what I attached here.  Everyone was shocked.  I took a screen shot, and there was much rejoicing :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, with Freckleheist, I can see where the GM's coming from. Bit interesting to see they have the ability to post w/out sensors. Amazed he didn't send that in a PM. Would have been better then over the public channel like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what amaze me is he told that without auto censuring himself or trying to use an other word , better for a GM than this one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightWolf</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, that's why I posted it.  I was thinking, &quot;what is this guy doing, there are probably kids here&quot;  (of course they've probably seen it in game or elsewhere, but seriously.  They shouldn't post stuff like that, very unprofessional.  Although in it's context it isn't to bad but he still should have sent to him in tell</div></div><hr />

I'm not German, but have taken a lot of German classes and am currently in Germany, so two points that I noticed:<br />
<br />
First, &quot;du shizea coif&quot; means nothing.  lol.... &quot;du scheis kopf&quot; is probably what they were aiming at, but they can't spell - or sound out what they're trying to type (in German, every letter is spoken... so yes, spelling does actually make a difference).  (Again I'm amused)<br />
<br />
Secondly, far as I can tell, &quot;Freckle&quot; does not even exist in the language unless it's a slang term of which I'm unaware.  And &quot;heist&quot; is a conjugation of the word meaning &quot;to be called.&quot;  The word the GM said it meant would be &quot;Ficken&quot; something.... which last I checked, again, spelling is no where near.  I would really like to know where the GM got that information.  I'm guessing he doesn't have much more knowledge of German than I if: &quot;Near as I can tell.&quot;  How can you even call someone out if you're not positive about what you're calling them out on?<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp worth.  Going back to my hole now.  :)<br />
