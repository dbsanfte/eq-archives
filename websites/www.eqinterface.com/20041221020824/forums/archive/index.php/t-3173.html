You never see a store with a price $100... its always $99.99<br />

People seem to drive 20 extra miles for a sale on somthing that is only a saveings of $1 - $2.<br />

However I dont. I'm one that values my time and will pay the fair price and not spend tuns of time to get a small discount.</div></div><hr />

There is no reason to have to make a troll or ogre mule. The zone is weightless. If that's your main and that's who has the items in the bank, then either make a mule in a small race and hand things off to them or buy a shrink potion and use it before you set up.<br />

Most of the tards that do that 1cp - 1pp less pricing are the same idiots that would have set the price 5k above what it normally is.<br />
I've actually paid 100 platinum more for an item, just to avoid the people that set a price of 999pp 9gp 9sp 9cp... why would i want to create more change for myself?</div></div><hr />

Heh the only things i even set prices in gp or sp are things that i am selling for ONLY gp or sp =P  ya know the silly little things, like the plain hand drum ya keep in the bank for a CR when you are a bard... i mean you buy it at a vendor for 5gp something, so sell in the bazaar for 3gp just to get rid of it when you have better... LOL laugh if you must but i sold them!  hehehe =)  Or the Morning dew when i dont' have a whole stack just one or 2 ... ah, gimme a couple gold and you can have it frees up a whole inventory slot for me hehe... To be honest i think they should only allow one form of currency to be set on an item at all... like only silver or only copper or only gold or plat... that would be far less annoying.   Ah, well, that's my 2cp worth =P</div></div><hr />

Nothing worse than finding someone who is selling a product for a real nice price only to find when you arrive at the location a pillar. I feverently click around trying to find the individual and even looking up, to no avail. I cannot find the person at all. Why bother selling in the place if your not going to make yourself available for purchases. You send a tell to the individual (who just made a 'shout' that they have the cheapest items available) that they cannot be targeted and they dont answer your tells. This infuriates me to no end. Why bother even being there... :mad: <br />

<br />
hehe it's worth a sp or cp or even gp to me not to see a messy bazaar browser =P  My eyesight isn't the best so less clutter on the screen = eaisier time reading it, and not having to resize the price column width to accomodate that kinda stuff hehehe =)  As it is i change all the backgrounds on everything i have to plain black and set alpha to 100% for both normal and faded hehehe =)  So, yep, it's a bit irritating to me to see peeps setting prices 1cp or gp lower, or 1sp lower LOL.  Now don't get me wrong if the plat part of that price is significantly lower than the next one up i'll still buy from that peep, but yes that has kept me from buying from a person who did that... i'll buy from the person who is just selling at plat only over the person who sets their prices in that fashion.</div></div><hr />

nope nope... it's the people setting the prices and making it all cluttered looking, not the bazaar browser... that's just an interface ROFL!  much easier to read this type of thing:<br />
<br />
100p<br />
12000p<br />
400p<br />
350p<br />
<br />
than this type of thing:<br />
<br />
99p 9g 9s 9c<br />
11999p 9g 9s 9c<br />
399p 9g<br />
349p 9p 9sp<br />
<br />
(allowing for different variations on how peeps set prices there)   now at a glance, honestly...  which is easier to compare?  =P  the ui doesn't make it look like that, the peeps selling stuff do =P  LOL   either way, i'm still gonna peruse the bazaar for good deals anyhow... LOL just a little irritation to me nothing that really matters in the long run anyhow LOL honestly if it has that kind of price on it i just don't even bother looking at it so no big =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ReallyLongTypist</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, personally, and I don't mean to sound rude, both of those are equally legible to me... but what I meant about 'irritation with the UI' is that the UI ought to do two things:<br />
<br />
1. Provide seperate columns for the parts of the price to be seperated into: Pp, Gp, Sp and Cp.<br />
<br />
2. Allow you to provide price upper and lower limits... thus solving a great deal of the problem.<br />
<br />
Both of those would make it easier for those people having a hard time.</div></div><hr />

I straight out refuse to buy from anyone that sets a value in anything other than increments of 1 platinum piece, period. There's nothing wrong with the interface really, it's just the idiots that cause the clutter.<br />
<br />
There are some real asses in the bazaar. You know the types... price fixers, scammers, beggars... and those people that just HAVE to climb on top of you when there are 2 empty 'stalls' to either side.  A shame the 'Mens Public Restroom Theory' doesn't apply to the bazaar also. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is more or less a guarantee way for them to get a sale. If someone is selling for 20 plat, and for them to get a sale they sell theirs for 19p 9g 9s 9c... Yes it does seem ludicrous, but it does work. There are some (I know not you) who actually are looking for the best deal and to be honest, if it sells for one copper less it is in theory a better deal. The cheapest items usually sells first. I myself search for the cheapest item around. It is the way economics works. Of course then there are those who totally overflate the prices, but if your the only one selling it, then the benefit lies on the seller. Buyer Beware!<br />

This is something I have to totally agree with... you sit in an open area all by yourself and suddenly your surrounded by 3 - 7 others. Especially if your in the back area that isn't heavily populated (ie near the arena or very back). Whats with that??<br />

 Traders on standing on posts<br />
First off - their head and name is hidden in the canopy. So I used to have a ball running around bazaar levitating these guys.  The levitate had 2 results - first it would knock them off the pole and second it had small chance of taking them out of trader status.  No doubt this is why levitating traders got nerfed.  But why not just make the traders stay on the floor?<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding the pricing in Bazaar, the price column is actually centered.  By providing non-zero values to the other coins, the price stands out more in the lis compared to the others since most of us scan and read left to right.<br />
450p<br />
425p<br />
345p 5g 5s<br />
400p<br />
350p<br />
However, I do agree that anything under a plat difference is just silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing that most annoys me about the bazaar is when people just start spamming me with the eating/drinking messages. Really makes me angry because EVERY time I go there I get spammed with it. And I don't even know why. I mean they will all eat/drink eventually, you don't need to keep clicking. And then there are the people that HAVE to cast spells with huge spell particles, or bards always singing their songs. Then, about as bad as the spamming eating/drinking messages, is the /random spam. This one guy was sitting there next to me spamming everyone for no good reason. His only reason was &quot;What else am I going to do?&quot; I really hate people like that. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldritch_goth</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, heres the beef i have in the bazaar...<br />
<br />
So I'm working on trying to raise my jewelcraft, which I guess is still kind of low for my level.  Everyone keeps telling me i should sell the stuff at the bazaar to recoup the cash I invest in it. Good idea right? Wrong!<br />
<br />
For starters, every time i tried, i'd end up getting burried under other traders (/tell get your @$$ off my head you stupid ogre!) or i'd get spammed with lvl 16's asking for stuff they shouldn't even be able to afford at their level ( Blah says, 'Don't you have any platinum jewelry? that silver stuff is crap' ). The end result is that my trader's satchel just became an expensive container to keep my stuff in the bank, and i sell squat. I end up having to take a loss by selling to a regular merchant for just under cost :mad: <br />
<br />
And i agree, the 1199p 9g 9s 9c thing is annoying...if they are gonna be stupid and undercut by a small ammount, make it a whole plat instead of dealing with all that change<br />
<br />
One last thing...the only good thing i can see (for me anyways) comming out of the way the bazaar is set up right now is that maybe competition will get so feirce that i can get a crude stein for 5p :D  :nana:</div></div><hr />

<br />
THAT's the other thing I hate. I thought there was more but couldn't remember. Damn people. I use two different mules for bazaar, one on each server. Ones a dwarf and one is a dark elf. EVERY time I leave my computer on during an all nighter when I get back sure enough somebody's ass is all over my screen. I really wish I could cast grow/shrink outside of the group. I'd shrink everyone around me, then cast grow on myself. That'll teach the %$&amp;*^#@ to block me out.</div></div><hr />

    anyway just dont try to get that &quot;prime&quot; spot,  on veeshan it seems that 250 of the 400 people in the bazaar are trying to cram in the first 10 booths by each bank.   Take a stroll over by the arena or stables and always find plenty of room</div></div><hr />

Especially the outrageous ones: /ooc &quot;Buy Item XYZ from me! Only 20K, cheapest in the Bazaar&quot;<br />
Guess what? If I've got 20K, I know what I'm going to buy and I'm going to be looking specifically for that item. That's why there's a search option in the first place. So on entering the bazaar ooc's and shout's are off. Too irritating for my tastes. <br />
<br />
In Trader mode, it's always irritating to come back and find someone standing right in front of you. If I can't find an open spot for my mule, she doesn't go into trader. I don't go hijack someone else's spot. <br />
<br />
Another frustrating thing to me is the price gouging. I'm all for using your skills to make a profit, but I've seen high-level mages selling some of the really nice summoned focus items for 500, even 1000pp. To me, that seems a bit outrageous for a No Rent item. Selling them is fine, in my opinion, but at a reasonable price, please. These items help tons in raids, etc., and take time and mana, so I don't expect them to be free, but some of the prices! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melosa</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely. Mages are awesome (and very underestimated, in my opinion) and I would never want to cheat them out of their due. If I need an item summoned for me, I'm more than willing to pay for it, just as I would a port, or C3, or whatever. But 1K for an item that goes away after I log is silly. There are many other examples of that as well. I just keep hoping someone just accidentally added an extra zero to their price or something like that :)</div></div><hr />

This one merchant (which I hope was just playing around) was selling items that were mega overpriced. She (as much as I would love to print the individuals name, but I won't for the sake I dont want this individual flamed by people) was selling the lowliest of items (though not as lowly as fishing grubs) spider silks for 30p a piece. Now I was thinking okay maybe a mistake? Well I searched more, a Ranged item Razor Fungus Claws (which I have seen sold for as high as 1p--must be rather common) and they were selling it for 50p! Okay I thought... kinda pricey.. once again a mistake maybe (other traders were selling it for, at the time, 5g). Then perusing even further, I saw a claw, so I checked it out... hmmm a Burynai Digmaster's Claw (rather common item seen a few of those in my travels) usually sells for about 3p a pop... nope.. she was selling it for 5,000! In fact all her items were not priced less (minus the spider silk and Razor fungus claws) 5,000! And most of them were common items... Leather Tunic was selling for 10,000.. now thats gutsy or just playing around...<br />

Granted, he's gonna make the extra 15pp - but geez, at least give it to a different char!  I made the ring cheaper because most people who can use a focus I aren't necessarily gonna wanna dish out 50p... if you're not a twink, that extra 15p means something.  lol<br />

Anyhow... the biggest problem is - it's people behind the pixels, which means all these things will never change.  lol  :)<br />

The only way to get that item is to buy the trash in the way to get the stuff to scroll up.  This is Verant's crappy coding again....<br />

My 2cp worth..<br />

P.S.  I only carry 3 Trader Satchels because of this,  and I put the trash in the bottom satchel so no-one has this problem with my stuff.</div></div><hr />

Without a doubt... that is rather irksome indeed. I have had that happened to me so far twice. I just started my trader and this green clad gnome comes up and buys three items of mine, so I decided to do a check on the individual (which I normally do when people talk to me.. Always like to 'consider' and '/who' the people I'm talking to). Only to find that the individual has taken up residence as a trader.. So I have my friend check him out and Lo and Behold he's selling the same product for 30p higher... The nerve...<br />

In terms of these nitwits who sell items for 99p 9g 9s 9c, I make it a point not to buy from them unless their prices are MUCH lower than the next lowest price. I constantly destroy 100's of copper and silver when I get encumbered. Why do I need to save a copper on a purchase? It clutters up the screen and makes it annoying to read.</div></div><hr />

/blush...  I am (well was) one of those peeps...  I had NO idea that was the case at all...  Glad you mentioned it though, now i know why i try and try to look at their stuff and refresh the bazaar browswer which says they do have the item but i just can't find it...  I only have 2 trader satchels at all though.  <br />
<br />
Hey, has anyone else noticed that after you sell an item, sometimes things in your inventory are no longer listed in the bazaar?  I have to close out my trader window, move things around in the satchel(s) and then do the /trader thing all over again to have them show up... (i am constantly checking my prices against other peeps and whatnot, and while doing this i noticed several times that my items that i have are not showing up...  Has this happened to anyone else?</div></div><hr />

Guys, SPREAD OUT! <br />
it's a big zone, but you always see 10 people crammed in a stall by the banks, and completly empty ones in the back.<br />
If everyone would look around a bit before turning on trader, they would see that there's lot's of room out there.<br />
Ever tried to buy something from someone and after all the trouble of walking through the lag that that all people in one place creates, trying to sort out who's who, since all their names run together,  finally seeing, and being able to target a halfling who's part way in an oger's leg, only to find that once you click on them the right way, and get the merchant window to open, that the lag is soooo bad that you can't get your cursor to move to the item you want?<br />
<br />
meanwhile... my little mule is all the way in the back corner... all by himself.<br />
