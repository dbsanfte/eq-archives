<br />
      Ok I have been checking out this sight since the patch that enabled the New UI. I have seen ALOT of things that I would love to be using, is it possible to take a file from &quot;john doe&quot; and then the file from &quot;eddy&quot; and another from &quot;fred&quot; and combine them all into my own &quot;custom&quot; skin for my personal use? If this is possible here comes the really hard part. I have looked at any tutorial that i can find. And quite frankly soon as i get about 2-3 lines down im totally lost. When ever it starts talking about the XML, DOM, SAX and so on, im lost. Im not tring to program a skin I only want to take 3 sep. skins and combine them into 1. But knowing my luck that will be harder then making a skin from scratch. Oh well. If any of yall can help me with this it would be greatly appriciated. Thank you for your time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Download the ones you want.  Open the zip files and see what's in there.  If any of the files say EQUI.xml or EQUI_Animations.xml, you need to be careful if it's last update was before the 8/14 patch because it may not work due to the EQ update.  Also, make sure two pieces you want to use don't include the same file.  For instance, you get 5 pieces - some *.tga's and an EQUI_*.xml.... make sure you're not overwriting some other .tga's from another file you want.  (the *.tga's are graphics files and the *.xml are specific window set-ups [i want this border with this button here, etc])<br />
<br />
Create your own folder and copy in the files you want... the names of the *.xml files are usually pretty self-explanatory.  You can also cut and paste from an entire skin just the few little mods you want - a player window there and group window here.....  Again, just make sure if the .zip contains the same files as another .zip, you're getting the ones you want.  :)  Any file that EQ needs that is not in your custom folder, it will pull it from the default.<br />
<br />
Hope that all made sense.  Basically, it's all trial and error.  If something fails to load, or crashes EQ, there is *usually* a reason for it in your UIErrors.txt file in your EQ directory.<br />
<br />
If you have any more questions, just let me... us :) .... know.<br />
