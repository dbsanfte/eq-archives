I swear it's not malicious.  What's happening here is that Norton/Symantec are lazy and are the only major anti-virus manufacturer in the world that has not yet made allowances for locally run .vbs/.vbe files.  It simply sees that a VB Script is touching your local system and it uses the same level of security as if it were running via your internet browser (which would be a very bad thing) even though it's a local file.  I've emailed Norton about this and I have yet to receive a response.<br />
 <br />
Anyway, only Norton Anti-Virus 2000+ pops up with a malicious script warning.  McAfee, PC-Cillin, Thunderbyte, et. al. don't have a problem with it.<br />
 <br />
If it would make you more comfortable I'll send you the source code so you can see it for yourself.  I encrypted the final versions as an extra layer of security in the manner of making sure that no one could modify it maliciously and redistribute it.<br />
<br />
and I have tested the file. and it has no true virus to be found.<br />
<br />
If you truely find a file with a virus send me a direct email with the file name and category and i will investigate it further..<br />
