It seems no matter what zone I go to or what toon I try to level or what camp I try to lvl at, someone bigger wanting to pl a toon always runs little solo me out of it.  I know officially there are no camps, but c'mon; everyone has little spots they like to have all their own and to pull mobs at their own pace til the camp is broken.  Lately, I've been ksd, driven off, trained, any number of ways you can think of to hinder progress.  It's becoming frustrating and bothersome.  I do lots of things for ppl, I drop what im doing and cross four zones just to summon someone's corpse.  I spent 4 hours helping some little guy farm the stuff he needs for his noob armor quests.  I'm not an *******, I'm not a prick, but there are times in this game where the actions of others truly piss me off.  Anyway, enough said, my rant is now off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice rant Inokis, I've ran into the same thing in the last few months.<br />
  My approach is to stand there and not say anything nore move, and when they try and train me I just FD till they are done; after they are done with thier little trains that only end up hurting themselfs I stand back up an continue to watch them till they freak out or leave..<br />
  I offer this as a fun alternative to ranting to people who can't really help you anyhow..<br />

Granted there technically isn't camping, but if you have been holding a camp for a fair extended amount of time, the GM usually rules in favor to yourself.<br />
<br />
Make sure when you report you also petition immediately afterwards. I find this gets the response quicker as petitions are a booster to them. Every report/petition that I have done has been answered within 3 hours (depending the severity of the report - the three hours response was always to naming violations) I have gotten a response to a particular trainer within 10 minutes of sending in the report/petition combo. And the individual was immediately reprimanded.<br />
<br />
The more thorough you make your report and petition the more helpful it is for the GM or Guide to resolve the issue. And when the GM responds, I always tell people &quot;Pretend you are speaking to an officer. Be courteous and calm. You will get better results with kindness than with attitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm sure there will be those here that will say otherwise, but I have yet to have any inconsiderate GM respond to my reports. Good luck with your adventures and journey well!</div></div><hr />

This happens to me quite often.  In fact just today I had been playing my beastlord in DSP, soloing for relaxation, when I see a druid show up with some other toon /following him.  I was chatting with a friend, and as soon as I saw them I remember saying &quot;Got anything going on that I can join?  Some druid just showed up to PL and I'm going to have to leave.&quot;  <br />
This was even before I had even checked their levels and lo and behold, before my friend even got back to me there wasn't a mob to be seen that wasn't being DS'd to death by a level 21 cleric.<br />
Fortunately, this time my friend was forming a group for CoD and I didn't feel too put off having to leave</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathos</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is one reason why I try to stay in not too-populated zones.  I find Innothule Swamp and the Qeynos Aqueducts to be very soothing, as there's a max of 5 people in each zone lol.  Only problem is that when someone is there, they keep bugging you to join a group, and it's always a lvl 1 wanting xp.  They need to learn how to fight for themselves :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

However, I must say it's going on more now than in the OLD Days. I never believed in PL. All you end up with is a high lvel character with crap skills, and then wonder why your level 50--- can't handle the Mob. <br />
That's why I have joined &quot;The Few, The Mighty, The Solo Artist&quot;. I now ONLY Group with those I know</div></div><hr />

Tis why I solo in out of the way areas such as OOT and wierd places in the planes for my higher lvl char.  Any place hat is popular seems to have atleast one prick that thinks he is a bad arse and runs his mouth.  I know more than once I have handled this by challenging them to kill something WAY out of their legue...like Ran in HHK :D</div></div><hr />
