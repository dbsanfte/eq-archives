<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Horaxe</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my first actual Mod, aside from graphics work and coloring things. I wanted something to go along with the Player Window, I like to keep my screen as free and clear as possible. So here it is.<br />
<br />
Anorexic Window in Action (http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Nothing/fullsize/AnorexInv.jpg)<br />
<br />
To download a copy of the file, click here (http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Nothing/fullsize/AnorexInv.jpg)<br />
<br />
 If your curious, this is why I'm using such a bare bones inventory. I found this mod elsewhere on this site, and just changed the text colors to suit my own taste and theme.<br />
(This isn't what it currently looks like, I changed the text so that all of the %s are in white instead of the colors you see, but you get the idea)<br />
<br />
P.S. The Class Symbol is the Auto Equip Window in this mod as well BTW.<br />

:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smelly</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That Player Window is from Mafoo's Mods....<br />
<br />
Only his Group Window is in the DL section so far *wonders why?*, so here is link to where you can get it from Forums:<br />
<br />
Mafoo's Mods (www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=607)<br />
<br />
Be sure to send him an email/PM and let him know you appreciate his work *chuckle*</div></div><hr />

I've changed the Text Color's on the labels for mine, but other than that it's the same one he had a DL for. It's that window that made me decide to mod my player window in such a way as I have.</div></div><hr />
