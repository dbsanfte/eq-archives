Read this from the FAQ:<br />
1.) You need a active account to download files. When you registered for an account the webpage sent you and email to the address you gave to make sure it was valid and not a fake email address. You need to follow the directions in the email that was sent to you to activate your account. If you used a hotmail or yahoo address or one of the free email providers they many times mark our email as spam or they just loose the email all together (what do you expect for something that’s free eh? Hehe). So if you don’t receive the email with in 24hrs please send an email to activation@eqgui.com and include the username you registered with and we will manually activate your account.</div></div><hr />

Must be something on your end if you can not download. I would need more information on what your trying to download and the error your getting.</div></div><hr />
