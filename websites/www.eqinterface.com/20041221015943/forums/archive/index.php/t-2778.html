  Ok, so I wake up and enter the world today to traverse afar and take my girlfriend to school, and even farther to take her daughter to her school (darn newbies can't find their own way there! Oh yeah... we only have one car...)<br />
  (You are hungry!)<br />
  (You are thirsty!)<br />
  (You are out of food and drink!)<br />
  So I get them to their proper locations and decide I should visit the merchants and buy some drink and food. Unfortunatly I didn't have enough coin, so I wrote a check for it and went back home to feast. <br />
  Once arriving home, I ate my rations and continued increasing my skill in Philosophy... man, this takes way longer than it would in game! Bah!<br />
  So I'm all done scribing and getting ready to go see my teacher and someone knocks at the door... it's A_Landlord! Mind you, in the past I could simply Feign Death and she would go away, but this one had a key! I smile and welcome her in, but unfortunatly she's scowling at me and aggros on me about our animals.<br />
  (A_Landlord pierces you for 250)<br />
  (A_Landlord bashes you for 75)<br />
  She was killing me, so I had to flee. A nice drive will cool me down... sure.<br />
  (Your Raging Fury has worn off)<br />
  Ok, I go get my GF and tell her what happened and that the A_Landlord would like to speak with her. Fortunately my GF has better faction with A_Landlord than I do, so  we go to the castle of A_Landlord and my GF goes inside while I wait outside... I'm not stupid! This lady is like the friggin Avatar of Fear to a noob! <br />
  Unfortunatly, the higher gods (A_Landlord's bosses) have instructed her to strike down any offenders of leases, and we have to find a new home. Now I'm feeling like the Iksar did when the Ring of Scale took over Sebilis! Oh well... I'll just work on my tradeskills for the rest of the day and camp out tonight... maybe stuff will be better tomorrow!<br />
<br />
  (You have increased your skill in Posting! (253))<br />
  (You have been successful in making A_Thread!)<br />
