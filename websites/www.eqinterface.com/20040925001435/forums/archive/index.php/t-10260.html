They  made it so we can see someone elses pets health and name in the group window why not mana?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't believe this is currently possible, but I have seen things recently that would make me hold out hope that it is possible...  I'll repost here if I can find something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not possible. Most casters would definitely not want it to be possible. Think about it, you're a cleric, you've spent 50 or 60 levels finetuning your play, you know when you can afford to buff and when you have to save for emergency heals...and some idiot with a custom UI joins your group, and now he's bugging you:&quot;C'mon, you have 20m, that's enough for a Symbol! You're just being cheap.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that most casters fudge their mana reports, depending on the group they're with, or just give them infrequently or with explanations. This is because most melees and hybrids don't understand that 40m can be a near-emergency situation and that if your cleric or chanter drops to 20m the next mistake could kill someone.<br />
<br />
And hybrids...nobody needs to know a hybrid's mana! Only the player himself knows when it's appropriate to cast and when he should melee, when he should pull with spells and when with arrows, whether he can be the group's secondary Sower/buffer/healer or whether he'll have to concentrate on pure damage. Hybrids especially vary wildly in play technique, and the last thing they need is someone bugging them to &quot;play like the last ranger I grouped with.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Could calculate exactly how many heals I can pull out or buffs ect.  Much better than guessing with the % which is way better than guessing how much a spell cost by the blue bub method.<br />
<br />
As far as seeing everyones mana.  Would be good and bad.  At least some moronic tanks would perhaps listen for a change and not pull when the healer is LoM.</div></div><hr />
