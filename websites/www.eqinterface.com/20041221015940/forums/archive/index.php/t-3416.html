<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyste</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some days I can get to www.eqinterface.com and www.eqgui.com just fine, and the world is happy.<br />
<br />
Some days I can get www.eqinterface.com but EQGui just refuses to resolve This is not a 404: Page Not Found error... I mean it doesn't resolve like I typed it wrong.... but it's a bookmark.<br />
<br />
Some days it's the other way, EQGui works, but EQInterface won't resolve. <br />
<br />
Today, for fun, I tried rebooting a couple times. When I started, EQInterface was OK but EQGui failed. Then I rebooted and niether worked. Then I rebooted again, now I can get to EQGui but not EQInterface. <br />
<br />
I even tried a computer that's at my ISP, and I could resolve BOTH of them from there, but not from here...<br />
<br />
All I wanna know is... WHHHYYYYY?<br />
<br />
hehe<br />
<br />
It's extreemly frustrating... Especially when I can get to EQInterface and see the &quot;most recent&quot; posts at the top of the page changing, so I KNOW everyone else is getting here... and I just can't get it to resolve!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried that earlier today... it seems BOTH EQInterface and EQGui are the same server ( same IP ) and you can't load BOTH by using the IP address... you just get EQInterface.<br />
<br />
hehe bummer<br />
<br />
Yea I figure it's an ISP thing... but this is the ONLY site that I've ever had a problem with in the year I've had Verizon. But hey... it's Verizon, soooo... :P</div></div><hr />
