<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkVixen</div><div class="date">05-21-2004, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded the UI custom file for the complete set of blue tablets. I made a new folder in the eq dirctory in the file folder uifiles. I read the read me .txt but I don't know what an ini file is nor do I know what to do to put one in the main eq directory. I checked my eq directory and there isn't a file folder with an ini title and none of the files I looked at had .ini after them. I tried loading the new UI but even tho it tried to load I didn't get an error message or anything just the same default settings. If someone could explain that whole copy and rename the ini file and paste in the eq directory in simple terms it'd be a great help. Love the UI skins just wish I could load em =)Computer Illiterate! Need some info!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I've always done is make a folder in the Custom UI folder like &quot;Blue&quot;.  Unzip the download and move all the unzipped contents into the &quot;Blue&quot; folder.<br />
<br />
The custom UI is now ready for use.<br />
<br />
Try that...see if it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkVixen</div><div class="date">05-21-2004, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that's what I did too when I downloaded. I unzipped file and had it in a separte one, Don't have any subfolders tho =). Then I logged into eq, typed /loadskin, choose my custom from the list, clicked on load UI and it waited for a bit, my screen when blank, then all my default settings came back on. Don't know what I'm doing wrong...</div></div><hr />

Please post the information requested here: http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5231<br />

The ini file only holds the window placement. So if you have an interface that has special placements for each interface window the ini is important. Either way it should still load using the /load command and if its not there is something wrong and we need more info.<br />
