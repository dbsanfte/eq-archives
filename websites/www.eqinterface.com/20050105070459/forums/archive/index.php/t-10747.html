<br />
I'm looking for a patch for &quot;buffwindow-2&quot; by Geddine.  It's the number one downloaded UI, but I can't find a patch for it in the last month.<br />
<br />
My error:<br />
[Thu Oct 16 14:36:01 2003] [Line:77 Source:UIFiles\Default\EQUI_Templates.xml] Couldn't find class:item 'A_QMarkBtnPressedFlyby' reference in FieldParseItemOfClass()<br />

[Thu Oct 16 14:36:01 2003] Error loading skin: loading default skin instead.<br />
<br />
Does that make sense to anyone?  The Buffwindow-2 is the only UI I have in the folder I tried to load.  Thanx ahead of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look inside the xml of the window for instances of A_QMarkBtnPressedFlyby.<br />
<br />
Then make sure this is defined somewhere in the textures that came with the UI.  The texture will most likely be defined in the window your having problems with.  However they may also have added a textures xml.</div></div><hr />

No clue why you've waited for &quot;so long&quot; for Geddine to fix it when you could've done it yourself the day the patch was released. /sigh :rolleyes:<br />

Although I have programmed for over 5 years in HTML, XML seems to throw me for a loop.  I spent hours trying to figure it out, and decided it's not worth it (well, at the time the UI I liked worked, so no big deal).  Guess I will have to take time.<br />
<br />
update:  Ok, I got Geddine's buff window to work.  Thank you for the link.  I've never tried to do that... now... why can't I get Enoks_UI_sleek_v2 to work?  It doesn't have any of those files listed in it!</div></div><hr />

I did the repair patch from Oct 9, 2003 as recommended.  I no longer get an error, and it, &quot;Buffwindow-2&quot; by Geddine seems to be working as intended.<br />
<br />
Only problem is now I don't have any textures in my hotkey box.  The hot keys are there, they just aren't defined (they don't look like buttons, just flat grey).<br />
<br />
In my &quot;spell&quot; folder I have 3 files, &quot;buff.bmp&quot;, &quot;EQUI_Animations.XML&quot; (which I just edited with 9/9/03 update) and &quot;EQUI_Buffwindow.XML&quot;.  What would these three have to do with my hotkeys?  I can only imagine I've lost something in Animations.<br />
<br />
I've done a search for &quot;hot key images&quot; and &quot;hot key textures&quot; but I haven't found anything.  Thus I'm back to asking<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong??<br />
<br />
UIE reads... Leonne is a user interface error!</div></div><hr />
