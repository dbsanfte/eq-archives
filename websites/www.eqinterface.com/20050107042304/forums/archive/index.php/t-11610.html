<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Helkos</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I been a long term fan on Drakah till the latest changes on window borders. I play in 1024 x 764, and I am not upgrading my video card &amp; monitor just to run a his higher resolution UIs. Sorry Drak, 1024x768 is my limit.<br />
<br />
I downloaded &quot;KatnTKBeast-fixed&quot; today, to C:\Program Files\Everquest\uifiles\KatnTKBeast-fixed. Copied over the XML files from the 1024 folder, and copied the UI_username_servername.ini file over to C:\Program Files\Everquest, and renamed it to my UI, UI_Helkos_torvonnilous.ini.<br />
<br />
Ran up EQ hoping to see this ezquisite UI, only to have it error out on load. Could not load the skin with or without using the INI file.<br />
<br />
I am quite bummed. I did copy over the T King *new* Beast spellbook &amp; spell bar over to a former T King UI (Drakah's) and dern if I could not load it again either.<br />
<br />
I so wanted to load KatnTKBeast-fixed tonight. I might see if I can load it up in a higher (slower) resolution, and see if I can squeeze it down somehow, as I did with most of Drakah's higher resolution UIs.<br />
<br />
I'm sort of picky of what I use. I started using Drakah's UIs when he first started, posted on my website, and made only one modification to the cursor color. - I's still hoping for a bright orange cursor, as I need fast tracking of the cursor so it don't get lost in the background.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo... I hope she can post some sort of fix or tell me a different way to load her skin in 1024x768 resolution.<br />
<br />
HELP!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Despite the name, that series of UIs were last updated sometime in June of 03 I believe.  It hasn't been updated to work with the latest patches.  I know, because I used to use KatnTKCeltic-fixed.  I get the feeling that the creator doesn't play EQ anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Helkos</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took a year off, and was jazzed to be back playing a game with real content again. I was looking for UIs and wasn't even looking at the dates. I figured being away for a year SOE would stopped changing the UIs like they used to. I was wrong.<br />
<br />
This is one series I woulf of stayed with, as it brings out the 'beast' in me.<br />
<br />
Wished T King would bring more of the 'Spirit' series out. I tried his recent spell gauge &amp; spellbook out, but that makes the UI they in not load where they would of loaded before.<br />
<br />
Excellent graphics, just will not function. /sad<br />
