<br />
here is a screenshot from Sokol to show what the buff bar, and bard bar should look like as well as a replacement compass.<br />
http://www.technosapien.net/kudane/ScreenShot-1.jpg<br />
<br />
The compass was changed to correct an issue with the new TGA. a reworked compass with the red and green dots will be coming down the line, but this will get you back online with vert 2.2<br />
<br />
Please do not reply to this thread if it does not work... I will start a thread in the help section for that.</div></div><hr />

The new music note icon set fit in the TGA fine right below the old red/green dot compass from vert 2.2. so I merged the notes in over the old vert 2.2 TGA and viola it works in game fine..  I attached my TGA..<br />
<br />
This file is the working original Vert 2.2 red/green dot compass, updated for the 1/9/2003 patch.<br />

<br />
This is a universal release, we changed the color to orange.. which is not used in ANY mod, this is for 2 reasons.. <br />
1. when posting screen shots we can see if your using new TGA,<br />
2. since Vert is not really Sokol's or mine, we were patching it.. didnt want to make 4 or 5 patches last night.. we might try to go back and make patch as we can<br />
<br />
the important thing was to get the mod working.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well this does make it generic grey, but the first thing Sokol and I are going to tell you if you have problems is to download the patch if we see grey... as I stated the color change was too help with trouble shooting.. but whatever works for ya.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All that's really needed is the new Short Duration.xml file.  The rest was easy to fix, but I just can't get that window to show the spell buffs correctly.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Thankx for the quick patch.....<br />
I can not get the Shordurationbuff window to show up at all in vert mod...<br />
When I click the music note emblem on the selector window it depresses like a click but does not stay highlighted in yellow and I dont get a bard buff window.....<br />
I have tried Alt-E to bring it up but nothing happens there either..<br />
all other changes in the fix seem to be working fine...<br />
When I bring up the patched Mod in SidleWidl it does not show the EQUI_Shordurationbuffwnd at all. However when I bring up the Default folder in SidleWidl it does show the EQUI_Shordurationbuffwnd  also when I run the default UI in game I get the bard window.....can someone help me please?<br />
I am posting my entire mod so it can be checked...<br />
you can e-mail me if you like with suggestions at: tuoneves@einsweb.com<br />
Thankx again<br />

<br />
we are not currently supporting vert 1.1, with 4 versions (or 5) of 2.2 and the upcoming mod from Sokol and myself, we are to swamped right now..<br />
<br />
I suggest trying a new download of Neptune-PoP (or Nexium-PoP) and the patch attached above.. I have tested this on 4 machines and it works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skuma</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too am having an issue.<br />
<br />
The vert 2.2 with patch loads fine, no errors.<br />
<br />
When I depress the musical note, I get nothing.<br />
<br />
it depresses, but no buff box appears.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />

i'm a fan of 1.1 myself....do you think you can attatch the file or post ur xml for us =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, everyone dealing with a brown mess on their interface, so that you have no problems troubleshooting a few people's UI is a bit of an odd way to do things.<br />
<br />
259 downloads on my correctly colored TGA can't be wrong.<br />
<br />
I fixed everything in my UI manually except for the short duration buff window.. and I have no programming experience, maybe giving people the benefit of the doubt is the more prudent route,<br />
<br />
DOWN with ugly BROWN<br />
<br />
Great site</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greywain</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the Cannabis version and the colors dont match but it does work fine.   Is there a way to get the Short Duration buff bar right justified?  The Cannabis verison of the mod has the buff bar right justified and I would like the Short buff to line up with it, if you could also get them in green it would be great.</div></div><hr />
