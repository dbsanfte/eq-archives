Not to make fun Dolby (my spelling is the pits), but this is too funny!  eq 'widow'?  I think a few people feel like widows lately with all the patch problems. ;) <br />

Because people in those forums seem to be alergic to responding to questions. Theyre as helpful as rubber crutches.<br />

I too have had peoblems using EQW with my Sars UI even though it performs flawlessly with the VI windowed version. But like kopiwar I prefer EQW for several reasons and miss being able to use it. I've posted on the EQW forums several times and naven't gotten so much as a &quot;Hmmm Dunno&quot; in reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kopiwar</div><div class="date">02-03-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well right now, i'm checking out if EQW will work for me, ill leave an update when i zone... hope it works good</div></div><hr />

Your exactly right about the EQW forum and to answer the question, it's not and EQW problem. The problem steems from soe providing 4 different patches to be downloaded, and different people getting different flavors of the patch.  Repatch as neccessary and make sure your it's the current and correct patch.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">02-03-2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I simply re-mapped my key release in the SOE version of EQWindows, to Cnt-Alt-R (just as EQW) and I have no problems.. <br />
<br />
actually its nice, cuz when i click on EQ on my task bar to re-enlarge, I am already back in the game. no need to &quot;re-activate&quot; the mouse..<br />
<br />
<br />
and I too do this to check my magelo..</div></div><hr />
