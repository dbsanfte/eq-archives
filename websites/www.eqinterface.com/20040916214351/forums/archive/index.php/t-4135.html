It's extremely low bitrate and plays a flat tone for the last second of the file. When zipped the 6min.mp3 file is only 4 KB. I'm going to do a full range of MP3 files in the same format. Leave any specific time requests, ideas or whatever here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a superb idea :) only problem is you can't run more than 1 at a time- but then again you could put several different timer tones into 1 mp3 file if there's a cycle you do frequently I suppose</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice idea. I *would* use it buuuuuut....I'm afraid someday when I pull an EQ-All-Nighter it'll jump the living hell out me. :p <br />
<br />
Speaking of that, something like that happened to me a long time ago. I was almost asleep at the keyboard, even had my head face down on it, then BOOOOOOOOOM it's started raining and I didn't know I had my speakers that loud. Almost fell out of my chair! :eek: :eek: :eek: :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
and lol that fall out of the chair thing is funny, only because I think I have done that soo many times, especially when I am getting really drunk playing EQ and wam thunder freaks ya out bad.:) :nana:</div></div><hr />

Fortune and Glory to all!</div></div><hr />
