<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ÆÆÆÆ</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I guess it's got it's good points and bad pts. I suppose that it has a little of each. It's not very good, and neither is the renaming service of EQ, in my opinion. I wish the service were free, but it isn't, so only use it if necessary, I say.</div></div><hr />

Statement of opinion is fine, but &quot;flaming&quot; won't be tolerated.  It is possible to disagree (or dislike) without resorting to &quot;flames&quot;.<br />
<br />
Whether applied to each other, to SOE, or to this site, the same rules apply.  Keep it polite, courteous and respectful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I think SoE is adding any and every possbike feature to EQ people ever wanted that they can. With EQ2 coming out soon and other mmorpg starting to make the biggest threats ever to EQ's sales numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yet for some reason they continue to ignore the best money-making scheme they could use... If they would create and release a supported and integrated UI editing program... all of us would buy it. Well, at least all the weak people like me. =) <br />
<br />
This is of course yet another shameless hint to SoE in case they happen to read these boards.<br />
<br />
Charge 100 bucks SoE, I'd probably still buy it. Only if it's really good though... don't release a crappy one please.<br />
<br />
As for the transfer service... what I think would be really interesting to discuss is what this will do to the servers. How its going to effect the various economies. On some servers a weapon might be worth double what it is on other servers... and now you can make transfers of items. Could create some interesting situations. If I had a character covered in gear that is relatively cheap on my server, but is worth 100's of thousands on a different one... I might consider a round trip to get rich. Could become just a round-about and legal way to buy plat for RL money.</div></div><hr />

But I don't wanna start all over again, and try and catch up.<br />
<br />
But on  the making PP thing well I know an Argent Protector goes for 7-9k on kane bayle. Once I statrted a couple toons on other servers just to go to other servers and see what prices looked like, and the Protector was going for under 1k. So what you might see by this happing is more of a set price on items server to server. You may see alot of people making PP in the beginning, but I figure in the end it will just make a universal charge where the Protector will go for 3k on each server.</div></div><hr />

I heard concerns that guilds as a whole might do this transfer so they can become Uber_Guild_01 on SoandSo Server.  <br />
<br />
Not being a Zekker, but since coming to Stormhammer, I have ran into many that have transferred over the Stormhammer to get away from he constant mess there.  Now, this new transfer opens a lot of doors to PVPers to go just about anywhere and get Uber loots, transfer back to there home server and lay waist.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I like the idea but I really enjoy being on Stormhammer.  Yeah, more money for some options that are not on other servers, but the people I have met, the maturity of most is a factor in staying.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't the initial Xfer to Stormhammer come for free (well wrapped up into the higher fee for playing on the Legends Server)?<br />
<br />
I actually think its a Bad Idea to let people move back and forth between servers, if you move, you move, and don't get to go back... or if they want to go back, make it a little prohibitive to do so... like only after a few weeks months etc...  Me personally, being on a limited EQ budget (not RL) am happy slogging along playing my level 61 Iksar Shaman watching others pass by in levels from those races that don't have the penalties that Iksar have.  I play for the enjoyment of playing.  Or.. SOE could make it a RL money cost and an EQ money cost to swap servers... say... $100 in RL money and 500K PP to move.  I know 500K for some people isn't much, but I hardly ever have 5K PP in the bank.<br />
<br />
On another note... anyone mind posting the fees to xfer toons?  Since I have access to 2 accounts I'd like to move one of my alts to another account so I can have my main buff it and PL it up a few levels...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both accounts HAVE TO originally registered by the same person (in this case you)..</div></div><hr />
