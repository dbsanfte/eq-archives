But now when I log on, the MAIN EQ window (The one were we look in the world) is now moved to the upper left of my screen.. So the area where it was supposed to be is now TOTALLY black.. So the bottom and the right side are just BLACK with no EQ... But I can still have all the windows there, just no main EQ where you watch.. any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

When I load into EQ all is good.  When I use the Alt + Enter command to make it into a window all is good. When I hit Alt + Enter to go back into full screen mode though my screen shifts about 1 inch to the left so the left side of my ui is off my screen.  I have to camp to server select screen in order to fix it.<br />

If anyone knows whats wrong that would be great.<br />

P.S.  I tried EQ windows but didn't like playing with that.</div></div><hr />

If your running WinXP, I think I may have your fix. Simply change your computers Display Properties Screen resolution to 1280x1024 (right click on your computers background and select Properties). For some reason, if your running your normal computers window at 1024x768 or less, your computer will play games at that resolution regardless of what you have your games resolution setting at. As soon as I did this, my game encompasses full screen. Just another quirky thing of Windows. /shrug</div></div><hr />

Anybody have any ideas because my monitor doesn't go any higher on the resolution scale?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lothay</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently had to downgrade monitors from a 19&quot; tube to a 15&quot; flat pannel.  The change forced me to go from 1600 x 1200 to 1280 x 1024.   I started experiencing a similar problem. <br />
<br />
Essentially, any time I put EQ into Windowed mode (usually by acidentally hitting the Windows Key) Full Screen Mode was simply a big black box filling the entire screen.   Alt+Enter took me to a Windowed view and I could play, etc., but it was irritating. <br />
<br />
I run EQ and my desktop in the same resolution and bit-depth (1280 x 1024, 32-bit) so the size of the window elements (title bar, frames, etc.) were just using up valuable space.  <br />
<br />
To work-around this problem, I downloaded and installed WinKey Killer (see WinKey Killer Homepage (http://home.plutonium.net/~bjackson)).  I don't know what the other cause was, but you might try installing this, and changing the line in your eqclient.ini fileWindowedMode=TRUE to WindowedMode=FALSE</div></div><hr />
