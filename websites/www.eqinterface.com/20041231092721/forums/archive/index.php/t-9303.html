You can read the patch message Here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9307). there are only a few changed to the UI, and they added one new XML file for gathering CPU data.<br />
<br />
Let me share a little bit of myth about the &quot;data gathered&quot; SOE is gathering only data about performance, they don't care how your got your software, they are not &quot;policing&quot; for illeagal files, images, or music. You will hear a lot people tell you that they might be. That would be an invasion of privacy if they did it without your consent and pre-warning. Only the FBI, CIA, Local Police can suprise inspect you machine. I dont want to start a huge debate about this (because there are those who will preach just the opposite), I just want to put peoples mind at rest, that what SOE is doing with is exactly what they said they were. Helping build a better EQ..<br />

have a good day<br />
