I remember some time ago, as well as recently, here and there, of some having trouble with the Yes/No buttons on the little confirmation window (for no drop item looting, item dropping, AA/Adventure purchasing, etc). I believe I've found a fix. However, if you are uncomfortable editing INI files, I wouldn't recommend doing this.<br />
<br />
You will need to open UI_Charname_server.ini (In my case, it's UI_Karaab_rodcet.ini). There will be a section in there labeled [ConfirmationDialogBox]. What I did, was add the following lines to the bottom of it (above [InventoryWindow] in my case, your mileage may vary)...<br />
<br />
Width800x600=274<br />
Height800x600=200<br />
Width1280x1024=274<br />
Height1280x1024=200<br />
Width1024x768=274<br />
Height1024x768=200<br />
<br />
... after that was done, my ConfirmationDialogBox section looks like...<br />
<br />
[ConfirmationDialogBox]<br />
XPos1024x768=431<br />
YPos1024x768=272<br />
BGTint.red=255<br />
BGTint.green=255<br />
BGTint.blue=255<br />
BGType=1<br />
Fades=true<br />
Delay=2000<br />
Duration=500<br />
Alpha=255<br />
FadeToAlpha=255<br />
Locked=false<br />
XPos1280x1024=750<br />
YPos1280x1024=568<br />
Width800x600=274<br />
Height800x600=200<br />
Width1280x1024=274<br />
Height1280x1024=200<br />
Width1024x768=274<br />
Height1024x768=200<br />
<br />
... again, your mileage may vary, but so far, so good. My UI's confirmation box is smaller (about half the size) of the original, but this also worked if the yes/no buttons were up in the middle somewhere (which happened to me if I had more than 1 confirmation box open). I tested it with the default and it worked great.<br />
<br />
The above is if the yes/no buttons are visible, but do not function. Now, as for the smaller confirmation box, where the Yes/No buttons are missing entirely, look in your UI_Charname_server.ini file for a [PopDialog0] (They go up from 0 numerically) line. If you delete the whole section, from [PopDialog#] to the next line inside brackets (signifying another window), it should fix the problem completely.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer/Warning: Do realize, this involves editing files that are not friendly for the non-techie. If you perform any of the above operations, be sure to copy the file or save it somewhere else as backup FIRST, in case something bad happens. (Without looking like a blatant and shameless plug, my &quot;Velious2&quot; and &quot;Quartz2&quot; UIs here contain a smaller confirmation window within them and can be easily used on their own, but don't put them inside the default folder or they will be overwritten when you patch).<br />
<br />
How'd I find this? Well, was making casserole dishes and accidentally had two of them open, one I couldn't do anything with and decided to try to figure out how to fix it... and did<br />
<br />
Hopefully this works for anyone who is having trouble with the yes/no boxes.</div></div><hr />
