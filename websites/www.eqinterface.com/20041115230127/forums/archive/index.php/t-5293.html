<br />
I added the T.King icons just as personal preference and i put the Chat box on the left side of the screen.<br />
<br />
This is my first monstrasity that i made for Eq interface and as far as code goes i have some HTML exp but no XML so i just fiddled with Soes's UI till i got it to work for me.<br />
<br />
I have seen people download it and beings this is my first mod and not to sure of myself i wanted to start a comments section to make sure its working for those of you who are using my version.<br />
