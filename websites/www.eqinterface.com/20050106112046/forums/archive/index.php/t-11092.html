The buttons that are missing are several from the Window Selector (all that has been added since we got the Short Duration Buff Window), all that has something to do with drawing maps in the map window, and the indention that the charmslot should show, are all missing, or rather, the graphics for them are missing, the buttons are there.<br />
<br />
If I use default UI, all the buttons are there. But if I use a custom UI they are not. I even tried to make a copy of the default folder, calling it test, then loading that, still the graphics are missing.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a solution to this?</div></div><hr />

Those are the actual graphics, as opposed to the .xml files which are the coding files that define the various graphics.<br />
<br />
If you go to this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6589) thread, it lists all the patches, and which files were changed in each patch.  As you look at each of the patches, you will see that some have window_pieces0X.tga listed as having been changed.<br />
<br />
You need to compare each of those to the one of the same name that you have in your custom file.  Chances are good, from what you describe, that you will discover a lot of buttons on the ones in the Patch forum that aren't on yours.<br />
<br />
What to do about it?<br />
<br />
a) see if the author of your UI has released updated .tga files.  If not;<br />
<br />
b) you can delete the appropriate files from your custom folder, letting EQ pull them directly from the default folder; or<br />
<br />
c) modify your existing .tga files yourself.</div></div><hr />
