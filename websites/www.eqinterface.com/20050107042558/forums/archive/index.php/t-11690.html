With the patch today i was not able to do any of the new combat abilities, the window would come up but i could not pick any to hotkey.  Also i read your post about the attack indicator, and went into my playerwindow.tga, and noticed im missing that whole thing.  If you could help me out with this, would be much appreciated.<br />

As for the Drakahmain, that UI is no longer in use. The DrakahLegacy is what replaced that. As for the PlayerWindow, that should not affect the UI even though some code is not there.</div></div><hr />
