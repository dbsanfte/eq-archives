<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CamDog</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded the Cletic theme from this site from here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1931)<br />
<br />
I out it in its own folder, and loaded the game. I used the /loadskin (foldername) and it loaded all fine, looking great btw.<br />
<br />
I then downloaded a spell book, put it in, and it worked great also.<br />
<br />
my problem is when I try to put the enchantress animation in, then it messes up. I run the program it asks me to in the readme file (remmy.exe) and it loads, and says sucessfull. But when I logg in my windows are all messed up, half transparent and mission sections, and mixed up with original themes.<br />
<br />
Am I doing this right? I drop all the files from the enchanter theme found here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1854) into my current UI directory, and run the remmy. it seems to work ok? If anyone is confused and needs more info, just post, and I will take some screen shots of what I am seeing.<br />
<br />
thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please re-download the enchanter animation using this link (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1854), I'm assuming you may have downloaded it prior to the new install scheme, the newer install does not require remmy.exe, everything is handled in one step now, basically the installation has been changed to use Nullsoft's Install System, an awesome script driven setup that does not require additional system files to run, making it an easy one-step process, and it should not cause any problems with my Celtic UI, I've uploaded 4 class animations with this new system, the rest will follow soon, fortunately in your case the Enchanter class animation was one of the four I updated.<br />
<br />
I hope this works for you, if not please let me know, also I'm in the process of updating the Celtic UI 1.8 to version 2.0, it will have a lot of nice updates and enhancements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried the new beastlord installer with my UI (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2586) last night and it didn't work. It seemed to make a backup of the animations file, install the four graphic files, the makensis.exe, and the uninstaller in the correct folder... .but in game I still had the default animation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldisar</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i got pretty much the same result with the cleric animation. All i get is the default animation. Even tried to load it up a couple of times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What UI are you using?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CamDog</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used the new program you told me about, and if I am doing it right, still nothing.<br />
<br />
I had to change the default install directory to C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest\uifiles\CELTIC (folder name I put your UI in).<br />
<br />
All the newest versions of EQ purchased off the shelf put EQ in a Sony directory, just if you were not aware of this yet,.<br />
<br />
When I load the game, at least with the new one nothing crashes, but still no custom animation :( am I using the newest version of Celtic? maybe that would cause an issue? I downloaded this one (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1931) .<br />
<br />
is that the two I should be using? the Celtic 1.8, and enchanter animation 2.1 found here? (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1854) .<br />
<br />
thank you for trying to help me out, this is frusterating :)<br />
<br />
btw, your custom UI's are amazing, keep it up. On your next Celtic theme, put buff names next to the buffs, thats the ONLY thing I wish it had! other than that, its perfect ;)<br />
<br />
-CamDog<br />
<br />
<br />
btw, these animations go into the same folder as my Celtic Theme, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
edit<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It makes another folder inside your UI directory? I installed to C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest\uifiles\CELTIC and it makes another folder, Enchanter, within the CELTIC directory, is this correct? I tried to move the files out of the enchanter directory into the CELTIC directory and run the exe, but nothing still.<br />
<br />
If i have it install into a fresh new folder, lets say C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest\uifiles\Enchanter, then I can /loadskin Enchanter and the annimation will work, but without the celtic theme, just normal EQ</div></div><hr />

<br />
***Patch Notes***<br />
<br />
December 30th, 2003<br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: I've reverted back to remmy.exe, the script isn't working for whatever reasons with the latest Everquest patch, if you still have problems installing, please use the latest &quot;remmy.exe&quot; from this location: http://pub165.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31.showMessage?topicID=47.topic<br />
<br />
<br />
So re-download and run the install, but don't run remmy.exe, until you've downloaded it from the link provided, I'm going to update all the installs tonight.</div></div><hr />
