Paladins that MA really the spell gems and the Hot bank side by side due to high lag situations.    When I tank I am hitting Taunt, Disarm, Desist, Cease, Yalup IV all at a rapid pace (kinda makes me feeling like im twisting songs.)   The only UI that I could use in those situtations would be one that requires the least movement with mouse.   Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus why Disarm? Waste of time<br />
<br />
Yaulp IV is as near a waste of time as they come<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varigon</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Disarm is a huge taunt and seems to work better to gain agro then the taunt button itself.  Yalup IV also a huge taunt and gives a nice little AC bonus (every little bit helps.)   I group with a druid, cleric, and a wizard when I am just exp hunting.  Makes for a hard time when all three start chain casting.   We add a Monk with so much haste on him it is disgusting, which is another reason to get the extra taunt. <br />
<br />
Currently my hot key box is filled with keys stating who and  what my target is, Calling for assist, Disarm, Taunt, Bash, Attack, Range weapon, Lay Hands, and an announcement that Heal over Time has just been cast.   I could use another set of Hot Keys but in doing so I am back to difficulties in high lag situations.  <br />

Cairenn had one, the verision 1 UI, but i have been unable to locate a copy of it since the creation of the Ver 2.<br />
<br />
edited to include:<br />
This is just my style of Tanking on raid.  I do not mean to imply that the above UI is not a good one.   If it fits the style of tanking you do then by all means use it.  From what I could tell it really looked good.  It would just be difficult to use with my style of tanking and the Lag that I encounter if I dont have time to turn off the newer models.</div></div><hr />

Complete Feature &gt; Cairenn &gt; t.king based UI Ver 2 by Cairenn. ;)<br />
<br />
And yeah, it's *very* hybrid friendly, I am a ranger, after all.  But, it works well for *all* classes, depending on which options you snag out of the Choices folder.</div></div><hr />

Must have spellbar... give... give... give... ribbit! /tremble :p<br />

P.S.<br />
Make a reversed one too! :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rikari</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, for a Sword style spell cast bar, i always pictured the actual &quot;Gem area&quot; of it to be upon the scabbard with the Sword sticking out at the top..  Perhaps with the sword all the way in when spell book is closed, with an animation of the sword being drawn just enough to reveal a glowing blade or something like that... Im no graphic artist by any means tho, and until now, didnt really have a reason to make such a suggestion... But if anyone wants to undertake such a project, well.. 1- id prolly play my pally more, and 2- id have one helluva mod for em. <br />
<br />
That said, Ima major T.King Fan myself, and look forward to seeing some of the new mods in development, let alone using them, ESP the Druid Class animation. :P<br />
<br />
And to anyone working on the eq dev team, for the love of god, Hire Thomus already, let his eye candy / programming skills effect more in Everquest than just the UIs. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Disavow</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The eye candy is a major plus.  It gives EQ that little extra it's needed for a really long time.<br />
<br />
What Im mostly interested in, is the functionality.  A hybrid is unique in the fact that you need to have lots of viewable area, but still need tons of open windows for spells, hits, chat, etc.<br />
<br />
I am very interested to see what you guys come up with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Rik :)<br />
<br />
I also thought of centering the gems on the blade, but as you'll notice there are runed etchings along the blade that I didn't want to be obscured, I was iffy about it but once I got to load the working spellbar in-game, it is very awesome the way it is, hard to explain you'll have to use it to know what I mean, I will however review it further and most likely make a few variations since I would also like to see one with centered gems, in fact I may make a better sword.</div></div><hr />

No joke!!  You think think they might take the hint with as many tweaks to the UI as there are just on this site alone. <br />
