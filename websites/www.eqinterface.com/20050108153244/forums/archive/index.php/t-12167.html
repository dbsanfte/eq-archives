<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beaverkid</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. What is the name of the mod and provide a link to where its located on our site.<br />
 you already answered part 1 of this:What are the names of the mods, with this response &quot;The 6 i dled were razors, lila ranger, vert mod,slayer,night elf,rangerous, inifinti,and merskin &quot;<br />
<br />
For part 2:Provide a link to where the mods are located, this is how you answer: Find the web page you Dl'd the UI's(mods) from. This time don't click the link to download the UI(mod). Move your mouse cursor to the top of the web page. With your LEFT button, click on the web address shown in your web browser's address bar. (example: www.blah.com\something.html)  *Make sure the whole address is highlighted.   Then right click (press and release the right mouse button) on the highlighted address. A list of options will appear next to your cursor. Move your mouse cursor down and highlight the phrase &quot;copy&quot;. Left click(press and release left mouse button) to select copy. [Now everything highlighted is copied to your computer' clipboard] Now goto the web page that you are typing your post(question/response) on. Right click(right button), where you want the copied text/link to be. This time highlight and select(left mouse button) paste. This should paste the address you copied earlier. Congratulations you just copied and pasted, creating a &quot;link&quot;. That link will show whoever reads your post the page that you downloaded the UI or mod from.<br />
<br />
2. What steps did you take to install the mod?<br />
<br />
   Explain here step by step from start to finish the process you went through after you dl'd the mod all the way through loading the ui/mod in the game<br />
<br />
3. Go to your everquest folder and find the uierrors.txt file and copy and paste the errors. <br />
  <br />
  Find the file, open it, highlight everything listed ...right click and copy it all...then goto your post, right click and paste everything like in part 2 of question 1.<br />
<br />
4. Be as descriptive as you can. <br />
<br />
  Saying the mod doesn't work does not tell anyone anything other then it doesn't work...try telling more about what actually DOES happen when you try to load the mod...does your screen go blank, are the windows all wrong size, does your computer lock up, or anything along those lines?</div></div><hr />
