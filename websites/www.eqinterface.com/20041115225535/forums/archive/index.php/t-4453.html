<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugurth</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. Here is my first attempt at an original mod. This is a mod that takes the compass window and makes it into something usefull for monks. Any help with additions or corrections will be great. tell me what you think about it also. <br />
<br />
Here are some pics of it.<br />
Combat Skills Page (http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Cynwrig/fullsize%5cMonk+Abilites+Guide/Combat+Skills.jpg) <br />
Non Combat Skills Page (http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Cynwrig/fullsize%5cMonk+Abilites+Guide/Non+Combat+Skills.jpg) <br />
Regeneration Rates Page (http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Cynwrig/fullsize%5cMonk+Abilites+Guide/Regeneration+Information.jpg) <br />
Fist Damage and Delay Page (http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Cynwrig/fullsize%5cMonk+Abilites+Guide/Fist+Damage+and+Delay.jpg) <br />
Damage Bonus Page (http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Cynwrig/fullsize%5cMonk+Abilites+Guide/Damage+Bonus.jpg) <br />
Disciplines Page (http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Cynwrig/fullsize%5cMonk+Abilites+Guide/Disciplines.jpg) <br />
<br />
And here is the file itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">interesting, but I think I would rather use this in thefriends window ora windowIdon't use so commonly.  With sufficient skill, the compass far too useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugurth</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. What window does everyone suggest then. If it for monks, how about the spell gem bar? or maybe the pet window? any suggestions will be of great help. thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ratsnest</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it. Altho I agree with the other guy, you shouldn't have used the compass window. I use my compass all the time.<br />
<br />
Since it is monk info, and there is a cool timer button UI that uses the pet window.  If the spell window is doable, that'd probably be the way to go. Also, haven't seen, at least not yet, anyone else using the spell window.<br />
<br />
Keep working on it, its a cool feature. I'll look for updates on this.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caras</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also one thing to look at is if you play any alts this window will also be there for them. May wish to pick a window such as Notes, bug, gems...:nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deertag</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have a problem with alts. If I /loadskin &lt;whatever&gt; it's for that character only. If I log on an alt character, it uses the default UI or even another UI if I had loaded one up for that character.<br />
<br />
Maybe the trick here is, only download this file into a file reserved just for monk UI?<br />
<br />
I have seperate UI files I use for my druid, monk and shadowknight. I dont have any problems with crossover files. My mules all use default.<br />
<br />
With all that being said, I havent downloaded this file yet, but cant really see a problem<br />
<br />
P.S. - BTW, the only good banana is one topped with ice cream and a cherry  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugurth</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. am working slowly on upgrading this. Have changed it over to the pet window since the spell bar window wont come up for me as a monk. Am also changing the look of some things and adding some new stuff. once this upgrade is done, will start working on the AA skill pages. one for Luclin AA skills and one for Planar AA skills. they will take a bit, so might try another window. let me know what you guys think about it. thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All in all it's nice :)  can't wait to see the finished product.</div></div><hr />
