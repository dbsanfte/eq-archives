instead of when buffs are wearing off have the icon blinking and blink faster to tell us its wearing off in like 2 sec... MAKE the buff have a timer so it would look like this<br />
<br />

1.Speed of Wolf     | | | | | | | | | 2.15|<br />
_____________________________|<br />
                                                          |<br />
2. Ressurection      | | | | | | | | | 1.00|  <br />
_____________________________|<br />
<br />
etc.. where the | | | |  area has a filled in bar that is empting to 0 , and keep the buff blinking when it gets to say 10 sec left before it wears off ...    the 2.15 is obviously the minutes /seconds that the buff has left to be there before it wears off and make the numers match the graffic..<br />
<br />
Second,  This is mainly for bards The current spell gem system is great if your a caster and need to cast one spell , but for bards its the worst thing in the game. If you try to twist 3 song continusly you will know what i am talking about either you have hot keyed your songs to a macro or your fingers are killing you after 1 hr of game play...MAKE THIS:<br />
<br />
Add a special Bard only twist window, where what ever spell you mem goes to your normal gem container but you have the option to copy the same gem to a new window with lets say for example 6 gem slots or less. This window would have a stop and a start button , Then the bard enter s lets say selo acc, haste, mana song in the top 3 gems of the 6 slot special window. and hits the start button .. the bard will auto twist starting with the first gem in line.. obviously if the bard adds liek 6 gems then the 1st song would have ended by the time say the 3rd or forth one started like normal. this will save peoples mice , it will stop people from using third party macro programs just to play thier class and it will make more people think about playing a bard and make the bard class more enjoyable!  Todays system you can almost do this with hotbutton macros but there is no start stop button , and no way to repeat it w/o manually hitting the buttons non stop!</div></div><hr />
