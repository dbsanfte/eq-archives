After d/l the last patch recently, everytime I zone I crash to desktop! I came here and d/l'd the patch fix, then also updated my vert cannibus 2.2 to 2.3 and redid the pacth fix.<br />
<br />
STILL, everytime I zone I end up crashing to desktop. Is anyone having this problem or can anyone tell me what I'm missing here? Your help is appreciated! Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jessper</div><div class="date">02-01-2003, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To tell you the truth the crashing to desktop is not directly your UI, I have made a mod from a few diffrent ppls work and 2 of my friends use it(total of 3 ppl using it). I just gave them my only folder in the uifiles directory other than default (the folder of the mod im using) they didn't change a thing just put the folder in theirs just like mine is and loaded it. They both crash to desktop on zone but I do not, so its not exactly the UI but something diffrent, on another note changing to default will fix it so it has something to do with custom UIs just not directly. anyways after rambling on try this ... Explination to fixing your ui (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6012)</div></div><hr />

This makes grouping a huge burden, not to mention travelling.</div></div><hr />

(Related to and discussed in part here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6054).)<br />
<br />
The best thing I can suggest at this point is to check around over at the Technical Help (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Technical+Help&amp;number=3&amp;DaysPrune=20&amp;LastLogin=) forum at the EQLive site.  Sorry I can't give you anything better than that. :(</div></div><hr />
