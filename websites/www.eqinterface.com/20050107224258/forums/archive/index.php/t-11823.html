<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scrollith</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I dont know how to do any of this XML stuff, I just learned today about this site, but I have found lots of cool stuff! I am going to have a revamped UI for my necro now =-). I would like to learn how to do this stuff, such as the thing like the EQ Companion thing. I would like ot figure out how to get it in a certain window, and then how to make the tabs, and then how to add info to those tabs. Now, if someone could help me with that, I can make a &quot;EQ Companion&quot; thing for Casters, that has the spells, their levels, and their effects if I can do that. I would also like to do a loot by zone thing, it would take a year to make but I am sure everyone would love the hell out of it hehe. I also have a table for DoTs that I made for my necromancer. It has a list of all my DoTs, and then I have it where I can add in my BA, SCM, AE, AH, and so on. I would like to be able to make that appear in a window in EQ, instead of having to minimize EQ, and go to the folder where it is.<br />
 Another thing, I notice some of the timers, and EQ companion, and those things, can go into your feedback, or friends, or bug report.....if I put them there, will I still be able to see my friends list or report a bug ect.? Thanks for any info ya'll, greatly appreciated =-)</div></div><hr />

     Still a little bit confusing, and I am a lil scared to start messing around with things, but cant figure things out if I dont do em! If anyone can think of easier ways to get me started, please post =-). Also, if anyone wants to do any of the above posted ideas, that would be cool too =-).</div></div><hr />
