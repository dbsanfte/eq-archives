Though I wish I could put 'pen to paper' as the saying goes, such as thee. But I have to agree with Breaker... these are far too garish and gawdy. T'would be good for those of the neon and tech look. A good attempt though.</div></div><hr />

But like I said before, I wish I were able to make XML editings (sp?) to upload rather than just postings... A great many apologies if it came across wrong. Good luck to you my friend...<br />

Even the greatest of artists are disliked by someone =D. Not sure what the XML statement was about, but just since it seems to me not everyone is sure about compasses, it uses no XML to make a compass look different it is just a simple image file.<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting to you all.<br />
