Two: This was not leaked<br />
Three: To do it for yourself, create a char and keep clicking on the race names until you get a window with nothing in to pop up.<br />
<br />
The races for Berserker are as follows:<br />
<br />
Barbarian<br />
Human<br />
Ogre<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathos</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh ho ho.. Dwarves with Berserker! And Beards! ...why don't they make any of the good combinations... IMHO, I think every race should be able to be every class. Even though that would mean that every city would be huge on acocunt of having 12 guilds. But hey, they can do it right? Just make it so everyone starts out in the same city.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah those class's make sense. Any class thats very large since one of their special ability's is to throw large objects, objects much larger then dwarves...They could make dwarves berserkers but in concept they would suck dramatically compared to say an ogre. I imgaine they would be able to throw stuff slightly larger then their selves (in concept), so dwarves would be throwing objects a strong man could while ogres and trolls would be chucking small cars.<br />
<br />
Of course they've been pretty good at giving choices at both ends, like trolls would excel at the throwing but dwarves would excel more at 2H weapons (berzerkers other specialty). But in end game it doesnt mean jack what race you are except for maybe some special quests, and that little more regen you would get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh if only EQ worked like that!<br />
<br />
The Sambata throwing boulders are, I imagine, gigantic, and yet, gnomes can wield them.<br />
<br />
Besides, there ARE throwing axes and various other smaller tools. The best weapon to throw is one that is balanced. Throwing boulders and meteors is good and all, but it really makes absolutely no sense, in EQ, and IRL, which is why you rarely see any sort of 'large' items. Shissar fangs, shurikens, shattering hammers, etc, are small things.<br />
<br />
I don't see a berserker as someone who would master throwing. I see a berserker who would run into the fray, go &quot;RAAR&quot;, kill lots of people, and probably die doing it. However, for a berserker, they should incorporate a special &quot;Boromir rule&quot; (anyone who's seen/read the Two Towers knows exactly what I'm talking about).<br />
<br />
When you go purple, you become invulnerable for the typical DA duration (18 seconds), and have perpetual Mighty Strike and some sort of positive damage modifier. This ability? Rage. Sounds a bit like the warrior rage, but warriors don't seem to be the type that would go berserk. They seem to be more like moral (or immoral, depending on the race), well-trained soldiers, not feral beasts unchecked by society's bounds. The DA effect would make the berserker invulnerable, but like DA, they wouldn't be able to be healed. In fact, they won't be able to be affected by ANY positive spell effect that would involve the alteration of HP or endurance, thus filling the berserker's role, while making him an effective DPS class.<br />
<br />
The beserker's entire point, then, would be do deal INCREDIBLE burst damage, but die doing it at higher levels were resses aren't a problem. At lower levels, however, the berserker should fit a role similiarly to a monk, but a bit tougher, and simply use the Rage ability as a sort of emergency tool.<br />
<br />
Berserkers should NOT start in town. They should start at the first newbie zone (Butcherblock, Commons, Innothule, etc). I imagine them to shun the cities, and not very well liked back home either (apprehensive to glower, depending on race).<br />
<br />
Then again, what do I know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well think about when you get all pissed off, you start thrwoing random crap in the general area of where your at. I imgaine thats what their thinking is, but plus they get a weapon so after they throw some random crap at the mob they start rushing at it swinging their weapon of choice all over the place. Be cool if they got like a flurry type thing but also have a chance of hitting allies because their just going NUTS! And instead going &quot;critical&quot; like a warrior should have some mode where they become invulnerable for a couple of seconds like you said but instead of more damage they get more haste. Prolly the easiest way to explain how i see a berzerker would be, just see yourself fighting along side &quot;The Hulk&quot; but not as huge or as invulnerable heh.<br />
<br />
Also would be cool if they got some sort of &quot;forage&quot; but instead of food they foraged rocks and blocks of wood to throw.<br />
<br />
In any case I just hope they just dont copy a monk or warrior then tighten a skill here and loosen a skill there. One thing that would be quite new is if they worked completely off the new attack sysytem, no auto attack.</div></div><hr />

I've always found that auto-attack is really effing boring. The foraging for rocks isn't a bad idea. Will they do it? <br />
<br />
No.</div></div><hr />
