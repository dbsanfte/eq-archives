The &quot;A&quot; also fixes the recent compass issue..<br />
<br />
As of 2/16/03 the following colors are done<br />
<br />
Cannabis<br />
Ocean Spray<br />
Pepto*<br />
Neptune<br />
Nexium<br />
<br />
Click HERE (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=1029) For the screenshot of Cannabis with all repairs to see what it looks like now.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Pepto is a new Hot Pink theme that my wife insisted should be made for the women out there.<br />
**Crystal Meth is being removed, it is only a slight shade different that Ocean Spray and with Neptune and Ocean Spray out, there is no real need for a 3rd shade of blue. and it had the least downloads, less than 1/4 of Ocean Spray and 1/2 of neptune.</div></div><hr />

I may not gett o it till this weekend, which is close to the LoY expansion release, so we will see. <br />

I can verify also on my system that the compass is reading 45&amp;deg; off of plumb.  I also verified that the graphics line up as you showed here ... but the compass in Ocean Spray is not lining up properly.</div></div><hr />

These are all normal errors. by that i mean, its all the items that we dont have in the folder and its pulling them from the default folder.. not sure why the compass is coming up off 45%.. will look into it further.. it may be certain zones that its not coming up &quot;plumb&quot; but the graphics are as centered as I can make them...<br />
<br />
attached is a 2nd shot showing both the strip and the guide are centered on the older image... still have no idea why its coming up off by 45%</div></div><hr />

Yep ... I verified on my system that the strip is lined up in the graphics files too.  But in the game it is showing up misaligned.  I have a compass that works in another version of Vert ... but it doesn't have the left and right overlays ... could that be part of the problem?</div></div><hr />

not sure, may be... it may be shifting the whol thing off center...<br />

I've had that happen.. I had to realign it with the true north spell..<br />

<br />
Other than that one little thing, I applaud your work, good job, and thank you for the effort it took.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jentraal</div><div class="date">02-16-2003, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so then how do we get this alignment problem fixed?  I'm not squeemish about editing text files.  I just don't know what to change.  I see a bunch of numbers in the compass.xml file... do i mess around with that and subtract 45 from every one of them?  will that work?<br />
<br />
I LOVE  this version, but the only thing that's irritating me is this compass. I can't play the damn game with it being off 45° all the time, even though I know where I'm going.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can find that in the other files listed in the vert category.<br />
<br />
ALSO!!!<br />
<br />
COMPASS IS FIXED!! Re-uploaded current version with &quot;A&quot; with compass fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">02-17-2003, 12:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jentraal: It's not an xml problem.. It's a graphic problem.. To fix it you would have to open up compass.tga in a graphics editor.. Then, you have to move the whole compass strip to the right 24 pixels... Then cut 24 pixels off the right side and paste it on the left side...<br />
<br />
So that it looks like this one:<br />

Just let me know and I can pack it up and get a copy to you guys.  I'm currently at work so I can't post a picture, but the only thing that really changed is the equipment  area has been changed to 4 wide (40pix more).  This has caused a space under the equipment...this is where the auto equip box has been placed.  The done button is in the lower left corner as seen in this picture (this is an older pic and doesn't have the other stuff!)

Like I said, just let me know if you want a copy to put into the 2.5 version. :)<br />

Good job, missed 1 thing... Charm Slot..<br />
<br />
and as mentioned above.. .we have one coming out.. we are working on the best placement.. <br />
<br />
sooo be patient and you will get it!! attached is a screenshot of one of the first test version..<br />
<br />
notice the auto equip area on left, and done button on bottom right..<br />
<br />
no need to do this yourself. it will just get confusing for others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">02-17-2003, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's cool, but look at the picture in the following link.  That is the new inv window.  I'm using the picture that Theriwen posted to the boards a little while back. :p <br />
<br />
Just letting you know its there and all yours if you wanted it. ;)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Sorry again...I just figured out what happened.  You looked at the ful picture which is of the old Vert skin.  Farther towards the top should be a picture of just the inventory and hotbutton windows.  This is the updated one.  Sorry about all the edits also (I have trouble thinking of everything all at one time :p )<br />
<br />
<br />
Editted to remove link, apprecaite the work, but your going a different direction that we are, if you want to use the official versions and make mods we would appreciate it.. but untill then dont want people downloading to many different files, its creating extra work for Sokol and I - Kudane</div></div><hr />

<br />
I appreciate the work your doing, I truely do.. but you would be better to send Sokol and I a PM if you want to offer help with a file, otherwise your creating more work for us when someone downloads your fix, and then gets our fix that doesnt match.<br />
<br />
please understand I am not censoring your work, but your working a different direction.. if you contact us by PM we can share more with you of what we are doing that will make more sense.<br />

<br />
*edit*<br />
Btw I was thinking if you were making an old Inventory (thinking of the one with Auto Equip area in the middle and the items surrounding it) with new charm slot ?<br />
*end edit*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sokol</div><div class="date">02-17-2003, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, first off, the charm slot is hooked up to nothing right now, and having been on the test server, theres more buttons that go in the inventory window, group window, selector window, and more files in the animations file to gett hem to work.<br />
So makeing a bunch of changes to the inventory window right now and re-releasing each one is pointless at the moment. What I did do is make one that works on the test server, and just waiting for kudane to get me some TGA's to work with them, then well be set. <br />
<br />
 When we have a lot of partial patches going in for one big patch over the course of time, it always better to wait for ALL the changes to present them selves other wise we are tripleing our workload. <br />
<br />
 We always appreciate people helping make their versions of windows, but Kudane has a point, if you want to help were more then happy for it, but having multiple versions of a file out there, all of which will be obsolete in a week just makes people who download them frustrated.<br />
<br />
 Vert left the UI in my hands when he left, and I have never failed to come up with an update the same day a patch has broke soemthing. Kudane has joined me in this effort, and theres always room for more, but we need to have it be an organized effort so as not to confuse people.<br />
<br />
 Back for pop, a person released a patch he made which to this day people email me complaining this or that doesn't work thinking I made it. It's just easier for things like these to have communication and direction.<br />
<br />
 On a side note, the vert compass was always 45deg off, thats why we changed it temporarily to the old style compass, untill we had the time to fix it. Also Kudane and I are working to update many of verts features, and have just abotu finished a new UI Called Solaria, we've rescently started discussing just including some of our changes to vert and renaming it. <br />
<br />
 Kudane and I have put alot of effort into Making Vert what it is, and were not trying to stop people from making changes, we just want uniformity, and people to understand were updating it, and if something isn't relaeased right away like the charm slot the reason is that theres more coming in, and the slot doesn't work as of yet. I just have never liked releasing an update 4 times in the same month.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sokol</div><div class="date">02-17-2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this works for the test server. <br />
I have NOT tested it on the standard servers, but it should work.<br />
It includes (in rudimentary fasion)<br />
<br />
The LFG button in the group window.<br />
[will revamp this when Kudane gets me a good button image]<br />
<br />
Inventory has the TINT, and FACE buttons, Charm slot, clearly defined auto equip, and a DONE button.<br />
[NOTE: the bottom right button says destroy but is actualy the DONE button, I'm just waiting for Kudane to send me the new TGA file, then it will say DONE]<br />
<br />
The Selector Window has all the new buttons.<br />
<br />
Basicaly this is a temporary file with XML done just waiting for some image revamps, but it's a file requested to work with the test server.<br />

No, Sony actualy made these a whole new xml file, so they will be fine. Actualy there should be VERY little problems with the patch.<br />
Version 25 should work seemlesly with it as soon as we finish a couple minor details.<br />

Yes all the previous mods should work, but to be safe always backup the file your changeing.<br />

We will be working no many mods in the future and this has been requested, along with a horizontal buff. just have to get the time :)<br />

No, you must get the 2.5 LoY patch for it to work and have the charm slot. It's in the Vert/Sokol DL section. Second there are many spell mods out there with the spell book Icon in place.<br />

I had a freind send me the file for 2.5 for the patch fixes. It didn't work. <br />

So I downloaded Vert Cann 2.4a and then copied the files from 2.5 and let it overwrite. Now I have non of my inventory/Hotkey that I had before the patch. :(<br />

for some reason, some of the features do not seem to work correctly, manly the journal and more importantly the maps!<br />

I tried to transfer the map section from the default to Vert file but this is not working either. <br />

Works brilliantly. Thanks for all the hard work.<br />

Just unzip 2.4 into a fresh folder. Copy the corresponding files from the 2.5 update over and it really should work.<br />

Once again, sterling job on the UI!</div></div><hr />

Everything worked great, that I tried.  Spellbook, inventory, spell bar (with an extra casting bar now :rolleyes: ), hot buttons, chat, pet window, and the LFG tool.  I did not try the MP3 player, Maps, Trader mode, Bazaar searching or banking.<br />

You're not supposed to use an &quot;outdated EQUI.xml&quot;. The file is missing on purpose. It was left out so EQ would be forced use the default one. If you copied an old EQUI file into your vert folder that would most likely be the reason why some feaures aren't working.<br />
<br />
Try to make another fresh copy of vert using 2.4a and the 2.5 patch as suggested. Don't add any other files to the mix, especially not an old EQUI.xml file. EQ will add what it needs when it loads the skin in game. <br />
<br />
Yes, I know it's what others have said but really, I do hope it works for you. Just a reminder to never copy the files from the Default folder into a custom skin folder by yourself, you'd be suprised at the problems it can cause down the line. <br />

The LFG button, for me, is in the upper left hand corner of the Group window.  It is a bit hard to notice unless you know where to find it.  I could not find the Disband and Invite buttons for a while either (in the upper right hand corner :)).</div></div><hr />

There is a known bug with all UI's that does this.  If the links are side by side, as in no spaces between then, that will cause this.  I don't the UI has anything to do with displaying the links or lack thereof.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, open the EQUI_CastingWindow.xml file with word pad.<br />
find the line <br />
<br />
	&lt;Screen item=&quot;CastingWindow&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;!--&lt;ScreenID/&gt;--&gt;<br />
		&lt;!--&lt;Font/&gt;--&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;false&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;290&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;50&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
change the part that says<br />
<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;290&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;50&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location<br />
to<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;-290&lt;/X&gt;<br />

And here I was trying to find a realyl long casting spell so that I could grab the casting gauge and drag it off the screen!  Either I could not grab it or I did not drag it fast enough and the spell ended before I finished.  Meaning it popped back to the original place.<br />
<br />
Then I looked for a way to completely disable it and found none (through the interface).  So I set the Faded and Normal levels to 0 hoping to make it completely invisible.  That did not work either, except to make it harder to grab when I went back to that method.<br />

All in all it was fun.  :)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the help!! much appreciated =)<br />

I think I did something wrong... so I downloaded the &quot;simple-hotbutton.zip&quot; from your file list, unzipped it and copy it into my vert folder replacing the original hotbutton xml file... then load it in EQ, I didn't get any error message but the whole UI just won't load up and it loaded up default, what did I do wrong?<br />
<br />
*Edit*<br />
<br />
Seem to find another problem... everytime i switch from default to vert mod, all my armor turn silver (they are original dark green, non dyed) and i have to zone to get it set back to dark green. I tried bringing up the dye window what's funny is that it listed all my armor as white (or silver) as original color, then after zoning it return to the actual orginal color in dye window</div></div><hr />

Seem to find another problem... everytime i switch from default to vert mod, all my armor turn silver (they are original dark green, non dyed) and i have to zone to get it set back to dark green. I tried bringing up the dye window what's funny is that it listed all my armor as white (or silver) as original color, then after zoning it return to the actual orginal color in dye window  <br />
<br />
<br />
this may be an issue with EQ, as the colros you see are apart of that and not ANY UI.<br />

I liked the Sokol Advanced Group Window that was made months ago.  Picture is here : http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=270<br />

If it's a duplicate LFG button, make sure you aren't using another mod I just tested it witha  blank copy of Vert24a oceanspray, the 25 patch and the group-inv mod and it works error free. Try re-downloading the Vert 24a, get the 25 patch, and the Group-inv window again and try it fresh.<br />

I honestly have no clue as to what your talking about as the other vert... What casting bar in the Chat window? A screen shot would be nice. The chat windows are all called froma  template file, and while it may be possible to add one to the chat, if you have more then one chat it would be in all of them..<br />

I downloaded the Ocean Spray 24a, the 25 patch and the R hand buff window, so that they were all default. I could not duplicate this. I hate to ask but are you sure it wasn't the short duration buff window showing too? :) any way it was most likely a screen glitch as you just can not load 2 buff windows, and especialy not those that would move independent from one another.<br />

i know exactly what is wrong Mitsune<br />
<br />
you didn't read the README FIRST!!.TXT file that was included with the patch..<br />
<br />
which means you did one of two errors<br />
<br />
1. you copied everything inside the patch folder into your vert UI, you can tell if you did this if you look in your Vert folder and see folders with these names &quot;pepto&quot; &quot;neptune&quot; &quot;ocean spray&quot; &quot;nexium&quot; &quot;cannabis&quot; <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
2. You only copied the XML files from the patch folder into your Vert UI Folder.. <br />
<br />
EITHER WAY the solution is:<br />
<br />
You need to copy the PATCHED GRAPHIC FILES TOO that are in folders by color name... sooo if you are using Neptune Open the folder &quot;neptune&quot; (inside the patch folder) and copy the TGAs there into your VertUI folder<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have gotten 3 emails on this.. 2 of them copied everything into their folder, and the other only grabbed the XML files... all 3 of them had not read the instructions in the README FIRST!!.TXT file that we included so you would get the whole patch.<br />
<br />
if you look and see any subfolders other than &quot;extras&quot; and &quot;CCake&quot; (especially if they are the names listed above) then you may want to remove them... (stick to those i listed above, incase you have another custom piece in there)<br />
<br />
and you will be all fixed</div></div><hr />

OK, I was able to go through the default and Vert animations files and pick out what was changed in regards to the spellbook stuff. I did, however, have to go in and modify the layout a bit....seems I couldn't find where the size of the spellbook was laid out, and the background pic didn't line up with the icons, and didn't stretch all the way to the right. hmmm. it's working, though  <br />
<br />
<br />
Cool! There's no better feeling Then Figuring something like this out on your own, GRATS!<br />

Im quite new to vert, coding and stuff and tried to get the classanimation into my ui.. many wasted space yet and i wanted to fill it up with da SK class anim right under my spell gems where the &quot;spellbook&quot; icon is at the moment.. perhaps with a layer to open up the spellbook when clicking on the animation... any clue how to implement it perhaps?..<br />

<br />
I'm using the classic hot buttons, because A) I'm a lousy typist and it takes me too long to change banks of hot buttons with the keyboard, and B) with the prefered size of my chat box, I don't have enough room for two columns of inventory slots.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to get the classic hot buttons with only one column of &quot;right clickies&quot; and a single inventory slot, or if that's not possible, a single column of inventory slots?   Just to be clear, I wouldn't expect all 8 inventory slots, just whatever amount of &quot;right clickies&quot; and/or inventory spots would fit in the the same vertical space as the height of the classic hot button box.<br />

hmm, I was on with my enchanter and charming pets last night, and didn't experience this, so it may just be a problem with your UI folder some how. Try to either re-DL 24a and the 25 patch, as it is likely you may have a problem with a TGA file or it could have been a random glitch with EQ. If the problem persists, email me and I'll look further into your specific problem.<br />

Actually, I was going to ask about the same thing that Lizden did (I think, anyway).  I believe he means the actual spell cast bar you seen when casting a spell.  It appears in the upper middle of the screen, and resists being relocated.<br />

All you would have to do is copy the mouse.tga file you want over the one you have. Make sure to back up the existing file! then it should work fine. If you need more details, just click the flashing orb to email me.<br />

It all works 100% :)<br />
Things to check:<br />
<br />
Did you after applying the 25LOY patch copy ALL the files from the oceanspray folder it created into your Vert folder? <br />
<br />
Did you copy ALL the XML changes from the 2.5 LOY folder to your vert folder?<br />
<br />
IF the answer to the above was yes, you some how have corupted files, and i suggest a clean install of 2.4a and then 2.5 LOY patch making sure to follow the above, and um use the included readme file :)<br />

Unfortunetly, the OLD way of hits mode got changed, and all information sent to the chat window hits mode is sent from EQ server to your client. The XML can't change this. I know that several have expressed wishing to have hits mode changed. All I can suggest is you /feedback ingame and suggest it.<br />

You should just be able to open the EQUI_TargetWindow.xml file find the<br />
gauge and stretch it, IE just make it say double. You will then need to find the whole size of the screen IE the target window it's self and set it double. This should just stretch the gauge.<br />
Theres better ways, but that should be the easiest.<br />
Once upon a time I had one I made, I'll look for it again, and post here if I find it.<br />
<br />
P.S. You may have to change the gauge draw template to a custom gauge too :) It's realy not hard if you know alittle XML.<br />

Change that to <br />

	&lt;Fill&gt;A_GaugeFill_001&lt;/Fill&gt;<br />

	&lt;EndCapLeft&gt;A_Targetimage&lt;/EndCapLeft&gt;<br />
	&lt;/GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
Now open EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
<br />
Now Find this.... <br />
	&lt;!-- Gauge Parts --&gt;<br />
	&lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;A_GaugeBackground&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />

			&lt;Duration&gt;1000&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Frames&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Ui2DAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
and see where it says SIZE? Copy this whole section and name it<br />
A_GaugeBackground_001<br />
Now do the same copy the <br />
<br />
A_GaugeFill<br />
and<br />
A_GaugeLines<br />
then<br />
A_GaugeLinesFill<br />
<br />
adding the _001 to the Item name, and double the SIZE property,<br />
and you should be set this will &quot;stretch&quot; the background gauge.<br />

<br />
DOH! My fault I told you to expand the size but this loads more of whats beyond the gauge image from window pieces 1, whichr equires a new TGA for the gauge :)<br />
<br />
Any way I hacked a copy of the tga gauge, and will attach it. place it in your vert directory, and then edit your animations file to add the following.<br />
<br />
&lt;!--Long Target -BEGIN--&gt;<br />

	&lt;!--Long Target -END--&gt;<br />

	&lt;!-- VERTMOD --&gt;<br />
<br />
Thats the very top of the file, so it's easy to see. It will be best if you edit the ORIGINAL animations file and dump what I told you to do earlier for the animations file, but KEEP your traget window XML file as you changed it and it should work fine.<br />

Make sure all the XML files got moved to your UI folder too. :)<br />
If that doesn't do it you'll have to re-install 24a then 25LOY <br />
your files may have gotten corrupted some how.<br />

Boy am I glad i did :) However, I'm using Thomus King's buffs instead of the default because they're lovely, but with each buff icon having a border, and with so much detail in them, they become very hard to see and distinguish when rendered.....what....half thier original size in game? It prolly seems very Scarlet O'Hara of me to make this request since the names of the buffs are written next to the icons, but it's not a matter of recognition, it's one of aesthetics. <br />
Would it be doable to alter the buff window xml so that the icons are drawn a few pixels larger all around, say like 30x30? I understand it would also be necessary to alter the buff frame with the numbers from windowpieces_08, but I don't think a new .tga file is necessary for that. <br />
Anyways just let me know if this is doable with simple modifications to xml files or not, I'm not afraid to dive in and change them once in a while ;) Keep up the good work, and thanks for the dedication!<br />

  <br />
<br />
They (SOE/VI) coded the pet window so that it automatically closes anytime you lose a pet (i.e. death/telling it to go #$%@ itself and get lost/zoning).  From what I've seen from other posts, there is no way to fix this, and you will have to reactivate the window (alt + F1)  once it goes poof.<br />

according to the eq text untill vert is updated you have to use default gui to access the new bank window</div></div><hr />

First there has always been mods in the DLs ection under vert for spell windows with the book button on it, second the 4x2 version with the casting gauge atatched has a spell book button, it's the gauge it's self, it states this in the DL section.<br />

It seem that you have mislocated the spellbook image in the .tga as i see part of the non highlighted spellbook button , part of one of the map zoom button, and part of 2 windows selection button. That is when i dont have the mouse over it.<br />

With mouse over i see part of the non highlighted spellbook button, part of the highlighted spellbook button, part of the map zoom button and part of an other non-identified window/button.<br />

I must be misunderstanding something, when i click on the spell casting gauge (bottom of the 4x2 window) i doesnt open up my spellbook.<br />
<br />
It just gives me a small properties window with Background &gt;, Alpha &gt;, Lock, Close.  It has never opened up the spellbook for me.  Opening the spellbook isnt a problem, but not having the code that tells it Right-click = Favorites is what I was hoping for.  <br />
<br />
Hmm you may have the original version of the 4x2 my appologise, DL the one there now, it's been done for awhile, but theres no extra code for the spellcasting window so the 4x2 there now should work...<br />

Have you ADDED any NON-VERT pieces to your UI?<br />
<br />
if sooo.. then lets start at the beginning... Download Vert 2.5 (your choice of color) and then take the three files in the zip (that is linked above) and OVERWRITE the 3 files in your new 2.5 folder.<br />
<br />
make sure there are no sub-folders, and do not just &quot;unzip them&quot; into your new vert 2.5 folder.. makes sure the files over write the old ones.</div></div><hr />

I've downloaded the new vert2.4 file, and installed the patch for the three files.  Logged on, and got an incompatible .xml file message.<br />
<br />
I then deleted my entire original vert ui directory, and then rebuilt it using the new vert2.4 files, and then patched that.  I still get the incompatible .xml message.<br />
<br />
I checked the errors file, but it tells me nothing.  The only thing in the UIErrors.txt file is:<br />
<br />
UIErrorLog created at Wed Jun 11 17:18:01 2003<br />
<br />
I can find nothing else.<br />
<br />
Should I just ignore the warning about the .xml files?  If someone can clue me in, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Make sure they overwrite the existing files. I know it lame to repeat that, but as you can see from the screen shot, it all works fine with my changes. Make sure to overwrite all the files and the TGA.<br />

If you dont want to upgrade.. well not much we can do to support you bro..<br />

when you come to 2.5 let us know and we can trouble shoot.<br />

we dont even OFFER 2.4.. because itwas not LOY compliant.<br />
