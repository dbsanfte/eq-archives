<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerah</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">first, let me start off by saying i use the buff window that has the small icon and the text ... with the blue background, sorry for not being more specific.<br />
<br />
anywho, so i'm sitting in akheva staring at my god-awful buff window, thinking to myself &quot;you know, i'm starting to know the icons by now, so what do i need this huge window for?&quot; <br />
<br />
and then it hits me, to conserve space (i'm huge on playing with as much open space as possible), would it be possible to make a mouseover feature that would allow the buff window to dock the icons on the right hand screen border (or upper, or lower, or left, or however you play), and when you mouseover, they would slide out to reveal the name at a set distance from the border?<br />
<br />
it wouldn't even have to slide, a person in my group today said you could redefine the alt key's purpose to , instead of popping up just the name, bring out the whole window like i was sayin earlier.<br />
<br />
anyway, just an idea i thought i'd put out there for everyone to kick around :)</div></div><hr />
