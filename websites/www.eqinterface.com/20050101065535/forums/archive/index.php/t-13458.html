<br />
Using WinZip ?<br />
<br />
If so, your prolly not watching what directory your putting your files.  WinZip will keep File Path Info intact, so you may just be burying your files another layer down in your /uifiles/ directory.<br />
<br />
Maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone also realized they hadn't downloaded content for additional zones.  This can affect UI usage.  Inside your patcher, go to advanced and select the additional zones as well as all expansions you presently own, then do a complete file check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Som1gottaDIE</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've downloaded all the updates from all the Expansions. I don't have GoD or LDoN, though I still selected them. Took 16mins and everything is still the same. I download the zip file to the zip folder, then I extract to the UI directory and follow instructions from there. Consequently one of them said to change a .ini file which I did and now I have this huge black aread at the top and bottom of my screen. So I say again, any Ideas?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">another important thing, are you keeping the files in their own sep folder so the path should look like:<br />
<br />
Drive:/.../everquest/uifiles/customfolder<br />
<br />
make sure you're not doing this:<br />
<br />
Drive:/.../everquest/uifiles/customfolder/customfolder1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sedasi</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what I do when I try out a new UI is this. ( I know it is backwards way but it works for me hehe )<br />
<br />
1. open up the zip file where you downloaded it to.  For me in a file called &quot;everquest UI's&quot;<br />
<br />
2. next open up the &quot;UI files&quot; in everquest.  So I am looking at two windows.<br />
<br />
3. make a new folder in the everquest &quot;UI files&quot;, calling it whatever I want (usually test or a name of a toon I am going to try it with )<br />
<br />
4. in the zip file I highlight all the files I need to use minus any preview or &quot;read me&quot; files and then left click + hold.  Move them to the new folder in the everquest &quot;UI files&quot;.  Letting the computer complete the trasfer.<br />
<br />
5. I make a copy of the &quot;UI_ini_file&quot; if needed and paste it to the desktop.  Close the zip file.<br />
<br />
6. back out of the new folder in the everquest &quot;UI files&quot; and into the main directory of Everquest look for the character that is going to try my new UI and check the name and server.  Making sure of it I rename the desktop one the same as the one in everquest and then move the file into everquest.  Saying &quot;yes&quot; to the overwrite.<br />
<br />
7. done.  close the Everquest directory and log on the game and have fun with the new UI.<br />
<br />
Works everytime unless the UI is old or I like to see if this mod will run with this UI and they break each other.  I mix and match a lot. :D <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  also if you type /viewport reset.  It get rid of the black bars you said you have at times.</div></div><hr />

The rest of the .ini file are just warnings. Anyone who uses a custom UI will get warnings just like those.<br />
<br />
The XML Errors on the other hand are what is stopping you from loading. It almost looks like you are missing or are using an old animations file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In utilies folder i make a new folder most time named after toons name or ui's name ,if its mod im working on that mods name.<br />
<br />
Make sure every thing is unziped corectly no folders inside that ui's folder (them parts inside folder wount load)<br />
<br />
Check your zip files intergrety , i have had to redown load zip files few time of late duno what causes them not to download corect.But stoped using download acelerators not had as much problem with it.Hope this helps a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShaithanAB</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My method to installing new UI's.<br />
<br />
Create a directory in c:/program files/sony/everquest/uifiles for my new ui.  In this case, we'll call it &quot;test&quot;.<br />
<br />
-- NEVER COPY FILES FROM THE DEFAULT FOLDER -- You will have major problems when sony releases minor patches.<br />
<br />
Unzip the new ui file to c:/program files/sony/everquest/uifiles/test.  When you are prompted to overwrite files, you must select &quot;yes&quot;.  If you do not get a message telling you that you are overwriting files, the files did not go to the right place which means the creator of the UI has probably packed them inside a directory.  In this case, go to c:/program files/sony/everquest/uifiles/test and look for a directory folder with the name of your UI.  Open that folder, select all, copy, and paste all those files back into your uifiles/test directory.<br />
<br />
If the file came with a UI_CharName_Servername file I copy that to desktop, rename it to UI_Mycharname_Myservername and save it to c:/program files/sony/everquest.  Load up game, click on options, click on load ui skin, load ui.<br />
<br />
Note:  Of course, you're exact Everquest folder location may or may not be the same as mine.<br />
<br />
Hope I wrote this so it's understandable, it's easy for me to think about and do, but seems to be a pain to explain. :)</div></div><hr />

If you look at the dates on some of those interfaces there have been some patches since their release and the author hasnt updated them requireing you to update them.<br />
<br />
You'll need to perform all patches that are dated after the date of the interface. http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6589</div></div><hr />

Doing some searching way back I found that this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=53176#post53176) should fix your problem. A person with a similar problem posted here (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12537&amp;highlight=XML+reference+error+Ui2DAnimation) and thats how I found the fix.</div></div><hr />
