<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blyte</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok here is what I was trying to do with no sucess...<br />
<br />
I was trying to incorporate the compass into the player window and using the compass window for somthing else...<br />
<br />
got GUI error and couldnt load my skin...<br />
<br />
I am well versed in XML and stuff and my gui up till now was nice.. but I would like to get rid of that compass window...<br />
<br />
if I have no choice I would just take the border out of it and make room for it in the player window to put it on top of it. however that seems like an awefull waste of a window thats stays up across zones...</div></div><hr />

(and just offsetting, in the player wnd, the pet hp so the window doesn't freak out)... then using the player window for something new.  :)<br />
<br />
But that's a last resort - hope you get your answer.  :)<br />
