I have now incorperated rainbow bars (have to be seen to belived)<br />
%'s have also gone but i will reintroduce them if they are wanted.<br />
LFG/LFM button is in now.<br />
all warning/error messages have been cleaned up so should not cause undue UIErrors.txt and the non-compatable warning!<br />
window size is now 108 by 178. (went on a minamalizing frenzy again)<br />
<br />
Please leave your comments and feedback, i apreciate to know which direction to take things!<br />
(This Thread covers any Version 2.0 mod i have made)<br />
Group Window (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3258)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is so great to see you are back and playing with your mods.  Norrath without Mafoo was a much sadder place.  I cannot play EQ without your Spell Bar and Player window.  I have always appreciated the look and feel of both of them.<br />
<br />
And while I simply adore your group mod, I have but one true wish.....not that you minimize it any further as all your mods are intrinsically minimized already by design and the content to take up as little screen acreage yet give the maximum amount of information AT A GLANCE, but instead that your group window be sized the same as your player window.  That way, I can place them side by side in the middle of the display on the bottome edge with chat windows on either side.  For those that stack them, they can be placed one atop the other in a seamless column.  <br />
<br />
I know you have been minimizing the group mod, but at the risk of repeating myself, your design is already minimized because of the layout of the information.  You are trying to make something perfect better.  And that is always hard to do.  But in truth, I like the look of the Rainbow alot.  I mean a whole lot!  Great design.<br />
:p <br />
<br />
Thanks for your inspiration and hard work.</div></div><hr />

is it possible to include the F1 - F2  and the actual numeric health indicators ?  those are a big help to healer classes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mafoo</div><div class="date">05-08-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think i agree curiously, i think i will size it identical to player info and put end caps back on.<br />
and style it all to match the player info.<br />
Expect a Group Window 2.2 released sunday evening (GMT)<br />
and possibly a Player Window 2.0 as well going to experiment with rainbow bars for that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greymantle</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Downloaded this for my wife and installed it. Haveing a small problem. If a group member is not in the same zone their name dissapears from the window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefang</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this mod - but my particular set up requires a horizontal layout - tried moving it around myself but cant seem to get it correct - any chance for a horizontal version ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zenlaugh</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rainbow bars make this mod beautiful.  But I'm also having a hard time with the lack of percentages.  It's not just that I'm biased because I play a healer, most people I know who I've showed this to are also having the same dilemma.. 'I'd love to make this part of my ui, but I'm not sure it's going to work without some numbers.'<br />
So basically, if you make a second version with %'s for the rest of us, you'll have twice the downloads =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefang</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">been playing around with this a bit - got a horizontal version, with function key numbers and percentages - now trying to resolve the dissapearing names issue... I read a post here somewhere that explains why the names dissapear when a group member is out of zone - its because the window uses a seperate &quot;label&quot; for the name rather than the &quot;built in&quot; text that comes with the gauge...<br />
<br />
so,<br />
<br />
my problem is this - there are so many layered gauges that I'm unsure of which one to use for the text - or if it even matters - I seem to recall reading somewhere that it needs to be the gauge thats on the &quot;top&quot; layer for the text to show, but I'm really not sure - if anyone can shed some light I can get this finished pretty quickly - otherwise I'll keep messing with it till I figure it out.</div></div><hr />
