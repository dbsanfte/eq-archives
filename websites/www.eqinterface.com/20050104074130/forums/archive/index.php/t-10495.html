I use PSP 7 and Eye Candy 4000, but was wondering if anybody knows any good collection of filters out there aside from Eye Candy.  Some of the graphics in UIs are incredible, and Drakah's logo on http://www.shakahr.com/ is just really awesome so I thought I'd mess around and see what I could produce and nada.  But anyways, just was curious as to the setups some people are using.</div></div><hr />
