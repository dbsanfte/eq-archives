<br />
Basically, I beleive it is loading fine...  but as soon as I log into the toon of choice, it crashes to desktop...   my other toons load fine as they still use the default... (Honestly I never loaded the new ui stuff because of this...  but decided to give it a try as I am sure its relatively stable now i am sure..I hope...)<br />
<br />
(In case it was a video issue, I tried 16bit and 32bit... no change)<br />
<br />
I admit I am new to this UI stuff... but I found KatnTKUIv2 (http://eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1670) and unzipped it under the uifiles directory as it said to do...  (it created its own folder as it was supposed to)<br />
<br />
I then copied the files as required from the resolution of choice into the KatnTKUIv2 directory...<br />
<br />
I also changed &lt;Animation&gt;A_ClassAnim15&lt;/Animation&gt;  to<br />
&lt;Animation&gt;A_ClassAnim02&lt;/Animation&gt;  for cleric as i was supposed to...<br />
<br />
and I named the file UI_charactername_number.ini to be UI_Tharic_23.ini as I was supposed to... and moved it to the main EQ directory...<br />
<br />
My error log:  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">03-19-2003, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that error log says it doesnt see any files in the folder you specified.<br />
<br />
my first suggestion would be to make sure that the files are located in &quot;KatnTKUIv2&quot; and that the folder is named correctly. this is not uncommon when there is a subfolder.<br />
<br />
second<br />
<br />
i fixed the link to the file you linked.. (it was giving an error)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharic-Rathe</div><div class="date">03-20-2003, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kinda checked that theory...  the files that are missing, are the ones that weren't included in the Set...  and from what I read in the help, I was not to move copies of the files to the new Folder...  Of all the files in the above error log, I checked to see if any of them were files the Set did supply and they were not present in the errorlog... SO...  its just files that are not included and that are supposed to go to default as far as I can tell...<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
I am home now, and copied the additional files from the default dircectory to the KatnTKUIv2 directory just to see what would happen...  it cleared all the errors from the errorlog...  so its something else...  oh well...  gonna try some other UIs i guess and see if they work...  I really liked the look of this kat one though...  will add more when I find out if others work...</div></div><hr />
