It looks really nice!!!...AND then this idea popped into my head:<br />
<br />
If any of you have ever seen the anime &quot;Hellsing&quot; there's a character in there named Alucard that has a really really cool looking design on his glove (it's like HIS rune or something).  I was just thinking how cool it'd be too see that as a targetting ring.  I'll try to find some sample pics or the like and show you guys. =) <br />

<br />
A quick question though, any way to make a part of it (say the boxxie bottom edge) stay still, facing the 'front' of the MoB even if it turned, while the runes run around the edges?</div></div><hr />

That's I imagine how the Compass targets work, they always are aligned the same way.<br />
<br />
Someone who knows better about the limits of the target rings could comment, I haven't seen a lot that have a small center hole...the opening in the middle of the star might be too small to do. (Not speaking as a maker of target rings but from looking at what is out there to download.)</div></div><hr />
