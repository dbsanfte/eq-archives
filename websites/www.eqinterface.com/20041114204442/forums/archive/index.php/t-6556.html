<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvasie</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As promised here is my version of a hotbutton window:<br />
<br />
http://www.imgmag.org/images/kuvasie/HtBtn.jpg <br />
<br />
If anyone is interested I can make simpler versions of this - hotbutton only w/ or without class anim, or side by side w/ or without animation.  Just let me know. <br />
<br />
I am working on other colors for the buttons, green and purple mostly - again if anyone is interested, let me know.<br />
<br />
2/10 - Added variations below<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
To change the animation:<br />
<br />
find this:<br />
<br />
&lt;!-- CHANGE This (A_ClassAnim04) to your class --&gt;<br />
	&lt;StaticAnimation item=&quot;HTW_ClassAnim&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;21&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;10&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;60&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;124&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;Animation&gt;A_ClassAnim04&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
	&lt;/StaticAnimation&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Change this line:<br />
<br />
		&lt;Animation&gt;A_ClassAnim04&lt;/Animation&gt;<br />
<br />
To whatever class you want displayed.  The number in the above line (04) is all that you need to edit.<br />
<br />

Just the bottom one where it has the forage and stuff... not the hot-swap or class animation one, hope ya know what I mean, just a simple hotbutton...<br />
<br />
And do you have different window pieces for it too so it could be used with inventory or chat? like window-pieces 1, 2, 3<br />

I will love when you get your green color out (goes with your player window better) .  I do hope you come out with a simple hotkey layout (just the 10 hotkeys).  I'm a fan of simple and lots of space to see.<br />

Again I love your work and use of TK's.  Keep it up and you'll have a whole UI</div></div><hr />

This download has the blue buttons (show in first post) by default.  If you want to use the green, delete or rename A_tk_hotbtn.tga then rename A_tk_hotbtn_grn.tga to A_tk_hotbtn.tga.<br />

Yes - I can - that is one of the colors that I think would look good.  <br />

Ok, here are the grey / black buttons you wanted.  Hope this works for you.  Just drop it into the mod you are using and replace the existing file.  If you want to save the other file, be sure to rename it or move it before you place this one in the same folder.<br />

i went into file and changed all text colors from 255/255/255 to 0/255/0<br />

but its not swowing up green, my eyes arent what they used to be and the green text works good for me<br />

i changed the text colors on your group window to green- actually changed the orb color to black also<br />

That is part of the drawback to using tabbed windows.   These are hard coded to fade to 50% of the parent window - no matter what you do.

Sorry to be a bother tho, is there some way I can disable the tabbed windows then? I onlu need the first page anyways. I can edit the tga at some point later, but I really really really dont like that fade *L*<br />

You would have to recode the ui to remove the tabs and move the items you want out to the main window.  The .tga file woudln't have to change at all.  The problem is in the coding not the graphics, they are already in the parent window.<br />

I have looked over all the files you have hosted here and all i can say is wow.  I love my ui so much that I rarely even think of changing anything about it. I use the spell bar this is from in the ui and it's one of my favorite pieces. I'm thinking about putting together another ui. If you don't mind I'd like to include some of your work. Full credits would of course go to you for your pieces. Please let me know if you have any objections.<br />

Did you do an update to this hotbutton mod without animation simple hotbutton, and in black/grey?  <br />
<br />
As far as I know, all hotbutton mods are updated and have the three color options available in the download.<br />

I just tested the simple hotbutton window file and it seems fine.  If you changed the button colors, make sure you renamed the tga file correctly.<br />
