<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
The first window is EQTC - Recipes. This window can use the Pet, Help, Gems, Feedback, Friends, or Bug Window. This window has tabs for each tradeskill and contains information on recipes and trivals. The default display tabs are: Baking, Brewing, Fletching, Jewelry, Pottery, Smithing, Tailoring. The following tabs are also available: Alchemy, Fishing, Foraging, Poison Making, Tinkering, Barbarian Cultural, Dark Elf Cultural, Dwarven Cultural, Erudite Cultural, Halfling Cultural, Human Cultural (broken into 2 tabs one for Freeport, one for Qeynos), Iksar Cultural, Ogre Cultural, Troll Cultural, and Wood Elf Cultural You can edit the XML file to customize which tabs display. (See insturctions page for more information on editing tabs.) <br />
<br />
Where can I get the Alchemy, Fishing, Foraging, Poison Making, Tinkering, Barbarian Cultural, Dark Elf Cultural, Dwarven Cultural, Erudite Cultural, Halfling Cultural, Human Cultural, Iksar Cultural, Ogre Cultural, Troll Cultural, and Wood Elf Cultural files? Or are they all included in the file? In the screenshot it shows only baking brewing, fletching, jewelry, pottery, smithing, and tailoring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The tabs you are looking for are included but not displayed.  In order too see them you need to edit your xml file.  Full insturctions on how to do this can be found here (http://www.frostwolf.net/EQTC/instructions.htm)  under Adding Tabs.<br />

First of all the EQ Tradeskill Companion is the best extention of my work that I have ever seen and I personally use it now over my own mod.<br />
<br />
I have lately(well over the past 2 months) been getting PM's about changes/wants/needs/desires that have to do with my tradeskill mod that is still available to download from this site.  I haven't been to the site in a while having finally managed to get my over all UI the way I wanted it(well mostly but I'm messing around with it myself) and I appoligize to all those that I haven't answered. I am no longer supporting my mod because someone with the graphical knowledge and obviously more time than me has made this version so well that I no longer need too.  I don't mind my mod being left up for all those that want the current version but there will be no more updates or anything else as I simply do not have the time and no longer actively use it myself.<br />
<br />
All props to Frostwolf this is brilliant work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aasimon</div><div class="date">12-22-2002, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello. This sounds like an awesome tool! I am new to mods, but have mixed and matched several cool ones so far.<br />
<br />
My questions concern choosing the Windows to overwrite with EQTC. If I place EQTC (any of them) in Friends, does my /who friends all no longer work? Same question for Target window...will I no longer be able to target if this is chosen?<br />
<br />
As my first posting here, I'd also like to thank EQGUI for this AWESOME collection of skins, and thanks to Frostwolf for thiw mod I intend to use when I feel good about overwriting Windows I may otherwise use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">12-22-2002, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by aasimon <br />

<br />
If you are using the default interface, putting the Tradeskills Companion in the Target window will not stop you from targeting, but you won't see the target. Putting it in Friends will remove the functionality of the friends WINDOW only. /w all friends will still work, you just wont be able to call up your freinds list and edit it FROM THE WINDOW. ALl text commands will still function as before.<br />
<br />
My suggestion, if you want to use the Tradeskills mods would be Help, Gems, Bug, Friends, Notes or Pet (if you aren't a pet class) Unless your using a UI that has adapted another window to reflect the seleced target I wouldn'ty use  Target<br />
<br />
Also, just a reminder. You never actually overwrite the default files. You create another folder and only place in it those files you are using. EQ will use the default files for anything not in that folder. If for some reason you don't like the mod or it isnt working for you all you need do is /load default and voila. Back to basics.</div></div><hr />

Sorry new to this,but is it possible to run all three (loc,rec,quest) in the same window or even in 3 differnt windows? I can only get one at a time to work.  <br />
<br />
Download each of the modules and copy all of the TGA files, the EQTC_&lt;Module Name&gt;.XML file and one of the EQUI_&lt;WindowName&gt;.XML files from each module to you mods folder. Make sure you choose different files for each module you want to use.<br />
<br />
I'm running all 3 modules with no problems. I have Quests in the Gems window, Locations in the Bug window and Recipes in the Friends window. So I'm using: EQTC_Quests.XML and  EQUI_GemsGameWnd.XML, EQTC_Locations.XML and EQUI_BugReportWnd.XML, EQTC_Recipes.XML and  EQUI_FriendsWnd.XML in addition to all the TGA files from each module.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually yes you can have all 3 in 1 window you just have to do some moding of your own, and you'll have tabs out the wazoo.  First download all the files.  With one of them being the window you want the mod in.  Then open up the EQTC_&lt;Recipes, Locs, or Quests&gt;.xml files.  Whichever copy all but the list of pages part of the 2 files that are not already in the window you want, then paste them above the list of pages in the one that is in the window.  Then Copy just the &lt;page&gt; (pagename) &lt;/page&gt; part of list of pages from the 2 others and paste them into the one that is in the mod.  And poof ya got them all in one window, but that's a lot of tabs.</div></div><hr />

That way we would never have to worry about them changing any files during a patch to screw this mod up anymore.<br />
<br />
The Storyline Window seems to be the best way to display this kind of information for users.<br />
<br />
Have one storyline for Recipies, Locations and Quests. Hit Alt-N in Game view Storyline Window and select which of the 3 storylines you want to views for information.</div></div><hr />
