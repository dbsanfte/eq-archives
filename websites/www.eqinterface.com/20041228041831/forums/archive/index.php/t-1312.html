We should be moving to the server by Tuesday - Wednesday(updated) unless we encounter other unforeseen complications.<br />
<br />
With this new dedicated server you will no longer receive the “server busy” message and we can also re-enable our download section and forum attachments. The server we purchased will give us a good deal of growing room. Once setup on our server we can continue to grow and add more features down the road.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank all of those people who were patient and didn’t start emailing and complaining. I have received many emails and private messages with offers to help. I thank you for that.<br />
<br />
I had never expected these sites to be so popular and grow so fast with in a couple weeks time.</div></div><hr />

Congrats...the patience is paying off!<br />
<br />
This is going to be one of the busiest EQ sites, which is saying a hell of a lot, considering how long the EQ community has existed!<br />

Dolby, before ya move to a dedicated server reply to those emails I sent ya.. I may be able to save you guys a nice amount of money. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your offer Ventrix and sorry I didnt get back to you (some how lost your email, remember reading it though). We have found a plan that we think will work well for us and things were already set into motion.<br />
<br />
Just an update for every one... I have purchased a dedicate server plan and the host thinks they might have it ready as early as friday but there will still be about 24 - 72hrs for the dns to the domain names to change over.<br />
<br />
So things will be back up soon! YAY! :)</div></div><hr />
