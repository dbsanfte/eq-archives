JUST RELEASED! 90 Minute Counting UP Timer!! Look I the &quot;Released&quot; thread for this NEW timer! <br />
http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=3668 <br />
<br />
Dalink's 90 Minute COUNTDOWN TIMER  <br />
<br />
Extract these files to whatever directory you use for your User Interface. <br />
<br />
This Replaces the Friends Window, To Display the Timer press alt+f on your keyboard. <br />
<br />
To restart the timer, type /loadskin &lt;YOUR UI DIRECTORY&gt; 1   <br />
<br />
The &quot;1&quot; switch is very important, this is what keeps your window positions.  <br />
<br />
The Ui Directory is the directory for whatever Ui Directory you extracted these files to.<br />
<br />
The timer counts down for 90 minutes, at which time the timer restarts. <br />
<br />
The timer does remain acurate through zones. In other words, it keeps counting while yer zoning.<br />
<br />
I hope you like it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalink</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, I suppose the code was just about trippled from the amount of code used in sabani's 60 minute timer = )  but in doing so, it made it alot easier to make a timer of any length you desire. Right now, it takes 6 frames for every minute, and 60 frames for every 10 minutes, but you could extend this simply by cutting and pasting more frames, no need for more TGAs. I think this timer is a good test of the animation system that was put into the new UI so far allowing as many as 540 frames per animation (how many frames there are in the 10 minute digit.)</div></div><hr />

I suppose, you could use it to time a spawn...but it just seems like a lot of work for very little use.<br />
<br />
I mean this question quite sincerely, as I would truly love to know.</div></div><hr />
