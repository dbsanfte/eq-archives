I extracted them both into their own folders inside of uifiles.  There is no subfolders in either of them. I know that's not the problem.  When I go to load the mod it gives me this error in my uierror.txt file.<br />

<br />
That's your problem child right there.  If you don't have a custom Inspect window, then just delete that file (EQUI_InspectWnd.xml) from your custom folder.  If you do have a custom Inspect Window, go to the 24 Feb patch thread in the Patch Fixes forum and find the information for updating that window.<br />

Great job on giving us the info to work with to be able to help you, thanks. :)</div></div><hr />
