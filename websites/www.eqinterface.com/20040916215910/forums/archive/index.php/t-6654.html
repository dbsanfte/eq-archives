I have tested it on a live sever after running it on test. You will see the the new buttons but they will not work on live servers until LoY goes live. Anyone that is beta testing on test will be able to use right away. (ok I will say it, I don't like using the default :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
File name will be Wizard_LoY.zip under mix and match with all the creidits to all the changes from the first one posted plus changes that still need to be updated. (Tking celtic inventory and inspect window) I did make the temp charm slot that Cairenn and Aeroslin posted.<br />
<br />
I wish I recorded the changes I made to the EQUI_Animations.xml and EQUI.xml files that are not posted yet. Cairenn if you read this I will be happy to send you a zipped copy of my default dir that I refered to make my changes.<br />

Tking has released his G2 inventory with all the updates. I have been waiting for the G2 spell gems to be released to compete it but is minor.<br />
<br />
I was doing some testing for a freind of mine for a pally epic cursor in the UI. Note this is what the UI is going to look like when you first load it.<br />

<br />
Please note that the UI I will post in mix and match will have TKings briar wand in the old screenshot posted, not the pally epic.<br />
<br />
Also I would like to add I have used this UI with diffenent classes and works with all of them well.</div></div><hr />
