Other than that small feature everything looks great.</div></div><hr />

I will mark a forum all read.  Go back to the top listing of all forums.  And yes, its marked with the no new messages icon.  I go on and read a few more sections and repeat.  Then I notice that the first one I read (and maybe some others) look like they have new messages again.  I frequent some busy boards so I think that isn't too unusual and head back to read whats new.  Only when I get there all 20 threads that were marked with new messages last time and havn't been updated since I used 'mark forum read' are all marked as having new messages again! <br />
<br />
This happens consistantly and is pretty annoying.  Makes the 'mark forum read' feature useless.</div></div><hr />

Seems to be working fine for me on IE6. I'll take a look at it under a couple other browsers and see if I can reproduce the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways, what about my original post?  If I click 'mark this forum read' I'm saying I have read everything here (duh) so why am I being taken back to here??  It doesn't make sense, and this is the only forum I have ever seen do that.  Clicking 'Mark this Forum Read' should take me back at least one level up, even though I personally would prefer it takes me back to the top level.</div></div><hr />
