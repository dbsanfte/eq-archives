<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lairelin</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read this thread (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8588) on referencing textures and such in the eq_animations.xml file, but I really don't understand how to tell what is being referenced and what isn't.<br />
<br />
I read someplace, that if my ui wasn't totally up to date that I could get the second-long lag when I open an interface window, inventory bag, etc..and I do.  A week ago my ui errors file was maybe 6k, tonight I looked at it and it was 137k+, so big my computer just about froze trying to open it. (It met my recycle bin.)<br />
<br />
I'd really like to be able to figure out how to fix my animations file if that's what is causing me problems rather than waiting on file updates.  I use Murr's UI which is popular on the Safehouse but with some modifications downloaded from this site, some of which haven't been updated.  (I never had the ingame message about my ui not being current until I added in the extras.) <br />
<br />
Anyway.. if anybody is able to help me out just by explaining how to check the referencing in my animations file, I'd be grateful. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advcance!<br />

<br />
1. load up murr's ui by itself and as you said you get no lag. Add in one mod at a time to see what's causing the lag. <br />
<br />
2. Once you find out which mod is causing the lag theres a ton of threads up here in the archives that tell you what you need to add in for each mod and the lines of code that are needed to fix it.<br />
<br />
Catch ya tonight<br />
<br />
Boku :P</div></div><hr />

I did actually reload the ui I use without my add-ins, and surprisingly the first thing that gave me the reloaded ingame error msg was using the player/target window that is for hybrids..not much of a difference but for now I'm using the version without my atk or endurance bars listed, and that second-long lag is gone. ;p<br />
<br />
Just gotta figure out that window really and I think I'll be ok.  Goint go post a msg on the safehouse to the guy that updates the UI and see if he can fix it or tell me how. ;)</div></div><hr />
