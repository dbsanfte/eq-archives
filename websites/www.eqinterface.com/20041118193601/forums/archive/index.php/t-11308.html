<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quichon</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I am a total newbie as far as UIs are concerned.  I am a monk, I do LDoN often, and I absolutly hate lag.  I looked at the minimalist stuff but they seem to shrink everything so small that I can't make out what is going on (or perhaps that's just the way the pic turned out).  I want something that gets out of my way so I can see what is going on, yet is there in case I need to see something. Most espically I want the following:<br />
<br />
Compass<br />
Target Indicator that has con color<br />
Target bar that has con color<br />
seperate windows for combat clutter and chat<br />
percentages for both hp and xp<br />
no animations<br />
easy to read font (ariel or times new roman or something similar)<br />
1024 X 768 or smaller<br />
<br />
What I would not mind having but isn't an absolute must<br />
<br />
cool spell buff icons<br />
cool graphics IF they are not placed where I need to look<br />
<br />
<br />
If there is anything fitting these then I didn't see them.  If anyone has suggestions PLEASE let me know.  I am still using the default UI (created a sepereate window for combat clutter) and I would like something better.</div></div><hr />

Although I am a Chinese player .. I think this also suits for English Version..<br />

Keep in mind when you look at the screenshot, that I pushed the Opacity to 100% for that shot. When I'm actually playing, I set the fade value of everything on screen to 25%. So although the windows are on the screen, they're all semi-transparent.<br />
<br />
Also, the 36 minute timer isn't visible, but it's got con-color around the timer window. I use 36 minute because that timer is broken into 6 blocks, and 36 minutes makes it 6 chucks of 6 minute intervals... nice for Mend. Also nice because most spawn times are 18 - 24 minutes, so it's easy to calculate.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck !</div></div><hr />

My favorite for my monk is &quot;Clean&quot; UI. Check it out, should be under the full sets  :)</div></div><hr />

I like the invisible text boxes for chat groups.  Any chance you could link that file or shoot me an email at chemfused@hotmail.com with the file.  Thanks would be greatly appreciated<br />

Awsome UI Fyste! Tried it, loved it, don't know how I managed without it in the past.<br />
<br />
Your target timer has helped me out so many times already, not just for mend but spawn times as well. The friends 12 second timer I removed since it wasn't as useful and I actually wanted to see my friends list.<br />
<br />
Only thing I might do with it is break out some cool buff icons instead of EQ default, but that would be about it, and that's a simple fix anyways.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much Fyste!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one that's on the Friend's list is EQUI_FriendsWnd.xml<br />
The other one is on the Target window EQUI_TargetWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Delete either of those two files in the fyste folder ( or whatever folder you installed the UI in ) and it will automatically use the default UI window.</div></div><hr />

I play 65 lvl monk on the TholuxePalles sever. I am very intrested in using this interface. But the problem i encounter when i download and extract the file then load it. It says in my window that the file is not compatiable with my current eq setting..something about Xml file or something..sorry i not very computer smart..my question is how do i tell which files i am missing or what files i need.. better still is there a patch i can download to make this interface updated so i can use it with out worries..of some incompatabilty promblems. Thanks <br />
