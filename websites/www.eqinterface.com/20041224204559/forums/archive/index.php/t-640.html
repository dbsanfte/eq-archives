One thing though, there is no way I could ever make my own skins.  Just not that tech inclined.  I have seen alot af great ideas/skins but not one complete set that I like.  <br />
<br />
Is there a way I can use lets say:<br />
1) the player window from one download or set, <br />
2) the gem icon from another download or set, <br />
3) the hot key/inventory box from yet another download or set, <br />
4) the spell book from from another download or set.<br />
<br />
<br />
A friend sent me a new UI and it of course had all the different files I had to put in the folders.  I liked a couple of the windows but I didnt like the fact I couldn't move the chat window around and I didnt like the player window.  I was thinking would it be just as easy to move swap the files out with ones I do like?  Any help would be appriciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the ones i have been writeing are self standing (does not require graphics)<br />
you just drop them in the dir you are going to use them with http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=607</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not all Graphic changes require modifications to the EQUI_Animations file. <br />
<br />
If you can modify the graphics within the current EQ size contraints, then you don't need to modify the file.<br />
<br />
However; there is currently an open bug that doesn't load the wnd_bg_light_rock.tga and the window_pieces01-05.tga files from the custom directories. Until this bug gets fixed, it will require modifications to the EQUI_Animations file to make them work.</div></div><hr />
