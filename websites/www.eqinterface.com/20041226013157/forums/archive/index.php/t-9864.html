<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LancerChronics</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently I downloaded a very nice UI from the beta section called Delta. It takes up most of the bottom of the screen. This works great for my HFL rogue but not for my OGR BL. I cant see what i am killing with it..and half the time i cant follow grp members because of it.. Is there a decent ui that is not necessarily oreiented on the top or bottom? I rather not use anything translucent cause it really annoys me.</div></div><hr />

So what I've done is gone through the downloads and mixed and matched the different things from different people that I like to make my own UI adam. (bonus points to whomever gets the reference).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freya</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i have been looking for a ui for beastlord barbarian style. seems like all i find  is for the  vah shir, though the cats look cool, where the  love?  i favor transparent windows so i can get a clear shot of what it is im fighting, since many skins i have seen are clumsy and in the way, best thus far and i still use, is the infinity2 &lt; i had to down load the  new version since  ldon messed my old one, but i get an auto equip so im happy.&gt;<br />
 as a barbarian beastlord, id like to see/find wolf pet gems and as any class or alt i play, perhaps a slim, and more of a view ui. for now im just  gonna have to mix and match if any one  has an idea of what im looking for can email me at  blazeya@nightschampions.com with a link &lt; i dont  come out to the forums too much im always  playin and there is a patch going atm.... thanks  in advance, and  no prob  thanks  anyways if  &lt;anyone &gt; is still looking for what they havent found.</div></div><hr />
