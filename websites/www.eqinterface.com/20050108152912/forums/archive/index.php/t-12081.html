<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakah</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I post files here and browse around quickly but for the most part, all Q&amp;A I do over at www.shakahr.com because its a ton easier.<br />
<br />
Here is the info you are seeking which was in your Mod already:<br />
<br />
Posted from the ReadMe file inside the ZIP of the WOW Emulated UI.<br />
<br />
Important Notes:<br />
--------------------------<br />
** All graphics have been recreated by hand to simulate the Warcraft UI. There are some portions that come from screenshots, etc. that are from the game that were submitted and were re-textured for clarity. You can visit the Warcraft website at www.blizzard.com/wow<br />
<br />
o  Two types of Cast Spell Bar Windows have been inclued (left and right)<br />
o  EXP and  AAEXP Hotbutton Windows versions are included<br />
o  Some parts of the WindowPieces graphics were done by Tking from the Celtic UI.<br />
o  Cyrssi’s specially made an Inventory for this particular UI, and has been included by default.<br />
o  Temporarily removed the Races pictures since they now do not fit with this version. But you can make your own!<br />
<br />
<br />
2 Files:<br />
<br />
EXP version of EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml<br />
AAEXP of EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml<br />
<br />
The current EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml IS the AAEXP. So if you want just plain ole EXP, delete the current EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml file, and rename EXP version of EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml back to EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml</div></div><hr />
