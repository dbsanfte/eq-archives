Hopefully without encringing too much on Wizards of the Coast licensing, have the Inventory/Player info window look like a character sheet, with class picture being done in a pencil sketch style, and CON listed instead of STA.  Have the spell gems somewhat resemble clear d20 die.  I think that style UI would really hit home for some players. <br />

So if you have natural strength is 100, ring gives you +2, it would show STR 100 + 2(green) = 102  Not sure if that's possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most 3d programs have a built in polygon creator that will do all the work for you increating d20's. I think the correct name is an isodecahedron or something along those lines. I know maya, 3ds max, and swift 3d all have these tools.<br />
<br />
Attached are 2 rendered dice, one with a reflective opaque blue skin and another with a transparent, refractive blue skin, sitting on a wood-type surface.<br />
<br />
I do think d20's would be coooooooool spell gems.<br />
<br />
Edit, I have a completed d20 with anatomically&lt;g&gt; correct numbers if any of you ui makers would like. I think I have it in 3ds max and swift 3d format.</div></div><hr />

Maybe have the spell bar be a set of die?  not sure how well that would show up at a good size for a spell bar though, maybe the player info in a dice format, each visible side has a stat/number?</div></div><hr />
