This Friday, October 18th CBS 48 hours is doing a story about us players i guess, wasn't to much info.  Just an FYI, feel free to have your say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaherashadowwol</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">forgot to put it in the time is 8pm est once again on CBS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyle Colussi</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen on the news and have done reports on people killing themselfs over Everquest. I have seen people say that Sony/Everquest is putting somthing in the game to make it &quot;addicting&quot;. I will take a guess and say that addicting part of the game is FUN.<br />
<br />
Fun as to kill things, lots of money, make fun of people, have a girl char. when your a guy and mess with other guys. Its just fun. My point is o wait I forgot my point. nm I think the show will be about the addicting part of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaherashadowwol</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I&quot;m sure it has nothing to do with the actual fun, we the eq players have.  I've heard nothing bout people killing themselves over a game but i'm not gonna sit here and say its not going to happen or that is hasn't.  Yes I do feel eq is a very addictive game.. its a very time based game.  You can turn the switch on and defeat your opponent in less then 1 hour i/e x-box games.  IMO they should do a full addiction to all games.  The game Halo on x-box actually had me away from eq for almost 1 month then couldn't advance any further.  GOt off subject, anyways i gotta agree that eq is addictive d/t fun for the same examples as mentioned above.  You kill dragons which mind you i've only done once but was still a blast and soon we'll be raiding gods homes and burning them what are they the reporters trying to say that we'll go around burning churches/ temples? TO me eq is a fun addictive game.<br />
<br />
/edit this was suppose to go with my response to is eq an addictive game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was in Feb-March a story going around about &quot;shawn wooley&quot; who among other things was an EQ-addict.. (he had some other problems as well) who killed himself. <br />
<br />
It is believed that something traumatic happened in EQ that sent him over the edge and he shot himself on the friday after thanksgiving in 2001.. <br />
<br />
if you do some digging you can find the whole story..and I am sure it will get mentioned friday<br />
<br />
if you search some of the EQ forums you will find the story.. <br />
<br />
BTW 48 hours comes on at 8 or 9 pm based on your time zone.. for PST it will be 9pm local.<br />

I'm gonna have to tape it to see what they say since no matter what time zone i'm in i'll still be at work :( and a friday is not a day i can play sick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldritch_goth</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:mad:  Okay...here's the deal... this is the same garbage that people have been saying about Dungeons &amp; Dragons for years, only now these freaked out parents are blaming EQ, Half-Life, Pokemon, and Harry Potter for their kids' &quot;unusual&quot; behavior. <br />
   Now I'm not saying that EQ is not addictive (cause it sure is, bugger all) but anybody that is gonna kill themselves and/or others because of a bloody game or because of KISS or AC/DC or because they read a book about a little boy that can do magic were probably a little off their rocker in the first place, and may have ended up doing the same thing if they played tiddleywinks and listened to Pat Boone and Rosemary Clooney.<br />
   I'm sorry but i get tired of this sort of thing bouncing into the media spotlight every so often. It is really unfortunate that some people feel the need to demonize anything they don't understand, becuase it may cause some people that would really enjoy this game to turn away because they are affraid of some CBS new report. It really is a shame.<br />
  Sorry about the rant. Its just something i feel strongly about ever since the crap i had to go through after the demonization of the goth scene after Columbine. Tragic events may happen, but I get sick of ppl trying to use stuff like this as an excuse instead of looking for some real answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I agree, NBC is much better. NBC has The West Wing, and Scrubs, and other stuff..CBS has..umh. I don't know. But they do have this show, so I guess I can accredit them with one watch.<br />
<br />
I believe 48 Hours is usually fairly good about representing both views, so hopefully they'll not be idiots and take the side of the woman, who in my opinion is wrong in her accusations. I believe she tried to file suit, or something? I'm certainly very disturbed and saddened that her son was driven to kill himself, just as i'm sure the folks at Sony are. However, I feel that there are no grounds to sue.<br />
<br />
For the man--and he was an adult, he wasn't just some highschooler--to have gone so far as to lose his mind to this game, so that he could not live with himself because something happened in the game; there had to be something else very wrong there. I feel his mother let it go way to far, even if he was &quot;out of her control&quot;, and he also must have had some kind of psychological depression or imbalance that would make him lose touch with reality like that. It could happen to anyone, i suppose; However, it happened to him. <br />
<br />
So, is EverQuest addictive? Yes. There's no question; it's a fun game that is built in such a way that it's hard to put down. To many players, the answer is &quot;Well, Duh.&quot; But can it be *blamed* for that? No. In my opinion, the judge should not even take the case, because it wouldn't be a fair trial; Either the jury (or other deciding members, i'm not familiar with civil suit law) would be made up of people biased against &quot;these newfangled computer gadgets&quot; or young people who wouldn't listen to anything the mother said. But, being a free country that can grand a woman 5 million dollars because she was too stupid to know that coffee is *hot*, I'd wager that it will be taken, if it hasn't been already. I guess i'll have to watch the show to find out; I haven't been following the suit.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, Verant's done all they can be expected to do, and should do. They expressed their condolances publically, and they've expressed that they aren't responcible for others' poor time management, and I've heard that there is currently a timer window on test that will alert people when they should get off, if they want to try to limit themselves. They can't raise people's children. They can't be expected to stop trying to make money &quot;honestly&quot; because some people can't stop playing their game. I really do feel sorry for the late son's family, but I don't feel that if it's anyone's fault, it is his own. It's unfair to try to make the grief process easier by sticking the blame on a party that doesn't deserve it. Those are my thoughts. Take them or leave them, or flame them, but please do it politely ^.^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaherashadowwol</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">went to look for myself to find the entire story bout the person whom killed themself, heres the site<br />
<br />
http://www.planeteq.com/features/editorials/stryker<br />
<br />
This is just for the clueless as i was that someone had supposobly commited suicide over eq.  I do send condolences to the family for such a loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thangor</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly what it comes down to is that people are always looking for someone else to blame for things. Take this mother for an example... she doesn't want to blame her son, so she tries to place blame on someone else.<br />
<br />
These days kids are padded up and armored to the core just to ride their bike. When I was a kid, kids were kids... they get hurt, they fall down... all kinds of things happened. However, it wasn't sensationalized by the media like it is today. Kids are a LOT more resiliant then people give them credit for.<br />
<br />
As for all this media stuff... well... to be honest, I don't really care much for any of the major broadcasting companies. Seems like most the time they're trying to make a big deal out of nothing in the pursuit of the evergreen dollar. It gets old pretty fast. Why don't they try talking about good news sometime. 99% of news shows should be called &quot;More Bad News&quot;... Hell... part of the reason I enjoy playing EQ so much is that it's more fun then watching TV most the time (Except &quot;Iron Chef&quot;... because that show rocks... and &quot;Junkyard Wars&quot; heheh)... but I think my point is made... this sort of thing is just dumb.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaherashadowwol</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think the way this is going it could start to get a little bad don't need to hear bout 1h typing eq players just a little to much there. lol.  But seriously I don't understand why the media wants to put so much emphasis on a game.  I remember when doom i believe it was came out they had a problem that is was to gory.  Now, the game producers and i'm talking bout x-box, ps2 and so on are coming out with Dave Mira xxx, where the whole goal is to save money to go to a strip club and they show actually footage or something couldn't tell upon screen shots in a mag i seen.  But the blame is on eq? We have games where you can assassinate Sadaam Hussein or you can be a soldier during WW2 and kill Nazi troops.  I just hope 48 hours does a good job in their investigation so to say and don't leave out that more and more kids i'm sure are going whats a tv when they aren't realizing that the square shaped object they stare at 24/7 actually shows real people not computer animated.  Where does it end?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember reading an article about (Stryker?) the guy who killed himself over EQ. I tried to find the article to save for permanence and could never find it again... but anyways, it told the whole story. The guy was on medications to begin with and it was suspected that he had quit them and was being antisocial before his death. The article was against EQ, but gave more info to support that the guy had serious problems before he did that. I believe that people were saying that he had reclused to his room for 2 weeks prior, etc etc. For some reason, all that info has dissappeared... Sounds like another Mathew Shepard case to me! (I live in Laramie... grew up here. Believe me, noone got the real story. Kenny was approached by Matt's parents who said they would let him only get life instead of death sentence if he kept his mouth shut, plus a bunch of other stuff... Matt actually was instigating a fight as well.)<br />
<br />
Also, talk about some pre-existing mental problems, there was a guy who let his friggin 2year old die because of neglect... yep, it was blamed on EQ as well.<br />
<br />
And what about the guy who KNEW he was prone to epileptic seizures and played EQ anyways? yeah... that's the one that got the warning about seizures put on your screen.<br />
<br />
Yeah, EQ is addictive... and I believe, sadly enough, that there's alot of people who are antisocial and depressed and hate people that use EQ as a virtual society. Yes, that's right... when they get mad and can't deal with the other people, they can just log off. Sounds reasonable, but when those people kill themselves because they can't even deal with a 'virtual society', EQ gets the brunt.<br />
<br />
You know what? I'm willing to bet that EQ has done more to keep kids off the streets on friday nights than the Boys Club has. And how many people would probably just sit with 20 chat room windows open if they weren't playing EQ? And how many people have found some kind of new hope or inspiration attributed to EQ? I BET THEY WON'T MENTION THAT, WILL THEY?!?<br />
<br />
Yep, you're right... Ozzy, Judas Priest, and D&amp;D all over again. Super nintendo never got blamed for us ditching school when super mario 3 came out, did it? Yeah... we spent just as much time on that damn grey box as I do on EQ now! My god... if I could've logged the hours I spent on Super Sprint...<br />
<br />
I gotta stop now... I'll fill up a whole page with this... just gets to me in a bad way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay this is starting to get annoying... but its part of the whole finger-pointing-Ive-gotta-blame-something-cause-it-can't-be-me/us/or anything else you can put in that section thing...<br />
<br />
Pre-1950 It was certain books like To kill a mockingbird and Catcher in the Rye (though it was published in 1951)..<br />
1950-1980 It was rock and roll along with heavy metal (though that war is still going on)<br />
1980-1990 It was Dungeons and Dragons and video arcade and home arcade systems (though that war is still going on also)<br />
1991-2002 Computer games starting with Castle Wolfenstein and DOOM.<br />
<br />
It only goes to show that if there isn't anything on the market that the people can point thier fingers at, then there's nothing for them to blame the poor state of society. Remember, in their eyes.. its always the fun things in life that is why society is going downhill.<br />
<br />
and its a shame I cant get CBS.. would like to see what crap they sling... Like the last show they did with &quot;Wolves vs Ranchers&quot; episode.. talk about a mistake show there, they only did one persons side of the story.. made headlines because the Interviewer had to make a public apology.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol... addict? Possibly... yes.<br />
Started playing right before Kunark release... here's a list of all characters I've ever had:<br />
<br />
&lt;can't remember name&gt; Barb War, L2<br />
Quesarr Darkart, Iksar SK, L32<br />
Verflixt Darkart, Iksar SK, L37<br />
Leger, Iksar Shammy, L19<br />
Sssissy Lallaa (main now), Iksar Necro, L41<br />
Bomms (A'Way), DE Wizzy, L5<br />
<br />
Now... if I was as addicted as some people try to claim, I would've had Ver and Sssissy to L60, and my Leger on the way, plus my wizzy to porting levels by now.<br />
<br />
Again, been playing since right before Kunark release (about 2 years+?). I know people that have stayed up on EQ for like a week just so they could play high end game the rest of the time...Let's call it Dedication, not Addiction! lol!</div></div><hr />

All I can say is... yes it can be addictive, but it takes your own mindset to judge when enough is enough. And if you are the ones who are easily addicted to such stimuli, then you should take a step back and review your level of enough. Yeah its too bad what happened to that guy, but there was probably other extenuating circumstances that we, the public, will never know. As it went with him when he died. If the game wasn't around it would of been something else, like say... the chat rooms or other games which you take on another persona. All in all, for most its just a game. But for others its their life, and maybe they should reevaluate theirs if it comes to this.<br />

I didnt get to actually watch the broadcast because Im in Saudi Arabia, but from what Ive heard its a bunch of bull.  Just because a lot people enjoy playing EQ dont mean that it makes it addictive.  I see an addiction as something that people need to have to keep them sane.  Do we really need EQ for that.  No, we play EQ because its FUN!</div></div><hr />

<br />
So am I or are we addicted?<br />
<br />
Hmmmm.... lets see. You tell me.<br />
<br />
I play EQ. My wife plays EQ and our kids play EQ.<br />
<br />
We have 13 accounts (ACTIVE) between us.<br />
<br />
I play 3 boxes at once.<br />
My wife plays 2 boxes at once.<br />
One of my kids played 2 boxes at once but now they use the other box to chat with friends while on line.<br />
<br />
I have a T1 internet connection. (No it is not just for EQ, LOL)<br />
<br />
My kids make straight A's in school.<br />
I am not on public assitance.<br />
My debts are paid, my bills are paid on time.<br />
<br />
So you tell me?<br />
Are we addicted?<br />
<br />
Oh, I forgot to add...<br />
We play 2 to 4 hours per weekday and all day weekends.<br />
