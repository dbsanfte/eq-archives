<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mirithal</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay we've all seen the posts (even some made by me ;p) about people wanting the old UI buff icons.<br />
<br />
Well I downloaded about 2-3 different versions of peoples and they were all so so.  What I've spent the majority of my time fooling around with is perfecting the buff sheets and gem icons.  The problem I'm having is that no matter how much I fool with it, I simply don't have the resources to perfect it for all classes.<br />
<br />
What I call this mod is more the Paladin Classic Buff Mod 1.0 :) <br />
<br />
I play a 62 paladin, so that's where tests were mainly made.  All major melee raid buff icons are set as well, except for these known issues:<br />
<br />
1) VoG.  There are only 2 haste icons I can find, the old style Augment Armbuff icon spot, and the pure haste foot icon spot.  The problem is VoG uses the arm not the foot, and for the life of me I don't know how to make it use anything but the arm without then changing the icon for the whole rest of that line.<br />
<br />
2) This only works perfectly for paladins 1-62, and there is one change I made I'm too lazy to go back and fix atm, and that's that the stamina/extinguish fatigue line is a white eye(invisible, see invis etc) and not a foot buff.<br />
<br />
3) Chorus of repleneshment sucks my wang.  I can't make it the blue brain buff without then making all direct heal spells blue brains in the spell book.  I was able to make the GEM icon a blue brain, and the heals remaind the blue hand, but that isn't perfect so I don't like it :D <br />
<br />
4) There are still a handful of buffs that use the default UI's icon, but like I said I didn't know how to adjust them since I don't know what some of them are, especially those that look like specific uber mob debuff/AEs and rogue poisons.<br />
<br />
5) THE ONE old world Icon I don't have and haven't been able to get a good file of is the druid/ranger line DS (that brown bush/tree thingy) mucho helpful if someone could get me an apropriately sized screencap of one.<br />
<br />
What I need YOU to do is to download this mod, install it, and then hopefully you're all uber graphic designers or something and can give me back a perfect version ;p or at least just take VERY SPECIFIC notes so I can update the mod.  <br />
<br />
What I need to make changes:<br />
What Spell you specifically need changed<br />
What Spell LINE the spell belongs to<br />
What the buff icon and gem icon look like *BE SPECIFIC*<br />
What the buff icon and gem icon need to be changed to *BE SPECIFIC*<br />
<br />
What I would LIKE from you for the changes (but know most probobly can't do):<br />
Change requests accompanied with screenshots of what the buffs look like and what they need to be changed to<br />
-OR-<br />
You to simply change it yourself and post the .tga file.<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoy, and love them as much as I do, I certainly missed em, hope some of you can help us get them perfect, I'm going to keep trying and anything I can get fixed I'll update here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mirithal</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, will put one up as soon as I can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bold</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But if you could please modify the haste icon back to the boot, and fix the mark of retribution / mark of karn gem icon it shows as a buff icon instead of the magnifying glass icon ie the bind affinity on the gem bar but shows correctly in the book this would be all but perfect!!  By far the best set i have seen to date and the spell gem icons are crystal clear!! Good work. <br />
<br />
p.s I play a cleric and the only other thing though this doesnt bother me is currently our DD spells show as a skull, the default icon for this is like the healing icon just with a red hand not a blue one.<br />
<br />
<br />
again thanks<br />
<br />
pps  and that's that the stamina/extinguish fatigue line is a white eye(invisible, see invis etc) and not a foot buff.<br />
this one too hehe.</div></div><hr />
