<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, when someone comes up and says &quot;Hail, Grottel&quot;.  I want my computer to say &quot;Hail&quot; in the appropriate type voice file (which could be player specified).  Doesn't have to be complete speech, but I give the ability of existing code floating on the internet its very possible to make EQ talk.<br />
<br />
I would want the following features available:<br />
- default triggers: chat strings, events<br />
- default sounds when trigger are activated.<br />
- customize list of triggers and specify external sound files for each trigger.<br />
<br />
Currently, the game is running on its default sound triggers.  Now while I have no idea how the engine is running it can be modeled as  Trigger:Sound<br />
<br />
Chat Triggers<br />
Chat_You are low on food:&quot;C:\sound\StomachGrowl.wav&quot;<br />
Chat_Long Live the king:&quot;C:\sound\Trumpets.wav&quot;<br />
(result- when anyone says &quot;Long live the king&quot; I would hear the sound of trumpets playing.<br />
<br />
Game Event Triggers<br />
LevelUp:Ding (default)<br />
DroppedItem:&quot;C:\sound\DropIt.wav&quot; (says &quot;dont need that&quot;)<br />
Hailed_Female:&quot;C:\sound\girlsayshi.wav&quot; (says &quot;Hello&quot;)<br />
Hailed_Male:&quot;C:\sound\hail-mail.wav&quot; (says &quot;Hail, Grottel&quot;)<br />
PickupCoin:KaChing (default)<br />
BardSong_&lt;Name&gt;:&quot;C:\sound\selo.mid&quot; (plays a song)<br />
<br />
and then there would be defaults that are there but they wouldn't let you modify<br />
<br />
[zonename]BrowseVendorMusic:[zone]Music (default)<br />
MoveGrassRun<br />
MoveGrassWalk<br />
MoveRockRun<br />
MoveRockWalk</div></div><hr />

So it's already like halfway there...</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about &quot;Red warrior shot the food!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Chat_Long Live the king:&quot;C:\sound\Trumpets.wav&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I dub thee, Sir Loin of beef, Ace of Spades, Water of Ten...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
LevelUp:Ding (default) <br />
<br />
&quot;CHA-CHING&quot; from that fast food commercial....<br />
<br />
<br />
BardSong_&lt;Name&gt;:&quot;C:\sound\selo.mid&quot; (plays a song)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah... the A-Team:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer to have them wired to 9volt battery myself - but that would be possible if the other person had it set up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bzfreek</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its posable via 3rd part software to make anything that appears in the log an event to triger just about anything.  But the UI is just the screens and mouse that you see on top of the game so you can interact with it.  I think they put those sound event tags in the SIDL is that mostlikly we will eventually be able to have sound effects when we click a hot button or something like that not so much when something in the game happens (like attacking sounds we can't change those)</div></div><hr />
