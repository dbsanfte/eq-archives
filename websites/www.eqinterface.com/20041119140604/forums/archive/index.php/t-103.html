<br />
Now onto biz .  I will be trying to keep you folks as upto date as i can for full mods . <br />
<br />
So far from all my pokeings seems we have a lot to play with , <br />
<br />
1.) the image files . <br />
    these can be done how ever you want <br />
all file info , and the location and size of the area to use can be defined in the xml for that window . <br />
<br />
2.) No you can not make new buttons , but you can move and redo old ones. <br />
<br />
3.) Still loking into the makeing of new windows . Aka makeing a new window for spells<br />
<br />
I'll fill yah in as far as details as i go along .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alshain</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the number of windows is also going to be limited by the current set.  We can't add a window to the UI without a program modification to support that window.  However, I have noticed some of the EQUI_*Window.xml files aren't included in the list of windows in EQUI.xml.  This may mean that there are some windows not currently being used that we can hijack for our own uses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenaka2k</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was looking at that also .  Atm i am trying to compile a list of items needed in each current window . I am in the process of makeing a WYSIWYG editor for the UI . I want to make sure all optins that can be played with are there :) any info you may have feel free to toss it at me :) Can use all the help i can get on this one :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
not everyone has (access to) photoshop and gimp is not even worth it.<br />
<br />
not everyone is artistic, on a computer no less!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenaka2k</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no offense ment Tefrod, but i am not sure how your post relates to this thread ..............   But i do agree with you not every one has the tools or the skills to do the art . Then again that is why places like EqInterface.com where created. :)  And These fine forums , for ppl who can't do mods on there own to request of the ones who can .</div></div><hr />
