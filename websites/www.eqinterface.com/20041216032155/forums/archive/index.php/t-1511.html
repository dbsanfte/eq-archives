Then, I was also wondering on where you put this file, because I followed the FAQ on how to make a skin and that didn't work, and then i troubleshot it and it still didn't work.  I'm desperately seeking help as to how to get this to work.  The sooner I can figure this out, the sooner I can get my map mod into game.  Anyone's help is greatly appreciated.  <br />

I'm not really sure what qualifies as &quot;sweet,&quot; but surely something there will interest you.  If not, perhaps you could better define what it is that you are looking for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Sweet&quot; is not very informative.... <br />
<br />
To me &quot;Sweet&quot; is functional with minimal impact to my visual area... meaning I can see more of the room i am standing in than a bunch of useless graphics.<br />
<br />
To other people &quot;Sweet&quot; is lots of cool graphics on each window that are specific to thier class... this is opposite of what I want because graphics take up space. :eek:<br />
<br />
And yet to another group of people &quot;Sweet&quot; has nothing to do with function or visual appeal... it is all about the fact that they made it themselves and it is unique. :cool:<br />
<br />
Almost all the Mods are out here... just look around and grab stuff you want.... if it isn't here... write the mod and sent it in.  Just a fair warning though... not everything is moddable.... some parts of some windows have to stay exactly where they are.... like the DONE or COMBINE buttons in containers.... or trying to move a actions menu items to go along side of your hotkeys to make it look like you have 15 hotkeys... it doesn't work. :(</div></div><hr />

Basically, it will be keeping the inventory viewable all the time.  I have condensed it, and surprisingly the whole UI is taking up very little space and is being made to shrink the viewport, while keeping the proper aspect ratio...</div></div><hr />

I need to update the screenshot though.  I have a slightly newer spell gem bar thing now, t. king's free-floating one.  I've also removed the friends window timer, since there was an error in it that I need to get an update on.  The blue borders, backgrounds, inventory, songbook, container mod, and all that important stuff is intact and up-to-date with the recent patches.   I won't make any guarantees about downloading the individual pieces at this point, however, since I haven't updated those links yet. =)  Just grab the whole thing, and switch out whatever you don't like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Look around this site a bit, find yourself a UI bag mod that shows the primary and secondary slots at the top of the bag when you open the container.<br />
<br />
Now stuff all of your weapons/instruments into a ten-slot bag, open the bag and put it where clicking to swap is easy for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
TA DA!  Ten slots to swap from and no need to give up general inventory slots anymore.  After using such a mod for a week or so I can't imagine doing without it.</div></div><hr />

I also wanted to note that my UI is back up and running now, I've fixed everything to be in line with the 2-24-03 patch and updated my website and .zip accordingly.<br />

Everything is clean and stashed along the bottom of the screen to give max viewing room.  The bag you have to open after each zone.  Trust me, that's the one thing you don't want to live without as a bard.<br />
<br />
I want to eliminate the inventory slots on the hotkey bar, as I never use them over my swap bag.  Haven't figured out enough code to do it without destroying the UI yet, however.<br />

hi all <br />
<br />
i want to know if theres someone here enough knowledgeable in bard playing and xml file to do a cool and useful bard UI  <br />
<br />
<br />
I downloaded Celtic's 1.1 UI from this website, sorry not a URL jock but it's great for a bard.<br />
<br />
the bard song window is small as the spell icons window.  set them side by side and you'll be able to pretty much keep track of what up and down and know what song to hit.  Heh if your paying attention.  your primary usage slots bags and such can be set up so targeting, instrament switching song twisting etc is easily done with minimum of mouse movement.<br />
<br />
The extended time buff's icons are greatly reduced in size and fit out of the way on the left or right side of your screen, all 15 slots.  move your text box to one side or the other.  personnally I changed my entire game set up from all spells etc being set on the left side to the right side because it allowed me to put song effects beside the spells and line them up.<br />
<br />
Compass is a VAST improvement over the EQ default.  directions are much more readable when bleary eyed LOL.<br />
<br />
Over all because of the greatly reduced size of buff's icon and spell bar and most other boxes you'll free up probably 1/4th to 1/3rd of your screen for much much easier targeting when pulling and still have all those windown open.<br />
<br />
I actually set the buttons, bags window which cleaverly has all item slots shown on the right up over the stats, combat button, skills window (the one with sit and camp on it) so that if I need one of those things I can tough the tab, just above my primary items and hot key junk, do the skill etc and touch bags hot key window to put it on top.  Further free's up image area for less stuff in the way of what you wanna see.  This is also part of why I changed sides for spells bar etc.  I don't normally need to see or get at all inventory junk so when I open my bag of bardy goodies for instraments weapons etc it pops up over those much less used item slots but leaves my hot key slots uncovered on the hot key side of the window. <br />
<br />
Great UI.<br />
