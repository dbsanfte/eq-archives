<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed that many of the UI's posted recently are missing screenshots.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact that my updated Player Window (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3385) has a valid  .jpg file attached to it (I can see it when I go to edit/update my UIs) but when I click on the View Picture ioption in the listing it's blank.<br />
<br />
I've noticed ithe same thing on several other new (since the board upgrade) files, such as This One (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3044) so it doesn't look like they were lost in the crossover.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd bring it to your attention. Am I the only one not seeing the pictures? Or is it a global problem?<br />
<br />
In the meantime is there anything I need to/should do to make the screnshot on my UI visible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem comes when the author uploads a picture then uploads another one and deletes the first one. Since the first one is deleted it doesnt show the others. Thats a big bug I still need to figure out how to fix. What you need to do is remove all the attached images, submit, then go back and attach the image again.  <br />
<br />
We dont have this problem in our moderation queue so we see all the pictures and approve it.</div></div><hr />

HELP! hehe, thanks</div></div><hr />

I have a completede UI, called Delta3 M2, and updated it recently along with the preview images of what it looks like. It's those images that are not showing when people look at my currently updated UI on EQ Interfaces.<br />

Here is the link to my UI<br />

There was an if statement that was only looking at the first image if it was there or not and if the first one was deleted and the 2nd one wasnt it wouldnt show the pictures.</div></div><hr />

Can you peek at my Infiniti Redux update please?<br />
<br />
I updated the JPG and initially it showed fine but realized I used the wrong SS, went back and attempted to fix it by removing the incorrect version and uploading the corrected one but now nothing ahows in the Image Manager or File Updater...<br />

Color me frustrated :P</div></div><hr />
