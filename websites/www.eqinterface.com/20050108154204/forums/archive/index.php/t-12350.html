<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can read all about it at www.worldofwar.net<br />
<br />
They have a rather detailed explination of everything. Including many screeshots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was surprised by the sign-up questions.  They did not ask as much about my gaming experience as I had expected.<br />
I would have at least have thought that when you put in &quot;other&quot; they would ask what other games you have played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They're probably not concerned by other non-mainstream MMORPG as they are with the common popular titles out there (i.e., EQ, DAoC, PS, etc.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With Horizons looming around the corner, you'd think they would like to know if a person has played it in beta already.  I think that EQII and Horizons are likely to be WOW's biggest competetors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellyana</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Horizons is the biggest disappointing MMORPG i have ever purchased. I amnot the only one who feels that way. You should read the officials message board. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in beta II and stopped playing because the game could not hold my interest.<br />
<br />
The graphics were spectacular, and the concept was good, but it lacked that something special that would ahve kept me there.<br />
<br />
One of the things that I look most forward to with WOW is the community that Blizzard creates with it's games.  <br />
Blizzard is the Tarentino of gaming, they create cult classics that are always fun to go back and play.</div></div><hr />

I think once WoW and EQII are available the clientele of Horizons will migrate en masse to greener pastures.</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
<br />
while the game offered some interesting aspects, I couldn't mass up interest enough to stick beyond my free month...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sounds a lot like my experience with Earth and Beyond.  Great concept, but lacking in gameplay content.  There were really only 4 things to do, fight, explore, trade and make items.  After awhile this gets boring.  Once you play one class you've pretty much played them all.  I played it for 6 months before i got bored and came back to EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woot, that was your 200th post Inokis! And this is my 100th!<br />
Gratuitous? Definately.<br />
<br />
So...anyone playing a MMOG besides EQ that actually has star power?</div></div><hr />

Lineage 2 looks very good awaiting beat on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys, I just wanted to let everyone know that if you signed up using a Yahoo or Hotmail account that they deleted your registration.<br />
<br />
Originally there was nothing stopping these addresses and unfortunately they did not notify anyone that had done so.  I stumbled upon the information when my brother tried to register.<br />
<br />
Here is a copy of the correspondance from Blizzard:<br />
Hello Brian,<br />
<br />
If you have previously signed up for the beta with a hotmail or yahoo email address then we have deleted your registration. Please go back through the registration process with your new email address, and resubmit your registration. You will not be disqualified for resubmitting if you had a hotmail or yahoo email account registered originally.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raynsmajic</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why can't hotmail or yahoo email users register with those emails?<br />
taht doesnt make sense...<br />
<br />
and if i am reading that email correctly, they said that he has to resubmit his registration, ubt if he does, he will be disqualified<br />
<br />
<br />
ok, im really confused</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teddyboy420</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am VERY interested in WoW. WIth Blizzards history of great games, and the meticulous attitude they have, I really think (hope) that WoW is going to be something spectacular. The only thing I worry about is the player base, the Blizzard WoW forums are filled with a bunch l33t children.<br />
<br />
I too was in Horizons beta, and bought the game, even though by the end of beta I didn't want to, I changed my mind because one of my good friends got it. One thing about Horizons is, the game had, and still has alot of potential. Artifact is actually starting to listen to their customers (they haven't payed too much attention to their players suggestions since early beta). If they can live up to the potential of their game, it will be a pretty enjoyable game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the reason why they didn't listen to the customers during beta, it turned out that the individuals that dealt with the feedback and bug address, more or less ignored as well as deleted large amounts of the emails and reports. Thereby much of issues weren't dealt with. Once Artifact found out about these individuals, they were immediately released and emails were sent out to all testers. As my wife and I received this email about the situation. And from this experience, Artifact swore to respond to issues within the game. Needless to say, this situation floored me when I got the email about it...</div></div><hr />

Most likely it's to help prevent multiple submittions. People can always change their name and street addr, but they can't always change their email address.<br />
<br />
Could also say it's cause most of the spam from there. Their systems might filter out Yahoo and Hotmail address completely. I can tell you from experience, I'm about ready to completely filter out Hotmail address myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raynsmajic</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, i asked my brother about it, and his explanation was that Yahoo and Hotmail aren't considered real EMails, which, i cna kind of understand....<br />
so, being that i am lucky to have cable internet that comes with 7 available email accounts, i figured out how to make one of them and was able to register<br />
<br />
and hopefully i will actually have some good luck in my life and get accepted for the beta, would be really kewl<br />
<br />
(hehe, and as an afterhtought, wow, i am actually using Microsoft Outlook now.... amazing :D )</div></div><hr />
