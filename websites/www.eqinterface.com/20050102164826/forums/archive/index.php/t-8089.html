<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adventurer</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded the same ones. Place all of the files into your EverQuest\Storylines folder. Reload your UI and you should get a message saying that you have new unread storylines.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQKobara</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, these story files do NOT go into your custom UI folder.. simply unzip the files so they keep the folder names in the zipped file and place them into your \everquest\storyline folder. They should then show up as a new story when you open your story window in your UI. <br />
<br />
If they dont, then perhaps your custom UI has done some modification to the Story window by design and you may need to use the default UI to see the menus in your Story window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQKobara</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, went back and looked at the way the files unzipped and realized that the problem may be in the way you are putting those files and folders into place...<br />
<br />
Example using LothBake:<br />
<br />
Step one--- unzip files<br />
Step two--- open the LothBake folder... move the file named  &quot;StoryLothBake&quot; into the /storyline folder of the EQ directory<br />
move folder named EQTRADERS into /storyline folder<br />
<br />
That should allow the recipes to work as intended.<br />
<br />
The author of the Loth recipe lists should have probably included a readme file in his download that explained this better... the folder named LOTHBAKE and LOTHBREW should NOT be kept but can be deleted after you have moved the storyLothBake and storyLothBrew files into the /storyline folder where all the others are.</div></div><hr />
