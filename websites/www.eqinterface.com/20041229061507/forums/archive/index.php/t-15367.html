<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eqinterface.com/images/sections/directx.gif&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Nvidia has released a new texture based compression tool with the extention .dds. The Microsoft DirectDraw Surface (.dds) is part of DirectX 9. You can read more about the format it self at msdn (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/directx/graphics/reference/ddsfilereference/ddsfileformat.asp).<br />
<br />
You can find the photoshop and other plugin info at Nvidia's site HERE (http://developer.nvidia.com/object/nv_texture_tools.html)<br />
<br />
Sokol and I have done some experiementing and found that you can use DDS files in your UIs.<br />
<br />
Upside<br />
Files are 10% of the file size of a TGA. (TGAs that are 1meg become 100k)<br />
<br />
Possible Downsides<br />
DDS UIs are not cross compatible with TGA UIs. Trying to merge them in experiements caused crashes<br />
<br />
If you want to see DDS UI at work, you can download the Solaria test HERE (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=3740). Its a stand alone version of our UI to test the DDS files. <br />
<br />
We have added a category in the forums for DDS discussion (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=60). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiniyen</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">shouldn't the topic say &quot;Use .dds files in your ui now&quot; since eq has been able to read .dds files since luclin(i believe it was luclin)? Eq uses the dds format for zone textures and player/npc skins. Sorry if I seem a bit stupid as this website is all about everquest uis so I should get the idea instantly that you mean uis can use them now but I felt like pointing that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The interface couldn't use .dds until EQ's gfx engine was upgraded to use directx9 since dds part of directx9 sdk. So it has only been a month or so since EQ's interface could use .dds.<br />
<br />
Since many havent played with dds we figured other authors would like to experiment with the file format for the eq interface graphics. With more people experimenting more information can be found about this file format in relationship to the EQ Interface.<br />
<br />
Luclin upgraded the gfx engine to dx8.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyns</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the only upside is the size of the file, why not just Compress the tgas?<br />
<br />
I assume the 1 meg tga you were talking about was solWindowPieces01.tga.. I took that file and saved it as a compressed(RLE) tga and it reduces the size from 1025kb to 118kb..  <br />
<br />
I'm sure DDS has better compression. But, there seems to be some loss of image quality/sharpness.. Look at the the buttons in solWindowPieces01.dds and compare to the tga version(original picture)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiniyen</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes luclin did upgrade eq to DX8 but DDS was introduced with 7 not 9.<br />
The DDS format has been used since luclin. so instead of the title being eq reads a new format it should be more like &quot;eq can now use the dds filetype with uis&quot;.</div></div><hr />
