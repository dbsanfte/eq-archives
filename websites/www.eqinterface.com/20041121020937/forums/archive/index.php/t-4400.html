<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chakarum</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm attempting to make a window across the top of the screen to contain my stats, saves, some clickies, and titles.  I think I have everything working, it looks excellent in SidlWidl, and I don't get any errors when I load the skin, but the window does not show up!  I have edited the <br />
<br />
    &lt;Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
      &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
<br />
information, to no avail, and I even went into my Character's UI_Soandso_00.ini file and looked up the window information.<br />
<br />
[TargetWindow]<br />
XPos1024x768=0<br />
YPos1024x768=0<br />
BGTint.red=255<br />
BGTint.green=255<br />
BGTint.blue=255<br />
Fades=true<br />
Delay=0<br />
Duration=500<br />
Alpha=255<br />
FadeToAlpha=255<br />
Locked=true<br />
Show=1<br />
XPos800x600=0<br />
YPos800x600=0<br />
<br />
Everything seems to be good on this end, so could someone PLEASE help me and let me know why the window is not appearing on my screen?<br />
<br />
P.S.  If someone can help me get the .tga file to show up on the far right side of the bar, I would be very very happy.</div></div><hr />

i sometimes see post that are moved? why maybe this is  where they wanted it..were they ask'ed if they wanted it moved.and who is doing the moving.  <br />
They are moved because there are specific forums for specific topics.  If you are looking for a mod to download and go to the &quot;Released&quot; forum, would you appreciate looking through 5 pages of &quot;Help me&quot; posts?  Comparably, if I am surfing the site checking to see if anyone needs help on something, I won't necessarily check the &quot;Released&quot; forum, so a &quot;Help me&quot; post that is there won't be seen.   As for who is doing the moving, that would be the site administrators and moderators.</div></div><hr />
