<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Enoks UI, Enoks UI Mini and Enoks UI tking (versions 7, 3 and 3, respectively) will be uploaded shortly after the EQ servers come back up, gotta do one last test, if the percentages really disappear when you don't have a target/groupmember like the patch message says, that'd suck and I'd have to add custom percents so they'd always be visible...<br />

Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - My chat windows are now super cool and hopefully the EQ UI world will love them. Also redid a buttload of graphics on all three UIs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are tested, good to go, and uploaded. They should be available soon. Two significant UI advancements are a &quot;condition&quot; gauge in the inventory (Enoks UI and Enoks UI tking) and chat windows with an improved &quot;Sneeze Guard&quot; with an unlock button in the upper right corner.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - Enoks UI needs a real powerhouse comp to run well, here are my framerates (in the nexus, staring at a wall, they are averaged over a one minute period):<br />
Default: 78<br />
Enoks UI Mini: 81<br />
Enoks UI tking: 84<br />
Enoks UI: 47 (ugh)<br />
I did a LOT of work making Enoks UI Mini and Enoks UI tking run well, as you can see they outperform the default UI. Enoks UI is sickeningly complicated with over 300 visible gauges on screen most of the time.<br />
<br />
P.P.S. - Also, I want feedback on Enoks UI tking v3, if enough people REALLY want it I'll make a mirrored version of every graphically fancy window and a horizontal buff and song window (one set that goes right to left like normal horizontal buff windows, and one set that goes left to right).</div></div><hr />

At least the player, group, pet, and both buff windows. hehe<br />
<br />
Hope you do the mirrored version, have been looking forward to the release of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, somethings up, all three of my submissions are no longer awaiting approval but they also aren't available for download... were they all mistakenly denied? Kudane, Dolby, someone who moderates file submissions, please help.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - I was really hoping they'd be approved by now, I'm not at the computer that I made the UIs on and was planning on getting them to use when I play tonight... guess I can't and I won't get back to my UI comp 'til friday, so if they were denied I can't resubmit for a whole 24 hours at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daydream</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">waiting patiently for version 3 of Enok UI tking to be uploaded .... =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here's the plan:<br />
I return to my good comp on friday at like 6 or 7 am. As soon as I get there, I'll upload all three UIs again so they can get approved ASAP. Then, at about 11 am I'll start work on my mirrored version. That should be done by late friday. Then I'll make the horizontal and reverse horizontal spell buff windows, that'll take 'til monday though I suspect since I'll have to chop up tons of graphics and hack together a left-to-right loading buff window.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - Here's how I use my UIs:<br />
Enoks UI v7: most of the time<br />
Enoks UI Mini v3: second account in a tiny window<br />
Enoks UI tking v3: if I need a framerate boost (some luclin zones, bazaar, raiding)<br />
The newest Enoks UI v7 and Enoks UI tking v3 are designed to have roughly the same window sizes so if I toggle between them repositioning windows isn't necessary unless I want the tking UI to be lined up against the right edge and for windows to not overlap a tiny bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All three uploaded as of 6:20 AM Friday morning.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - They are now all available for download.<br />
<br />
P.P.S. - Enoks UI tking v3 Mirrored is now available for download.</div></div><hr />
