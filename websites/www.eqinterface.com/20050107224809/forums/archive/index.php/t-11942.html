Also don't see myself getting it. If i'm gonna start on another mmorpg i'll go to FF11 rather then flock with the newbs from EQ.

I hate to bring this even more off topic but believe me... no matter what game you play there will ALWAYS be a great amount of &quot;morons that lack honor&quot;. So I can assure you playing a different game will not remedy that problem unless if it’s on your own private server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking forward to this game.  If the direction that SOE has been heading with it's games is any indicator I expect that it will run much smoother for the quality than many of the competition games.<br />
<br />
I like the factions in this game, and the &quot;invisible war&quot; they create.  Not only is advancing your own personal level important, but so is advancing your faction.  I hope that this will create more RP, something that I miss from EQLive.<br />
<br />
Now as far as the iksar goes, I don't think that there is anything special.  Even in EQII they are still just stupid leezards.<br />
<br />
I just want one thing....kerran rangers.  I wanted Vah Shir when SoL came out, hopefully EQII will give me my jollies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
p4 1.7ghz 1024ram  fx5600 256<br />
back to the topic..<br />
<br />
I thought they looked pretty darn good.</div></div><hr />
