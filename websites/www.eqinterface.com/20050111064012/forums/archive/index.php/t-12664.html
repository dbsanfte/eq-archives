Only thing I miss is an attack indicator. Something that clearly flashes when I have attack on, is this possible? :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darl</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The file that controls that window is named &quot;EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml&quot;.  In Vertminimal2, I've replaced the buttons that show and hide windows with a display of your stats and resists.  I chose to make this modification because there are keyboard commands to toggle those windows.  However, if you prefer using the mouse over keyboard commands, you have two options.<br />
<br />
1.  Delete the &quot;EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml&quot; file from the Vertminimal2 folder.  You'll get a sort of gross looking version of the default window, but it'll work.<br />
<br />
2.  Copy the file from my original Vertminimal UI into the Vertminimal2 folder.  I think the earlier version is missing some of the buttons, but it will look better and should be functional enough.  Mind you, it's vertical, because all the horizontal real estate was already occupied.  Download the earlier version here. (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2036) <br />

Post if you have any problems.<br />
