<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry it took so long- finally bug-free, tested on 3 different computers, with and without PoP.<br />
<br />
BlueFantasy is an attempt to give a strong fantasy feel to Everquest by replacing the modern-feeling new UI with a more elaborately decorative and roleplay-appropriate set of graphics. It is also designed to maintain and improve upon the functionality of the new UI, and to provide all possible 'bells and whistles'.<br />
<br />
It's strongly geared to casters, especially those who use pets at least from time to time, but there's no reason you can't replace the pet window and remove the spellbar if you're a melee class. Upcoming releases will include a druid/ranger specific version and a melee version- but there's no reason any class wouldn't be able to use this UI right now.<br />
<br />
Credits:<br />
buff window by Cairenn, loc wizard by Atheenah, blue compass by Sylverpaw, gauges by Mynlaeni, spell icons, gem icons, and spellbook by t.king with modifications by Remelio. Group window is by Cairenn for KaoUI with some of my own modifications; inventory by t.king, shrunk by me. All other windows by me and/or Sony.<br />
<br />
BlueFantasy is designed to run in 1280x1024; it won't fit in anything smaller, as the hotbutton window is 1280 pixels wide to accomodate your hotbuttons, clickies, general inventory slots, xp and aaxp bars, and your target. You should set your viewport to 0 0 1280 761. (this should reduce lag for those who can't run at high resolutions- and the windows look best opaque anyway, so you wouldn't be able to see what's behind them even if you didn't /viewport)<br />
<br />
Here's a screenshot; I'm uploading it to the downloads section, will link to it once it's approved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that should fix things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great UI other than that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dodar</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok nm fixed it ... seems that player 3 name tag is 200 out of position. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
and the lag...I really don't know :( but try Pickk999's fix, it may help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zephraim</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a great skin.  I only have one problem though.  I can't drag the windows.  My track window is too far off the viewable area of the screen.  Is there a way to manually move the windows?

I had to copy the old EQUI and Group Window file over the fixed on. Otherwise the default skin would load. But by using the old files I cannot get the raid windows to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as far as moving the windows...not much I can do except put the title bar back on or make the window non-resizeable. Best way to make sure you can put them where you want them is to drag all your windows near the center of the screen while the default is loaded, then load the custom skin and move the windows where you want them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zephraim</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I found a way to move the windows.  The problem was that when I created a new window, the bottom of the window was outside the viewable area of the screen.  So, I just went into GUI_Zephraim72.ini (or something to that extent), and resized the window manually.  Once I did this, I logged in and was able to resize/drag it to my liking.  Once again, I love the GUI.  Keep 'em coming!<br />

There is some problem with the inventory window tho.  It's as if the background is not the same size as the inventory.  Any idea what's wrong or how to fix?  I don't see anyone else posting w/the same problem.  I'm not sure if it is something they did when installing it.<br />

Tell your friend to open his tk_inventory.tga file and see what size it is- it should be 374x374. Other than that...try deleting the UI_YourCharacterName_YourServerNumber file, see if that helps?</div></div><hr />

Might want to try downloading the new version if he can run in 1280x1024.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tema</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this skin and will probaly use it for my cleric she likes blue. I love the inventory it is like tkings but so much smaller. I love his inventories but running 1024 768 they are so big. How did you make them smaller. Can you just do an inventory mod without the color blue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to make an 'inventory package' with shrunken versions of all t.king's inventories- but meanwhile, if you have any graphics editing program, all you have to do is download the t.king Celtic inventory, scale it down to 374x374, and put that, my EQUI_Inventory.xml and my tkinvgauges.tga into your custom skin file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasus</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the skin.. but one question for you.. If I want different items in the clickie area, how do I go about doing that.<br />
<br />
I need head bracers, gaunts, arms boots ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
go to the file in your custom directory labeled EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml and open it with WordPad.<br />
<br />
Search For InvSlot34,35,40,41,42,43, or 44. These are your rightclick boxes, from left to right; find whichever one you want to change.<br />
<br />
the code should look something like this:<br />
<br />
&lt;InvSlot item=&quot;InvSlot34&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;ScreenID&gt;InvSlot34&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
    &lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
    &lt;Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;X&gt;374&lt;/X&gt;<br />
      &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;30&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;30&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
    &lt;Background&gt;A_InvEar&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
    &lt;EQType&gt;1&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt;<br />
    &lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
  &lt;/InvSlot&gt;<br />
<br />
go to the above link and find the EQtype for the slot you want to make available. In the code find the line &lt;EQType&gt;number&lt;/EQType&gt; (in bold above) and change the number to the one for the slot you want.<br />
<br />
You'll probably also want to change the background for the current slot to the one for the slot you want. The backgrounds for inventory slots are named A_InvEar, A_InvNeck, A_InvHead, A_InvFace, A_InvChest, A_InvAboutBody (think that's the back), A_InvArms, A_InvShoulders, A_InvWrist, A_InvWaist, A_InvHands, A_InvRing, A_InvLegs, A_InvFeet, A_InvPrimary, A_InvSecondary, A_InvRange, and A_InvAmmo.</div></div><hr />

I was wondering though, I haven't been able to get the Buff window to come up.  Using the Alt-B (the default keyboard command to show the Buff window) doesn't seem to work.  Any suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah. The buff window is transparent. There is a visible handle on it but sometimes it's hard to find. If you put a few buffs on, load the default interface, drag the buff window to the center of your screen and then /loadskin bluefantasy 1, you should see it and be able to move it.</div></div><hr />

Oh, one other question-- The main chat window doesn't seem to want to move,  although the other windows are moveable.  I made sure the windows weren't locked, but I'm not sure if there's something else that I could doing wrong.   Is there a way to move the main chat window?<br />
