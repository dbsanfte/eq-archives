<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have gone and corrected the two files that are impacted by the 1/9/03 patch.  The two files that Sony changed that impact the skin are the PetInfoWindow and the Selectorwindow.  I have included the two files in the attached zip file.  I have also added them to the Complete Set file in the Complete Sets section of the downloads.  The updated Complete Sets version is numbered ChronRight25.zip.  It is not showing in there yet but it has been uploaded and will be there as soon as Kudane is able to catch up on patched file uploads.  Till then you can use this file to update your skin to work with out any errors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well at this point the full version in the Complete Set section of the Downloads has not been updated yet.  If you want to get the error to go awayy for the ChronRight skin you will need to down load this patch here and replace those files in your skin dir.  Once you do that you will be good to go.</div></div><hr />
