 Every now and then, I'll get an email with information regarding an new or updated upload; while I don't mind at all, that info needs to get to Kudane (http://www.eqgui.com/member.php?action=mailform&amp;userid=9), who moderates the submissions.<br />
<br />
 Totally unrelated to the UI, have you heard about EQ for the Pocket PC (http://EQpocket.station.sony.com)? It looks pretty limited, almost Diablo-style gameplay, but it's got the EQ look down. So besides EQ/Kunark/Velious/Luclin/PoP, we have EQ Online for PS2, an EQ RTS in the works, and now the aforementioned Pocket EQ... not to mention EQ2 on the horizon! Me? I'm waiting for the miniseries, myself. :p<br />
&lt;a name=&quot;patch&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Patch Message<br />
Per Cairenn (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4114), here are the UI Changes:<br />
<br />
** User Interface **<br />
<br />
- Fixed an issue in the interface with the size of the last columns in windows.<br />
- /w all guild will now display all of your guild members.<br />
- Made it so it is much easier to trade items to a player on a horse.<br />
- Added new column to Bazaar Search Window that will display stat numbers if you choose to sort by a stat.<br />
- /doability 1 should work again.<br />
- Increased the size of raids to 72 members.<br />
- Increased the amount of experience given to the raid for most raid groups.<br />
<br />
** Music Player **<br />
<br />
- The Music Player is now available on the Live servers. Alt-K opens the player. Using it should be relatively self-explanatory.<br />
<br />
** Interface Files Changed **<br />
<br />
EQUI.xml<br />
EQUI_FileSelectionWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_MusicPlayerWnd.xml<br />
<br />
** New Labels and Gauges **<br />
<br />
- New Gauge type (22) = Current Song Progress. Will show the progress through the currently playing MP3<br />
- New Label types (75-79):<br />
75 = Current Song Name<br />
76 = Current Song Duration Minutes Value<br />
77 = Current Song Duration Seconds Value (2 digits always)<br />
78 = Current Song Position Minutes Value<br />
79 = Current Song Position Seconds Value (2 digits always)<br />
