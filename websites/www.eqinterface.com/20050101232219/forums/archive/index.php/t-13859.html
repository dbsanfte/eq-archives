<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinkfu</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the problem, Taleisin used the animations file included with the Soul Reaver download and it is out of date missing a few items.  here is a patch that patches his three files, and should fix it.  I just tested this morning.<br />
<br />
On a side note, Taleisin is going to be gone for a little while so for the time being I am going to keep his mods up to date.  /all phear me :D</div></div><hr />
