<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilamon</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When creating Pieces and then using the various EQTypes, is there any rule or naming convention that I need to follow? I'm having some problems with the attached xml code, though the previous version that I edited to remove unused space (and added a clickspace) worked well. The currently edited file crashes EQ when attempting to load it and the uierrors file shows nothing out of the oridinary.<br />
<br />
I'm also having some difficulty with the tga file, and I'm unsure if I'm referencing it properly. I didn't create it, though I did mod the &quot;glowing&quot; part for use in the clickies tab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EricLongsten</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only rules I know of are for creating new items or changing old ones are: 1 all names must be unique across the UI.  2 all screen ids must be unique across the UI.  3 EQ has certain screen ids that it looks for in certain files and will give errors if they are not found.  4 screen id defines the function of the item if it does not have an eq type (for buttons and such).  5 some screen ids have locked traits, ie they do things that you have no control over in the xml (group window button and label visibility is one example).   <br />
<br />
Glancing through your code I can't spot anything that I am sure is wrong but there is a potential conflict in the name and screen id for your inventory slots 32 - 38, one reason a lot of us add our initials to the names and id of a custom item is avoid conflicts with future additions, mods by other people, and/or other obscure items.  Also I am not positive but I think part of your problem may be that you are referencing items before they have been defined.  I don't really know how important this is to the EQ xml but in a lot of other languages it would be causing a crash.  Try shifting the order of your elements so that the inventory slots are before the page items, the texture info is above the animations that use it, and the animations are above the pieces that use them. <br />
