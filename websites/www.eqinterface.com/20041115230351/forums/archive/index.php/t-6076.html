As you can see below, it's a lot of information. And is coming along, but I am seeking any and all help I can to get this thing put together. After some inspection I've realized it'll take me forever and a day to get it into a workable Beta form unless I do get some help. So far my goal is 61 HTML pages long. WITHOUT Tradeskills or Quests. What I need is someone, preferably several someone's to help me compile and code this HTML. The finished version will be the Everquest Companion, and I hope to get some support here. I've already gotten a few emails asking about it. If you're interested in helping please let me know, you can email me at eqcompanion@yahoo.com. <br />
<br />
Here's some pictures of the progress. It's coming along nicely<br />

WHAT IS NEEDED:<br />
1. Need people to help with the class specific sections. As you can see in the picture above, I'm coding this EXACTLY like the HTML from the Help window. Mainly to maintain continuity in appearance and because the color scheme works well for anyone, even those who are color blind.  The Shaman Class section is done. As is the Alchemy section in the Tradeskills section. Focus Effects are done. As are some of the quests. Specifically, Coldain Ring, Shawl, VT Key, and PoP Flags. I intend on adding Epic Quests to the Class sections at a later date. Right now I'm concerned about what's already on my plate. I'm working on getting all of the links prepared for each sub menu now. And will be posting as things are completed. Again, if you want to see this mod happen, do help. Because it is a large undertaking. Need Locs, etc. Thanks again for your support.The sections need to be put saved in the following format:<br />
