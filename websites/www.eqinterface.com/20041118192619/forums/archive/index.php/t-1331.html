Now to figure out how to selectively use just those parts - heh.<br />

Can I have a .zip please? It's what I've been looking for for 3 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shizzyr</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as a monk i'm looking for a few things in an UI. First of all i need my hits in a different window or i spam myself to death. I want to quickly be able to access my inventory and bags to equip / deequip throwing items, dispell items and various other helpful pulling devices, also helpful if you need to switch weapons often. (primal, snare or rootfist for example) <br />
<br />
Another thing that's very important as a monk / puller is to keep track on when an NPC is casting a spell on you, i'd love to have a small window with nothing but NPC's spells in it(since spells have a nasty habit of breaking your FD). This would make it easier to time FD which can be very hard if you're spammed by hits or chat etc. The UI shouldn't take too much room on the screen either imo, it can be frustrating when you have to turn around too much to get a good overview of the current pull situation...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shizzyr</div><div class="date">01-09-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like that one, doesn't take up alot of room, puts hits in another window and shows alot of your inventory. <br />
<br />
think i'm actually gonna try it out hehe :) <br />
<br />
however i think the chat windows are too small to be able to work out well in some situations... but that's alwats customizeable. The window that shows the hits you take only shows 6 lines, this is way to little if you're pulling 2 or more flurrying mobs heh. you'd have no chance to see what you get hit for... Same thing with the &quot;my hits&quot; window, only 6 lines, would fill up in 2 seconds or less. The main chat window is 10 lines, i usually try to get it to at least 15-20. but as i said it's easily customizeable...<br />
<br />
p.s. <br />
<br />
i like the mend timer, really helps alot...<br />
