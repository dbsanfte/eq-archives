Most designed for casters. Gonna work on a melee version. Please give me your comments on what to get rid of and what to keep. Mostly I wanted the spell gems, pet commands and hotkeys fairly close together.<br />

Might load alittle slow. Not sure, my net sucks<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, cast gauge is under the spell gems, the buff window is along the top (transparent atm). <br />
<br />
Also. would like to send many thanks and credits to Abbatoir (sp?) used his some of his windows as a base for mine, TKing (for the great artwork) Vert, and all the other people I cant think of right now but will be sure to when I release it.<br />
<br />
Edit. Ack can't believe I forgot to thank the guys that made the SidlWidl program, cuz if not for that program I wouldnt have even tried to make a UI heh. Awesome job on SidlWidl guys, it basically taught me xml and how it works.<br />
<br />
Edit 2 lol. forgot to mention it is in 1280 by 960 atm (my monitors max) It also works in 1184 by864. Havent tried any lower but will soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/edit  Well, your edit #2 answered my question.  /sigh</div></div><hr />

I especialy like the way you have the pet comands set up.<br />
<br />
Where does your target bar show?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drestin</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Target bar is right above the actions window. I left the pets health bar off the pet window and just put in the percent tag. The pet window was to narrow to have the bar on it but the bar is under the players bar still. Anyone know how to shorten gauges without cutting it off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Succubus</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">please please make this in 800x600<br />
<br />
damn it sucks to have low reso with all these nice new mods :confused:</div></div><hr />

OIC... I thought that was the pet health bar.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm weird, I like having a side by side comparison of my target health and my pets health.  But then my Necro (alt) is only lvl 20... maybe it's just an experiance thing.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's your internet that is making is slow. I have a cable connection and it's very slow. even with my own pics. Must be a Strike9.com thing. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Screenshot finally loaded ;)<br />
<br />
That's awesome for a first attempt. My first UI looked pretty cool but it was actually a bunch of other peoples UI's put together with some of my own stuff.<br />
<br />
By the way, is that dark elf in the picture you? That armor looks badass, what is it?<br />
<br />
The only thing is the bar styles and buttons from verts mod. I don't really like those kind of buttons, but hey I can fix that myself. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drestin</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is a pet healthbar right under your health bar in the player window, It's pretty much side by side to the target health bar.<br />
<br />
The blue armor is royal frosted velium, drops off dorfs in Icewell keep, the silver stuff is gaurdian, drops off gaurdians in sky shrine<br />
<br />
I'll try it out in more resolutions and see how it looks. Since most of the screen is chat windows that you can resize it will all fit in any resolution I imagine. Only problem is that it might seem kind of tall, but the width shouldnt be a problem I hope.<br />

I particularly like the pet command window. This is a very cool ui, especially for a first attempt. Well done</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drestin</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks abunch for the nice coments. It is available for download in the Complete section of this site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very nice job, if you get a pure-mele (rog) version out before I finish mine, I'll just scrap it and use yours!   <br />

Got to love patchs. I tryed the fix for each XML file according to the link on the front of the EQUI page. But alas the stupid in me prevailed. I wasn't able to find the text they were talking about in the pet portion of the XML file. <br />
<br />
Anyone care to post the whole string for me so I can copy and paste? /sigh<br />
<br />
AGAIN...Man I love this UI!</div></div><hr />
