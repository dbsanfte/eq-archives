<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elpiper</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I notice with the new UI that some of the Hot Buttons I have now say &quot;Menu Button&quot; instead of what they used to, such as &quot;View&quot; and &quot;Persona&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now I know that I can get my Inventory up with the Selector Window and so don't need Persona anymore, but I like having a &quot;View&quot; button in my hot buttons.<br />
<br />
Is there any way for me to change this back to &quot;View&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Anymore spacifics? Or maybe somebody else that's reading this knows what you're talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in the old UI it is possible to grab the persona (inventory) button, the view (function key nine?), and the options (alt-O) from the side in the 640x480 mode and add them to the hot key bar.  These would be the buttons he's refering to.  Since there is more than one button that has this &quot;feature&quot; i would think that verant hasn't gotten around to putting proper labels on these buttons as likely they don't think anyone uses them<br />
<br />
Perhaps this should be a bug report.<br />
