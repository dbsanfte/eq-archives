I am having. a problem installing the timer program.  I downloaded the .zip file after customizing it and I moved to a folder called 'timer' in my uifiles folder.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the .xml and .tga files show as 'undefined' and not attached to the correct window they are replacing.<br />
<br />
Here is what the files are called:<br />
<br />
EQUI_undefinedWindow.xml<br />
<br />
undefined_Timer.tga<br />
<br />
<br />
No matter which window I try and assign this too they come up named the same way.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd suggest dropping a note to Arista (http://www.eqgui.com/member.php?s=&amp;action=getinfo&amp;userid=1154) directly, pointing her to this thread and your problem.  If anyone would know, it's probably her, since the timers are her &quot;baby&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, just got your message. This problem is very rare but has been reported before, and is likely related to your browser. When you select the window from the drop-down list, the window name should be associated with the value of that form field, which the browser should then send to the server as part of the request. The name sent is then used during timer file generation. In your case, however, the name is somehow not sent/received so the generator is using &quot;undefined&quot; as the value. I'm not sure what causes some people to experience this problem, but here are a few things to try:<br />
<br />
1) Try downloading the timer using Internet Explorer (5.5 or 6.0) if possible, if you're currently using a different browser.<br />
<br />
2) If you have access to a different computer, try downloading it from that one, chances are it will work.<br />
<br />
3) If all else fails, post or send me your desired timer configuration, and I'll be more than happy to generate the zip file for you.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. If there is any additional information (your browser version, etc.) you think might help pinpoint the problem, please post it here or send it to me. Thanks.</div></div><hr />
