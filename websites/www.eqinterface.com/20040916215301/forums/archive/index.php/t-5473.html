<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just submitted the Ranger UI 2.1 with patch updates for 1/9/03 to the files section.  should be posted up in a day or three :)<br />
<br />
no new pic, just used theold one, but I did add in and customixe the bard box, plus addressed any other changes the 1/9 patch made.<br />
<br />
I am currently working on new tables and such for the fletching window.  Going to include non-woodelf cultural stuff as well, which pretty much means PoP stuff.  also adding in more related brewing, tailoring, and smithing recipes for components used in the fletching :)<br />
<br />
Still wondering if the rumors about the ranger-only fletching will come true (of to dream) :)<br />
<br />
Also, just to let you know, I am almost done with the new borders.  They are going to be optional, being as they will not be able to be resized at will.  Thank VI for that one since they made the borders stretch and not tile.  If I could, I would like to give a set of &quot;source&quot; graphics with the UI so you could make the borders to the dimensions you chose, rather than you not be able to resizewindows.<br />
<br />
I guess we'll see depending opn how much time I get to sit dwn and work on this (been very busy IRL lately).<br />
<br />
As always, enjoy!  questions and comments are always welcome :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">screen shot with the UI in the downloads section, and a few threads down, but here goes :)  Just pretend the bard box is right beside the buff box, modified in the same manner (having difficulties with my FTP space, so have to use an old one for now).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kasca, no offense, but did you even read the post above?  I am having trouble uploading to my webspace.  I'll get a new pic here in the thread soon enough, but for now, have to settle for the old one.<br />
<br />
  The ONLY difference visually is the bard box, a 6 slot version of the buff box down the right side, is up against the buffbox.</div></div><hr />
