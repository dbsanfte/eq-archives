<br />
we have come up with a new plan, and new concept for the Solaria (Vert 3.0) UI and have made an animated gif of how we want the spell bar to work.. please watch the gif below (its about 4 seconds all the way through but loops) and give us feed back.<br />
<br />
http://www.technosapien.net/solaria/spellbar.gif<br />
What you are seeing is the on/off feature of the spell bar. In the final version it wont be &quot;grey&quot; when the other is button clicked it will just drop to a darker color of that mod (blue for above). but we wanted to make sure it cought your eye on this example..<br />
<br />
When you click ON.. the spell names will show when you click OFF the spell names will retract.<br />
<br />
what do you think... give us some feed back<br />
<br />
(shown in Neptune, but would of course be done in all current colors)</div></div><hr />

We are, the Buff and SDbuff window will be the same type exactly, allowing a truly modular design for these. We will experiment with designs for Player window, Group window, etc after we get these done and in a beta run.<br />

Even though the animation is looping above... this addition would not be like the alt key where its only on when you hold down the on button..<br />
<br />
when you click &quot;on&quot; it will be on till you click &quot;off&quot; and vise-versa. this is not just an eye candy feature. it allows you to run a &quot;graphics minimized&quot; version at the click of a button without having to reload a new UI..<br />
<br />
and it will be modular. we are working on making all the main boxes (minus chat) the same width so that you can stack them together.. also plans are for a &quot;left&quot; (see image above) and &quot;right&quot; version sooo you can have the gems on the left or right of the names.<br />

thank you for the feedback, we appreciate all the inputs so far.<br />

<br />
I have never really tinkered with tabs before, havent dug around to fiddle much with it, but this sure makes me want to reconsider. Heck, with added inspiration, you could even make several types of Player windows, etc. just by tabbing to the one you need ~ however its a shame it doesnt stay that way when you log back in the next time.<br />
<br />
Great job man, would love to see it in game :)</div></div><hr />

Already being discussed... at &quot;Melee&quot; Tab, &quot;Caster&quot; Tab and &quot;Pet Class&quot; Tab for the 3 types people might use (pet tab would have a totally seperate bar for thier pet)<br />

we have some ideas in the works we just wanted to see how this went over.. so far the response is very encouraging.</div></div><hr />

Actualy we will have to see, it's actualy a transparent window, so you could left click somthing, but Right clicking would bring up the settings for changing transparency and such for this window. We will experiment with it.<br />

The ALT key already does this, and the problem with adding more graphics to the UI is the impact on video performance. <br />
<br />
What your discounting here is the STREAMLINED Graphical Impact were adding, there by eliminating several of the video issues currently associated with the Vert UI. IE. Less graphical loads. By adding a tab, were not re-loading graphics, were re-calling them, when the tab would be clicked. IE. MORE video performance, there by definetly adding functionality.<br />
<br />
I love the Vert line of UI mods.  But rather than clever for clever's sake, I'd prefer to see it slim down some, become more modular and more informative.  <br />
<br />
Well I covered this above, but it's not clever for clevers sake, #1 as the Spell gem. Buff, and SD buff will follow this same exact format, this makes all 3 of these windows size X IE Horizontal the same dimensions there by allowing a more modualr window placement, and allowing more screen to be shown with LESS video impact, and the SAME amount of information to be shown.<br />
<br />
I'd love a way to get the spell names and the button all into a nice, neat compact window that stacks well with others and doesn't have issues with overlap.  I'm just not sure how to go about it.<br />
   <br />
Um well this does just exactly that, and it's the most stream lined least video impacting way of doing it. I and Kudane have done several tests to determine exactly what affects video impact with adding new graphics in UI's so once more this does indead add functionality and performance without sacrificing Info, while adding even MORE modual-ality (A word?) (Perhaps not) but any way on the the rest of the post...<br />
<br />
I like the window better without the spell name (essentially the OFF setting).  But having the spell names is very useful.  Especially if you play multiple characters and need the extra information.

 <br />
I real realy fail to see the validity of this thought process, but perhaps i'm biased having access the the actual XML workings and theories behind this mod. I'm not beign negative towards your feedback, just replying. I personaly LOVE feedback as it gives me a chance to explain in depth the workings of the new UI changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to more on the Solaria UI though. <br />

Actually already did this.. BUT forgot to post it before I left work.. soo as soon as Sokol Sees this message and can email the two images I sent him I will post the completed mock up which includes the spellbook button on the bottom<br />
<br />
Also have a new Group Window Mocked up and we have changed the plus, minus and check mark to &quot;invite, follow, disband, and decline&quot;  (it matches the current LFG button)</div></div><hr />

and version 1 of the new group window<br />

these are only mockups which means I made them look like they will in the game, but they are not coded yet.<br />

<br />
1) if we use the tab, the area that is there for the name of the spells, when you have names turned off may not be able to be clicked through. (We will have a no name mod avail for those that just dont want the names shown)<br />
<br />
<br />
  I personally use a viewport and stash most windows off to the right of the screen. I do this because I want my view of the game-world to be un-cluttered by information windows.  Because of this, I like windows to be as compact as possible.   But, on the other hand, I like my windows to be as informative as possible, so often &quot;compact&quot; has to make way for space for labels or sizes for images that make sense at 1600 x 1200 resolutions. <br />
<br />
  Making the names a tab makes the window pretty big in width.  If the space is not clickable from both mouse-buttons, that means I can't position anything to the right of that window.   <br />
<br />
  I like to postion things as closely as possible to reduce the distace I need to move the mouse.  I have a number of reasons for this; improved reaction time to in-game events, reduced strain on my hands, visual appeal of the interface.  So, I don't like the tab for the spell casting widow.  I do want the spell names.  Icons for too many spells are too simialr in many cases without them. <br />
<br />
  So, if you're commited to the tabbed spell casting window version, please consider also make a mod without the tabs and the spell names available. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) On the group window were working away to have an enlarged pet health bar, whichw as immensly popular with the soalria Beta group window previously. We are beign carefull not to change to many sizes of the window so it will still all be modular.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I like this idea.  I was modding the Vert 2.5 group window to use the mini-stamina bar for pet-health (right-aligned with the player health bars), but issues with label positioning made it difficult to get the look I was going for, and I abandoned it.  As long as the pet is easily selected from the group window, and the window remains visually attractive, I'd be willing to swallow an increase in the group window's size. <br />

* Please, remove the player infromation (stats, etc.) from the pet window.   The pet window needs to remain clean and dedicated to the use of a pet.   I didn't always feel this way, but having discovered the agony of having to choose between my pet command buttons and information I refer to frequently, I see this as a vital change.  <br />

Well if the default tab is to names on, then it makes no sense to have a names on tables window, as this is in essence identical to that, it only makes sense to make a no names spell bar mod for those that do not want names.<br />

I have always hated using a partialy done GUI. And my only complaint with the Vert mods is that the default spell icons are kind of confusing. And that's just me. But that's easily fixxed, i like the TKing G2 spell icons. So no real complaint there. From the screen shots i've seen it's all going to be very impresive and i can't wait to try it out. One piece of advice to GUI designers is that if you are going to make a GUI don't just do one window or a few. Do the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

our current plan is to have a full working version of Solaria 1.0 (vert 3.0) by the end of the week.. (barring real life steps in) we have the spell window working without tabs at the moment and the new group window working... left is the new buff/sd-buff and player window.. I will work in the 4x2 spell window also this week..<br />
<br />
expect to see Solaria up very soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this one is a little bigger than the old vert one, BUT it doesnt require any editting of the book images.<br />
<br />
this one also uses the larger icons like the default book, instead of the tiny ones vert was using.<br />

The BAD News<br />

(whispers) take another peek at the picture, there is a button that says SPELLBOOK. Guess what that is for...<br />
<br />
and if you check the PATCHES section you will find a fix for the current version of vert with a button for spellbook ALSO!<br />

1) In the spell bar, why is there a space above the top spell gem with nothing in it??<br />
<br />
2) I customised my inventory window - pic attached - a while back to make it smaller and more streamlined (my opinion); is there any such changes in the pipeline for version 3??<br />

That's it, cept to say... Your work is awesome! Keep it up and thanks! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. that is for the ON/OFF buttons we are hoping to work in for the tabbed version of the spell bar.. we are having trouble with the code, so its not there yet.. but we left the space so we could work on it.<br />
<br />
2. the Current Inventory is 284x328 which includes an auto equip area, all 4 of the small buttons, a done, and a destroy buttons.. and all the important data.. The Inventory picture you attached is 276x 431 thats 8 pix smaller left to right and 103 pix bigger top to bottom.. soooo if you want a more streamlined inventory, might I suggest you try the 2.5 version of the inventory. :D<br />

<br />
Yes, several of those type of mods will come out in the following weeks after we get it out of beta..<br />
<br />
first we have to make sure it works and doesnt cause lag. Then we can release a base set in the different colors... THEN we will be going back and making add-ons and tweaks.. (above and beyond the minor ones we did while creating it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally Done!<br />

Need to tweak a couple of things, and test one more time in game tomorrow and we will be ready to post a public beta... here is the picture showing all the new windows.<br />

Sokol and I forgot to caculate for fathers day when setting up our time frame.. since Sokol IS a dad, and I spent the day with my Wife's Dad (and my wife of course) we wont get the last bit of codding done till tomorrow..<br />
<br />
BUT come hell or high water, we will have something for you tomorrow (prolly in the afternoon/evening).<br />
<br />
Again.. it will be in Neptune only for the beta, and it will include all of the above shown new files. <br />
<br />
Personally I really love the new buff window.. though the icon is small, the text is very easy to read on the new beveled background..<br />
<br />
All of our new windows are 155pix across so they can be stacked on top of each other without any problems.<br />
<br />
See you all tomorrow... hope you had a great fathers day.. and thank you so much for your patience!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The blue &quot;lines&quot; connecting everyting are not the same width on all windows. In the buff window they seem a lot thinner tank on the group and spellbook windows. <br />
<br />
The LFG button looks like its not aligned vertically with the Accept/Invite and Decline/Disband buttons.<br />
<br />
I think it would look better if the LFG button was wider, so that it touched the other buttons and the framework to the left, making the window look more like the v2.5 one.<br />
<br />
If it is possible, I think some consistency in the general button size would look good. If you could make the LFG, Accept/Invite, Decline/Disband, Spellbook, Next and Previous buttons the same size, I think it would improove the overall look.<br />
<br />
Finally, I think you are doing a great job. Congratulations !!<br />

<br />
Your right... when we made it the same size as the others we gained about 170pixels of image top to bottom.. we wanted to keep it the same size as the current buff window. Soooo we experimented with shrinking down the bar, and of course this had the effect we wanted AND gave us more room for the buff name. Ironically is only 4 Pixels.. <br />

Well part of the idea is not to look like the 2.5 one.. but we will look at your idea, and consider it.. this is part of why we are releasing a beta version.. try it in game when we release it and see if what we have setup doesnt make sense.. We wanted you to notice when &quot;FOLLOW&quot; popped up.. ALL the buttons are 2pix wider than the word that is on them.. with the follow/disband/invite/decline i think one of them is 3 pix wider but the words were all about the same size and we obviously had to make those all the same size.<br />
<br />
But good feed back.. we will look at it with the rest of the feedback.<br />
