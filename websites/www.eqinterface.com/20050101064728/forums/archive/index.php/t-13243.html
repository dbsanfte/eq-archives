<br />
I am having huge graphical errors that are not ui related.<br />
<br />
Trees and most other textures appear blank like there is nothing there.<br />
<br />
It only happens when in first person view, and when I change the sky options it changes as well, does not get better just a different looking error.<br />
<br />
I have called SOE Tech support and they were rather useless.<br />
<br />
Hoping you guys might have some ideas.<br />
<br />
Have newest Nvidia drivers and Directx9.<br />
<br />
Have done a fromat and reinstall of EG, Drivers, Dx9 and patched EQ but have the same issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
HELP!?!?!?!?!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. <br />
Checked my UIERRORS log just in case, only the usual warning line but not a single Error line, also the graphical errors happen with default UI as well.</div></div><hr />

Definitely not a UI problem.<br />
<br />
Which nVidia video card are you using?<br />
<br />
How much free space on your hard drive? (Seems strange, but possible)<br />
<br />
When was the last time you checked for viruses?<br />
<br />
How much ram on your machine? (btw, does this seem smaller than what you remember it being)<br />
<br />
How many programs do you have running resident while running EQ?  <br />
<br />
BTW, for last question if your initial answer is &quot;none&quot;, then you really haven't looked.  You WILL have some programs running resident when in Windows.  The question is which ones and how many of them.<br />
<br />
Also, did you say you completely reformatted your hard drive??</div></div><hr />

It's not UI related, I have the latest drivers, and up-to-date virus software. Its intermittent, only shows up in crowded zones, and generally just one or two zones. If I camp to desktop, they are fine for a few days again.</div></div><hr />
