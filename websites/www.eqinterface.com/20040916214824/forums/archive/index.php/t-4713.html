I downloaded your mod and everything looked crisp and clean.  My group/guild chat window didn't show up when I did the loadskin command.  (I'm a newbie on the UI Scene.)  Would you tell me how to set it up?  Thanks Horty!  :D <br />

The ui is magnificent, I just need a few extra chat windows I can arrange at free will, rather hard when you have nothing to drag them in :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yggdrazil</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">gratz hortania, beautiful job :)<br />
<br />
hum, when will we get married, my beauty? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tapit</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have got all the above figured out but have two more questions to ask.  Does anyone else have the problem of PoP items showing up as nwecklaces?  My Nightmare wood bow and planar travelers manual for example both have an Icon as a pearl necklace.<br />
<br />
Second has anyone ever seen spell Icons that can be rightclicked and show you what they do?  You can right click them now and they give you a little box with nothing in it but an Icon, curious.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serruriere</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To change the image in the center of inventory, just modify the tkinventory.tga. You can find it in the file where you unzipped the UI.<br />
<br />
Make it with mine with a basic program (don't wanna make advertisment :D ) without any problems :) Thinks it's working with almost all programs which can save files in *.tga<br />
<br />
Screenshots of mine now (http://membres.lycos.fr/serruriere/image/uirogue.jpg)<br />
<br />
Sorry too for my English :( Playing on same server as Hortania and french too :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eqpozer</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My chat windows dont have tital bars on the top,  I cant move or resize them, any idea of how I can fix this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tapit</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">eheheh Finally figuring things out slowly but surely.  I have used your UI for a few weeks now and there are several things I like aobut it.  Your HP next to the targets for one, the way your buff bar is set up, and the MP3 player.  If you would not take this as an insult how can I import those items into my old UI?  it would just be for personal use I will not have a tapit UI eheheh on the boards anywhere.  thanks<br />
