<br />
PS can somone pls post the original ldon adventure window's ui file here....i'm at work atm and can't get to it at home hehe...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">exzyle2k</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a suggestion from a totally clueless player when it comes to UIs... Would it be possible to have a clock or something that can be manually triggered? I mean, I only care about how much time I have left in a dungeon, not really worrying about the adventure since the experience is better.<br />
<br />
Say something attached to the player window, much like a Monk can use Mend or an SK/Pally can use HT/LoH. But instead of automatically being triggered upon entering the zone, can there be a button that starts the timer and can be displayed, such as modifying the casting bar timer, with 3 digits that count down from 120 to 1 (obviously, at 0 you'd be punted, so you know you're out of time). <br />
<br />
Just a thought. Again, I'm creatively impaired, so I'll just drop the hints, you guys can run with them.<br />

I have feedbacked it though, since I'd like to make one of my pet window tabs be a mini-adventure progress indicator.  Maybe it will show up someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mebeksis</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i've discovered the same thing as far as no eqtypes....so what i'm thinking of doing is just making a 3rd tab on the adventure window that has the hp/mana/xp/etc. on it as well as progress/timers and seeing if that will work...if so, just gonna keep playerwindow gone...and me and my entire guild are gonna make a /feedback thing every time we log in....and i'm adding on mine that they should give us ability to use xsl /grin</div></div><hr />
