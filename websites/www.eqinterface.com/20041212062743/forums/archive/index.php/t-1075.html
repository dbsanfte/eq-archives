<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furykul</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welp, im a newbie to XML I just dled a xml editor was looking at an XML file I opened obviously was the inventory window. Looked pretty easy to understand. But there were some things that I would have a hard time with understanding. <br />
<br />
I am familiar with HTML (obviously not the same) but if that helps hey it would be great to know something of codes. But I would like to learn this stuff. That way I can build my own personalization for the UI =) that would make me very intrigued. =) <br />
<br />
So if there is anything I Could learn from anyone I figured id ask here before getting confused. <br />
<br />
So for starters if someone could give me pointers or a web site they would recommend for beginners that would be awesome. Secondly my goal is to make my gems and my buff box different from Default. <br />
<br />
heres what I want I want my buff box at the top of the screen (where the window selector is) and I want to put the name of the buff next to each icon. This is for the buff box.<br />
<br />
Secondly I want for my memed spell gems to be right next to that that, again, horizontal, and beside each spell I would like to put the name of the memorized spell. <br />
<br />
But the problem is I don't know xml...=/ and wouldnt' know the first place to start. I have a few other programming software...namely Visual studio 6.0 Proffessional...Visual stuio 6.0 pro basic...visual studio pro 6.0 C++...Foxpro...interdev...J++...MSDN...MSDE....win2000 readiness and last of all winNT 4.0 (assuming all of these are for programming.) would any of them be beneficial to a newbie programmer? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for all of the input. Id like some links or even book referals. last time I bought a programming book it was really bad. It explained the stuff just didnt' show how it all applied to each other. So wish me luck on this new adventure. =) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm not going to be able to give you all the help you want, but I want to give you a few pointers that might at least get you in the right direction.<br />
<br />
First - visual programs will do you no good.  As yet, there is no visual program for this - one (or perhaps more) is in the works atm, but still not released.  You can either edit them in Notepad, or download a program from http://eqtoolbox.not.net/   I'm currently using XMLwriter from that site - but after 30 days you have to pay $50 to keep it (/sigh).  It's helpful, though, because even though it looks pretty much like it will in Notepad, it's color-coded for easier navigation.<br />
<br />
Second - I *think* it's possible to say in the xml code that &quot;I want this window to appear here&quot;, but it's easier just to log on and move it.  So basically, create your windows in xml, log on and rearrange them.  When you load new skins, just do /load &lt;skin name&gt; 1... the 1 will keep the window positions you have set up.<br />
<br />
Third - I'm pretty sure you can't turn the Selector Window into the Buff Window.  I could be wrong on that, but as of yet, I've not seen buffs in any window but the one designated as the buff window.  As for that dumb Selector Window, I used mine for personal info - name, class, lvl... but then, that's the only place in my mod that that info is shown, so it's beneficial to me.  There are also some buff windows out there (already made) that have the names next to them.  And can, of course, be repositioned across the top of your screen.<br />
<br />
Fourth - Spell Gems.  I've seen them horizontal, and I've seen them with the names next to them - but not both, yet.  That is something I would definately like to see, though.  :)  Again,  your best bet on screen-location is to just drag it there.<br />
<br />
Finally - learning the code.  This is what I did: I have a VERY basic understanding of HTML... mostly from occasionally looking over someone's shoulder and just seeing what they're doing to make this look like that.  I also have a reference book for whenever I need some quick coding - inserting a link or something easy.  But, I downloaded some people's mods, opened up (for example) their Player Window (it should automatically open into Explorer for viewing... but, unfortunately, you can only view it there, not edit it), then I would open up EQ's Player Window right next to it.  I would make sure I had in my head &quot;this is what it looks like on the screen&quot; or I would take screenshots of both mods and clip them down to the one window and have them up, too.  Then I compared what one said to what the other said.  With having the basics of HTML in your head, this should be really simple to figure out.  Especially since you've worked with other programs.  The only difference here is, for now, it's all coding then loading up EQ and seeing what you just did.  Hopefully soon we'll have a visual program so you can drag and drop.  Anyhow - I have no idea where you can go to get more info.  I've done several searches on the web, and there doesn't seem to be much out there.  But so far, the resources we've been given should be enough to get you started.  It's mostly trial and error.  But since EQ always makes sure it's Default folder is intact, it's highly unlikely you're going to blow up the game.  :)<br />
<br />
Good luck - I hope this helped you out some.  Just keep scanning this forum and finding out what you can from what others have posted - that's where another chunk of my knowledge has come from.  Can't wait to see what you do with this!  :)<br />
