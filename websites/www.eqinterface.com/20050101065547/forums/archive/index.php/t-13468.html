I downloaded the Bst pointer and cant seem to get it to work. Im using the Drakah legacy UI. I extract the files, and then move the two files into the Drakah UI folder exactly like the readme says. But when I log into the game the UI is all messed up and the bst pointer doesnt load up either. But then when I delete the bst pointer files from the UI folder the UI works fine again....and help would be much appreciated.:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What did your UIErrors.txt file say when you attempted to use the beastlord pointer??  Could you post a copy of that file.<br />
<br />
Without seeing that file, I can only guess that the problem is with the EQUI_Animations.xml file.  The readm file that came with the beastlord pointer gave clear instruictions on how to edit an existing EQUI_Animations.xml file if your current UI has a custom one.  Don't know for sure, but I believe that the Drakah UI you're using does have a custom file.  Since you made no mention of having edited that file per the instructions in the readme file, I'll assume that you did not do so.<br />
<br />
Try editing the EQUI_Animations.xml file in the Drakah UI folder per the instructions in the beastlord pointers readme file.  Please make sure to back up the EQUI_Animations.xml file before doing this.  If it still doesn't work, post a copy of the UIErrors.txt file.  Posting a screenshot of what your screen looks like might also help.<br />
<br />
OH, and for future reference, when asking for help with a specific UI that's available on this site, it REALLY helps if your initial post contains a link to the UI you're askng about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
edit: actually figured it out. Theres something wrong in the EQUI_Animations file that comes with the bst pointer. So heres what I did. I copied the EQUI_Animations file over from the default UI folder into the Drakah UI folder and altered it exactly how the readme said, and voila!! Log into the game and it works. Thanks for the help.:D</div></div><hr />
