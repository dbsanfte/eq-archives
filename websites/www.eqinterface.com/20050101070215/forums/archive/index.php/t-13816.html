I can't see the new login screen although I made a complete filecheck in the patcher.<br />
Do I have to delete anything in the EQ directory first maybe?<br />
<br />
Please help!!</div></div><hr />

What do you mean you cant see it? Are you saying the game is crashing so you cant see it? <br />
<br />
You should be seeing the new login system because it was a patch sony sent down to every one.</div></div><hr />

Don't have this problem myself, but at least 3 others in various threads have reported a similar problem.  The necessary files are downloaded and are present on their system, but they still get the old login screens.  Thus far, I haven't seen enough information from them to figure out the cause.  Perhaps if we started a new thread specifically for this problem, we could get to the bottom of it.</div></div><hr />

Her patcher didnt even download the nescesary files ?!?<br />
<br />
The suggested thread might eb a good idea, as I know SoE looks into these forums :)</div></div><hr />

I asked my girlfriend to send me her everquest.exe, started EQ again and *voila* patcher downloaded the needed files and i see the new login screen :)<br />
<br />
Have no idea why it didn't update my files automatically though, we both have all expansions so it shouldn't make a difference, but it did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why isn't the new login screen downloading automaticly?</div></div><hr />

Was this done, and the window still didn't show up?....Just and idea! <br />
<br />
Oh OK....I see that you did try the file check in the patcher....Than I will shut right up now.....</div></div><hr />
