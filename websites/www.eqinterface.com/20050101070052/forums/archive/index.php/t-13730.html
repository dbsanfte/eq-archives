<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpott</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That happens most of the time after a patch.  You shouldn't have any problems (I never have) and if one of the UI windows won't work EQ should load the default in it's place.<br />
<br />
Usually the creator of the affected UI will create a fix or update soon after the patch.<br />
<br />
Good luck and safe hunting</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axeion</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1st you need to know which files are not comapatible.Go to your everquest folder,the file you want is UIerrors, look in it with notepad to see which files are outa date and/or their load problems.<br />
<br />
From their you got few options.One would be to replace those files ,another would be to update those files with code fixs . You'd have to look up past patch messages (based on the time frame the mod was posted to curent date)an see if any would be needed to fix your files. I belive theirs whole section on past patchs an what was removed an needed to be added .<br />
<br />
To do the code fix's you would have to mess with the files xml code,useing notepad an adding the corect lines or subtracting the incorect lines.Replace would be to delete those files an either use default or use a difrent version of those files from the download section.<br />
<br />
If ya can find out which files are bugged atm an post those sevrial xml guru's might help ya fix them.I'm no xml guru (nor do i play one on tv) but if i can help id be more than happy to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Notepad is a Windows file.  It is a protected system file and cannot be removed. (at least not easily)<br />
<br />
It should be located in your Windows or WinNT folder, as well as your System32 and dllcache folders.<br />
<br />
If it is giving you an error when trying to open it, then put in your Window CD, then delete notepad.exe from all three directories and let Windows restore it.<br />
<br />
If that still doesn't work, I've attached a zip file with the WinXP version.<br />
