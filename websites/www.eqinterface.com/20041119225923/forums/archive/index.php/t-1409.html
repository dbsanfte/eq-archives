Much more managable hehe. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the comments. As I said its what I consider a a very early alpha. Bug reports are very welcome (please check the forums at www.sidlwidl.com first so I don't have to look over repeates) but realize I don't have much time to spend atm on it and alot of the functionality is hiden/broken. I basically released it in the middle of a command layer rewrite, which was not what I wanted to do. <br />
<br />
I figured its still useful in its current state though, and till I get some more time some poeple would find it useful, bugs, warts, inconsistencies and all. <br />
<br />
Btw anybody get a chance to check out the EQToolbox.xml? Some enterprising soul could fill it up with all the eq types for guages, labels, etc so you would have a complete list in your toolbox that you could just drag and drop onto a new window. Or make a custom set of gauges, buttons whatever to apply in your own section, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am having trouble opening skins that are modded with from T.King some line declaration error in the XML it says.<br />
<br />
It does crash at times for no reason but I have found it to be a lot faster for editing most things just make sure to save incase of crash and this program is a much faster to restart then logging on and off EQ.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the great program I can't wait until you have time and get the bugs all worked out.<br />

oops.. well it was only about 20 min on my line so not biggie :)<br />
<br />
Regardles of me being a doof :o its still an excellent piece of work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faille</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would it be possible to modify it to display ANY XML file in that directory, not just the ones it &quot;looks for&quot;?  I would love to be able to create a copy of my inventory file, or whatever, so that I can have a work in progress while still being able to play.  Then when I am done with the temporary file I can just rename it to the official file name.  It could also be used to have other people's mods up so you can compare.<br />
<br />
It may already have this functionality, but a couple of the files I have in my folder were not available in the program.<br />
<br />
Any chance of making this open source, or sending the source code out?  I would not have any desire (or skill probably) to finish it and put it out over your head after you did all the work, but I would absolutely LOVE to be able to get a hold of the code to see how you managed to create such an application.  I learn by example and this seems like it would be an awesome tutorial of sorts .. commented or not! :)<br />
<br />
Good work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gendal</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couldn't you just use the save as command and work with a copy like that? The program only shows what's defined in the EQUI.xml file, same as verant does I believe. Not entirely sure I understand what you want though. <br />
<br />
Distributing the source code is unfortunatly extremely unlikely for a myriad of reasons. One being I might release it as shareware down the road (waaay down the road at this point). Two being you couldn't even compile it unless you had several commercial libraries which i can't distribute in design time form (mostly the window/docking/toolbar code). Three being the project started as an excercise in some of the principles I learned from Design Patterns : Elements of Reusable Object-Orientated Software by the gang of four (must read if you are really interested in programming). <br />
<br />
Sorta got out of hand after that =p</div></div><hr />

Not really. They still follow includes, if they are used in other files. I've managed to create windows using multiple custom files. Might want to rethink that part.<br />
<br />
Also, why is the Framework required? Yeah, it's 20 megs, but that is around 1.5 hour download where I'm at currently. And I disabled all that Framework junk on my XP boxes at home. It was usless for me, and MS kept constantly bugging me &quot;Don't you want a .NET account?&quot; .. gaaah</div></div><hr />

plz get me a hint or even the link to get it ;)</div></div><hr />

Could you give me an example of a custom file you loaded with out using the EQUI.xml? How would you do that? SidlWidl will load up any file you put in the EQUI.xml, but if its not there it won't be loaded, and I don't see any provisions for loading them otherwise.<br />
<br />
And it requires the framework not out of spite, but because its just that, an application framework. Think java but fast. SidlWidl wouldn't even be 1/3 of the way done if I hadn't have used it. Right now precious little uses it, but MS has big plans for it. You should be estatic they feel that way, because its a huge step forward from the registry/com crap we have to deal with now. Its sooo much easier to write nice programs and installation issues are practically nonexistant with it. Note, I don't even need an installer program for sidlwidl once you have the framework installed.<br />
<br />
Why would you disable it? It doesn't slow you down. Don't get the framework confused with all the other .net crap ms releases. Messager .net, passport, etc is not the framework, they are completly unrelated, just marketing gobeldygook.<br />
<br />
In short the framework = good, .net = marketing crap.</div></div><hr />
