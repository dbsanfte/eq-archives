I was looking for some advice, I have absolutely no artistic skills whatsoever &amp; I am looking for a good looking but functional UI including pet window that will work with the latest EQ Patch. I was mainly using the T.King mods and making my own, but I have seen a few here that incompasses everything in one big gui at the bottom of the screen. <br />
<br />
I mainly am looking for quick access to inventory.<br />
AAXP &amp; XP in percentages.<br />
Multiple chat windows<br />
quick access to spell book.<br />
Full player info<br />
group info.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I have no idea where to start. <br />
<br />
I want it to look amazing but not to over the top, i play a lot so dont want eye strain with all the colour.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can be downloaded here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2586).<br />
<br />
I comes with multiple different target windows to meet anyone's tastes (I like big gauges so I can see them without staring) and also comes with horizontal and vertical versions of the buff and song windows. It's fully compatible with all patches.<br />
It's cool looking, but simple concise... and can be arranged any way you like.<br />
<br />
Oh, it's made for 1280x1024. Hope you like it.</div></div><hr />

I came here looking for that same ui and i couldnt find anything even simmilar. IE: all 6 bags show up on the left, primary and secondary weps show up not some arms and  legs belt like most UI's do for me.. <br />
<br />
All i gotto say is thanks so much lol i got my old UI back.. but i have 1 problem with the UI you got here and its the Self HP box the one that shows your HP and stats.. its way to plain from the original version of this, yours doesnt show ticks where the % would be... anyways maby look at an old infiniti UI and change it other then that works awsome thanks again. i cant find a single UI on this site that comes close to this. you can change wepons on the fly, open bags and containers its just plain THE BEST UI setup there is. and for some reason i cant move the effects window its in the wrong spot for me.<br />
<br />
is it easy to add my own HP window where it shows hp mana end and stuff? let me know thanks.<br />
