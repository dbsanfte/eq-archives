First of all i get a error on &lt;Screen item = &quot;PIW_BuffWindow&quot;&gt;  saying i have to add a &gt; to Screen item so it looks like &lt;Screen item&gt; = &quot;PIW_BuffWindow&quot;&gt;.<br />

Ok, I cut and paste bet buff stuff into my file.<br />
Buffs show up but I get the folowing errors:<br />
Error: Could not find child AMP_FindButton in window ActionsWindow<br />
<br />
Could not find child AMP_EndFindButton in window ActionsWindow<br />
<br />
right after this warning:<br />
Warning: file EQUI_FindLocationWnd.xml not found in directory UIFiles\danka\.  Attempting to use file from Default skin.<br />
<br />
I wonder what I broke, since there's no mention on &quot;find&quot; in neither old nor modified file.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">salamane</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried adding a &quot;floating&quot; (i.e. outside the pet window buff window) display for pet buffs using kenney's method, and it sort of worked. I got it to display the buffs and buff names in a fashion very much like the shord-duration buff window and it even showed them outside of the main pet window. The problem is, I can't seem to get it to put the buff display onscreen where I want it (upper left of screen, under the lag meter). For some reason, it always shows up kind of in the middle of the screen no matter what I set the &lt;Location&gt; tag for the buff display child of the pet info window. Any ideas what could be wrong?<br />
<br />
edit - nevermind, it helps if you actually save the file before reloading the UI - d'oh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenney</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe.. glad ya got it to work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">salamane</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so I hacked away at my pet info window, and got a basic pet buff bar going that uses the same style as my short duration buff bar (it's one I got from here that has numbered slots for the buffs and shows the name and all - very nice buff bar). I finally got it all to work except there was this one graphical thing nagging at me - the slots were numbered 1-6 and then 1-6 instead of 1-12. This is literally because I reused the short duration buff window texture to be the texture for my pet buff bar (just had to stack the texture twice to make 12 slots worth of pet buffs from the 6 slot texture for bard songs). So, I figured it'd be easy to make a modified version of the TGA file to give me a nice 1-12 instead of 1-6/1-6. However, EQ will not use the pixels I cut'n'pasted from one part of the drawing into another. gah.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, the attached ZIP file has the 3 files in question. 1st is my hacked up EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml, 2nd is the original TGA file drakah_buffbackground.tga, and 3rd is my TGA file drakah_petbuffbg.tga. The way I wanted it to work, EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml used location 140,0 to grab the pixels for slots 7-12 and 220,0 to get slots 1-6. But when I did that, nothing showed up for 7-12. Changing it to 220,0 for slots 7-12 works fine, just it shows the '1' - '6' background image instead of the '7' - '12' image I had cobbled together. I just don't understand what the problem is... :/<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
also i seen in your window you had this wrong:<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />
&lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt;<br />
&lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
     &lt;!--&lt;TooltipReference/&gt;--&gt;<br />
     &lt;Text&gt;Pet Info&lt;/Text&gt;  <br />
	&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Pets&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;&lt;----- this should be WDT_Rounded <br />
	&lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;false&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;<br />
	&lt;Style_Closebox&gt;true&lt;/Style_Closebox&gt;<br />
	&lt;Style_Minimizebox&gt;true&lt;/Style_Minimizebox&gt;</div></div><hr />

Good point. Looking at the TGA (the original) again, I can't see why the short duration bar didn't just reuse the 1st 6 slots as well rather than adding 6 slots on the other side of the image. /shrug<br />
<br />
Anyhow, it took doing a little bit of math to crop it right, but I did get my pet buff &quot;window&quot; to have numbered slots for buffs 1-12, it's cool now. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tips!</div></div><hr />

Look for it in the Mix'n'Match section someday soon, I hope (unless the mods think it just sucks or something ;)). I'll attach a screenshot here (it's in the submission, too) so you can see what I got it to look like (many thanks to my best friend Shuice the Archmage for posing with her pet and buffs :p)...</div></div><hr />
