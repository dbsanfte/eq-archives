<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seddie</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to fix a UI which is pieced together from mostly TKing interface parts. I was trying to edit them using the information in the Patch area forum. <br />
<br />
The only file(s) I had that were customizable are:<br />
<br />
TargetIndicator.ini<br />
EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
<br />
I had no problem updating the TargetIndicator.ini file, when I went to update the Playerwindow file, I found I was 'missing' the line of code (?) I was supposed to edit.<br />
<br />
I had a similar issue on the updating of the Animations file, I found I was missing:<br />
<br />
&lt;TextureInfo item=&quot;Spells05.tga&quot;&gt; <br />
&lt;TextureInfo item=&quot;gemicons02.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;TextureInfo item=&quot;beastlord01.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;A_ClassAnimHighlight15&quot;&gt; <br />
<br />
My question is this: (Since even after updating my files, the UI does not work) Are these critical files for the UI to work now? <br />
<br />
Edit: I just noticed that Remilo has a patch which I will try on this. Eep! Sorry if this was a repost!</div></div><hr />
