<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if anyone out there would be interested in making a FF11 looking UI. I play both games and i would think having a similiar UI in EQ would be good to ease the transition. Also I think it looks pretty slick. <br />
<br />
Problem is i cant provide screen shots because the game doesnt allow screenshots while the games menus are showing. I could make a very rough version of it but i dont know enough about the coding to do anything further then moving components around and editing them slightly. <br />
<br />
So I hope to get a response from someone who plays FF11 or has access to it who knows a good amount about coding. In the mean time i'll be figuring out a way to get SS of the games menus.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here are some screenshots I just got. I can only post 2 of them now because of their size even though their in jpeg format. I havent got one with the group window yet though.<br />
<br />
For now i can tell you the group members health and mp bars show up in the same window that the players info is in and look exactly the same just below one another and the players info stays on top.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bobdz</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then you misread my post Cairenn I stated that it is one the worst UI mainly because it is not userfriendly and ergo there will be no easy transition from one game to the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That most certainly wasn't what you said the first time.  The first time, you said it was one of the worst UIs.  Period.  No reasoning, no suggestions for alterations that would make it not &quot;one of the worst UIs&quot;, nothing of any substantive value or benefit.  It appeared that you were flaming the original poster for wanting an EQ UI based on it.<br />
<br />
This time, you posted reasons for your opinion, which differentiates it.  Now it has become something to be taken into consideration when contemplating creating the UI, rather than an unproductive flame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bobdz</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then my apologies Cairenn</div></div><hr />
