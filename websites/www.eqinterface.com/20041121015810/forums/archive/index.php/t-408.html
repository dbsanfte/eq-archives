<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Statix</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the /bazaar crashing bug is caused by the animations.xml file and the bazaar search window (verant added a new image so ANY mod that uses an older animations.xml will crash with /bazaar) <br />
<br />
im pretty sure this bug affects the vertical buff box mod for one. <br />
<br />
the new image is called A_SqrButton(the stupidass background behind the ItemName/Price/Seller list) , or something similar <br />
<br />
just thought all of the people who are crashing should know about it <br />
<br />
Quartz UI 1.2 (with bazaar patch+others) is released @ EQSkins.com or the quartz UI site http://skins.machin-shin.net<br />
<br />
i hope that clears up some stuff</div></div><hr />

I first saw the new resizable bazaar window and thought it was dumb as anything because it did not also resize the columns.  But then, I noticed these tiny little lines next to the colums, they are little handles you drag the size of the columns with.  That's what they added.<br />
<br />
Would have been nice to say something about that, eh?</div></div><hr />

But didn't get time to update my webpages or resubmit them to sites yet.  But you can get the file here  http://dm-mt.dynu/files/updates/buffwindow.zip   It is also smaller horizontally now, for those who put that feedback in.</div></div><hr />
