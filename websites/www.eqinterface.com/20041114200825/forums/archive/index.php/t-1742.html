<br />
Since both of these require the EQUI_Animations.xml file to be changed, I've included an installation text with both archives explaining what to enter, so this mod shouldn't interfere with any others that also modify that file.<br />
<br />
Here are the two zip files:<br />

Any feedback is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tipop</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It appears I left something out of the spell-window archive, as someone tried it and it loaded strangely.  As soon as my DSL gets up and running again (using a crappy dial-up at the moment) I will upload a revision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tipop</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I fixed the problem.<br />
<br />
The directions on how to modify the EQUI_Animations file was in error, which caused some people problems.<br />
<br />
I have now included the edited EQUI_Animations file, which should work fine if you are not using any other mods that change it.<br />
<br />
I have also included better directions on how to edit the animations file, in case you *are* using a mod that has changed it already.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any feedback on these two.  I would like a few people to try them out (in a test folder) and let me know if there are any improvements I could make before I submit them as &quot;finished&quot;.<br />
<br />
Once that is done, I plan to do some different styles, keeping the XML the same and just changing the graphics.  My girlfriend has already expressed an interest in using this spellcasting window, but with leaves for the buttons.  (Three guesses what her class is. hehe.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a couple of people would install these and let me know if there are any difficulties, I would really appreciate it.</div></div><hr />
