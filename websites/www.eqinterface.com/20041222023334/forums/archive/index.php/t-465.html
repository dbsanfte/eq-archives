<br />
I am glad to see the &quot;hybrid&quot; part of this class specific forum open (and i hope it is because the post I did to say it was missing :cool: ).<br />
<br />
Now, what do you think would be the best UI for rangers ?<br />
<br />
IMO, the &quot;UI for rangers&quot; on website is just not what I am waiting for.<br />
<br />
I found right now :<br />
      - buff window : i love the windows with small icons, and the name on the right, with blue or red background color for positive or negative effect.<br />
<br />
      - Player window : as a pvp server player, i would probably use the windows with all your stats (hp bar &amp; number, ac , atk , mana bar and percentage, stats, resists...).<br />
<br />
<br />
After those 2, i have no real idea for the others windows ... I like the spell window unmodified with a bit smaller gems, but we can sure do better ; I still haven't seen really interesting book mod ; I think there can be better group window than just old one with percentages, same for target window ( well , one nice thing on both of them would be pet health with just jauge , no percent, because i hate this &quot;0%&quot; showing when there is nothing to show ).<br />
<br />
I still wanna see a nice new track window ( i wonder how would be a big window with multi-lists, by con color :D )<br />
<br />
For the other windows, i have no idea.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post ur ideas , url of what u think is an interesting UI( url of pics would be nice too).<br />

<br />
Check the sites out for a new tracking window mod.  Someone made a trimmed down window for it I liked.  He removed the lesser used items from it, and made it look &quot;old school&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ftp://ftp.frontiernet.net/pub/users/anarqy/apollyon.zip<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot prior to 8/14 which will give you an idea of how it looks (just imagine the addition of the compass):<br />
<br />
http://www.frontiernet.net/~AnaRQy/apollyon_ui.jpg<br />
<br />
Most of the UI is bits and pieces I've found on this site and others that worked best for me personally.  One original file is EQUI_MyAnimations.xml, which is all the animations changes needed for this UI to work.<br />
<br />
Having the addition of this file (and the subsequent include statement in the EQUI.xml) prevents having to mod the EQUI_Animations.xml file every time a patch changes it.  In other words, this mod won't crash when Animations is patched :)<br />
<br />
Best thing about this UI from a Ranger's perspective is the modified tracking window, which has all the buttons for filter and sort at the top.<br />
<br />
***Note:  This UI is modified and has been tested post-8/14 patch and works like a charm!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildice</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to state some facts about the way I fight as a ranger, in general I think most rangers also fight this way.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Rangers like to switch weapons during battles, HENCE the equiped item boxes should be close to our inventory boxes and they should be on the screen in a convenient location. ( I don't want to run my mouse all over the screen.) WHY? you ask. Because rangers have proc'ing weapons and we fight with them just until we get the proc. IE Earth Caller.<br />
<br />
2. Rangers aren't used to targeting group members but we do NEED to do it on occasion. lets put &quot;F2&quot; next to the first member &quot;F3&quot; next to second member . . . and so on. Hence we won't need to have our group members screen to close to the action. WHY because as a Ranger I might need to DS or even emergency heal caster or a cleric.<br />
<br />
3. YES buffs are a big problem for Rangers we have so darn many of them. Lables with small icons is a good idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Norwolf</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always modified my interface to see as much of the world as possible. I think all Rangers want to see whats around them as one of their skills is that of a puller &amp; exploder.<br />
<br />
Here are a few points that I will be pushing toward while I’m customizing an interface.<br />
<br />
<br />
small but legible icons / buttons etc<br />
<br />
I have grown accustom to using the keyboard for sitting, book, invite, disband, etc so all those vision blocking things will be gone.<br />
<br />
I also like placing windows up where they will support each other in the even I am using my mouse for some reason keeping the target, group, spells, self.<br />
<br />
When I move around I have a tendency to always take the high ground, as such I differ from most EQ users in that i like my text, &quot;windows&quot;, etc. at the top in the &quot;sky&quot; as im often looking down into the &quot;vally&quot;<br />
<br />
As a Ranger I’m sure we are use to battle span and possibly having the danger of missing comments due to battle Spam. hits mode was a great and I see they are not taking it out... I hope that we can tweak the hitsmode / &quot;chat windows&quot; enough to get what we want. One question I had was Damage shields showing up in the &quot;main window&quot; is there a way to move this to a different window or is the easy way to move all &quot;chat&quot; to a new window, combat to a new window and just close that original window down?<br />
<br />
Tacking I like the quick changes you can do however I don’t like the space it takes up so I’m still hopping someone makes a nice track window to use so I donut have to  :-)<br />
<br />
I like the spell tip text on the new buff window that are always on for now, as well as the background color change effects. However once we get use to the icon I believe many will not need the &quot;text&quot; showing up, so ultimately I think a small effects icon with each spell having a outline or bar that would enable you to quickly know if you had harmful spell cast on you would be the ultimate set up.<br />
<br />
Some of the innovatory / hotkey combinations are great.... perhaps would I would change would be to cut down on the number of innovatory slots as my use with them would be to change a few weapons around as needed [swiftwind/LSoEE with Swarmcaller, etc]<br />
<br />
<br />
heads up this is my first post... don’t know if my Sig, etc will work :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelric</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sylviania, the best place I've found for Ranger-friendly UI components is at the Ranger's Glade (www.interealms.com), specifically this thread:<br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6917<br />
<br />
Even though Sunmoon requested all UI's go in that thread, if you do a search you'll find some more. There's one in particular by Kruull that has an excellent inventory window, and I think Sean Spiritarrow posted a trimmed-down tracking window. I've also seen multiple examples of Hotbutton windows that include Inventory slots, for easy right-clicking and switching.<br />
<br />
Regarding battlespam, what I've done is created a second chat window and sent all Melee and Spells there. If you make sure to include &quot;Non-melee&quot;, you'll get everything: bow hits, DS's, everything. Especially with the new Hitsmode capability, you can abbreviate the hits or even just display the numbers, allowing you to make the Melee window that much smaller.<br />
<br />
I used to have three windows, the third taking all my guild and chat channel stuff, but I've found with all battle spam in it's own window and changing the &quot;echo&quot; colors to match the channel colors, I can follow just two windows with no problem... meaning I can make them wider and easier to read.<br />
<br />
Once I get some final tweaks in place, I'll post a screenshot of my preferred UI - not because it's innovative, but because it just works really well for me, as a ranger. Of course, I like the smooth, streamlined look, that doesn't interfere with vision.<br />
<br />
Oh, one other thing: I've run into a LOT of folks who really like the /viewport command. They compress the view window enough to set all the UI components outside, almost like a modified version of the old UI.  You can see an example in a link in this thread:<br />

But the more I get into the gaming world and my fascination with the more technical aspects of it grows the more I realize just how little I know.   So here are a couple of questions that most of you will think are pretty dumb lol but like I said I am real newby to this stuff so please bear with me.<br />
<br />
1) What does this comman do?  /viewport <br />
    I followed the link but am more then a bit confused can someone explain it in &lt;cough, cough&gt; english?   Note that I have a small screen I belive I use 640X480 if that helps.<br />
<br />
2) Where do you folks learn how to do all this stuff?  I have a trial verison of an old version of Paintshop Pro and frankly though I have messed with it a bit I still dont have much of clue what I am doing.  For example I created the buttons and background for my website useing this program. Mind you the dragon was drawn by someone else. http://www.geocities.com/jadell_nightsong/<br />
<br />
I am sure I will have alot more questions in the future but theres a starter.  My own prefrences for a Ranger based UI are fairly simple at this point.<br />
<br />
A) I like the combination hotbutton/Inventory window I have seen on this sight and plan to use it as soon as I am certain I can install it without messing something up.<br />
<br />
B)I want a smaller spell gem window. I hate that my hotkeys currently overlap the end of the gem window.  Not sure if I will go to a horizonal spell gems window or use one of the skins/mods that turn it into a two column window.<br />
<br />
C) The percentages being added to HP, Mana, Sta I like alot especialy the group HP percentages but I would like the exp bar added to my personal info window onder the HP, Mana, Sta bars havent found one I really like yet.<br />
<br />
D) I like the idea of putting my battle spam in second chat window never thought of doing that thank you for the Idea.  Will do that the next time I go in.<br />
<br />
Other stuff I have seen Here I am gonna check on like the buff text idea.  With my small screen I am not sure it will work but I do like it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the Ideas and info I will be checking back here quite often you can be sure.</div></div><hr />

You know there was a time I considered myself to be computer literate.

So here are a couple of questions that most of you will think are pretty dumb lol but like I said I am real newby to this stuff so please bear with me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I almost never make the mistake that I know everything about computers, even after 20+ years of programming, building, etc. with them, I always find something new that Ihave never seen before.  It's just my assimilation of new information about them runs faster now :)<br />
<br />
<br />
1) What does this comman do?  /viewport <br />
    I followed the link but am more then a bit confused can someone explain it in &lt;cough, cough&gt; english?   Note that I have a small screen I belive I use 640X480 if that helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
/viewport allows you to change the viewable &quot;game window&quot; size to smaller than your full screen.  sort of think of it as a way to make your screen look more like how the old blue-marble 640x480 rez screen did, where you could put things around the sides, and not cover your character's vision.<br />
<br />
To use it is simple.  the first two numbers after it are the coordinates on the screen for the upper left corner of your viewport, the firs one being X, the last one being Y.  now, depending on your resolution, the ranges for these numbers change.  However, if they are both zeros, it will stick it in the upper left corner.  as the first number gets larger, the more right the window moves.  as the second number gets larger, the more down the window moves.  The last two numbers are the width and height of the window, in pixels.  The bigger the 3rd number, the wider it gets, and the bigger the 4th (last) number is, the taller it gets.  here's some examples:<br />
<br />
/viewport 79 59 640 480<br />
<br />
this would make a viewable window of 640x480 pixels in size, and the upper left corner be at 79, 59.  If you were playing at 800x600 resolution, it would be centered on your screen.<br />
<br />
/viewport  139 0 1000 750<br />
<br />
this would make a viewable window of 1000x750 pixels in size, and the upper left corner would be at the very top of the screen, and shifted right a bit.  if you were playing at 1280x1024 resolution, it would be centered at the top of your screen.<br />
<br />
Easy enough?<br />
<br />
 [B]<br />
2) Where do you folks learn how to do all this stuff?  I have a trial verison of an old version of Paintshop Pro and frankly though I have messed with it a bit I still dont have much of clue what I am doing.  For example I created the buttons and background for my website useing this program. Mind you the dragon was drawn by someone else. http://www.geocities.com/jadell_nightsong/<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I've fiddled around with graphics programs off and on, usually just manipulating and &quot;fine tuning&quot; someone else's work to what I want.  I dunno, I learn this stuff usually by just playing with it, if it breaks no big deal, can always start over, recover from a backup, etc.  Pretty much trial and error are by two best teachers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I'm not a ranger, and was just wandering around the board, reading messages.... hope I helped.  check under the released and beta sections here, plus the downloads section of eqinterface.com, and see if there's anything in those that fit what you are looking for.</div></div><hr />

You'e obviously taken into account *everything*, and this seems like it would be absolutely perfect for rangers. There's obviously a small amount personal preference here (like the choice of inventory boxes to be used) but with a bit of modification i think any ranger could use this to its fullest. I love how everything seems to &quot;fit&quot;; both the colour scheme and the windows themselves. You make me wish I played a ranger &gt;.&lt; The tabbed spell gems is pure genius, and would be extreemly useful. I'm almost tempted to use this on my cleric O.o Great job, once again, and keep up the great work.</div></div><hr />

The green and gold colors, as well as the Ivy texture are modified Window pieces and backgrounds textures that Sylverpaws did.  I found the files here actually.  <br />
<br />
If you want to use them, since the DL section is disabled ATM, just DL my UI and extract only the Window pieces and backgrounds to your UI folder.</div></div><hr />

Find where your everquest folder is.  Usually it's C:\Program Files\Everquest<br />
<br />
In it there's a folder called uifiles.<br />
<br />
In the uifiles folder there is a folder called default.  This contains the default VI UI files.<br />
<br />
Create a new folder in the uifiles folder.  example call it CustomUI<br />
<br />
Extract the files from Mav_UI_Mods.zip into the folder you created<br />
<br />
Enter EQ and load up the char you wish to use.  If you haven't already enabled the new UI, type /newui and camp to desktop.<br />
<br />
After the new UI is enabled, reload the charactor and type /loadskin (whatever you called the new folder) 1<br />
<br />
Now the new UI should load up.<br />
<br />
Resize and move Windows as necessary.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

I like the idea of a tabbed Spell Gem Box however would it be possible to make the &quot;clickable&quot; inventory Boxes like stardard Hotkeys? This would allow me to place my Coldain ring and other Clickables there without Limiting me to the inventory slots you have assigned.<br />

 I wish I had a clue how to make this change myself.... I will look forward to seeing either a simple way I can change what inventory slots are assigned or a new Spell Gem Box Mod for me to download.<br />

Don't use wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga and wnd_bg_light_rock.tga .  Delete those two from your custom UI folder and EQ will just grab the &quot;default&quot; ones.</div></div><hr />

This seems to be a common problem. :( All I did to the Buff box was reduce the spellicon size and spacing as well as removed the title bar.<br />
<br />
Here's how I've had success resolving the issue:<br />
<br />
1.  Type /Load default<br />
2.  Move the Buff box to the upper left corner of the screen<br />
3.  Type /Load Default 1<br />
4.  Type /load &lt;whatever&gt; 1<br />
5.  Move and resize boxes as necessary<br />
<br />
If all else fails.  Just use the default Buff Box or find a different one that suits you.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

I need a little more info to be able to help you out.<br />
<br />
1.  Where did you DL the UI from?<br />
2.  What is the complete path to the custom folder?<br />
3.  Did you only put the files contained in my UI Mod in the Custom folder?<br />
4.  What is the Error message in it's entireity?<br />

Try the copy that is linked in this thread:<br />

and make sure that the only files in the custom folder are the ones from the Mav_UI_Mods_10_16.zip</div></div><hr />

After posting this I saw the thread with the updated UI file download location and saw that the file was updated so I downloaded the new one from the link you mentioned. Deleted the old one and the custom folder made a neew custom folder and unzipped the new one. Loaded the default got in game and loaded yours and this time it worked just fine. Got it all :)<br />
Only thing I had to do was use your fix for the dissappearing buff box.<br />
<br />
I love this ui but it's a little busy for the resolution I play at. I'm a total newb at this stuff and would like to know is there a way I can modify it for a 1024x768 resolution? I realize that would require code changes someplace but don't have a clue where to start. Thanks a ton, you help is greatly appreciated and what a fantastic UI!! Excellent work :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But ... alas ... being a member of the Top Raid guild on my server has it's responsibilities.  So to make a long story short, I haven't had a lot of time to fool with  the UI other than keeping it functional in it's current form.<br />
<br />
Lot's of clever ideas I've seen and considered, like Maps, LOC Charts, Tradeskill recipies, Timers and the like.  But all that stuff takes system resources that I prefer to have used elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I am trying to incorporate TKing Graphics as they come along to keep the Rangerish/RPG feel to the UI.  Vert, Sars and other mods are really quite cool, but I feel they really don't fit the feel of the RPG/Fantasy environment we play in.  Some I've seen, seem more suited to the Starwars Galaxies game then EQ.<br />
<br />
The UI graphics I use and share with all of you, for me anyway, enhance my EQ playing experience by being more in tune with the Fantasy RPG that EQ is.<br />
<br />
So, for now, I will be keeping the UI functional for future patches and working on a new one, somewhat condensed and less &quot;busy&quot; as time allows.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all of the posative comments and your continued support  :)</div></div><hr />

Can't wait till you get the less busy version done though, but for now I'm gonna make do with what you have because it is so cool and really fits both my character and play style. just had to rearrange where some of the boxes were is all. :)<br />

works great, but has slowed down my zone-times considerably.<br />
I'm working on one of my own now, that's using standard backgrounds, but custom borders, with most of the same features found in yours Mav (since they're the best I've found so far) but a more compact, out-of-the-way design (I hate trying to target mobs and ending up just moving my group window into the middle of the screen in the middle of a raid :D )</div></div><hr />

I found a lot of good info on this thread and I have a request (that I will also be posting in the requests section).<br />
<br />
I play a Ranger, and now that i'm reaching the higher end i find myself swapping out weapons and items fairly frequently depending on the situation.  What I am looking for is a slimmed down inventory window, either a horizontal one or a vertical one.  I have seen several where the primary inventory slots (8) are added to the hotkey window, and some even include the weapon slots and possibly one or 2 more.<br />
<br />
Although these are close to what I would want, what I am really looking for is a long, slim inventory with all slots.  It could even have the spots reduced in size to save space.  This window could be vertical or horizontal, and even contain the player info allowing me to remove that that window as well.<br />
<br />
I've been trying to locate one similar to this, but as yet have been unsuccessful.  Any thoughts on this, or possible UI's that could fill my needs would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After looking at your UIs, the hot button window with the inventory slots added on seems like it may be very feasible for what I am looking for.<br />
<br />
A couple questions I have about it: <br />
<br />
The container slot in the top position, and the 5 inventory slots below it, are they set for for specific slots, or would I be able to use some form of drag/drop to put anything there?  For instance could I make the spot under the container a ring inventory spot, and then if I no longer needed a ring spot change it to say a face slot?<br />
<br />
The other question I have is, If later on I wanted more than 5 swap slots (that's just the way i think of them) would that be somthing that would be possible?<br />
<br />
Also just wanted to say that the full UI skin you show looks really nice as well.  Is it LoY enabled, and the viewable are seems like it would be reduced significantly, is this the case?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the horizontal spellbar option it's the best hybrid UI out there imo, and looks fantastic as well.<br />
<br />
Only problems are: <br />
<br />
Resolution can be hard to handle if your comp doesn't do 1152 x 864 or isn't big enough for 1280 x 1024 (although I've managed to force it to do 1152 somehow, will see if the graphics patch screws it)<br />
<br />
Chat windows are a little small, but this can be sorted by getting fontsize / titlebar / bordersize altered to your satisfaction, or putting invisible text windows along the sides of the screen.<br />

As a Guild leader, I tipiccaly have somewheres around 6-10 tell windows open, and 6 chat boxes.

The second one I don't think can be in just a skin, but it's a feature I've wanted for a long time so I'm going to mention it.<br />
<br />
#1  An Auto-fire feature:<br />
      Currently, there is an external piece of software tht can             give the Ranger a button to hit and it will fire till you turn it off.  I don't remember the name of it, think I read about it on rgpexperts or someplace like that.<br />
<br />
#2  Targeting feature:<br />
       I would like to see a way that would alow the ranger to target something from his track window, or at least con it.<br />
This would alow you to con or target or sonething from the track list.<br />
I'd like to see a be able to track a locantion or spot that they previously marked.  I would also like to see them be able to track corpses, or at least track their own corpse.  I'd also like to see the track skill raised form 200 to 255, especially since they raised the track skill of the druids.<br />
