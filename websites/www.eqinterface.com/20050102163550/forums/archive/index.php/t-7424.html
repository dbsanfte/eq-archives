<br />
<br />
1. Did you check the  to verify the proper way to install your UI?<br />
<br />
Yes I checked that, and I installed it correctly <br />
<br />
2. In your main EQ directory, in the eqclient.ini file, do you have:<br />
<br />
NewUI=True, UISkin=Default<br />
<br />
Yes <br />
<br />
3. In your main EQ directory, in the UI_CharacterName_ServerNumber.ini file, do you have:<br />
<br />
UISkin=CustomFolderName<br />
<br />
(Make sure it is spelled the same as the custom folder. example: &quot;Custom&quot; does not equal &quot;custom&quot; nor does it equal &quot;CUSTOM&quot;.)<br />
<br />
Yes, it reads UISkin=CustomFeb24<br />
<br />
4. Did you put your custom files in a different folder than your default? If you just overwrote the files in the default folder, the patcher will overwrite them. They have to be in a seperate folder. Your path should look like:<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\EverQuest\uifiles\customfoldername\files<br />
<br />
]C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest Trilogy\uifiles is the way mine looks.  I notice the difference is that *\files* is missing from mine.  Is that possibly the problem? <br />
<br />
5. Did you make sure that the files aren't in a sub-folder within your custom folder? See this graphical interpretation by Kudane.<br />
<br />
There are no subfolders in the file. <br />
<br />
6. Did you make sure that when you typed in the command line that you spelled it the same in-game as the folder is named? example: &quot;Custom&quot; doesn't equal &quot;custom&quot; nor does it equal &quot;CUSTOM&quot;<br />
<br />
The file name and the line I typed in game are the same[/COLOR] <br />
<br />
7. Is there any chance that you have 2 EQ directories?<br />
<br />
ie C:\Program Files\EverQuest\Blah blah blah and C:\Program Files\EverQuest Trilogy (or Sony or EverQuest Gold or something like that)\Blah blah blah<br />
<br />
Yes but that didnt work. [COLOR=blue<br />
<br />
Additional general information<br />
<br />
I downloaded ShamanFeb24.  I changed the name to CustomFeb24 just so I could have the word *custom* in the title for easier search purposes.  I unzipped it to uifiles.  I didnt touch/modify the default folder.  In game, the screen would freeze for a moment, then reload the default skin, though it moved the windows around (i foud out *true* would stop that).<br />
<br />
I checked to see if there were any uitexterrors but there arent any.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this information can help someone help me.<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />

If you didn't make a copy of the default folder (which is correct), then there should be something in your UIError.txt log file (found in your main EQ directory).  Log in, try to load your skin, as soon as it gives you the error message, either log out or go to windowed mode, and post your Error log here.<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest Trilogy\uifiles is the way mine looks. I notice the difference is that *\files* is missing from mine. Is that possibly the problem? &lt;snip&gt;<br />
I unzipped it to uifiles<br />
Are the files in a folder under UIFiles, or are they just &quot;loose&quot; within that folder (UIFiles).<br />
<br />
*edit* BTW, just wanted to thank you.  It's really great to see a post where someone obviously read the information we provide and tried to give us as much information as they can about their problem.  Kudos to you! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my case, I did not copy *all* the files I had unzipped to the custom folder.  I checked the uierrors.txt file and saw that it could not find some/most of the files and set them back to default.  I unzipped the file this time directly to the folder and it worked perfectly.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your time,<br />

PS Doing the bare minimum was the least I could do to fix my own problem.</div></div><hr />
