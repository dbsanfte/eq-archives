<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angeliny</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I'm having a problem trying to load a new UI. I'm totally new to the UI thing ;). <br />
<br />
1. This is the UI I'm trying to load :  http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3019<br />
<br />
2. Steps I took: A. Created a new folder in uifiles section, right next to the default folder (called Kenna2) B. Downloaded the file C. Extracted the files D. Went on EQ and did /loadskin but the only folder listed was default<br />
<br />
3. I went to the uierrors.txt and all it said was: UIErrorLog created at Sun Feb 22 18:27:52 2004. I'm not sure if that means anything ^^. <br />
<br />
I'm not very experienced with computers, but any advice will help =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laroden</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This zip file already contains a folder, so basically what you have is a folder in a folder, and EverQuest won't read folders in folders.  So you need to copy and past the uifiles/kenna2/kenna2 folder into uifile/knenna2, then get rid of the empty one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angeliny</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I moved stuff around so there is only 1 folder (Kenna2) and it has no folders inside. I tried EQ again, but I still only see the default as one of the choices.<br />
<br />
It seems like I'm missing something important, but I just can't figure it out =/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angeliny</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was talking to one of my friends, and they mentioned something about maybe it wasn't updated after the patch. I looked and saw it was last updated on 3/3. Is that too long ago?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, have you tried the info in the FAQ??<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=FAQ&amp;file=index&amp;myfaq=yes&amp;id_cat=3&amp;categories=Installing+Interfaces <br />
<br />
Second, the date of the UI's last update has nothing to do with why you can't see it listed in EQ.<br />
<br />
Third, are you sure you only have EQ installed in one location on your computer??  Right click the icon you use to start EQ, and select properties from the menu that pops up.  On the shortcut tab, what does it say for target.  Depending on what version of Windows you're using, the menu you get when you right click the icon may look different.  Essentially, find out which file the icon is pointing to.<br />
<br />
Once you find that out, does the path you find look similar to where you're putting your UI file??  If not, then you probably have EQ installed (or partially installed) in more than one location.</div></div><hr />
