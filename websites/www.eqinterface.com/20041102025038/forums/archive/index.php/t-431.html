The actions window is hidden via Alt-M but remains in the same spot. if you want to move it you will need to edit the Actionswindow xml file to read Title bar true.<br />

I moved the inventory buttons out of 2 windows and intot he old spell casting window. and made them a little bigger. the actions window is moveable , and the pet window is hidden atm via Alt P  since I couldn't think of anything to put in there =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmier</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Transparency is still there I just have it viewported  so the backround is black.  you can do the colors pretty easy within the game actually, thats how I did those just right clicked and went to tint color. <br />
<br />
<br />
and Yes I agree I give total props to Stratix, all I did really was flip flop it some. and realign the bars and info to fit the backrounds.</div></div><hr />

I tried this mod and it doesnt fit my game window. I cant go to 1200 size it hurts my system and monitor barely runs it. I use the size up from 800X600.<br />
<br />
Also, how can I add about 3 inches of blank space under the EQ game window with the new ability. I cant remember what its called but, shrink the game window up so that I can put info windows in the blank spot and free up my game screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After looking at this skin and thinking I decided that there were a few things that I did not like and wanted to change.  So here is a screen shot of my skin.  A great deal of thanx go out to ***Statix*** as well as ***Grimmier*** for what they started with this skin.  <br />
<br />
Just a few things that I added:<br />
<br />
*Percentage values on the bars<br />
*Added the Stamina Bar<br />
*Removed the Stamina value from Stats list<br />
*Moved everything around a bit to fit better<br />
*Adjusted the Spell gems to fit a little better (Still working on them, not quite right yet I think)<br />
*Added the percentage for the Pet<br />
*Modified the Lower Chat window for Hitsmode<br />
*Modified the colors of some of the bars just a little to make the percentage more visable (just made them a little darker)<br />
<br />
Assuming that VI gets the other issues that we are all having fixed I will eventually add the Coin counts to this as well,  since that is the only thing that I don't have in this so far that I would like to see (With the destory button as well)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
***Update***  As soon as I have a chance I will upload the zip file with my changes in it.</div></div><hr />

Oh and I had a question Chrom.  How come you removed the STA stat from the player bar?  The added stamina bar is nice but i'd also like to be able to make sure I had right amount of sta buffs :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh sorry was miss thinking things.<br />

I can put them in that pattern but it might through off the look of the area,  The area is king of set up for the<br />
<br />
  1 2<br />
 3 4 5<br />
 6 7 8<br />
  9 10<br />
<br />
Layout, but I will work with it to find a way to get it to work in the area that is there.<br />
<br />
About the Sta value.  I removed it just for look.  With it there is was throwing off the curve around the top.  I might be able to get it in there if I decrease the size opf the fonts for the values of all of them.  I will look into that as well. Who knows maybe with all the imput I can make it even better than it is now....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bending</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the 2nd one is the same as it is now isnt it? Heh</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I could move them over some and get them in there vertical if you didn't care whether the background graphic was going to be out of place with the buttons...<br />
<br />
Let me know which one you prefer and I will get them put that way and get the skin put up here for you.<br />
<br />
The only way to place the buttons that will preserve the look of the background graphics though is going to be to have them run horizontal though...</div></div><hr />

I play a monk on Bristlebane, in a high end guild.  I have been looking around for a UI that will work and talking to some other monks in the guild....we are looking for something pretty straight forward.  <br />
<br />
Really don't want anything overwhelming on the screen, get enough of that in pulling for a raid, trying to read small text on a shortcut or in a chat window and then there is the lag of suxxor.  Of course there is the crapple spam from attacks, proc, buffs, etc... (think you see where i am going with this)<br />
<br />
Your Melee UI is the Best I have seen towards this: Shortcut keys, Chat, buffs, Grp, Target, Your status windows, while the rest thru the shift, alt key strokes (since don't need those to much).   <br />
<br />
What I would like to ask you though, if you have a version that does not have the inventory windows below the main chat window?  Or if even possible to move Chat down at its current size and place a small hitsmode (me &amp; my) windows across the top it?<br />
<br />
Look forward to your reply if this is available.<br />

I just put em down there to keep the continuity with the backround images.<br />

Try checking your eqclient.ini or Options menu from in EQ to make sure the Keyboard section is still set correctly.

<br />
The circled areas are the changes.<br />
http://www.eqgui.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=2809 <br />
I have added the Sta value back in.  I also made the mod that was asked for to get the Hotbuttons re-aligned up and down.<br />
<br />
In making the Hotbuttons changes I had to also re-work the Inv slots.  the previous layout was as follows<br />
<br />
  1 2<br />
3 4 5     for the Hot Buttons<br />
5 6 7<br />
  8 9<br />
with the Inv slots as follows<br />
<br />
1 2 3 4<br />
   5 6 7 8<br />
<br />
With the Hot Button change the new layout is as follows<br />
<br />
1 2<br />
3 4<br />
5 6         for the Hot Buttons<br />
  7 8<br />
     9 10<br />
<br />
and the Inv slots as follows<br />
<br />
1<br />
2<br />
3<br />
4 5<br />
6 7 8<br />
<br />
This is the best way that I could come up with to get everything to line up with the back ground well.<br />
<br />
I will send the Zip file in my next message since it wont let me put them both in the same message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here are the files that changed from the original.<br />
<br />
In the zip file you will find three files:<br />
<br />
EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml      The STA value change file.<br />
<br />
EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml     The two files for the Hotbutton<br />
EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml             Change.<br />
<br />
If you only want to change the Player info window to add the STA value back in then you only need to replace the one file.<br />
<br />
If you only want the Hot Button changes then you only need the other two files.<br />
<br />
And if you want all the changes then you will need to replace all three files.<br />
<br />

I was being a dolt, I was so busy looking at the Xtml and trying to figure out what was going on, I didn't check the keybind in options -lol-<br />
<br />
Works great now, looks good and started to alter a couple of things to get things just right for me.. <br />
<br />
I run 4 chat windows so having to move things a touch to get them all in...<br />
<br />
The only other thing I have noticed I have done of late and can't figure out why is my main winodw the invite,sit,stand,camp and so on one is no longer moveable it was, I moved it to center of the screen till I could figure out where I wanted it and now I can't move it again...<br />
<br />
Any thought on this one?<br />
<br />

Also, I no longer have the window that has the icons to open up the various boxes on the screen anymore. Maybe I goofed something up.

(that are not included in the Zip) (I left out the ones that weren't edited by either Statix or myself) <br />

----files to copy over------<br />
- EQUI.xml<br />

- EQUI_BazaarWnd.xml <br />

<br />
I have tried erasing the file, copying and renaming a clean default file, then dumping the dloaded melee into it.  There is no file in this dload that I can rename and copy to my everquest directory like in the caster version.  Also, I am still stuck with a mana bar in this one.  I am a warrior.<br />
<br />
I have also tried witha  clean default, copy, rename, dump the caster version in and then dump the melee version on top to no avail.  Still have the stamina bar replaced with the mana bar.<br />
<br />
Other than this I am fine.  If I knew what file(s) in melee were for this block I could probably just swap them.<br />
<br />
thank you in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok sorry it has taken me so long.  I was on vacation last week and just got the skin back up and running last night.  The only file that needed to be changed is the one I have included here.  But in order for the skin to work right you will need to delete the following files from you skin directory (NOT YOUR DEFAULT directory)<br />
<br />
- EQUI.xml<br />
- EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd.xml<br />
- EQUI_BazaarWnd.xml <br />
- EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml <br />
- window_pieces04.tga <br />
<br />
Once you have deleted these files and copied this one in to your skin dir you should be good to go.  Do not worry about the fact that you are deleting a couple files.  VI has made it so that when a file is not found in your skin dir it will automaticaaly go to the Default Dir to find them.  And since these files are not related to this skin they do not need to be in your Skin dir.<br />
<br />
Once the File attachments are back up and running I will include the zip file with the updated file that you need to run the Mod with the new changes VI has put in place.  And since the Compass is so small in size you can fit it right in the bottom right hand corner of the skin.</div></div><hr />

if its just the player window.  and you have a copy of the old one you can just replace the playerwindow xml file with the old one.</div></div><hr />

I only have on problem. It seems there is a stacking issue with windows. When I tell a pet to attack, I then can no longer use the top two spells, I have to click the second rom to activate the window and then I can use the top spells....really strange. I din't have this prob with the original quartz, maybe it was becauseI had to manually place the windows? The UI_blah_99.ini didn't seem to work for me...<br />

You already have the action window so it can be hidden, why not remove it from it's window (reload the default) and add some equipment slots in that possition for hot clicking some clickable armor (Jboots, ES Vamb, etc.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightWolf</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One more thing :)    I sort of like the way that Stratix had it set up, I like having my targeting (group and self) right next to my heal spell.  It causes less deaths from late heals (My mouse sometimes lags accross screen, causing a little to much delay).  Although I have to use the spellbook to med on the fly (when kiting) so I just have it minimized so it stays out of the way.<br />
<br />
If there was a sit button by the spells, that would be nice, but that's not really possible without moving the hotbuttons next to spells (like you have), and there's not enough room for those too if I keep my group stuff there :)  <br />

This will work with any UI so can easily drop it into the quartz one. <br />
<br />
to move it around though  you will need to edit the XML or of course wait till i set it up already aligned =P<br />
