<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thossy</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While this isn't an EQW help board, I figured a post here may be in order since my problem *seems* to be UI-related.  With any luck someone on the multiple boards I've posted on may have an answer for me.   Anyway, on to the problem..<br />
<br />
I'm using Vert 2.2, fully patched with everything and these boards, and edited using Cairenn's fixes.  In fullscreen/SoEwindows my ui checks out fine, I get no error messages saying that it is not compatable.  However, when I try to load the UI in EQW, I get a clean boot to desktop, with no error message at all.  When this happens my UIErrors.txt file gets updated, but all it contains is the time/date stamp of the latest attempt to load (in EQW), there are no details about specific errors.<br />
<br />
I get the same results using both 16 bit and 32 bit color depths.  Color depths always match in eqw.ini and eq.ini, and in-game resolution is the same as desktop resolution.<br />
<br />
I've spent hours searching the boards for another poster with this problem, but with no luck.  So forgive me if I missed something in my search.  Any help with this problem would be appreciated, and thanks for tolerating the (possible) off topic post.</div></div><hr />

It might be the same issue, so try this out.  The only change I made was to put the comment down a few lines.  Sounds iffy for your problem, but who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelara</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the exact same problem, only I'm using Sars version 4.0 (with his 1/20/03 patch installed) <br />
<br />
If I log using a totally default UI I can use EQW fine now, as long as I have no extra windows created etc. As soon as I attempt to load any skin other than default I crash to desktop. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions regarding what changes, if any, can be made to the UI to make it EQW compliant? <br />
<br />
I'd love to be able to go back to using EQW but not at the expense of my UI. I can't play in default UI :(</div></div><hr />

Setting up your windows again is always a pain though, so you might want to back the .ini file up before doing anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've read that it is a UI problem probably related to some minor xml error.  I've also read that lots of trial and error loading xml files one at a time can isolate the problem file.<br />
<br />
has anyone done this?  perhaps if it is know which file is a problem the error might be identified.<br />
