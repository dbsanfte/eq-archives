But seriously. If verant is actually planning this, they will be answering the pleas of us music buffs ever since the game came out. No more unreliable workarounds; this will be the real thing.<br />

I'm getting tired of switching hotkey banks to select mp3 tracks (not to mention that I'll sometimes forget to switch back, or I'll switch to the wrong one, especially whilst raiding).<br />
<br />
So, I guess now the question is, can we rip whats in the xml file on test and dump it into a modded window now?  Would it work right, or what.  We all know Sony's penchant for leaving things hanging forever and ever (hihi gender illusion been in beta for 5 years, as well as illusion scaled wolf)<br />

<br />
Nope sorry... the xml it self cant play the mp3's. You would need the new everquest.exe as well as maybe a few other files.</div></div><hr />

File selector is apparently to load mp3s and/or playlists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yar, looks like it. Here's some eye candy for those who want to see what it looks like, attached below. This thing is awesome. One of the greatest features is that it can load already made Winamp playlists (.w3u) so you don't have to spend ages searching for your favorite songs again. <br />
<br />
As a warning, whenever this goes live it will likely break quite a few mods, though i haven't investigated the changes thoroughly; it would not allow my character on test who is set to my own modded interface (which has rarely broken in the past) to even complete loading, crashing to desk. But if you load up an unmodded interface character on the test server it'll run just fine.</div></div><hr />

Clearly, Verant is making a concsious choice to NOT provide the ability to populate STMLBOXs which leaves skinners having to display TEXT as GRAPHICS.  Frustrated to the point of tears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems you can only add one song at a time (and with my collection of music, loading all my music that I listen to is going to take longer than me leveling to 65) &lt;Sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
The other issue was that I use Vert/Nexium and just for fun, I decided to load my skin (I use default on Test).  We can all guess what happened -- crash to desktop.<br />
<br />
At least this time, SOE/Verant gave some warning - but it looks like I'll be tweaking my files again (along with everyone else).<br />
<br />
I'll be watching the boards for patches for Vert/Nexium.</div></div><hr />

For ease, you can then save that playlist into your EQ directory using the save button. Easy, neh?:D</div></div><hr />

Sound output sounds good... I have good sound, very rich, sounds as if you were playing on any WINAMP or JB.. But it would depend also on your sound card... running SB Live! myself still sounds great...<br />
<br />
The played music cuts all other music in the background... so if your someplace where the music normally plays, your music selection will override that... so only your music played is heard.. Combat music is overridden as well...<br />
<br />
As for CPU/mem usage.. nothing noticable as if you were to play WINAMP... minute at that...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...I suppose I shouldn't assume that everyone's been using PCs as long as I have. I've always been an audio junkie, but not all are. You can pull the mp3 song files from your CD collection fairly easily using various programs. If you'd like to download some songs you don't have, Kazaa (www.kazaa.com) is a pretty good, popular media downloader, and there are several others. As long as you don't have any reservations about &quot;stealing&quot; music, with this whole napster debate that's long gone stale. You can find entire orchestral soundtracks to games like Zelda, if you're looking for great music for Everquest, and if you have a high bandwidth connection, you can download an entire advarage-length song in the time it takes to listen to it. If you're stuck on dialup, like i once was, you'll just have to wait longer:( Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

I-mesh has some spy ware but you can get rid of it by running Ad-Ware a program by Lavasoft that finds spy ware in your registry and gets rid of it. If you run Ad-ware over Kaza it makes Kaza unusable for some reason but dosent have that effect on I-Mesh. Also there is Audio Galaxy for really hard to find MP3's. It creats a data base and even if the person isnt on line it will tell you when the person is on line to get what ever song or songs that your little heart desires. :nana: Limewire is a purely peer to peer to its a litttle slow and sometimes harder to find stuff but seeing as alot of the Kaza's and Morpheuses of the world are getting sued and I-Mesh is prolly on the list also we true Audio Philes belive Limewire is going to be the &quot;next big thing&quot; seeing as it is untrackable as it has no central server based system being a true peer to peer to spiders out useing your computer as the &quot;server&quot;. I have a 100 gigs of space just devoted to MP3's and other &quot;media&quot;. I built a file server just to hold and share them so I wouldnt have to shut it down while playing EQ.

<br />
All these questions like &quot;Is it free?&quot; &quot;Is it live yet&quot; &quot;what's it look like?&quot; could have all been answered by a quick visit to our Official EQ news site www.EverQuestLive.com . There'a a prominent 'EQ MP3 Player' link right on the front page. <br />
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/images/featured/small/MP3_player.JPG <br />
<br />
It goes here:<br />

You might want to get used to checking that site for news. Many of the EQ fan sites just copy-paste the majority of their news from there. <br />

Speaking of mp3s, where can i get some?  <br />
<br />
Well for starters you can 'rip' some from you current library of music CD's. If you dont have a 'ripper' a good one is MusicMatch Jukebox, you can also you Windows Media Player, but Im not a fan of Microsofts ripper. But otherwise you can use P2P programs such as Kazaa (site is same name www.kazaa.com) or Grokster. Just type in the music you want either by group or by song title and click on download. But be wary, Kazaa does put in Spyware in your computer... choice is yours on this matter. Enjoy and good luck!<br />

It scouers your wrecked CDs over and over 16 times to be exact and must have 9 times of the 16 to determine that the data it got is the data you want. I used it to extrac audio from an original Public Enemy CD &quot;It take a Nation of Millions to Hold US Back&quot; from 1986ish I belive that was tore up but I got all the songs in digital quality (it took 16 hours) no lie on a 1.6 gig AMD with 512megs of 333mhz DDR ram but hey I got my songs. Its a God send for discs that are UBER rare and destroyed. Most discs wont take that long but it does work. I have found a very few occasions that it didnt work but even if it dosent work it will try to compesate for the bad areas of the song by useing the data sourounding the area in question. Just a few more tips for you hard core Audio Philes out there also for copying CD's or games for that matter or even UBER copyright protected stuff try Clone CD with a Lite-On CDRW drive it will copy ANYTHING garunteed cause it writes in RAW mode. Which by passes ALL known copy protection schemes not that I encourage such things use this information for back up of your own personal archiving purposes only you have been warned and this is a disclamier that this site in no terms condones the use of technology for illegeal purposses.

I also have buffer underrun protection of some great magnitude because I can copy a CD while playing a computer game, watching a DivX movie, etc. without the copy failing, only a loss of power or complete crash of my OS (uhm, which doesn't happen) could screw up the copy. My CDRW is a no-name brand which I bought at Fry's Electronics for $40, it was in a semi-mashed box on the back of the shelf and was the last one there (next cheapest was $90 so I opted for the $40). It's 16x-10x-40x.<br />

Kiegh, I think the plugin is called SneakyAmp, I've also had that since it's earliest beta when it was a seperate program (not even a true winamp plugin).<br />
<br />
What else... just incase anyone missed my previous post, go to http://k-lite.tk and get KaZaA Lite if you are a standard KaZaA user. It doesn't have the spyware and is just slightly better over all.<br />

Also you are correct that as long as your burner can write in RAW mode Clone CD will work but Lite-On is the only brand that I know that all their models have RAW write capabilities. Plexor also can RAW write but Plexor drives are usually about $120 US. And have the same logic board as Lite-On drives basically your paying for a name. But Clone CD will runa diagnostic on your CD drive and tellyou if you can or can not use it in RAW mode. Have fun and be smart.</div></div><hr />

This is true, Lite-on CD-RWs can be found selling as the cheapest CD-RWs on the market at www.priceline.com and yes, they are the providers for such big names as Plextor and others.  Just a little reassurance that this is true.<br />

Then again for the 23:59:59 track I suppose I could just edit various tracks from my mp3 library into it-clock and music, wheee!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">helltoupe</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found my copy of Clone CD useing I-Mesh similar to Kazaa. It is shareware you can use it for I think 21 days for free then you need to register it.UNLESS you get a Regestraion Key generator that you type in your name and it will give you the Key to unlock your copy to use after the 21 day period. This BTW cheats the creator out of the money that he or she may get from making and updateing the software in question so you can buy it or cheat the guy its on you. But just remember that without people that give a few bucks here and there people in the future will have no reason to create and share what they know. But I myself am not one to judge. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
if they re-enabled the basic Windows functions (minimize, ctrl-alt-del, etc) while only allowing 1 copy of EQ to run on the computer at once, and made an option to play without patching (very helpful for those of us whose crashes are always to desktop) most people would have no reason to run EQW. But those who still chose to run EQW so they could run 2 copies of EQ or otherwise exploit the program could be disciplined without hurting the harmless folks who just want to talk on AIM or check e-mail without crashing the game.</div></div><hr />
