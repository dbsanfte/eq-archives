<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phalia</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello :)  I know absolutely zip about XML, so I come here hoping someone will take pity on me.  I am currently using 1024x768 resolution.  I love how everything is nice and compact.  My only problem is my hotbutton panel is way too small.  I have a hard time reading it, and I use my mouse for everything.  I did try going to 800x600, but everything was huge.  I felt like I had no viewing room at all.<br />
<br />
So my request:  Would someone be willing to come up with a new hotbutton panel?  I'd like it a little bit bigger than it is now, and not quite so large as it looks in 800x600 resolution.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance:)</div></div><hr />

at the bottom describes itself as just that, even though the image they show for it is the one of the file right above it, but you could try it out maybe since it's described as just being bigger for people that use the mouse primarily etc.<br />
<br />
hope it works / helps</div></div><hr />

I just looked at the pictures my first time through, and knew I didn't want inventory attached to my hotkeys.<br />

<br />
Yep, it is exactly what I needed.   :D<br />
Thanks again.<br />
