I was thinking of creating a static version of the Target Indicator for people that don't want the use an animated one.  Let me know if you would like to see a static version or if you have any ideas to improve it and I will post some modified versions.<br />

I think it looks really neat, and I downloaded it to try out, but after seeing the number of graphics that it uses I decided that it potentially could create more lag than I want to contend with.</div></div><hr />

I was trying to attach images of it to the message when you replied.  I haven't really had any lag issues with it so far but I had seen some people saying that they preferred static target indicators so I am planning on making one that is not animated.<br />

but the ring might skipp a few frames when you are raiding and your comp need to lead alot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the simplicity the majestic ring but I did notice that the animation is jumpy whereas this one is smooth.  I suspect its just a matter of frames.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dastinar</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am planning on making a few variations to the target indicator when I have some time.  <br />
<br />
The first will have the same 8 frame animation but will use the built in features in EQ to create each con color.  This should cut down on memory usage because EQ will only need to load 8 frames, not the 48 current frames.  The downside to this will be that the runes will glow a static color and the con colors that are drawn into the images will not be there so it might not be as bright as the original.  The EQ Target Indicator engine may also put a tint on all the gold rings with this version.  I'll have to experiment on it some and see how it looks.<br />
<br />
The second will be the same image for each con color without any animations.  This version will only have 8 images to load so it should not use that much memory.<br />
<br />
The third would most likely be static and I would just remove the middle animated ring that rotates counter clock wise in the original version.<br />
<br />
Just some of my ideas I've been thinking about since I finished it.  Personally, I created it because I wanted a Target Indicator with some &quot;Eye Candy&quot;.  With that in mind I figure any variations I make will be tailored for low graphics usage for use on raids etc...<br />

I use the target ring and like it very much. I have no issues of lag with it. Keep up the great work <br />

Glad you like it Sedasi :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I agree the majestic ring is also very nice.  Both basically work the same in that they have 8 images that create the animation, the only difference being the Elanthian Ring uses a different set of images for each con color.  The only thing I noticed with the majestic ring and mine was that the animations were a bit jumpy.  This is in fact due to a bug in the target indicator code in EQ.  If you were to open the TargetIndicator.ini file you would see a line for each con value that says:<br />
<br />
FrameCount=8<br />
<br />
When I was creating the indicator screenshots for the red animation I noticed that it was skipping a frame.  I replaced the images with ones that had a number for each frame and noticed that it was only displaying frames 1 thru 7.  By setting the <br />
<br />
FrameCount=[Number of Frames] + 1 (ie. 9 for 8 frame animation)<br />
<br />
I was able to fix this problem.  If you edit your TargetIndicator.ini file and change the FrameCount to 9 I'm pretty sure the animation will not be jumpy any more.  Hope this is of help to you.<br />
