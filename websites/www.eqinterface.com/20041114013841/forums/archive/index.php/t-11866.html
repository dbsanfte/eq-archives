<br />
I've been hesitant to post this before, since others have taken up the maintenance of the original vert mod that many of us liked so much.  However, my version of the original vert stuff is rather significantly different from the current stuff as maintained by Sokok and Kudane, so I thought I would go ahead and at least post mine here.<br />
<br />
I think my stuff remains truer to the original vert design, and I actually prefer it - that's not to say of course that the work done by Sokol/Kudane and others is substandard, it's just gone in a different direction.<br />
<br />
I also have incorporated the T.King spell icons, with one change - because I have Ring10, which regularly is overwritten by druid regen, I've changed the icon of the druid regen spell to something &quot;reddish&quot; that is actually probably more appropriate for a dot, rather than a buff.  I did that intentionally, since I wanted a solid visual cue when the druid dot had negated my Ring10 buff that I as a ranger happen to prefer.  If you find that change annoying, it is easily remedied by simply unzipping the unmodified T.King spell icons into the vma42 directory, restoring the originals.<br />
<br />
VMA version 4.2 - (Vert Mod, as maintained by Aoenla) (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2933) <br />

Also noticed when I tested it your missing an LFG button (just an observation)<br />
<br />
And I love that you are using my VERT 1.0 Compass... :)<br />

<br />
was the first thing I ever made for Vert.. when Vert 1.0 (now 1.1) was the only one out they added the compass, I made a compass I thought matched fairly well. <br />
<br />
Vertabrae went back later and made his own for 2.2... but its nice to see mine still out there.. :)<br />

<br />
Any chance you will be updating? Seems not to work since the GoD patch.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chinghis</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been wondering the same thing, Caribacey.  Haven't had time to do it, and I have a couple of (unanswered) threads where I ask this, but I wonder if you can't use the Solaria updates (UI based on the same mod (Vert) that Aoenla was based on) to update Aoenla.  Or, just use Solaria, I suppose....<br />
<br />
But, if you get a chance, give it a try, and give us a shout if it works. Seems logical, I just don't know.<br />
<br />
Edit: Well, I tried updating Aoenla with Vert and then Solaria, and neither worked. I'm sure it would, I just don't know enough or have the time to muck around. Solaria, I think it was, made my system crawl, so I've since settled on the Kaori interface. Back to pretty borders, I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I decided to give a shot at updating this UI after seeing this post by brokey (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=71134#post71134) .<br />
<br />
<br />
You can download the new version HERE (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3269) <br />
<br />
Please post here, PM, or email me any problems, requests, or comments that you have with the UI and I will work toward addressing them.</div></div><hr />

Drop these files into the VMA folder and let me know if they do it for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chinghis</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks, Mortis. This updated version works very well for me.  Funny, I think you did an earlier mod to something that I liked, too - maybe the switching of the target/self window, so the target flashed when you attacked? Think that was it, maybe not. In any case, thanks for the updated VMA.<br />
<br />
Hehe, I take it back. For some reason - perhaps because I rolled back my video driver to take care of a graphics problem? - I cannot load VMA 4.3.  Very frustrating. Makes me wonder if my dinosaur PIII-800 is about at the end of its EQ rope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not purchase OoW and cannot be sure that these will work, but if you are interested in testing them for me you can find updated files on my blog (http://mortis42.blogspot.com/).<br />
<br />
Once they have been tested, I'll be posting an official update on eqinterface and then start work on the Ocean Spray theme update.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm waiting on a Solaria update to get the buff numbers for 15-19, until then they have no number labels.</div></div><hr />

Its the only thing I am not crazy about with this version. I tried just dropping in the EQUI_Actions from Kudane's vert. It works but there is a graphic error on the side to side arrows.</div></div><hr />

I haven't touched that window.  I have basically just been patching the UI whenever it needs it.<br />
<br />
I'd be happy to try to modify another window for you to use.  Let me know the link to the file that contains the window you want, and I'll work on it.</div></div><hr />

Its the one from here. Its basically just 2/3 the height. Thanks for the fast reply  :)</div></div><hr />
