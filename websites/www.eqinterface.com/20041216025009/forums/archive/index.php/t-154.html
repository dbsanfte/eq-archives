Not the % but teh actual number.. or maybe have both..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, percentages are the only thing that VI's allowing us to see. Why? no clue. Just the facts. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">buzweaver</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I believe I saw one as well, however if VI coded it where you couldn't, who knows what the number represented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The actual mana numbers are sent to the client, and that's how it calculates your percentage, but they purposefully left out a UI label for your actual mana numbers, so there's no way to display them, other than evil |-|/\x0r programs which shall remain nameless.<br />
<br />
A long long time ago, some guys imagined that EQ would be a roleplaying game, where players wouldn't obsess about numbers and game mechanics or worry about being the most uber or how fast they could clear PoF, so they tried to FORCE it by not giving us the numbers for exp, mana, skills, and many other things.<br />
<br />
Later, there was all this discussion on having a roleplay server, since only a minority of players actually did roleplay the way VI had originally intended, and they wanted a server where everyone else had to be like them. VI said there was NO WAY TO FORCE PEOPLE TO ROLEPLAY, and that they'd never be able to make a forced RP server.<br />
<br />
Much later, they decided to go ahead and try it, so they made Sullon Zek and Firiona Vie. Didn't really work all that well.<br />
<br />
So now, there's really no excuse for them not to give us our mana and exp numbers, other than that they won't go back on their word and admit it was pointless to try to force people to RP by not giving them all the info. After all, they did finally give us our skill numbers, so why stop there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's right, they do send the numbers.<br />
<br />
They use to send HP numbers as well, but changed with Velious cause of the new 32k+ hps on the mobs. Just couldn't fit that number into there, so they shrank the packet, and put only %'s in now.<br />
<br />
Player HPs you get full, but the UI only allows us to use Percentage. :(<br />
<br />
I have yet to see any evidence of the ability to get group member's mana. Not even the %, thus why it currently isn't in game. Who knows, they might add that in soon. Hopefully.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know, I was just saying.<br />
<br />
Sadly, VI did not supply an EQType option of the Mana number, thus it's not possiable. :(</div></div><hr />

So true about the obsessiveness that seems to be dominating the game, I think this creped in early though, but certainly is more prevalent now. I debated whether or not I wanted the Numeric Percentages, but since I’m a gadget freak I couldn’t resist.</div></div><hr />
