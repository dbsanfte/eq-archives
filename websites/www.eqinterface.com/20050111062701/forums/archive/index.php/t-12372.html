<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Narshe</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now, I dont know if this category/forum/website would be the correct place to get this information... but here goes.<br />
<br />
Is there any kind of way to add a button to the bazaar window that would dump all prices of all items currently available for sale in the bazaar into a .txt file?<br />
<br />
I do not know if this is against SoE's rules and regulations, but I do not think it would be.<br />
<br />
Is it even possible though.<br />
<br />
This would help the occassional bazaar goer like myself in not getting ripped off, by getting an average price of items that I would like to purchase.<br />
<br />
i.e Paying 500 plat for an item that is worth 250 pp at the highest.<br />
<br />
If this is possible/has been done, please let me know.<br />
<br />
If it is against the SoE Rules and Regs, please let me know as well and I will drop it right here and now.<br />
<br />
I am a decent player, who does not need to break rules of a game to have fun.<br />
<br />
Please respond if you know anything about this.</div></div><hr />
