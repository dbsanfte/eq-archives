<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pini Uldar</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, not currently. A lot of the magic of containers is hard coded so that parts of the XML for containers is changed depending on how it was accessed. This is why there is one XML but really a lot more containers that can be opened.<br />
<br />
The InvSlots on the container are hard coded to be named what they are named and are setup in hard wired ways to operate properly depending on what bag you open etc. So you can't put specify currently which bag and which slot in that bag a specific InvSlot object is. <br />
<br />
It would be plausible that they add EQTypes for InvSlot objects that correspond to possible inventory slots. Like EQType 104 is Bag Slot 4 and you can put that on your hotkey box. But until they do this, you can only put general inventory slots there because they have their own EQType. The container EQTypes depend on what you clicked on to cause the window to open.<br />
<br />
I think. This is all me guessing based on what I've been able to ascertain playing around with things.<br />

Thanks Pini :)</div></div><hr />
