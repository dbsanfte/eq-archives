<br />
So I asked him to put his ini file =default, to erase the content of the uifiles/default directory so the patcher redownloads all.<br />
<br />
But even with this the game still crashes.<br />
<br />
When he puts NEWUI=FALSE, games works. And the new UI was working perfectly before last patch.<br />
<br />
Anyone has a clue ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the cliche`.....make sure desktop bit depth and EQ bit depth are both 32.</div></div><hr />

Their is a file in the everquest directory that looks something like this.. UI_charname# Where charname is name of the character and # is the name of the server. Open that file up and their should be a line somewhere that says UIdirectory or something to that effect (at school can't check) but it has to do with the skin directory so should be easy to spot, make sure that is set to default also.</div></div><hr />
