<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelric</div><div class="date">04-14-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a cool idea! Looks like just about everything all in one window. Just out of curiousity, which window did you use?<br />
<br />
I like the target HP at the top.. at first, I didn't realize it was part of the PDA. I thought about suggesting a border around it, including it in the window visually, but I do like the design concept you're using.<br />
<br />
Plus, the whole PDA idea is cool :p</div></div><hr />

It uses the Hot Button Window. <br />
<br />
I omitted a border around the target bar to save space around the PDA itself because most people will always want to see the targets hp's. The idea was to use less room not more.<br />
<br />
I'm still toying with the idea of making the hot buttons themselves smaller.<br />
<br />

To sync it just touch your forhead to the screen and osmosis will pull all your settings...<br />
<br />
The PDA batteries last forever. They use mana!<br />
<br />
The OS is strictly a hardcoded magical based ROM!<br />
<br />
The PDA speed is directly proportionate to the size of your mana pool (read it works slow as hell for tanks!) j/k</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing i think this needs is a player hp gauge on every tab and perhaps making the mana bar a sub par of the play hp gauge like pet bars often are oon everything but the main player page.  Good work by the way. <br />
Oh and personally i don't like the frilly border but that is just me...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starshelle</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ohh I *really* like this! Did you think about adding the target window on there? Maybe just under the hotkeys that way it can always be viewed no matter what tab you're on? If not that's probably what I'll do on my own when you make this file available. ~grins~ Great work!</div></div><hr />

The target guage is on top of the window. It floats on a transparent background and is always visible &quot;IF&quot; you have a target selected so as not to take up to much of the limited space when you don't have a target.<br />
<br />
Orpington2019<br />
<br />
The cast bar is actually a sub bar of the mana bar like pets are to players in the group bars. The breath bar is a sub bar to stamina. Sorry they are not labeled as yet.<br />
<br />
In order...<br />
<br />
Target hit points<br />
 <br />
Player Hit Points<br />
Player Mana/sub bar-cast bar<br />
Player Stamina/sub bar-Breath bar<br />
Player Experience<br />
Player Alt Experience<br />
Players Pet<br />
<br />
Group 1/pet 1<br />
Group 2/pet 2<br />
Group 3/pet 3<br />
Group 4/pet 4<br />
Group 5/pet 5<br />
<br />
I cant see a reason to have the player hitpoints visible from all the windows but it is easily doable should someone choose to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. the border is a direct sample from the Calael Player window. It matches T. King artowrk very well and I use his spell bar and spell books. The skin is very simple to edit I'm sure if people like there will be lots of them out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starshelle</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neat idea. :) I was thinking the target window was its own sperate window. I hadn't realized it was transparent. Obviously I skimmed over the other posts or I would have seen Kelric's explain that. Sorry about that ~grins~ Again, really nifty idea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teannas</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well when do we get to see it for a download hehe<br />
<br />
<br />
awesome work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still making the code look pretty. Eliminating files I dont need, that kind of thing.<br />
<br />
Plus how does one make it available for download.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teannas</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if at all possible send me a PM with the code or an email.<br />
<br />
Only thing I am thinking about doing in making the buttons on the bottom be on the left side of the PDA and shrink them down so the bottom of the group window and the buttons are on the same lvl on the left side.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton and look forward to check it out</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy! Go to the Downloads (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?s=) area, choose the Category you want to upload it to (like Hotkeys (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?op=showfiles&amp;catid=18&amp;sortby=date&amp;sortorder=DESC) or Player Info (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?op=showfiles&amp;catid=20&amp;sortby=date&amp;sortorder=DESC) or Target Window (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?op=showfiles&amp;catid=24&amp;sortby=date&amp;sortorder=DESC) or wherever you think it best fits), and click the &quot;Upload&quot; button. You'll want a screenshot and description ready to go, and just follow the instructions!</div></div><hr />
