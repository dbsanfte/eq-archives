I have a peculiar problem with your ui.<br />
<br />
let's say i have the following people in my group: <br />
<br />
me<br />
player1<br />
player2<br />
player3<br />
player4<br />
player5<br />
<br />
if i want to use my mouse to select player5, for instance, it will actually select player4.  it does that for all of the players, actually selecting the one above it.  if my mouse is on top of player5, the info bar that comes up will say &quot;Player4  &lt;100%&gt;&quot; for example.  if i want to select player1, i can't.  i can use the F1-F6 keys though.  <br />
<br />
just wondered if it was just me, or if there was something i could do to fix it.<br />
<br />
other than that, great ui.  i'm very picky about my ui, but yours seems to work very well for me.<br />
<br />
thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the UI.  It is very compact and has tons of useful info on it.  I am still having the problem that was mentioned before about the targetting in the group window.<br />

This is with the Emil3ldon download.  The mod info listed this as working but I still have this problem.  I usually use my hot keys now but if my mouse happens to be moving and I have to select a group member fast for a heal...well let's just say they are understanding after the rez but I don't like making a habit of it. ;)<br />
<br />
Thank you again for taking the time to post your UI mod.</div></div><hr />
