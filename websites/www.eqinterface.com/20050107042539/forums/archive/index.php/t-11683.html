<br />
1. do not EVER copy all the files from Default to a custom folder..<br />
<br />
2. re-download VERT 2.6e, put it in a folder BY ITSELF.. download the patch(s) for it.. (posted to DL section this morning) Apply both the melee patch and the previous patch... <br />
<br />
3. Reload in game.. if you get an error.. post your error log.<br />
<br />
Following those steps should prevent your crashing, if not we can trouble shoot it.. <br />
<br />
Both Vert 2.6e and Solaria worked just fine on test server last night. Sooo we will need to see an error log before we could tell you if something is actually coded wrong.</div></div><hr />

DO NOT COPY THE DEFAULT FOLDER!!!<br />
<br />
PLEASE start over and ONLY PUT THE VERT FILES IN THE FOLDER <br />
<br />
I can not help you if you can not follow the basic instructions... this has been stated in our FAQ's, also in about 10,000 post, and again by me in this one as STEP ONE... <br />
<br />
I appreciate the speed at which you trying to get this fixed.. but please do it the right way so we can get you setup.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQKobara</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kudane,  I followed your instructions and I can see the combat ability window with the hotbutton slots fine, I can click on the *S* to bring up my new skills window, but the Ability window appears to be too small for the disc names to fit in the slots they are assigned, so they are cut off and jumbled. <br />
<br />
Playing my warrior, I have some long-named discs that are not displaying properly in such a tight space... any way to increase the size or is the problem a deeper one, ?<br />
<br />
My UIError file is 57 mb long just from a 10 minute session, and a Texture.txt file is 38 mb long that also has UIFILE error entries incorporated. Needless to say, posting those error files here would be ludicrous... will set aside this UI until a fix is posted..<br />
<br />
Nice UI btw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will see if I can figure out what the loops is, BUT I believe this error is an overall error, since for Solaria and Vert only ONE window was modified (see patch)</div></div><hr />

<br />
it was in the Animations file. he has fixed it and you can download a *new* 12/18 patch (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2887) that includes this file and it will fix your problem.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
<br />
It stems back to when they added the numbered buttons in Sept. Vert never used them, so we never update the animation file to load the graphics. Our hotbutton window doesnt ask for them (the default does now) so it didnt kick out an error till now, since the Combat Skill window DOES call these graphics.<br />
<br />
thank you for working with us to find the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
peace,<br />
Aielman  <br />
<br />
perfectly normal warnings... in fact if they were NOT there, we would be worried. its just letting you know what its loading from the default directory.. as it should..<br />
<br />
soooo you dont want to EVER, EVER, ever, EVER, EVER copy the default folder into a custom UI just to get rid of these messages.. because if they patch something we dont touch it could cause a serious error.</div></div><hr />
