I know they had Vert, Sars and I think Kaori as well as a couple others.  I am trying to help a friend with an old UI from there.  It may be one that hasn't been updated with all the patches but I thought if I could just remember who the author was, I might be able to search for some things on the forums.  I was a fairly simple ui without any of the fancy borders and it had gradient gauges.  The background was black/grey with horizontal stripes.<br />
<br />
If anyone can recall who else's ui's were there I'd appreciate it, if not then maybe I can just tinker with some of the newer ones to make it look similar.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Merry Christmas!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would suggest you tell your friend just to come look at what we have in complete sets, it would take you hours and hours of work to repatch back to feb.  and the UIbuilder files were not compatible with most peoples full UIs sooo just grabbing the patches could cause crashes.<br />
<br />
good luck!<br />

<br />
He has checked out this site already, hasn't quite found what he's looking for.  <br />
<br />
I might just tinker with it and see what I can do.  My UI is a minamalist/clean UI.  I think if I start out with my window pieces and snag a few mods from here and there I might be able to come up with something similar for him.  I think main thing he is wanting is to have some of the LDON stuff, such as the leader board.  I think that might just require editing the main xml to include pulling those files from the default folder.  <br />
<br />
Either way, I enjoy the challenge and I'll get him hooked up somehow!  Thanks for the comments.<br />
<br />
Merry Christmas!!</div></div><hr />
