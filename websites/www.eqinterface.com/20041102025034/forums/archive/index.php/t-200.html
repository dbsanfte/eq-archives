<br />
Used a similar target/group/personal window as XXXX.  Removed the last name of the personal window.  Made the breath and casting windows small, but still visible for those casting items.<br />
<br />
Player window shows HP (gauge, %, and current/max)<br />
                                   XP (gauge, %)<br />
                                   AAXP (gauge, %)<br />
                                   AC and ATK<br />
<br />
Group window shows HP (bar and %)<br />
                                   pet HP (bar and %)<br />
<br />
Target window shows HP (bar and %)<br />
<br />
Buff window is nothing special... just a nice resize to 3x5<br />
<br />
Pet window was stripped, and useful stuff put in the place.  (stats, resists, weight for monks, etc etc)<br />
<br />
Invintory window is from XXXX - looks like the old one. <br />

<br />
&quot;in the works&quot; <br />
<br />
Going to change inspect window so it looks like the old one.  <br />
<br />
Looking for suggestions on what to add.... Anyone? <br />
<br />
*****EDIT - EDIT - EDIT - EDIT - EDIT - EDIT - EDIT - EDIT*****<br />
<br />
Updated the player window to add stamina.  (It is actually yellow, this is before I played with colors).  When you cast a spell, those 2 bubbles are overwritten with the spell-cast-time bubbles.  <br />
<br />
I would have put the breath window there, but for some reason it is always active... so that is the same as before.  <br />
<br />
On to my next task... the quickswap window.  Nobody out there uses the &quot;friends&quot; window, do they?  :)<br />
<br />
http://equi.web1000.com/ui4.jpg<br />
<br />
*****EDIT - EDIT - EDIT - EDIT - EDIT - EDIT - EDIT - EDIT*****<br />
<br />
The friends window bit the big one this update...  It's now a hotswap box.  I went this way, as opposed to sticking them in like the hotbox window because I think the vast majority of folks will probably not need to swap stuff like this...<br />
<br />
On top is pri and sec weapon<br />
<br />
Directly below that is invintory slot 7.  <br />
<br />
[1][5]<br />
[2][6]<br />
[3][7]<br />
[4][8]<br />
<br />
Below that is the breastplate (for heals) and invintory slot 8 (for jboots)<br />
<br />
to open this window, use the window selector and choose the old &quot;friends&quot; icon... or hit ctrl-f.  (fast-swap?  :)  )<br />
<br />

While im using it there are a few buggs. For one buffs don't always show up when I turned the buff bar sideways and put it at the top of my screen. And the playername123456 thing shows up. Might want to see what ya can do about that. Great job man</div></div><hr />

I still wanted to keep some semblance of a name on there, but didn't want to lose the row of info due to the last name. <br />
<br />
The only solution I found was to use the eqtype 1 field (first name only, from invintory) in its place.  Due to the 1-eqtype bug thingy, the invintory window name wont show up.<br />
<br />
Dunno about the buff thingy though</div></div><hr />

One change tho...How hard would it be to put the stamina bar in place of regular exp? At 60 I don't care about regular exp all that much, but I DO care about stamina for those times I need to jump during pulls...<br />
<br />
I would prefer a carbon copy of the old inventory, but this one I like the most out of all the rest I've seen...<br />
<br />
Very nice UI, if it wasn't for the stamina bar thing I'd use it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway... to change the XP to sta....  Edit the playerwindow.xml file.  Look for<br />
<br />
<br />
               &lt;Gauge item = &quot;Player_ExpGauge&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;PlayerExp&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />

		&lt;LinesFillTint&gt;<br />
				&lt;R&gt;0&lt;/R&gt;<br />
				&lt;G&gt;80&lt;/G&gt;<br />
				&lt;B&gt;220&lt;/B&gt;<br />
		&lt;/LinesFillTint&gt;<br />
		&lt;DrawLinesFill&gt;true&lt;/DrawLinesFill&gt;<br />
		&lt;EQType&gt;4&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
		&lt;GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
			&lt;Background&gt;A_GaugeBackground&lt;/Background&gt;<br />
			&lt;Fill&gt;A_GaugeFill&lt;/Fill&gt;<br />

			&lt;EndCapRight&gt;A_GaugeEndCapRight&lt;/EndCapRight&gt;<br />
		&lt;/GaugeDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Gauge&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Simply change the bolded part to <br />
<br />
&lt;EQType&gt;3&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
<br />
then, play with the colors.  <br />
<br />
I will update this later - will probably put a mini-stamina bar in just under the health, a full size one below the AAXP, or just the fatigue % on the AC/ATK line.   What do you folks suggest?<br />
<br />
And... as for the primal switch.  Good idea, never really thought about that much, as I will not see primal for some time I'm sure. :) <br />
<br />
What slots would you look for?  pri/sec and an invintory?</div></div><hr />

As soon as I have time I plan on loading up this UI. You probably don't need Stamina for non-monks. When playing my Rogue or Warrior I never worry about it. But when pulling places like HoT and jumping out of the pit there is nothing worse then being too fatigued, cuz that usually means death without a quick FD...</div></div><hr />

Is there any way I could add my wis to the stat window?  Perhaps replacing one of the other stats like dex or agility.  Im a Paladin and wis is important to me so I was wondering if you could post on here what I need to do to show that information.  Other than that the UI is awesome and I cant wait to see what you do next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akshue</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course it's possible... but you would also want a manabar, no?   :)<br />
<br />
That's why this is for pure melee... if I get around to it, I'll make one for pure casters, and one for hybrids.<br />
<br />
Also... updated the friends box, as seen in the first post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HeroFromHyrule</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I would want a mana bar, forgot about that.  Guess I will have to wait a bit to use it.  Please update it for Hybrids and add a mana bar and the wis stat, then it will be perfect.  That new hotswap box will be great for my Bard!  Being able to switch to instruments and back to weapons like that will help out a lot.  If you get around to editing this for melees and you post it on here do you think you could send me a message so I know when its updated (just in case you update it and I dont check it right then, cause I want this sucker as soon as I can get my hands on it)?  Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />

Is it possible to change your swap box. I like to switch out my range item from a stat increaser to a shuriken for pulling.  Is it possible to add that to the hotswap box?  Also is it possible to make the items in the swap box come from a container?<br />

Only problem is I understand that the new patch changed some files, including EQUI_Animations.xml.  There's post on EQdiva (eqdiva.com) as to what was changed.  So will your player window still work or will we need to make some change to your EQUI_Animations.xml to get it to work? (I can't test right now... at work)<br />

Ok I will mess with the xml sometime later ... and I doubted you could have container slots as hotswappable but thought I ask :).<br />

Things ya might think of...<br />

I grabbed the buff mod that lets you see the words and slot numbers.  I dont want to learn the new icons (they are sissycons if I ever seen anything sissy). I put it into my folder with your stuff and it works fine. Only thing is its kinda large...o well...dont feel like resizing the whole damn thing.<br />

I am thinking of putting in the horizontal hotbutton mod because its to large and cumbersome the way it is now...<br />

Geddine's Buff Window: Untested <br />
Updated: 8-03-02<br />
Author: Geddine of Morell-Thule<br />
This window is slightly larger than the normal buff window but is a combination of the buffs icon and text, with a background to show beneficial and detrimental effects.&lt;p&gt; Current problems are when a spell wears off &quot;Unknown Spell&quot; text appears in its place  (please /bug to get this fixed). Also holding ALT over the buff window still shows the tooltips meaning the text will appear to double up, but then why would you need to hold Alt over your buff window anyway, the name is right there. I should also mention that the line that highlights your icons in your spellbook will appear funny, this is because of the graphic used as the backing for the effects. A major thank you the Allessandra as we compiled this mod together, and it is his graphic design. <br />
Update: Works with the 31st july patch. Buff window with icons on the left and the text to the right, with a colored graphic behind the text to show buff or debuff. Update was also made slightly thinner to take up less screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there anyway that I could integrate these 2 mods into yours? It would be perfect for me then.</div></div><hr />
