Two days is not a very long time to wait.  Try to give people a bit more time, or send the original coder a PM, before coming back and assuming that no one wants to help and bumping the thread.  Sometimes when I have had a crappy day I purposefully ignore excessevely bumped threads.  I spend enough time reading the posts to not have to deal with useless ones.<br />

I was waiting for Kuv to have a look at this before trying to make the changes but you can try this one.  I have not tested it in game, just added the appropiate code.  Well, what I think is, based on the rest of the mod.  8)</div></div><hr />
