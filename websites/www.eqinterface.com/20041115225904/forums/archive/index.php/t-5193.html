<br />
I was looking for Wrought Iron pics to use for boarders and came across this image of an Antique Faerie Brooch.  I instantly thought of someone who would want a pixie spellcasting bar and put this together.  Modified liberally from the tk_celtic_castbar. <br />
<br />
I use 1280 x 1024, however this bar may still be acceptable on a 1024 x 768.<br />
If you want this for smaller resolution, I will shrink it up for you, just let me know.<br />
<br />
Stands alone.  Simply drop the files into your mod folder and load up EQ.<br />
<br />
Click body to open spell book.<br />
Cast Time is top portion of wings and will not interfere with other casting bars.<br />
<br />
Gems are:<br />
  1<br />
  2<br />
    3      4<br />
  5  6  7  8<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy  :)<br />

 but i found a bug. The cast swipe only comes across the top of the pixie. The dark cast shadow is only the top half of the pic.<br />
Drives me nuts whin i cast. Can this be fixed  or make the shadow clear??:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had actully designed the cast swipe only across the top, but it can easily be modded to do the entire pixie.  I had at one time thought I would try to do the cast across only the gold filigree and leave everything else alone, maybe I'll try mocking up one of each that you can choose which you want.<br />
<br />
I was never satisfied with the quality of the graphic and have since learned some 'finishing' techniques so the next version should be a bit cleaner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kasca</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool..i just lov it. Looks so nice in my ui. Ill be watchin for it:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sc2kmayor</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...I'm at work, no way to test this cuz of the fire wall.  Really think that Sony needs to give us a 'Sampler' Zone that allows you to start EQ, not connect to the game, access one Caster/Melee sprite (hahaha) that can't even move, just so we can do testing OFFLINE...what a concept.<br />
<br />
Allow it to cast a spell that targets the one mobs in the sampler zone and all that jazzz.......oh what a rant. /rant off.<br />
<br />
Here is the Full Body Cast version of the pixie.  Cleaned up the graphics a bit so you wont see those annoying white pixels on the edge of her wings.  Test this out and let me know if it works and I will post it as rev 2 replacing the orginal.<br />
<br />
Enjoy. :)</div></div><hr />
