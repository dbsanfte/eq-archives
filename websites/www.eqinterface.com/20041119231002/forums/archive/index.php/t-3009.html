<br />
<br />
first thing I want to say what a great mod you have created. Kudo's!!<br />
<br />
After installing the new patch for ChronRight I noticed I can't move my chat boxes. Are the chat boxes supposed to be stationary? Just thought I'd ask, everything else is working great so far.<br />
<br />
Just to let you know this is a side effect of the chat window with no titlebar.  Here is the ways around the issue of not being able to move the chat window by dragging it around the screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
No this is the way it has always been with a Title-less chat window.  With out the titlebar there is no where on the chat window to grab to move it around.  There are two things that you can do to get around this.  1 is to go into the chat window xml<br />
<br />
&quot;EQUI_ChatWindow.xml&quot; and modify the line in there that turns off the titlebar.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;false&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;&quot; and change it to true.<br />
<br />
Then go into Everquest and move the window around.  Then go back into the xml and turn it back off again.<br />
<br />
the 2nd way to do it which is actually faster is to go into Everquest and move the window around by resizing it around on the screen.  Meaning that you drag the top of the chat window up to where you want the top to be. you drag the side around to where you want them to be and so on.  This way you move all the sides of the chat window to where you want them to be and there you have it,  A chat window right where you wanted it to be and you don't have to keep going into the xml file to change things.<br />
<br />
If this does not help you please let me know and I will attempt to help if I can.</div></div><hr />

For some reasin I wasnt able to resize the one that was in your zip. I unlocked but I  still was't able to change it. Replacing it with the original solved the problem. (I was too lazy to look at the XML file to see if Resize was set to true)</div></div><hr />
