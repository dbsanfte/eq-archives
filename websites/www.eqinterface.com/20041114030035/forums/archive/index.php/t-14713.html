You can make a vertical gauge with EQ's ui.  Not sure how I came up with but it just popped up in my head how to do it.  During the walk I was able to refine it a few times.<br />
<br />
It's not pretty to look at the xml code for it and is a hassle to write and to modify afterwards, but it does work.  Just going to post the files I made as a test.  This is pretty ugly looking casting gauge cause it was just hacked together so I could prove to myself it worked.<br />
<br />
If you want to see it in action just throw it into it's own ui file and load it up and cast a spell.  Most might see how it's done by looking at the files and seeing it's different pieces but for those that don't I will get around to writing the details of how it works when I figure out how to say it and make it make sense.<br />
<br />
Also I think this topic/note needs to be changed - Things the new UI can't do. (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?t=2267)<br />
<br />
Also with similar techniques you can make a circular compass.  I'm going to try and make a basic one soon to show you all and lay groundwork for those more industrious then me to make better ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  But, it is a good idea, and your style seems to cause less lagg.  So maybe there is hope  :nana:  and one day the vertical gauges can be used without alot of stress.<br />

ohh the circular compass...  hehe good luck  :D</div></div><hr />
