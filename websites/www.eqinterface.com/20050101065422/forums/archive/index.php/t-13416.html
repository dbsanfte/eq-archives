<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jentraal</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) You can't delete SONY storyline files.  (well you can, but the patcher puts them back anyway)<br />
<br />
2) There is a limit to the number of stories you can have.  Also, each one you use adds more resources to the game, so consider that when using stories, especially if you're on a PC that's not top-of-the-line.  I have sent this issue in as a /bug but Sony doesn't seem to care at this point.<br />
<br />
3) If the files you are using are not named story____.txt they will not show up in EQ.  They also have to be in the \Everquest\storyline directory.<br />
<br />
4) The Story window displays the newest created stories at the top.  It's sorted by creation date (descending).  This is an annoying &quot;feature&quot; and has made me resort to making the first line of all my user-created stories have an _ character in them so they will be easier to spot in the list.<br />
<br />
... I hope some of this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nerakas</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, I think my comp can handle just about as many stories as I put up there (80g hd, gforce fx 5200 128mg vid, p4 2.53g processor and so forth) and now all the stories are in the correct directory, and all are story&lt;xxxx&gt;.txt yet still, no show :(  If I could figure out why origionally Foof's worked but storylevels.txt didnt, I could probably figure out the others, but I'm clueless.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help though :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nerakas</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, thank you both Kernan and Jentraal for all of your help. <br />
<br />
Now, I have Foofy's working along with StoryLevels, but the Epics, Research, and Faction arent working...for epics, in my folder (this is going to be long post) the structur is <br />
<br />
EverQuest\Storyline*\Epic**<br />
<br />
(note * has the main StoryEpic.txt file and ** has the .txt files with the classes, ie: StoryBard.txt)<br />
<br />
Research- <br />
<br />
EverQuest\Storyline*\Research**<br />
<br />
(note same as above..* signifies StoryResearch.txt location and ** signifies the StoryNecromancer (and classes) .txt files)<br />
<br />
Faction <br />
<br />
EverQuest\Storyline*\Faction**\a-z<br />
<br />
(note this one is different because of the multipul factions. StoryFaction.txt is in EverQuest\Storyline\ and then when opening folder named &quot;Faction&quot; there are .txt files labled a-z, now, you have subfolders labeled a-z so it looks like this path<br />
<br />
EverQuest\Storyline\Faction\A <br />
EverQuest\Storyline\Faction\B <br />
<br />
And so on. Within those subfolders are names of faction types ((ie. banker, brownies, bloodgills, etc etc)) which to me would seem correct)<br />
<br />
Those are the other 3 storylines I have that I downloaded from eqinterface.com that are not showing up on my Story Window in game. Hope this helps guys.<br />
