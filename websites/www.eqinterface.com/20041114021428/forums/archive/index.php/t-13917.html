<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jethal</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Night Elf has been re-worked alittle and I've been able to solve a few issues that have had people emailing me for 2 years..<br />
<br />
First off.. the Target Window can now be moved by itself and you dont have to rely on the character ini file to position the windows.  Simply make sure it's not Locked.. then click and drag the window to the Right of the leaves.. I had to leave an empty space (10 pixles or so) to allow you to grab the window.<br />
<br />

<br />
Spelling errors have been corrected<br />
<br />
The w3 Spell bar now has a 1 minute rotating timer.. 8 buttons light up around the center sundial.. the sundial itself changes from daylight to nighttime.. though I wish i could there was a way to syncronize that with norrathian time.<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
Now to answer some of the more common requests..<br />
<br />
No, I'm sorry, I do not have time to customize this UI Skin to your preferances.. the resolution is 1280 x 1024 because that is the res. i play at..  the change the resolution would require the resizing of alot of graphicc.<br />
<br />
I know that w3 had UI's for Human, NightElf, Undead &amp; Ogre.. I've looked into making the various versions as an optional graphic change.. but they're just different enough to make a smooth transition difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&gt;&gt;EDIT&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Ignore what I wrote - by closer inspection, I saw that you dont have the energy to remake the UI in another es :(</div></div><hr />

I do have one question, if you don't mind.  I have a Grandmaster's Satchel from gm'ing jewelcraft, and for some reason with this UI, it looks like a Reinforced Satchel of Abu-kar (with the pretty green buttons and all).<br />
<br />
As silly as it may sound, I love the &quot;look&quot; of this satchel and am very pleased with the new look my Grandmaster's Satchel is now sporting with this UI.  Is this something you put into the UI itself to cause this to happen?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the UI ! I love it !</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
very nice skin otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jethal</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it explains in the instructions.. you have to resize the window into place.. the UI was designed without the Titlebar's in mind.. so you can not simplly drag them around.</div></div><hr />

I wondered though, is there an easy way to make dots and other detrimental spell effects show as red in the spell effects box? I have a very hard time seeing if I'm dotted or not as mine shows them as white like the rest of my buffs. Has anyone else mentioned or noticed this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jethal</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be the &quot;CS_Buttons.bmp&quot; file.. I made it transparent to fit myown personal preferances.. if you want go back to the  &quot;Red for Detrimental&quot; &amp; &quot;Blue for Benificial&quot;.. remove the file from the Nightelf-2004 directory and it'll read the default.</div></div><hr />

I then rename the UI ini file for my server and name UI_NAME_SERVER<br />
I then start the patcher login and when my character pops into the world my windows are still everywhere and theres not even a black bar at the bottom of the screen like with your previous UIs. Any fixes?</div></div><hr />

I have a lot to keep track of and 1280 x 1024 is a lil crowded. Also. I'd like to see The Target moved over and put in targets target like this  [ a decaying skeleton 23% ]  [ Main Tank 99% ]<br />
Just some Ideas...</div></div><hr />

Not in the near future.. my vid.card/monitor will not support that resolution.. man, i wish they could.  so, designing it would be extremely difficult<br />
<br />
I dont know if anyone else is having this problem but, ill put all the files into my nightelf 2004 folder. I then rename the UI ini file for my server and name UI_NAME_SERVER  &lt;clip&gt; <br />
Are you moving the renamed file back out to the primary EQ directory?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twen</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes i am. also something i noticed about the char_server file, the one in the zip is like 10kb while the one in previous version is around 90kb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jethal</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes i am. also something i noticed about the char_server file, the one in the zip is like 10kb while the one in previous version is around 90kb.<br />
<br />
Only other thing I can think of.. are you running 1280x1024 resolution?<br />
the UI_Name_server.ini file supplied in the zip ONLY contains info relating to the 1280x1024 resolution.. so if you're in another res, there is no info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twen</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using the right resolution. tho with new patch this UI prolly needs updated again so it doesnt matter now hehe</div></div><hr />
