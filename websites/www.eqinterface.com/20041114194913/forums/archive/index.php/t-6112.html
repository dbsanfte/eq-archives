Ghesta's Edition<br />
<br />
Original Drakah version Created: December 8, 2002<br />
Ghesta's Edition Updated: January 30, 2003<br />
<br />
*Resolution: 1280 x 1024 ONLY*<br />
<br />
I loved the Drakah's UI, but like my windows on top, so with his <br />
permission and some help from Chronwaas of the Saryrn server I <br />
made this modification.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.<br />

BTW, i forgot to mention that this ui uses Raxthorne's WC3 spell gems.... sorry.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghesta</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, at the risk of sounding mean, i probably won't be doing a lower rez version of this ui for two reasons.<br />
<br />
first and foremost... im just too damn lazy... I mean, the UI is basically Drakah's UI in the first place, just changed up a bit so it sits up top, and even then i needed help from Chronwaas.<br />
<br />
Secondly... As it is, it takes up a good 1/4th of the screen, I would be afraid of how much of the screen the UI would take up if it ran in any lower of a resolution.  Now... as for maybe making a higher resolution.... hmmmm..... theres something to think about.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />

<br />
The ui is up to date with the 6-11-03 patch which included the shared bank spaces.</div></div><hr />

I will be attempting to fix it, but it may take me a little while. Please be patient.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted a top-of-screen UI called Mintop, which is intended for 1024x768.  It doesn't keep the inventory, stats and such up all the time, but takes up less than a quarter of the screen.  Plus it's meant to be used without a viewport so it hardly blocks the view at all.  My UI wasn't affected by the 8/26 patch... it still works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I loved your EQ UI from your old page and I was wondering if you'll do an updated OPTIONS Control bar for it. I've got the old one to work (see attached pics), but I'm using the Ctrl+&lt;letter&gt; to access the the other (newer) updates to the EQ UI done by SOE.<br />
I LOVE the clean look I've developed using your interface and not the (Cluttered look) U and the others seem to like. I prefer to use as much of the screen as I possibly can.<br />
<br />
Look at the pics I've attached and see if you can assist me in doing an updated UI for the:<br />
<br />
1. OPTIONS BAR (Needs to be updated since 5 Nov 2003 update)<br />
2. INVENTORY     (Note that the CHARM block is missing)<br />
<br />
Like I was saying LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, your UI's.<br />
<br />
Thank you for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghesta</div><div class="date">11-25-2003, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It pains me to say that quite honestly I don't have the time anymore to work on my UIs that I did over the summer.  Between work, school, having sort of a life, and actually getting to PLAY eq, I just don't have a ton of time to work on the UIs anymore.<br />
<br />
Im hoping that over christmas break when im off between semesters I will get a chance to play around and fix my UI.  The added advantage to this time line is that by then the new Melee changes will be live so thats one thing I won't have to refix. (hopefully)  If I do get a chance to tweak it, there are a few things I have in mind, notibly the new endurance meter, a smaller hotkey/quickitem box, locked positions for the fact that there are now 4 item windows, and most importantly (in my mind, hehe) a change from Raxthorne's spell icons to my WC3 spell icon set.<br />
(see that thread here  -  http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=50030#post50030   )<br />
<br />
<br />
Again Id like to point out that my UI is basically a modification of Drakah's ui.  I don't deserve much credit, I just tweaked his hard work (with his permission of course) if you like my ui but its not working for you, you should check out his stuff.  Its pretty awesome.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback and who knows maybe Ill get some free time in december.</div></div><hr />
