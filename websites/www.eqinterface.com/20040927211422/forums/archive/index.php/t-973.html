But it also needs to have the alpha channel. If anyone could help me it would be great i have tried for hours in various formats and cant seem to get it to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But from what I gathered when it didn't work is this: it's not technically possible.  But you could make some tiny, virtually unoticeable adjustments - put a 1x1 pixel dot somewhere on the image - or a 1 pixel wide border.  This would create the RBG channels needed, also allowing you to have an alpha channel.  The 1 pixel can be considered the &quot;image&quot; that Photoshop wants to see, and everything else should work just fine.  Just choose a color that would blend well with whatever you're trying to do - or that at least won't stand out.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps... and if you do figure it out, please let me know - that's good info to have!  :)<br />

The only way I can think of being able to do that is to change the transparency levels in game.</div></div><hr />
