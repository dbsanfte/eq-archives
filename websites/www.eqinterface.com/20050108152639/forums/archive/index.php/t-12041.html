<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQKobara</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with these skill windows not appearing is caused by the UI_Charname_Servername file somehow getting reset to read the following in the [Skillswindow] section:<br />
<br />
[SkillsWindow]<br />
XPos1280x1024=0<br />
YPos1280x1024=0<br />
Width1280x1024=0<br />
Height1280x1024=0<br />
<br />
This results in the window not appearing, although the button is calling it up. A fix can be made manually by opening the UI file for the affected character and using FIND to locate the [skillswindow]section and changing the entries to something more usable, like below:<br />
<br />
[SkillsWindow]<br />
XPos1280x1024=292<br />
YPos1280x1024=504<br />
Width1280x1024=300<br />
Height1280x1024=240<br />
<br />
(The above entries work for me on my monk using a custom UI in 1280x1024 resolution- first 2 entries for positioning window on screen, last 2 to actually size the window)<br />
<br />
Experimentation with the numbers in each entry may be needed depending on UI used and resolution used.<br />
<br />
Alternately, players have reported success by simply deleting the file and recreating the file by starting freah by using the loadskin command in-game to reload their custom UI from the default version.</div></div><hr />
