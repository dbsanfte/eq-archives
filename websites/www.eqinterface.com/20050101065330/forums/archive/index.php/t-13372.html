They need to know the mods your using and they will need your UI errors text. So let them have this info, then the gurus here can help more.But I get the same on my mods and everything is working also. So for me I'll wait till i find some thing broken befor i ask for repair.</div></div><hr />

Did you get the three patches for it?<br />

Post your UIError.txt log file, please.</div></div><hr />
