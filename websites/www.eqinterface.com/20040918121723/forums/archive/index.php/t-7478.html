<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">03-10-2003, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...of ripping off everyone else and using it for my own UI, I present to you Tril's Mix -n- Match v.2 =P<br />
<br />
Note that NONE OF THIS IS MINE! The only thing I did was place everything the way it looks, and edit the player window to take out the duplicate AC tag.<br />
<br />
Without going into details... it is a lot of stuff in it. This screenshot gives you a basic idea of what you'll be seeing most of the time. Everything's set to 40-60% transparency, depending upon the window, and allows for full viewing room.<br />
<br />
It won't win any beauty contests, but that's the point. Nothing personal to t.king, but I'm not terribly into the large, detailed and gawdy interfaces. Don't get me wrong, I think his art is incredible, but it's just not my bag when I'm playing EQ, so I tried to keep it as simple as possible =)<br />
<br />
So, yeah, if anyone's interested in seeing more of this, I'll post it, as well as the features and the real credits =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
There isn't usually much action in this section unless someone is teasing us with something strikingly new/different that they are working on.  =)<br />
<br />
Post it up with details and a download link in the Beta section and you may get more feedback.</div></div><hr />
