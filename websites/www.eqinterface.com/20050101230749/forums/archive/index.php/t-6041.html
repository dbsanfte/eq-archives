<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TchnOwl</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently running Windows XP and using the zeremus mod, zw4.  I have applied the cut and paste correction supplied by Cairenn to correct the error I am seeing.  The error in question is the &quot;your files are not compatible with the current UI&quot; in bold red text every time I zone or log in.<br />
My problem is that even after doing the recommended cut and paste fix, I am still having the problem.<br />
<br />
I have added no additional code (cause I know none) and have added no additional mods.  If anyone could provide further assistance, I'd be much appreciative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Post your UIError.txt log file again.  That's how we can figure out what's acting up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hope this helps get to the root of the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, to start from the top, you have 2 choices.  You can either delete the following files from your custom folder, or you can go in and make the changes necessary to bring it up to date.<br />
<br />
Problem 1 is with your PetInfoWindow.  Info to fix it is in the 9 Jan 03 Patch in the Patch Fixes forum.  Link (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5314)<br />
<br />
Problem 2 is with your OptionsGeneralPage.  I find it hard to believe that you actually have this modified.  Nonetheless, if it is actually a modified window, the fix is in the 15 Jan 03 Patch. Link (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5619).<br />
<br />
Problem 3 is with your LootWindow.  It was part of the 9 Jan 03 patch, same as problem 1.<br />
<br />
Problem 4 is with your SelectorWindow.  Same patch, 9 Jan 03.<br />
<br />
Problem 5 is with your BugReportWindow.  Patches 9 Jan 03, 15 Jan 03 and the doozy 4 Dec 02 (found in the Archive Sub-forum of the Patch Fixes Forum, link (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4548)).<br />
<br />
Problem 6 is part of Today's mess.  Download the attached file and unzip it into your DEFAULT folder.</div></div><hr />

http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5932<br />
<br />
It's in the 2nd to last post  in the thread..  (currently)<br />
Follow the directions in the post that contains the gena_xml.zip..<br />
<br />
It will make it a lot more patch friendly :)</div></div><hr />
