<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alteri</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently down loaded one of the featured UI's, and am really enjoying it, except for a previos problem that wasn't related to it.  (The skills window wasn't displaying).  I had a GM lead me through the process to correct it, but somehow I introduced a NEW problem!  The Window Selector now show as blue on blue!  The icons ON the buttons are blue, instead of white like they should be, and the problem persists into the default interface too!<br />
<br />
Help?<br />
<br />
(sadly, I'm not sure of the exact UI I used, but in discription, it was a choice between the wood, marble and stone, in blue, green and purple?  I took the blue marble)<br />

<br />
You'll have alot of those, one for each character you use, any special settings, bazaar prices, ect ect ect. You want to do this for each crit you have. Delete that file, then run the patcher. It'll automatically replace everything, and load your UI back to default.<br />
<br />
It'll at least fix that problem, then you can try to re-load the UI and see what happens.</div></div><hr />

I actually was able to figure out what (and I have only myself to blame) had gone wrong and correct it.  Had THAT failed, I would have done as you suggested and counted myself lucky that all I needed to do was reload my UI of choice.  Thanks for the help!<br />
