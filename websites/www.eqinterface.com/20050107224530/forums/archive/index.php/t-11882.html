<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">supafly</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, over the past week or so I've been fiddling around with the default xml files, rearranging things and learning how to work with the code.  My goal is to design a new UI, primarily for my own personal use.  At any rate, I felt comfortable enough with the code now to go ahead and whip up text texture file (http://home1.gte.net/res051x0/stone_buttons.tga) and try it out to see if I had the hang of things.  I changed the first hotbutton animations in my EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml (http://home1.gte.net/res051x0/EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml) file.  The UI will load fine (read: without crashing EQ), but the first hotbutton that should be using the custom image/animations isn't there.  I see the text label for the hotkey (in my case, a social hotkey), but no image.  Just text in transparent space.  I checked the UIErrors.txt (http://home1.gte.net/res051x0/UIErrors.txt) file, but I didn't see a smoking gun in that log.  But then I'm new to this.  <br />
<br />
SO, now I have a few questions.  What would be causing my new image not to appear in place of the default image for the button?  The image I'm using for the button is 33x40 pixels, while all the other buttons that I've left unchanged are 40x40.. would that be the cause?  Also, with the animations, instead of having single frame animations, I have multiple frames.  For instance, I broke the Flyby animation into 5 frames, each with a duration of 200, to make a grand total of a 1 second duration to cycle through all the frames.  Are hotbuttons only allowed single frame animations?  I'm at my wit's end here, really.  I am truly stumped as to why it's not working.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I normally prepare my tga files in photoshop, and save them as they are but with reso of 32bit/pixel (an option you get when you save files as tga in photoshop)<br />
<br />
i removed the black bacground you have in your picture, and did save as, and chose 32bit/pixel and it working great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarsippius</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a quick peak of your file and based on numerous other people I have helped from my site that had similar problems I am going to suggest a couple things to try first before I get into deeper aspects of coding issues.  It may or may not be allowable to code a multi-frame animation on a button as I have never tried personally, but i am gonna go with intuition as a first shot.<br />
<br />
First of all, i don't understand why, but everytime I made one of my TGA files exceed 256 pixels in either direction, it goes bananas.  my images get shrunk and cut up all over the place and it took me weeks to get all the adjusted sizes in code just right so that my images appeared how and what size they were designed.  When i broke my long images up into smaller ones and kept my TGA files under 256 pixels though everything was exactly ow it should.   I suppose I could have found out why, but I never did knowing just not to do that.   Your stone_button.tga file is defined as a 512 x 512 pixel tga.  This is most likely not the culprit but it jumped out at me as a potential problem nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Secondly are you familiar with alpha channels and image masks?  Saved alongside the TGA files there is an alpha channel that blocks and allows portions of a image file to show through much like the same way a stencil bocks paint.  This mask also allows you to control and preserve transparency like a gif image can.  Though you didnt post your TGA file for me to check, this alpha channel is the most common cause of this problem in my experience with new UI modders when there are no code errors so to speak, but the graphics are missing.  If you can post your tga file as well  I will be happy to take a look at it for you.   If this is not the case then we can move on to a little more thorough check but I would be willing to bet your problem lies here.  <br />

I left off the 's' in the xml file when referencing the texture, so it of course wasn't grabbing an image from anywhere, even after I resized my image and put in a nice shiny alpha channel.  Uh, yeah, move along, nothing to see here.  Oh, and for anyone that may be interested, yes, you can indeed have multiple frame animations for hotbuttons.  I need to seriously tweak them though.  Yay, thanks for the help you guys!</div></div><hr />
