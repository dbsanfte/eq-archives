<br />
If not I have an idea, I'm just not sure if XML is capable of it, as I have no XML programming experience.<br />
<br />
If this is possible, could someone post the code, once it's been figgured out?  Anyway, here goes!  You take your Stamina percent field, subtract 100, then make it an absolute value.  Or possibly just strip off the negative sign?  I'm not sure if XML has the mathmatical capabilities to do this or not, it's just an idea, but will work, if it can be done.<br />
<br />
Hope this can be figgured out, as I'm sure I'm not the only one who is annoyed by a 0 Stamina when it's full *grumble.*<br />

It does not. XML is not a programming language. It's mearly a display language for data only.<br />
<br />
The only way to fix this is to bug VI.</div></div><hr />

I guess I can live with it, as I imagine VI has had lots of people bugging them already about it, and I don't like to pester. :)<br />
