<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eshelon</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I open up the Adventure stats or leaderboard a certain part of EQ crashes.. I'm not entirely sure but I think it's the &quot;Send&quot; part of the client that dies on me. I can see people moving around, I can see people cast spells, talk etc. but if I cast a spell I never get the message and I prompltly go LD within 2 - 6 minutes. Here is the copy pasted info from my UIerrors.txt file, not sure if it will help any.<br />
<br />
Edit: Removed the log for easier reading since Dolby said es all gewd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those warnings are good. Its saying your custom UI doesnt have these files so its going to grab them from the default folder. Thats a very good thing.<br />
<br />
Does this &quot;send&quot; problem your having happen with the default interface?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eshelon</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, just tested that out just now and here's what happens. I set my UI to default. When I then looked at the leaderboard I didn't get any stats (I never have in the past so this is the same). I close the leader board and stats windows and cast a spell. My spell gems stay grayed out and my &quot;send&quot; lag begins... <br />
<br />
Now in my nieveness I thought &quot;Maybe the default UI didn't actually load since my windows are all still in the same round about locations&quot; (but of course the look and shape of the windows was that of the default UI).. So durring my &quot;Send&quot; lag before I go LD I re-load the Default UI from the options pannel and walla! my spell suddenly casts and when I alt+v for stats and leaderboard all the sudden I can see people's stats!! <br />
<br />
I'm thinking &quot;Hey I'm getting somewhere&quot;. So I decide to try filtering the leaderboard acording to Deepest guk.. Nothing.. My &quot;Send&quot; lag had started again.. Tried to cast a spell. No cast - just a casting timer that expires and grayed out spell gems. Then, LINK DEAD..<br />
<br />
Any ideas on what's going on here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macomber</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm getting the same damn thing on 2 of the 3 comptuers I use in EQ. I cant find out what the heck is going on. <br />
<br />
Here's what I did to test out a few things...<br />
<br />
First thing I did was to switch to defult UI .. same crap as listed above... &quot;so its not the UI&quot; I'm thinking.<br />
<br />
Second step I took was to delete eq.ini files and files for char's... same crap<br />
<br />
Last step I took was to delete the entire EQ folder (basicly unistalling it) then I copied the EQ folder from the &quot;good computer&quot; and put it on the PC I just deleted it from &quot;the bad PC&quot;. After making the short cuts work... I load up... change a setting for the video card... load EQ .... and same old crap ... &lt;alt + V&gt; &lt;view stats&gt; nothing.... like it was said before... after hitting  view stats ... I could cast a spell ... but it wouldnt land... and then the gems would stay gray &quot;you have not recovered yet&quot; then bam .. LD<br />
<br />
I'm running all current model PC's all with WinXP Pro ... all the same service packs... all the same everything pretty much ... on a LAN ... router as the gateway ... on cable....<br />
<br />
just my 2cp ... I'll post something if I find a fix</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macomber</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also ... I can load any of my accounts on to the &quot;good PC&quot; and they work fine... so no its not the char on EQ's side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eshelon</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I have determined that is has something to do with the router.. How is your router set up in regard to the machine that works? What is that machines Network IP? Other settings? I have no machines that work but when I connect to EQ directly without the router the leaderboard works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eshelon</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have now resolved the issue by upgrading the firmware for my router at www.linksys.com, Did you also have a linksys? You might want to try this and see if it helps. Might even be the same model router or a sister model. BEFSR41.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck in resolving the issure for yourself.<br />
<br />
Also I think that even tho the problem was not UI related it does give the apearance of being UI related and I think other people with this problem will come here looking for answers and this post should stay around for a bit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macomber</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad to hear you got everything taken care of. I've already up-dated my firmware for the router (about 1 week ago) might be a new firmware out... I'll check into that... thanks for the info friend.<br />
Ever on Fennin Ro look me up .. we can chat or somfin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macomber</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, didnt help... Firmware is up-to-date, all 3 PC's are set up the same and all have the same settings in the router (hooked up &quot;the good PC's&quot; cable to one of the &quot;bad PCs&quot; and it didnt make a difference... so that narrows it down some... not sure what it narrowed it down to but it is narrowing hehe</div></div><hr />
