<br />
has anybody figured out how to view the XML files without loading up EQ? It's just annoying to start EQ up all the way just to see if your latest little change looks good. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for the help.<br />

Apparently EQ only needs the files when you initially load the skin, because you can make changes to them all you want and save them, then go back to the game machine and &quot;/loadskin skinname&quot; again to see the changes.<br />
<br />
Haven't tried it but maybe it's possible to use EQWindow and have a wordpad window open, switching between them when you need to.  Depends on the specs of the machine and may involve turning off some models and/or sound in EQ while you're editing.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you're looking for a custom program to display windows that doesn't require entering the game, and I don't know of one yet.  Would probably involve reproducing most of the eq code, I'm guessing, so it could be a while.<br />

Just my 2cp!</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's EQwindow? There a site or something I can read about this program? google.com gave me crap results for my searches.<br />
<br />
btw, if I find and use EQwindows, will I be violating EQ's ToS or EULA or anything like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mIkE_2oo0</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes EQWindow violates the EQ EULA. Basically, if they find out you're using it, you get banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The funny thing about that, is the reason they ban you isn't that you're playing EQ in a window. The reason they ban you is that playing EQ in a window allows you to potentially hack memory values that are handled client side, such as your run speed, night vision, breath meter, etc. Even though those values are constantly checked versus what spell effects are on you and any discrepancy is reported immediately by the client. Violators get banned instantly most of the time.<br />
<br />
I think it was Abashi who stated that it makes it too easy for &quot;casual hackers&quot; who don't have the motivation or equipment to hack otherwise. What blows my mind is that they want the business of people who would cheat if they only had a dual monitor setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qalamar</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used EQWindow for quite a while now and never had any problems with the GMs, etc.  I used it mainly to play 2 accounts at the same time on the same machine.  You can do a search for &quot;eqw&quot; on google and it should be within the first few matches.  (There's an update out for the new UI, by the way).  Anyway, no guarantees, but I've never known anyone to get banned for using EQW, but I've also never known anyone that used it for illegitimate reasons.  I'm at work now using it to modify my UI and it works great.</div></div><hr />

And know this: &quot;Number one reason hackers get cought is cause they can't get their mouths shut&quot;<br />
