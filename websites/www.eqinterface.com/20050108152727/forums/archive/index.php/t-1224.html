Has anyone made a mod for the group window and player info window where the player health is in the group window, in the first slot? Idealy, the rest of the player info would be left in the player info window (mana, stamina, add exp, AA exp, cast time), but the player's health would be in the group window, right along with all the other group member's health bars. <br />
<br />
I dont' know about others, but I have always situated my player info window right above the group window to get my own health bar as close as possible to the rest of the group. (I play a cleric a lot...staring at the group health bars consumes a lot of my play time). I just thought it would be cool to have it moved there. <br />
<br />
Another thing I've seen on some mods that I really like is the f-key number next to the group member's name, and of course, the ever-popular percentages. <br />
<br />
Finally, to put both windows together (however that's done, I don't know, but I've seen some done that way) would be even better. <br />
<br />
Man, I need to take some time and learn some xml :p</div></div><hr />

I've wanted to do it myself but can't find the time.  Reloading EQ to test every change blows.....WTB graphical UI customizer!!  I've often wondered why people put the HP % at the end of the HP bar instead of placing it above the HP bar aligned with the end of it.  It makes the window take up less space and the only thing up there is the group members name.  I guess you could have an issue is a group member had a very long name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks rather straight forward, code wise.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of using the Player window as the Target window (so it glows red during combat) and putting the player stats at the top of the group window. This leaves the target window free for future use ... not sure what as yet.<br />
<br />
Lothan, I use EQW (EQ-Window) it saves you reloading EQ for every little change, a bit ropey for actually playing though.</div></div><hr />

http://www.mafoo.org/host/UI/GroupWindow.jpg<br />
Alas thou downloads are currently disbaled and i cannot afford teh bandwidth hit on my server to host the mods i have done because i teh few days my mods were up on eqinterface they all hit over 500 downloads.<br />
I ill try to find a Phreeeby host but it may be on something like geocites, if anyone has any phreeby hosts that are good (i.e. don't pop-up spam you and you don't get qued/limited please let me know)</div></div><hr />

If ya find what you're looking for send me a message eh? :p Very nice group window by the way ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saph</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like something simple along these lines if someone could possibly make it :).  Just my health bar in the group window with the rest of the group's.<br />
<br />
Nothing fancy, no %'s, just the default group window, with your default player health bar included, while leaving your own personal player window seperate and alone.<br />
<br />
So the end result would be just a bigger group window because of your extra health bar being tacked on.  Thanks for listening.</div></div><hr />
