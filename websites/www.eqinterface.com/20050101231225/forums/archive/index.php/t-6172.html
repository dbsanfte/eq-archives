<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">regna</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know how to get rid of the small, frozen arrow that sits in the middle of the screen? It just  appeared after yesterdays or the day befores patch. I dual comp and run the same ui on both of them, but the second comp doesnt have it. The arrow doesnt do anything, its just kinda irratating looking at it. Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is related to the problems described in this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6054) thread.  Check there for the various suggestions folks have had work for them.  SOE is still looking into the issue to come up with a fix.  Unfortunately, it isn't really a UI issue, so there is little that we can do from this site to help, other than to pass along the information folks are able to come up with (ala the linked thread).  Wish I could tell you more.</div></div><hr />

Couldnt find anything on it to fix but but while playing around I found that if you alt-enter to go to windowed mode and then alt-enter back to fullscreen mode it goes away.  Thats how I get rid of mine now til theres a permanent fix.<br />

It'll be good when SOE can figure out what is causing the error and get it resolved.  They are working on it.</div></div><hr />
