Those are the two errors that your log file is currently showing.  You need to:<br />
<br />
a) see if there are updates for those by their original author(s);<br />
b) find new ones that you like that are working correctly;<br />
c) go in and fix them yourself (people here can help give you the directions to do so); or<br />
d) delete them from your custom folder and just let EQ use the default ones.</div>

		<div>This actually is a very common issue with the system as of about 2 patches ago and it has NOTHING to do with the UI files at all.<br />
NOTE:  My use of the word delete is a suggestion.  You may wish to RENAME the files as a safety precaution.<br />
<br />
  1)  Delete EQGAME.EXE<br />
  2)  Delete EQFX_DX8.DLL (or something like that)<br />
  3)  Delete EQClient.INI<br />
  4)  Delete *.opt.<br />
On the Advanced Patcher Tab reselect all (including legends) content.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW:  If you zone and crash everytime you zone.<br />
  Delete all TXT files in your Everquest main folder.<br />
  Do full file check on the advanced tab.<br />
<br />
These two things IMMEDIATELY fixed the issues with my dialog boxes and zone crashing, in fact, I now zone twice as fast.<br />
<br />
NOTE::::::  Your special color scheme will be blasted away when you do this.   You will need to reset OPTIONS upon the first load.</div>
