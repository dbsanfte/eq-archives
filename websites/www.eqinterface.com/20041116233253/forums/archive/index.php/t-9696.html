<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinkfu</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup thanks to a great artist who chose to remain nameless, I have a shiney new GUI for Einux (my linux that runs EQ)  the underlying code is going to take alot of time, I only have 3 people helping me with it we are starting with a slackware design and reworking it for our needs, the main goal is to have EQ run just as well as it would on windows, but be great for sitting a few days in the bazaar.  Filesystem and the amount of point-and-click compared to running command lines is still being looked into.  I have it supporting redhat packages and want it to support debian as well but I am still not sure how to get that done..  anyway enough of my runon sentences here is a screencap of Alpha 3 Desktop.<br />
