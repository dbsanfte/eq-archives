We've followed the directions and every time he logs in the windows are all scattered and the new blue quarts new graphics aren't showing up until he tries to actually load the UI in game and then it says something about XML files not being compatible. <br />
<br />
And currently I'm having a problem with Slayerv saying that its not compatible and only parts of it showing up.<br />
<br />
Anyone know how to fix these? Is this an LoY problem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Read some of the sticky threads in the READ ME forum that explain how to post in the help forum.<br />
<br />
Also might want to check out our patch forum before you do that. It sounds like your UI is out of date but since we dont have uierrors yet we cant tell for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ninilye</div><div class="date">03-22-2003, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I already read the readme and the faq and everything else I could find on this site. I also used the search feature. I had completely forgotton about the uierrors.txt file tho. I've edited the xml files and if I have any more problems I will post the uierrors.txt.</div></div><hr />

The new Blue Quartz is a skin for Quartz 1.6.  You need to have Quartz 1.6 already installed in order to use blue quartz.  If you have already know this, then sorry for butting in.<br />
