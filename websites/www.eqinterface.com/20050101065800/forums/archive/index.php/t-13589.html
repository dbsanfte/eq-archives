My Husband downloaded a few different target rings about a week ago and ended up with a Trojan. I'm not an illiterate PC person and I got it off  and repaired the damdge done to his PC . I am not sure what the file name here is but the downloaded file is called SecThought.exe. This wasn't part of a 'complete set' this was in the individual download section , specifically the ' Target Ring ' files. Agian , beware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You got the trojan from some where else. Our file vault is scanned every couple of hours and every file is checked manually by a file moderator before they are approved for download.<br />
<br />
I even ran another scan on the 3d target file directory to make sure. Also none of the zipfiles in the 3d target ring section have exe's in them.<br />
<br />
If you have a filename I can tripple check or more information please let me know.<br />
<br />
I'm running a manual scan on the entire file vault now.<br />
[edit] full manual clamscan done and nothing found.</div></div><hr />

Please don't take that as any kind of affront to you. I'm glad you looked into it and replied. i appreciate the reassurance that it may not have been from here. <br />

Lucidus. no thank god it didn't do much damage besides to a couple of EQ files. it's not spyware. it was specifically named a trojan . not a threat . But as you can see Dolby has taken care of it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurrani</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few weeks ago I also go the Trojan Virus. I have no idea where it came from. I didn't download anything or any emails that might have had it. The only attachments I get are from my parents. Anyway I fixed and repaired it. But as far I know it is in no way connected to EQinterface.  I hadn't downloaded anything from this site before I got the virus so it must be finding a different way in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anytime you go to any sites with popups etc, it's possible to acquire one.  I was simply surfing innocently on the web for information on a don henley song.  All of a sudden after a few links later and what seemed like a rash of sites that brought up numerous popups, I was getting virus warnings out the wazoo.  Virii are easier to obtain than dust in a pc fan these days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mozilla - http://www.mozilla.org<br />
Opera - http://www.opera.com<br />
<br />
When I used IE, I got adware and viruses and popups like crazy, I switched to Mozilla about 6 months ago and haven't gotten a one since.</div></div><hr />
