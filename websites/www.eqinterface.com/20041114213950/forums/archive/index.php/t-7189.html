<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the latest release of my /viewport UI for 1024x768 resolution. Completely updated for the LoY expansion and revamped to look better.<br />
<br />
It is designed for a /viewport 0 0 842 600 setting with the UI windows on the right side of the screen and chat boxes on the bottom.<br />
<br />
The zip file contains instalation instructions and a copy of a .ini file that can be used to insure the windows line up correctly.<br />
<br />
The UI is primarily designed to be mouse user friendly, and for any class.<br />
<br />
Download it by clicking here. (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1476)<br />
<br />
http://home.attbi.com/~mbeiser/Images/Caleal1.4.JPG<br />
<br />
The hotbutton window has a tabbed section that gives full access to all inventory and armor locations.<br />
<br />
The group window includes all player stats and has large clickable areas for targeting self and group members.<br />
<br />
The buff and song windows are compact with small icons, buff names, custom icon backgrounds and numbered buff slots.<br />
<br />
The &quot;target&quot; bar is very long and has 10 sections to it. There is a casting gauge under the target lifebar that also has 10 sections to it. I find it usefull for heal timing.<br />
<br />
The &quot;target&quot; window is made from the player window, so it will have a flashing red outline around the target and casting gauges when attack is on.<br />
<br />
The inventory window is very compact and has no stats in it. The autoequip area is the class animation.<br />
<br />
Containers have the primary, secondary, ranged and ammo slots in them.<br />
<br />
The spell cast bar has a transparent background and number labels for the spell gems.<br />
<br />
The chat window contains the template for its custom borders, as well as the templates for the borders for all other windows in the UI. All custom graphics animations used in the UI are defined in the xml code for the chat window.<br />
<br />
The UI is fully compatable with the default EQUI_Animations.xml file. The custom one included with the UI is for the custom buff icon backgrounds. If a patch makes changes to the EQUI_Animations.xml file, you can just delete the custom one and the game will use the default backgrounds.<br />
<br />
The modified xml files are:<br />
EQUI_Animations.xml (only modified to use custom buff icon backgrounds)<br />
EQUI_BuffWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_CastingWindow.xml (reduced to size 0 0 so it is never visible)<br />
EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_ChatWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_CompassWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_Container.xml<br />
EQUI_GroupWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_Inventory.xml<br />
EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_SelectorWind.xml<br />
EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_TargetWindow.xml (reduced to size 0 0 so it is never visible.)<br />
<br />
Modified graphics files are:<br />
window_pieces01.tga <br />
window_pieces02.tga<br />
window_pieces03.tga<br />
wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga<br />
wnd_bg_light_rock.tga<br />
scrollbar_gutter.tga<br />
<br />
Added graphics files are:<br />
buff.tga (Custom buff icon background)<br />
lunbar.tga (For the gauges in the &quot;target&quot; window.)<br />
vertgauges.tga (For the gauges in the group window.)<br />
<br />
Custom graphics files are from Raxthorn, Vertebrea, and Lunakin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">02-28-2003, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have gotten a few emails from people complaining that they are unable to move the chat windows.<br />
<br />
I don't use title bars in my chat windows because I think they are ugly and waste space. <br />
<br />
Unfortunatly resizable windows with no titlebars cannot be grabbed onto and moved around, they have to be resized into the new location.<br />
<br />
The borders on the chat windows are only 1 pixle wide so, depending on your mouse and drivers, you may have dificulty resizing the chat windows. Change your mouse speed to 0 and you should have no problem resizing the windows. /mousespeed 0<br />
<br />
If I can make it work correctly without changing the looks of anything, I'll ad a 2-3 pixle wide transparrent title bar to the top of the chat windows soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But since I have no choice now, I downloaded and installed your latest. 1.4 I believe.<br />
<br />
I have been unable to get it to load due to the following errors:<br />

[Sat Mar 01 11:17:26 2003] Error loading skin: loading default skin instead.<br />
<br />
When I take the SpellBook from the default folder and place it in the test that i'm loading, the skin loads fine with the exception of a very, very odd looking spellbook.<br />
<br />
I didn't notice any reference to changes that needed to be made to accomadate the spellbook in your skin, so I'm not sure if this problem is with my install or in the coding... <br />
<br />
Have you run into this trouble yourself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">03-01-2003, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There isn't a custom spell book, or custom graphics for one, in this UI. The game loads the default one if you installed the UI correctly.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you installed the new version over the top of an older version. Versions 1.1 and 1.2 had a variation of the vertmod EQUI_Animations.xml file and a custom spellbook and graphics for it.<br />
<br />
Delete all the files in the directory you are installing my IU to, or start with a clean directory.<br />
<br />
Extract all the new files to the clean directory, you will no longer have the problem.<br />
<br />
Only the modified files should be in the directory you install the UI to.<br />
<br />
Exept for the change needed to use custom buff icon backgrounds, I madeno changes to the EQUI_Animations.xml file.<br />
<br />
You can install any spell book mod, or any other mod, you want, so long as it is a stand alone mod, or works with the default EQUI_Animations.xml file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">03-01-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, just noticed a typo in my hotbutton window &quot;Unspnt Points&quot;. =x<br />
<br />
Oh well, guess I'll fix that when I update the chat windows to have a small transparent title bar.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tirnor</div><div class="date">03-01-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you are correct, that is exactly what I did.<br />
<br />
*boot to the head*<br />
<br />
I did not install to a clean directory.<br />
<br />
Many apologies and thanks again for the nice skin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazerik</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to say that I REALLY dig the skin. I love the compact nature, and to many other things to mention. <br />
  For personal use, I used other mods that I have found in EQGUI and changed the bags. I'm a caster, so I found the bags w/ pri,sec,rng, &amp; ammo distracting. I found a loaded a bag mod to compact all the bags down to minimal size.<br />
  Since EQ started, I've always thought that the number for spells was backwards...so I inverted the numbering system on the transparent spell.<br />
  Currently, I'm working on modifying the xml for the left inventory window so that it shows the areas that I have clicky items in. (boots, gloves, vambrace.)<br />
<br />
Here is what mine looks like. Once again, HUGE thanks to Caleal for making a skin after my own heart.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emil</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a very nice UI.<br />
<br />
If I could add a request/construstive suggestion:<br />
<br />
It would be nice to have the hotbox and the player/group box line up both vertically (width -- it already does) and horizontally (height -- does not at present) so they could be placed side by side, seamlessly.<br />
<br />
I would suggest/request to drop the player name (first &amp; last) and the diety all together, then move the /lfg, invite, disband buttons across the bottom of the player/grp box(or remove them all together).<br />
<br />
Also, it would be nice to see the AC &amp; ATK in the player window. and to remove the pet display. (I'm essentially suggesting a melee-based player window as an option) <br />
<br />
All in all, this is one of the better UI's I've seen, and I appreciate your work - very minimalist, tight UI.<br />
<br />
**edit.. nm on the AC/ATK, it's there i just didn't notice it so early in the morning, hehe..<br />
<br />
would be nice to squeeze the hp current/hp total near those 2 attributes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emil</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To give a visual representation of how I'm laying out your UI, I'm attaching a pic.<br />
<br />
I too, changed the bags out (found the 4 extra slots a bit confusing as well) and switched out the compass for a transparent one.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's a pic of how I have the components arranged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaysho</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">very good ui</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like the looks of how you are laying that out Emil. It wouldn't work for me really, but it looks very nice.<br />
<br />
The reason I laied it out like I did is because I cannot stand having my viewable area go the full width of the screen, it gives me a headach. I also play primarily by mouse click, so I like having everything very close together.<br />
<br />
I only use this UI on my 2nd machine for running 2nd characters and such anymore. I got a faster system and am playing at a higher res now, so I am working on a new interface (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6332), its nearly done.<br />
<br />
Heh, your bags reminded me that I need to redo mine. =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">03-05-2003, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note for Emil. If you want the 1 pixl wide border all the way around the windows, set the draw template in them to:<br />
<br />
&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Chat&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
Or you can go into the xml file for the chat window and modify the draw templates for each of the windows. They are all defined there.</div></div><hr />

i very like this UI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to be doing some updating this weekend to get rid of the error message that comes up when you first lot in or /load my UI.<br />
<br />
The patch had no impact whatsoever on the function of this UI, or my UI for 1280x1024.<br />
<br />
If you are having problems, make sure you have deleted the EQUI_Animations.xml file that was included in the .zip file for my UI.<br />
<br />
If you still have problems, make sure that the directory you have my UI in ONLY has the files that came in the .zip file for the UI.<br />
<br />
100% of the problems with the function of my UIs, that have been reported to me, were the result of people having files in the directory with my UI that were not suposed to be there.<br />
<br />
It has been nearly 6 months of patches, and one expansion, since the last time I updated my &quot;patch resistant&quot; UIs. The only problem encountered, that &quot;broke&quot; my UIs, was fixed by deleting the custom EQUI_Animations.xml file. My UIs do not need that file and function perfectly with the default EQUI_Animations.xml file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Updated the UI to remove the xml compatability errors that crept in over the last 7 months, and so the custom buff backgrounds work again.</div></div><hr />
