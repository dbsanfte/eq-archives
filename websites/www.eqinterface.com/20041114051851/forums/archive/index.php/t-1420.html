<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightWolf</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of you probably already use this, but if you don't, this can be a heavy time saver.<br />
I just started messing with the gui last night and discovered this, but couldn't get to website so this is my first chance to post.<br />
<br />
This only works if you have two computers networked together, which most of you probably have.  <br />
<br />
For this example, Computer 1 will be the computer you play EQ on and Computer 2 will be the production computer.  &quot;Mine&quot; will be the name of the mod that we use.  <br />
<br />
Ok,  first, share your Everquest folder on Computer 1 over the network (you could just share the mod directory, but then you wouldn't have access to uierrors.txt)<br />
<br />
Now, log in to the game with Computer 1.<br />
<br />
On computer 2, pull up the Everquest directory from Computer 1 (using the network of course) and the developing tools you use to create your mods.<br />
<br />
Here is the cool part, Everquest allows you to modify the files while in game, so you can edit the .XML files on Computer 1 (thru using Computer 2) without crashing the game (I think you see where I'm going with this).<br />
<br />
So, make a hotkey on your character logged in on Computer 1 that's titled &quot;Mine&quot; and have it type &quot;/loadskin Mine 1&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, all you have to do is edit the XML in Computer 1's Mine folder using your second computer, hit save, and press the &quot;Mine&quot; hotkey on your first computer.<br />
<br />
Violla,  You can now see the changes you made to your window imediately,  while still in production.  :)<br />
<br />
For those of you who constantly log on and off to check changes, this will save you a lifetime, and the mods that you develope will be near bugless since you can check the changes while still writing the code.<br />
<br />
P.S. Since you're sharing the whole EQ directory, if there is some problem loading your skin and it loads the default back, you can get access to the uierrors.txt file as soon as it's writen and fix the problem without logging out.  <br />
<br />
Hope this helps everyone.</div></div><hr />

Even though it was very simple, I saved atleast an hour by working on it from my computer and testing it from my brothers.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm working on a completely new UI based on windows XP. Since I don't want to log every time I need to fix something, I'll just use my brother's computer again. (we have all our hard drives shared anyway)<br />
<br />
Good to see I'm not the only one that thought of this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tipop</div><div class="date">09-14-2002, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's how I test my mods... EQW.  I do have a second computer on my network here, but that one is always busy being used for other things.<br />
<br />
And no, I have never heard anything about EQW being a problem with Verant. A lot of people buy second accounts because of EQW, so I don't think they are particularly worried about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
current setup:<br />
2 computers, both winxp pro<br />
linksys router<br />
<br />
eq is played on comp1, editing will be done on comp2<br />
<br />
comp1 has sharing on for c:\, program files folder, and everquest folder<br />
<br />
comp2 can connect using my network places, can access the root drive, my shared folder, and shared documents folder.<br />
<br />
try to open program files i get the following message:<br />
&quot;\\comp1\program files is not accessible.  You might not have permission to use this network resource.  Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cormanth</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also have had a problem with dumping to desktop after loading a custom skin a few times in a row. I usually get 3 or 4 loads before it dumps me. However, I have discovered that if I load the default skin every few times, I can continue to work in-game without be dumped (ie. load custom, make changes, load custom, make changes, load default, load custom, make changes, load custom, make changes, load default,...etc).</div></div><hr />

Note sure if you have resolved this or not by now.  But, if not (or for anyone else who experiences this), the problem is related to the default access permissions assigned by Windows XP to the so called &quot;system folders&quot; such as C:\Program Files and C:\Windows.  You need to grant access to the Everyone user group.  Check out Microsoft Knowledge Base Article Q308418 (http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;308418) for information on how to change the permissions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">imasianman</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">are these (eqw, 2+ comps) the only ways to check on your work?<br />
or are there progs out there that i should know about</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graffenlaff</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These are pretty old posts. With the alt-enter putting EQ game in a window, the same thing can be done with one computer and alt-tabbing out to your editor, folders and word pad type viewer for error checking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">imasianman</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">reason i asked is because i dont play eq anymore, but wanted to make skins on my spare time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grict</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">make sure you have privlages on both computers. XP wont let you use any resources if it doesnt know you. just make sure that the username you login as has an account on the other computer with the same password. (the users icon in control panel) that way when you ask to look at comp 2 from comp1 it checks to see who you are in its users list and if it knows you it allows you access. hope this helps!!!<br />
post back if you need more details</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derithon</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like your PCs are in a workgroup.  As such, each PC has control of its own resources. Adding the Everyone group will not help in this case due to the Everyone group being specific to THAT PC.  You need to think of PCs in a workgroup as self contained worlds - It only knows what it contains. <br />
<br />
You need to create a user account on each PC that exists on the other (i.e. On Comp 1 you have user 1 and on Comp 2 you have user 2 - You need to create user 2 on Comp 1 and User 1 on Comp 2)   You could also try to add the user from the other PC as a authorized user in the user manager (Right click on &quot;My Computer&quot;, left click on &quot;Manage&quot;, Left click on &quot;Users &amp; Groups&quot;)  Depending on which PC is the Browse Master you MAY have issues hence my first solution.<br />
<br />
Your other option is if you have a spare PC and a copy of some version of server (NT/2000/2003) you can create a Domain and join your PCs to the domain and have the domain control rights.  It boils down to not having rights to access the data - not that you can't see the data.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

<br />
I just break EQ down into windows mode, make UI changes in a seperate window, maximize EQ then reload the UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qinadwen</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of using EQW ... use ALT-ENTER and then SHIFT-ALT-R to release the mouse ... and with that option already in EQ, why is using EQW against the EULA? I have briefly looked at the homepage for EQW and might have missed something ... what does EQW do exactly, that is a violation?<br />
<br />
Note : I dont ever think I have read the EULA :p</div></div><hr />
