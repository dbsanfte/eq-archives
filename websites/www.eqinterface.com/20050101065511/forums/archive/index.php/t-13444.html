<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dewback669</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done all the things required to run this UI. I downloaded ,unzipped ,copyed the resolution files and the other files into a folder named exactly the same as the original down to the CAPS ,and I renamed the ini file UI_Slimenstera_Rathe and copyed that into the EQ main folder ,then in game I typed /loadskin KatnTKBeast-fixed. I can get all the right boxes to come up and in basically the right spots and the screen has even gone to &quot;widescreen&quot;so tat my game screen is no longer cluttered with all the chat and group hotbutton ETC windows but the custom graphics don't load it is still all in the default style. I sent an Email to Katn and she told me that I did everything right but the UI will nolonger work due to patches and that she is nolonger working on UI's which is a shame. So what I need to know is are there any ways that I can update this UI or are there anyupdated versions that I have overlooked. I am about as new as it gets when it comes to these things so I would appreciate all the help I can get. I will be happy to attach both a screen shot of how the UI appears and my UIError log if I can ever figure out how to attach them.<br />
