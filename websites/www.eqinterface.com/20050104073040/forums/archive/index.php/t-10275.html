The buttons are there if you hold the cursor over the area where the button should appear you will get the text prompt and clicking will open that window, however the icon for that window does not appear in the window selector bar.   I am missing about half the icons from the bar.  Any help would be greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have:<br />
<br />
A custom EQUI_Animations.xml;<br />
A custom EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml; and/or<br />
A custom window_pieces01, 02 or 04.tga files?<br />
<br />
If you have the customized xml (coding) files, make sure that all the coding is there.<br />
<br />
If you have customized tga (graphic) files, make sure that you have the actual graphics that have been added (compare to the corresponding file in the default folder).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenswing</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No I dont have A custom EQUI_Animations.xml or <br />
A custom EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml; <br />
<br />
I do however have a A custom window_pieces04.tga file  <br />
The window_pieces04.tga file in my custom UI folder is 19 Kb in length and the one in the default folder is 257kb in length which leads me to believe that I may have an incomplete file in my custom folder.  Can I just copy the one from the default folder or would it be better to delete the one in the custom folder?  <br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated ;)</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, you are either going to have to:<br />
<br />
a) give up the customization of the .tga file and just run with the default, which may impact how other things &quot;look&quot; in-game; or<br />
<br />
b) manually edit (or have someone else edit for you) your custom .tga file to include the additional graphics that it is currently missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenswing</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all your help Cairewn,  the author of my ui has not updated the ui since June of 2002 so that option is out.  Do you know what program I would use to edit the tga files I am fairly confident that I can do the edit but I have no way to open the file and no clue what if any program to use.  Again thanks for your time and effort by supplying some solutions for me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PaintShopPro, PhotoShop, GIMP, something like that, that allows you to edit alpha channels, etc.<br />
<br />
There is good information on dealing with the graphic side of UI skins down in the &quot;Developer&quot; section of the board.<br />
<br />
Good luck.  If I (or any of the other wonderfully helpful folks here) can do anything more to help, just post again. :)</div></div><hr />
