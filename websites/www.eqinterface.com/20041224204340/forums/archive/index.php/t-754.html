<br />
Soo far my favorite mod is the one by Dalink which is a mod of Quartz providing the auto equip area.  All I can say is wow, this is perfect.  I will be using this mod for my druid for sure.  The only problem I have is that when I enable this mod, my buff window poofs, sometimes I loose other windows as well, like the pet window and the one below it.<br />
<br />
The pet window I don't care much about, only looks weird not having the screen be balanced, but I can live with that.  The buff window though, that really sucks.<br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I switched to my Ranger and /loadskin  the quartz modified mod and POOF there went the buff window. I thought a simple alt+b would bring it back, which it did, but all that showed up were the buff names, no border, no images, and no background. <br />
<br />
I camped out and came back, and boom.. it worked then.. <br />
<br />
It sounds like an EQ bug.. I dont know.. <br />
<br />
Glad ya liked the mod. :)</div></div><hr />

The thing that worked for me was to open up 'UI_charactername_xx.ini' with notepad and check the settings.<br />
<br />
[BuffWindow]<br />
XPos800x600=100<br />
YPos800x600=100<br />
Width=44<br />
Height=664<br />
BGTint.red=255<br />
BGTint.green=255<br />
BGTint.blue=255<br />
Fades=true<br />
Delay=2000<br />
Duration=500<br />
Alpha=255<br />
FadeToAlpha=1<br />
Locked=false<br />
Show=1<br />
XPos1024x768=0<br />
YPos1024x768=-7<br />
<br />
For whatever your given resolution is, make sure that the xpos and ypos are values that will appear onscreen, once i saw the values way off and fixed it, next, check the Width and Height and make sure they are set to reasonable values.<br />
<br />
I just set the values so it would appear on the middle of the screen, then you can resize and reposition once you've got EQ running.<br />
<br />
It worked for me, hopefully it works for you too.</div></div><hr />
