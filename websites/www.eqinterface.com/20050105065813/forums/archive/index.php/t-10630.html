<br />
Just the first obvious questions.<br />
<br />
1) are you using the most rescent Vert 2.6e from this site?<br />
2) did you get the patch and overwrite the files in it into the vert dir?<br />
<br />
If so post the errors text and I'll get you set up.<br />

<br />
However I just re-downloaded the vert 2.6e cannabis and the patch, fresh install, and there are no errors.<br />
<br />
Are you trying to use another group window? If so thats where the problem is. Send me over the group window file and I'll get you fixed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sokol</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, when you unzip the Vert 2.6e it unzips into a folder of it's own, but the patch does not, the patch will unzip into whatever dir you tell it to, and the Vert 2.6 will make it's own dir.<br />

I'm sure you know this but it helps to cover all bases.<br />

anyhow it works now not sure why the folders are identical... could have been a hiccup in the download and one of the files is a tad different or something along those lines or maybe i just missed a file in the unzip &gt;&lt; no clue anyhow, it works now sorry to bother you lol, if you want i can pack up the folder i had first and send it to you if you're interested, if not &lt;shrugs&gt; it works now so thanks a ton ^^</div></div><hr />

As for the sugegstions you would be surprised how often some things are simple mistakes like that :) Glad your back, and enjoy Vert and or Solaria<br />
