I want to alter 2 seperate things, my buff window, and my user stat info.  tried several times to post here but the site is not working for some reason, so i wont go into detail again, i am tired of it.<br />
<br />
tried <br />
<br />
/loadskin &quot;name&quot; true, and false<br />
/loadskin &quot;name&quot; 0, and 1<br />
<br />
no luck.<br />
<br />
any clues.<br />
<br />
i am a computer pro, so i know the files are in the correct folders and such, but it seems my eq just wont be nice.  Not to mention another error i have about immages of Wolves.  Every wolve in game has strange fonts, yet on other computers it dosen't.  I belive i need to reload eq, however it still dosen't help my UI situation.<br />

<br />
/load Custom<br />
<br />
If this does not work, you either have nothing in that folder, or your client.ini settings are wrong.  Others here will clarify which ones (I'm too far into a headache to check..lol)<br />
<br />
As for the wolves: This is an old glitch. One of your files is corrupted. Go to EQ's website and they'll tell you which one to delete. Then let the patcher reload it. Easy as pie..I had the same problem =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok first the wolf issue is because your .txc files in your Everquest directory are corrupt.  You need to delete the *.txc files from the Everyquest directory and that should be fixed.  Don't worry about whethere this will break things.  These files are dinamically created when you start EQ if they are not there.  They don't get down loaded so they are not verified through the file check that the patcher does because they are strickly client side based.  But if you delete them and then restart EQ your wolves should be good to go again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the UI issue?  Are you actually typing in the quotes? If you are still having the loadskin issue then try to load the skin one more time and then if it does not load before you try to do anything else exit EQ and look at your UIerrors.txt file and see what it is telling you it is having a problem with.  If you want you can paste the contents of the uierrors.txt file here and I can take a look at it and may be able to tell you what the problem is.  Just make sure you don't do anything else after trying to load the skin and just exit EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beaconoflife</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will try it out and see where i go.<br />
<br />
To answer a question, I am not entering the quotes, for example i have been trying to load a buff called Oki in a folder called Buff,<br />
<br />
I would try <br />
<br />
/loadskin Buff true,<br />
or<br />
/loadskin Buff 1<br />
<br />
yet nothing yet.  I will give it one more shot and see if i cant get it to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you just enter the comand /load, what all is listed in the popup box?<br />
<br />
Also, after you delete all the *.txc files,  you can prevent the bad graphics for wolves and other things by turning off texture caching in the EQ options. If you have a fast system, texture caching is an insignifican't reduction in load times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beaconoflife</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be quite honest i have never gotten a pop-up box with the load feature.   I was told only to type what i listed above. <br />
<br />
When i hit enter after the string it acts as it zoning, and then pops back to my normal screen, however the buttons 1 and 3, (Sense heading) and (Bash) dissappear and i have to re-load them by right clicking and , well you know how to do that i am sure.<br />
<br />
Anyway if i use the value False, or 0 in the string, its as if i just loaded ey for the first time, as the help menu is up and every window.  I am guessing that these 2 options reset the default skin and cause it to return to where it would have been if i had just started playing.  I dont know.<br />
<br />
I just deleted all of my txc files, which i might add is very time consuming :-)  <br />
They are loading now, so hopefully one problem has been fixe.<br />
<br />
what do you think&gt;  <br />
<br />
should i just be typing<br />
<br />
/load Buff true, or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No your command was right.  It is <br />
<br />
/loadskin buff 1<br />
<br />
But after you do it the next time exit out of eq and check out the uierrors.txt file in your everquest directory and see what it is saying is the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tzeenth</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ugReportWnd.xml] Couldn't find class:item 'A_CheckBoxPressed' reference in FieldParseItemOfClass()<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go to the READ ME (http://www.eqgui.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=44) sub-forum at the top of this forum.  In there, find the thread entitled &quot;A_Checkbox&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey tzeenth,  Are you using a custom EQUI_Animations.xml or have you made any modifications to this file in your Skin directory.  If not then just delete the file from you skin and you should be ok.  What the error looks like is you have an out of date EQUI_Animations.xml file in your skin dir.  But if you are using a custom animations file then you will need to look in the Patch forum for that particular error.  In the patch forum it has been written up as to what you need to edit in that file to add that entry in so that everything work again.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to the issue you are having.  Just follow Cairenn's info in there and you should be good.<br />
