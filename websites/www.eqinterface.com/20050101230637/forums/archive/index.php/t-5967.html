<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ehmp</div><div class="date">01-26-2003, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm hoping someone can help me, I have just started to mess around with UI mods and skins recently and like so many others wanted just a few things together and not a complete set.<br />
<br />
Finding that even that was rather confuseing for beginners decided to try Cairenn's UI. For one it's simply beautiful and for two it actually came with a 800x600 version which is resolution I prefer to use. I can use higher reso if I want however when web designing my work revolves around 800x600.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my problem..after loading Cairenn's UI it was a jarbled mess, even tho I followed the directions precisely.<br />
At this point I decided to go back to the UI mods I set up for myself prior being just T-kings spell book and icons.<br />
(which always worked perfectly ) But when I do this my hotboxes are missing.<br />
<br />
I even loaded default ( I've never touched this folder ) and it loads default however hotboxes are still missing.<br />
So now, any UI or the default I load the hotbox is missing in ever single one :(<br />
I've read this forum and a few others for 3 days straight now and cannot seem to find a answer to my problem~where did my hotboxes go?<br />
<br />
I know I have to delete or change some file now in default folder but which ones? If anyone could show me the code to change or how to fix this I would be forever grateful. I miss my hotbox :(<br />

 <br />
Everything loads fine just there are no hotboxes.<br />
Even pressing alt + H ( which is the macro assigned to it )<br />
does not bring them up.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
