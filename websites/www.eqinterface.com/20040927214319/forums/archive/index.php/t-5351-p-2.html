I'm sure they'll be resolved in that version anyway :)  Though, a group window without the ball gauges would be nice.  I like the ones on the Pet window, but just too much going on for me in the group one.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's my little request if you have the time.</div></div><hr />

And yeah, I still play.  The guild might get rather up in arms if I didn't, they are funny that way some times. ;)<br />
<br />
gilantril - I know, I discovered that too.  Fix will be implimented in Version 2.<br />
<br />
Nasus - Glad I was able to explain it well enough that you were able to make the changes.<br />
<br />
Phweak - :D<br />
<br />
dethnyte - Thanks for understanding.  I'll see what I can do, whenver I manage to get some *cough* free time *cough*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CaladairVaz - By next weekend at the latest, I hope</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazykow741</div><div class="date">02-08-2003, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded the main file and saved it in a folder in uifiles just like in the faq. Then I logged on, typed &quot;/loadskin Hehe True&quot; ( Hehe being the folder) and it gives me the usual default windows but in purple. The only thing that works is the spell circle thing on your screenshot:( <br />
EDIT: I just tried it again and the inventory window is working properly.<br />
I have no idea what messed it up for me as I have touched or replaced nothing. Please help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dabbil - Renamed the files?  Huh?  The animation is the standard that comes with EQ.  If you are trying to use the t.king ranger animation, then you need to download it from his site and use the remmy.exe file that is included in the download.  Unzip it all into your custom directory, including the remmy.exe file, and run it from within that custom directory.<br />
<br />
Krazykow741 - Did you move the files from the appropriate resolution folder to your custom folder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazykow741</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, ok I'm really dumb:p  It works now, thanks a bunch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazykow741</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, just one thing. How do I get a group window and target window up? Can't seem to find them anywhere. The top music player bar doesn't work for me either. I appreciate your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you go into the choices folder and pick the ones appropriate to you, as outlined in the ReadMe file?  alt k for the music window.  If you have sounds turned off outside EQ, it won't open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lilpeanuts</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done has you stated in the read me file.  If using no specific Grp window, use the Pet info - left.  And I get NO top bar, tried it the other way, Using Grp window Left, Pet info - No specific file name.  Same result.  What am I doing wrong? <br />
<br />
Beautiful Work I must say, I was one of the first to download it and tried it only to keep crashing, since the recent updates, it looks as if I am able to use it *prays*.  I use the 1024x768 Setting you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You've picked one player window, one group window and one pet window, moved them up to your custom folder and renamed them, right?  They should be showing for you then ...  Did you use the appropriate .ini file?  And by &quot;top bar&quot; do you mean the one across the center above the chat windows, or do you mean the one at the very top of the screen?  The one at the very top of the screen is the mp3 player window.  Can you take a screenshot of how it is looking for you in game and attach it to a message here?  If I can see it, I may be able to help figure it out better for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telomir</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey!  Love the UI after messing around with the different choices I finally figured out why my bottom left side wasnt appearing properly =P<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway my request/questions are this.<br />
<br />
I have tried to change out the current spellcasting bar becuase i don't like it personally.  But every time i try to use a different mod for this, it messes up the rest of the Skin.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you might want to make another choice in yer choices folder that offers Vertical, Horizontal and the curent spell casting tool.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Have you thought about making an option that allows you to pick what side the Hot buttons are on.. right now although you can move it, it brings the right border with it hehe.  I am used to having the hot buttons on the bottom left corner of the screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
If this is too much to ask you to look into, its no problem I will adapt.  Was just wondering if you have thought about those other options is all.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">re the spell bar:  Go to this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=33777#post33777) post to see how to change the current version to run using a different cast bar.  The next version will be much better behaved for that.<br />
<br />
re the hotbuttons: I know a lot of folks are used to using them on the left side of the screen. I was that way myself. What I was attempting to do, however, was to keep anything that people mouse-click in one general area of the screen (right and bottom) to make that a bit easier. In order to move them to the left, I'd have to alter .... ummm .... at least 3 different windows, possibly more, I'd have to really look into it to know for sure. At this point in time I can't promise that I will change that, but if time allows, I'll consider it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telomir</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i sort of figured the hot buttons would be a bear to change.. <br />
<br />
But you did address my main issue.. the spell casting bar..<br />
<br />
gonna go check it out now hehe..<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telomir</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wrong information..<br />
<br />
I think the link you gave me has something to do with putting the spells in the hot buttons.<br />
<br />
I want to be able to use a custom spell cast bar other than the one this UI comes with.<br />
<br />
The one it comes with is nice, but I want a horizontal one, but when i try to change it, it messes up the whole Skin.<br />
<br />
The one you have right now is somehow linked to all the rest of the skin, so when EQ tries to load the UI (with my prefered Spell cast Horizontal bar), it cant find the horizontal bar I want to use so it reverts to the default individual mods.<br />
<br />
Any clue what might be causing it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasus</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes that fix DOES work on the spell bar.  The reason the hotkeys must be addressed is that people can put spells into hotbuttons so there is a correlation between spell bar and hotbuttons.<br />
<br />
Trust me, put in the spell bar that you want .. Then look at your uierrors and you will prolly see that the hotbuttons is what is complaining.. <br />
<br />
Cairenns fix allowd me to change the the spell bar fromthat circular one to a verticle one.  I did the spell bar part right but with out editing the hotbuttons as well, my mod would not work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is because of needing to change the hotbuttons.  Trust me on this one, okay?  Apply the change as I said in that post, and it'll work for you.  Version 2 won't have that problem any more, I have made the exact same changes as I outlined in that post, so folks will be able to drop in any cast window they want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bukaru</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, great UI, good work, look forward to others and updates...my only question is that when i installed your UI, the chat windows top bar ( where the name of the chat window is) is colored purple ( least for me it is)..and easy way to change this? thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No &quot;easy&quot; way to change that.  Only way to change that is to either grab the colour packs from the Kao mod, or go into the window_pieces01.tga, window_pieces03.tga, scrollbar_gutter.tga and lines.tga and colour them yourself.<br />
<br />
Version two won't have coloured titlebars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethnyte</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How close to Version 2 coming out?  Not trying to rush you or anything... just REALLY looking forward to it :)</div></div><hr />
