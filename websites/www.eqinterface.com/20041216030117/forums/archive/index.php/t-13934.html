<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">TimerMod (http://www.timermod.com/) version 4.0 features a new type of timer with lots of customization options.<br />
<br />
You can choose from 28 different windows in the UI for your custom timers. Also, an exciting new feature is the ability to reconfigure your timers quickly and easily without having to re-enter all the information. Just use the link provided in your dynamically-generated file package to launch the configuration wizard with your existing settings already filled in.<br />
<br />
Timer Features<br />
 The marker can be set with a single click. Simply click on the location where you want the marker and it will automatically jump to the spot where you clicked.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Specify the name and duration for each timer to match the events you want to time. For easy identification, you can assign any spell/item icon in the game to each timer and choose from 12 colors for each timer bar.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Each timer's name and duration appears as a tooltip when you hover your mouse over the timer's icon.<br />
<br />
http://www.timermod.com/image/screenshot/tooltip.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
 To begin timing an event, just set the marker to the current position of the dot. The dot will continue moving and reach the marker's position again when exactly one duration of the timer has elapsed. As the dot approaches the marker, you will know that time's almost up.<br />
<br />
<br />
 For timing variable-duration events, tick marks on the timer bar make it easy to set the marker and see the amount of time left.<br />
<br />
<br />
 If you wish, you can add additional pages of timers so you can use different timer configurations for different situations.<br />
<br />
http://www.timermod.com/image/screenshot/tabs.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
 Include up to 8 timers in your configuration, or up to 12 timers divided between tabbed pages. You can configure up to 4 tabbed pages of timers.<br />
<br />
<br />
 The timer bar can be one of 13 different sizes. Choose a larger timer for better granularity or choose a smaller timer to conserve screen space.<br />
<br />
http://www.timermod.com/image/screenshot/large.jpg http://www.timermod.com/image/screenshot/small.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
 Customize the layout of your timers by specifying the number of columns and rows. The timers can be horizontal or vertical, and the icon can be placed on either end of the timer bar. If you wish, you can also specify the spacing between timers.<br />
<br />
http://www.timermod.com/image/screenshot/vertical.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
 For each timer, you can choose between two marker styles. A standard marker can be set by clicking anywhere on the bar, and is good for timing events that only have a single instance, such as abilities and some spells. A split marker contains two halves that are set independently of each other by clicking on the corresponding half of the bar. Split markers allow you to time two instances of the same event, for example, staggering costly buffs or mezzing a late add.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Choose from 4 different base skins for better integration with your existing UI.Visit the TimerMod home page at www.timermod.com (http://www.timermod.com/) for more information and to create your own custom timer configuration.</div></div><hr />

Script Error and I don't get any .xml files..... <br />
What browser are you using? Internet Explorer 6.0 is recommended, so please try it using that if possible. You must also have scripting enabled in order for the configuration wizard to work, because it uses JavaScript.<br />
<br />
I just tried it again myself and I was able to create and download a zip file just fine. According to the logs, many others have successfully downloaded files as well. In order for me to help you, please be more specific about what you are experiencing and what steps you took to reproduce it. Thanks.<br />
<br />
EDIT: This problem, which affects users of IE 5.0, has been fixed! If you had trouble downloading the timers with IE 5.0, please try again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been getting some reports of people not being able to download the timer, but the symptoms are not necessarily the same so it is hard for me to know if it is being caused by the same thing or all different things.<br />
<br />
Just to check for myself, I have tried it just now using IE 5.5 and IE 6.0, and on both WinME and WinXP. I was able to download the zip file just fine in all those cases, so at this point I would like to ask for your help.<br />
<br />
- If you can download the file successfully, I'd like to know.<br />
- If you're running into problems downloading, I'd like to know that too.<br />
<br />
In each case, if you could provide browser type/version and operating system, it would be much appreciated. I'd like to try to figure out how widespread this problem is and pinpoint the cause. Thanks.<br />
<br />
UPDATE<br />
I think the main issues have been resolved now, and most people should be able to create and download the zip file package successfully. If you are still experiencing a technical issue, please feel free to let me know by posting here, sending me a PM, or emailing me via the contact link at my site. Thanks to all who provided me with info, it was very helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moonnie</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">firefox 0.8 under windows works to.<br />

Will try linux tomorrow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks moonnie for trying it with browsers that I don't currently have installed. That helps a lot. And thanks to RSephiroth too for finding out that IE 5.0 doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Ok, so far we have the following:<br />
<br />
Works<br />
Internet Explorer 6.0<br />
Internet Explorer 5.5<br />
Internet Explorer 5.0<br />
Mozilla 1.6<br />
Firefox 0.8<br />
<br />
Doesn't Work<br />
----<br />
<br />
Not sure yet if the above will hold true for all users but if you are having trouble, please try it using one of the browsers listed in the &quot;Works&quot; section. Some of the problem reports have been rather bizarre so hopefully I can figure out what is going on and get the problem resolved soon.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I'm pleased to report that the problems have been resolved! I have added a fix for those using IE 5.0 and have verified the fix on an old laptop of mine, so I moved IE 5.0 to the &quot;Works&quot; section.<br />
<br />
The other problem concerning strange download behavior turned out to be caused by having a download manager installed. The solution for this is to simply press the ALT key as you click the download button (to temporarily disable the download manager). I have added a note with this information to the page.</div></div><hr />

I get message &quot;loading... please wait&quot; but then page<br />

At this point, do you get a little yellow &quot;warning&quot; triangle in the lower left-hand corner (in the status bar)? Or is it just the regular blue-and-white IE icon?<br />
<br />
EDIT: It sounds like it may be possible you don't have scripting enabled. In order for the configuration wizard to work, your browser must allow client-side JavaScript (this is usually enabled by default). To check if this is the case, go to Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Security. Then, for the Internet zone, make sure that Scripting &gt; Active scripting is enabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rebaidah</div><div class="date">06-06-2004, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no yellow triangle, and just checked security settings and scripting is enabled.

Hmm, that does sound strange. If you're on a slower connection (like dial-up), then the configuration wizard may take a while to load and you may need to wait longer (until it says &quot;Done&quot; in the status bar). If that's not the case and it does say &quot;Done&quot; in your status bar, then your best bet for now would be to try it on a different computer if possible. Hopefully it will work for you then.</div></div><hr />

For others who may be running into the same issue while downloading:<br />
It is likely that you have &quot;block mime-type integrated objects&quot; enabled, which is preventing the download from occurring. Quote from the the ZoneAlarm Pro online documentation: &quot;For downloads initiated by you, it is safe to disable the Block mime-type integrated objects feature.&quot; This option can be found under the Mobile Code Control section of your options.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Wanted to add: ZoneAlarm users who experience an issue with viewing the configuration wizard itself (instead of the actual download step) should make sure that &quot;Block JavaScript&quot; is not enabled in your settings (this option is disabled by default, so most ZoneAlarm users won't have this issue).</div></div><hr />

No, you don't have to download or install another browser as long as you have already configured and downloaded the zipped package.<br />
<br />
From the sound of things, you downloaded and unzipped the zip file (it should contain 4 files), and then double-clicked on the instructions file (HTML) to open it. Windows will try to open this file in your &quot;default&quot; browser. It is possible that Netscape was once set as your default browser but was then removed, that's why you get the error.<br />
<br />
You can open the instructions file in any browser you already have. To open the HTML instructions file in whatever browser you want, just open a new browser window, then drag the instructions file into the browser window to open it. Or you can select File &gt; Open from the browser menu and browse to the location where you saved the file.</div></div><hr />

Thanks! that was the trick for me to.  D/L one set last night, can't wait to play around with some more with the new features when I get a little more time.</div></div><hr />

I downloaded a trial version of this to see what could be causing the issue; it turns out that Norton was preventing the browser from sending a header that my site was expecting.<br />
<br />
I removed the check for this on my end, so now you can leave Norton Security enabled and still use the timer configuration wizard.<br />
<br />
Thanks also to all who have responded with encouraging comments, they are much appreciated. Hope you are enjoying the new timers. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starshelle</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arista thank you so much! I really love the work you've done with these new timers. I am however, very attached to the leafy background of one of your user submitted skins http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/skins.asp as it fits perfectly with my druid theme. I was just curious if there were any plans to incoperate some of those skins with your new design, or would that depend on your users submitting them like last time? <br />
<br />
I suspect it might be harder to add custom skins for these new ones because there are so many different customizations with the size and shape that you can do. The old ones were easier because the size and shape were pretty much set.  Anyway I was just curious if there were any plans for this at all. Thanks again for your awesome work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Starshelle <br />

<br />
I suspect it might be harder to add custom skins for these new ones because there are so many different customizations with the size and shape that you can do. The old ones were easier because the size and shape were pretty much set.<br />
Like before, alternative skins would have to be submitted by other users, and I would encourage anyone to do so. I might eventually add some additional skins of my own if I come up with any good ones. One issue with skinning the new timers is that the borders are very thin now (one of the goals of the design was to conserve as much space as possible), so there's a lot less room to work with than before.<br />
<br />
You're also right in that there would be some extra work involved in making a skin that would work with all the different sizes and shapes that the new timers can be. Most of it involves making sure that the design tiles seamlessly at the right intervals; also, both a horizontal and a vertical version of the skin must be provided. After I'm done with revamping and moving the old content to the new site, I'll put up a page with details on the requirements for making a skin that will work with all configurations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As some of you already know, in the upcoming July 8th patch, buffs will show their remaining duration when you hover your mouse over them in your buff window. This is indeed great news!<br />
<br />
Of course, this eliminates one of the uses for my timer, but it is one feature that I've always hoped they would add to the game client so I'm very glad they are finally putting it in. :) My timer UI mod is still useful for timing other things such as detrimental spells cast on mobs, buffs you cast on others but not yourself, recast/reuse time, spawns, etc.<br />
<br />
So, for those of you who are configuring timers, please keep in mind that after the July 8th patch, you will no longer need timers for buffs on yourself (unless you want a constant visual indication of when they are about to wear off without having to hover over the buff). For myself personally, this frees up a timer slot for me, allowing me to add an additional mez bar in its place for an alternate duration mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qinadwen</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With regards to the images in this new excellent timer mod - will it be possible to  use ones own images, instead of the default EQ ones? Like for instance to upload them and have them integrated in to the download? I know it sounds big, but I hope that with some programming it can be done :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With regards to the images in this new excellent timer mod - will it be possible to  use ones own images, instead of the default EQ ones?I'm not sure if I'm reading your question correctly, but if someone wants to use alternate spell/item icons (for example, T.King icons) instead of the default ones, this can already be done by simply placing the custom icon files in the same mod folder as the timer. The timer will automatically use the corresponding alternate icons.<br />
<br />
If a player wants to create a few of his/her own custom icons for the timer, this can currently be done by modifying one or more existing icon files and then placing those modified files in the same folder as the timer. Of course, any place those icons are shown in the game, you will see the modified version, so if the custom icons are intended for just the timer, it would be wise to choose icons that are not frequently seen (like obscure items).<br />
<br />
If there is a large demand for allowing timer-only custom icons (as opposed to custom spell/item icon sets that are used throughout the UI), I can add an option for the timer to use icons from a custom file. It would be up to the player to provide the custom file by placing it in the same mod folder as the timer.</div></div><hr />

However, since the file that you got has &quot;undefined&quot; in its name, it means that somehow the form data was not posted to the server properly (values are undefined); this is also the reason for the missing file. Once in a while I would see this in the log files but have so far been unable to reproduce this rare problem.<br />
<br />
The files in an &quot;undefined&quot; package are invalid so please delete them. If you have access to a different browser or different computer, please try it with one of those to see if that works for you. If that still doesn't work, feel free to send me your timer options and I can generate the files for you also.<br />

If possible, please also let me know what browser, operating system, and any other relevant info (ZoneAlarm running? Norton IS running? Download manager?), so that I can try to track down what causes this issue. Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

I've added this info regarding download managers to the note on the timer preview page.<br />
<br />
Another change to the site today is that the Find window has been removed from the list of options. This window is apparently not available in all zones, and can only be opened where there are valid targets for the &quot;find&quot; feature. Thanks to the person who brought this to my attention. For those of you who have downloaded a timer using the Find window, please choose another window (the &quot;Reconfigure Timers&quot; option will preserve all your other settings).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arista</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following changes were made to the TimerMod (http://www.timermod.com/) site today: The timers are now fully compatible with Omens of War. To determine if you need to download a new file package, see this thread (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15125) for more info on the timer patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Two new windows have been added as available options for the timer, bringing the total number up to 28. These new additions are the Task window and the Voice window, both of which require the Omens of War expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
 New item icons introduced in today's patch can now be used as timer icons.</div></div><hr />
