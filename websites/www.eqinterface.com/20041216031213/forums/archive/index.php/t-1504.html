<br />
I have spent most of the morning browsing these forums now, looking for a skin that I would find useful, as a Paladin. (when I should be working) :p <br />
<br />
The problem, as I am sure that most hybrids have realised now, is that they are all focused around Melee or Caster classes, and there have been very few that I have seen that will work for me.<br />
<br />
Do any Paladins out there have any suggestions on any Skins or combinations that would be good? I particularly like the minimalistic approach that most designers seem to have gone for, such as the combined Player stats/group stats with %ages, I also like the skins that show XP and AAXP in the same areas, as well as showing essential stats such as AC/ATK and Stamina. Obviously, no ned for an integrated pet display though.<br />
<br />
Enough of that though, Paladins, please post some screenshots or info on what you use, to give me a little direction. :D <br />

I saw a really cool Paladin looking mod, don't remember name, but it was sort of like white marble.  It wasn't specifically built for paly use, but looked cool.  I think it was caster made.  But that texture would be sweet for a Paly UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">budadank</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks very much Gallice! You can email the files to:  mailto:jackgarnham@btopenworld.com<br />
<br />
I am still fiddling around with it all, since I am new to the Skinnable UI stuff, I hope to learn some XML myself in the process <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DondorHolystorm</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the Vert UI mod<br />
<br />
I modified the Wis caster self box, to accomidate WIS AC ATK under the icons<br />
<br />
I changed the way the bags were handled having the first four show up, instead of the randomness he has in the basic layout.<br />
<br />
I changed the armor slots on the right side to better suit my right click items, to make it easier to just open a bag click earring, close bag.<br />
<br />
I used a no title chat box for all my chats.<br />
<br />
Nothing hard really, as I have never programmed in xml before.:D</div></div><hr />

I think the &quot;crusader&quot; spell book would be perfect for pallies :)</div></div><hr />
