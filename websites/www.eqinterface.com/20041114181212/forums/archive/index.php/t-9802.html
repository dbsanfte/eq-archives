* ANOTHER NOTE * If you're using SoesUI 1.5 it will most likely not work after the 08/26 patch, so I suggest you download 1.6 asap!<br />
<br />

Color Changing HP Bar Player Window<br />
These HP bars will fade from red to purple in a very smooth transition, special thanks to Enokhaon from Innoruuk for coding these bad boys! Target bar, Player window and Group Windows included. Check out Enokhaon's stuff (http://www.eqinterface.com/list.php?skinnerid=17746)!<br />

<br />
Installation Instructions<br />
You MUST follow these instructions, or the UI will not work. Once you have unzipped Soes16.zip to your &quot;uifiles&quot; folder, you must rename the UI_YourChar_YourServer.ini file to match your characters! For example my characters name is Soes and my server is Veeshan, so I rename it to UI_Soes_35.ini. Then you have to copy the renamed file to your base EverQuest directory. Here is a very clear picture! If you don't know your server number, find it here (http://www.eqinterface.com/forums/faq.php?faq=servernumbers#faq_servernumberlist)!<br />

I've tried to make this very clear... if you rename and copy the ini file as instructed all the windows will load in the proper place !</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) The spell bar is too low on the screen. It overlaps the compass and the secondary msg window. <br />
<br />
2) The buff icons are placed out of the screen. I can only see the text, not the icons themselves. <br />
<br />
3) Windowed mode stopped working for some reason... can't get outta it... *shrugs*<br />
<br />
So yeah... great UI... personally I liked the old spell bar better tho:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I deleted my soes folder.<br />
<br />
I installed a new copy of soes from my zip file.<br />
<br />
I renamed my old UI_Zilth_50.ini in my main eq folder.<br />
<br />
I renamed UI_YourChar_YourServer.ini to UI_Zilth_50.ini in the soes folder<br />
<br />
I copy and pasted the new UI_Zilth_50.ini from the soes folder to the main eq folder.<br />
<br />
I use the 1280x1024 display mode.<br />
<br />
None of the windows lined up. I had to readjust all of them.<br />
<br />
The bard song window is in the lower right hand of the screen and I can not move it. It also just shows the name of the song. No song icon shows up.<br />
<br />
The Pet / stats / clicks window is in the middle left hand side of the screen and I can not move it.<br />
<br />
So how about you do a clean test of your UI. Install it fresh with none of your previous adjustments and see how it turns out? Or how about changing the bard song window and the pet / sta / click window to just be moveable.<br />
<br />
I do not mind having to adjust all the windows. I would just like to be able to move them all. I would also like the icons for the bard song window to show up.<br />

Goto the folder, click on Folder: Options: View. Is &quot;Hide File Extensions for Known types&quot; checked? If it is, uncheck it and see if you renamed the file to UI_Zilth_50.ini.ini by mistake. Also make sure when you copy the renamed ini file from the Soes directory that it's not marked &quot;read-only&quot; (right click: Properties). Those are the only possible things I can think of.<br />
<br />
Can you tell me the full paths of the files you are renaming and copying? (ie. C:\program files\sony\everquest trilogy), just to be sure.<br />
<br />
Despite what you may think... I do test my UI's, on 3 different PC's with different hardware. In fact thousands of people are using SoesUI without any problems, so that leads me to believe that there must be something wrong on your end. Sorry :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soes</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">99% of the time when people have a problem with my UI or another UI that uses a custom INI file, it's because they did something wrong or have incorrect settings on their PC.<br />
<br />
Just for kicks, I downloaded some of the featured UIs on EQInterface and pretty much all of them (XymUI, AYAUI, Cairenn UI, all of Drakah's UIs etc) use CUSTOM INI FILES. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happens if I don't rename and copy the ini file correctly?&quot;<br />
The UI will still load, but none of the windows will be where the author originally designed them to be. Some windows like the Pet Window in SoesUI simply cannot be moved because of the way they are coded. The only way to have these UI's set up 100% in the originally designed way is to follow these instructions.<br />
<br />
Instruction Manual: How to Install a UI with a custom INI file<br />
<br />
Step 1:<br />
Make sure your folder settings are correct<br />
Open any windows folder and click on Tools: Folder Options<br />
http://www.abouttahirihinc.com/pic/soeshelp1.jpg<br />
Make sure that &quot;Hide File Extensions for Known File Types&quot; is not checked!<br />
http://www.abouttahirihinc.com/pic/soeshelp2.jpg<br />
I have had people not install my UI correctly because they had this option checked (it's checked by default when you install Windows), so what was happening is they were renaming the file correctly but they weren't able to see the extensions. So their files ended up being &quot;UI_Character_##.ini.ini&quot; and hence not working correctly.<br />
<br />
Step 2:<br />
Unzip and install your UI to the UIFILES sub-directory within your EverQuest Folder.<br />
http://www.abouttahirihinc.com/pic/soeshelp3.jpg<br />
The program I use is WinZip, you can get a free version from www.winzip.com. Make sure &quot;Use Folder Names&quot; is checked, this will automatically create the &quot;Soes&quot; subdirectory.<br />
<br />
Step 3:<br />
Browse to your EQ Directory and into the UiFiles/Soes sub-directory.<br />
http://www.abouttahirihinc.com/pic/soeshelp4.jpg<br />
<br />
Step 4:<br />
Locate the custom ini file &quot;UI_YourChar_YourServer.ini&quot; and rename it according to your char's name and server number.<br />
http://www.abouttahirihinc.com/pic/soeshelp5.jpg<br />
If your char name is Bob and you play on Veeshan, your file should be renamed to UI_Bob_35.ini ... if you don't know your server number find it here (http://www.eqinterface.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=FAQ&amp;file=index&amp;myfaq=yes&amp;id_cat=8&amp;categories=Server+Numbers).<br />
<br />
Step 5:<br />
Finally copy the file to your base EQ Directory.<br />
http://www.abouttahirihinc.com/pic/soes-install-help.jpg<br />
If you've ever played the char you are trying to setup the UI for, it WILL ask you to overwrite your existing ini file... if you don't get a box like this, you did something wrong (or deleted the existing file already). Select &quot;Yes&quot;.<br />
http://www.abouttahirihinc.com/pic/soeshelp6.jpg<br />
<br />
Step 6:<br />
Log into EQ, but make sure you are in one of the supported resolutions.<br />
For SoesUI you have to use either 1280x1024 resolution or 1024x768 resolution, no other resolutions are supported nor have been tested so if you use another one you're on your own. So goto Options before you log into EQ and check to make sure!<br />
http://www.abouttahirihinc.com/pic/soeshelp7.jpg<br />
Similarly, if you were installing another custom UI make sure you use the supported resolution(s) the author specified.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some people out. Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Installed OK and everything seems to be ok except for 1 problem :)  (yeap there is always 1 thing aint there).<br />
<br />
Very rarely when I click on the spell cast icon it suddenly stops working and I cant click on any of the 8 selected spells. RC doesnt work to remove them. I can still cast using Alt+Number and I can still use the mouse on all the other icons but casting is out until I either zone or log and come back. Tried it on 2 different characters on different servers and it has happened on both.<br />
<br />
This is the only problem I am having and it only happens with this UI so sorta confused. Never happened before I used 1.6 and the patch the other night.<br />
<br />
Any idea at all?</div></div><hr />

Make sure you dont have a folder in a folder, these warnings say it can't find any of these windows so it's using the default windows, didn't doa  complete check, but seems all the windows are loading default and none from your UI, which makes me think you have a folder inside a folder for the UI.<br />

The problem is quite clear, you unzipped the UI to a folder named &quot;soes16&quot;, when it should be in a folder named &quot;soes&quot;. The supplied ini file points to the &quot;soes&quot; folder, so obviously that won't work.</div></div><hr />

OK great UI (always use this one for my druid). Installed OK and everything seems to be ok except for 1 problem :)  (yeap there is always 1 thing aint there).<br />
<br />
Very rarely when I click on the spell cast icon it suddenly stops working and I cant click on any of the 8 selected spells. RC doesnt work to remove them. I can still cast using Alt+Number and I can still use the mouse on all the other icons but casting is out until I either zone or log and come back. Tried it on 2 different characters on different servers and it has happened on both.<br />
<br />
This is the only problem I am having and it only happens with this UI so sorta confused. Never happened before I used 1.6 and the patch the other night.<br />
<br />
Any idea at all?  <br />
<br />
Yea I figured that out.. it only happens in 1024x768 resolution. The Short Duration Buff Window is a few pixels too high and in that resolution it sometimes overlaps the Spell Cast Bar. I'm gonna fix it soon, in the mean time you can turn off the Short Duration Buff Window (ALT+E), or edit the .XML file and make the length shorter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Left them out on purpose, if you want to re-attach them you have to edit the XML files and change:<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;false&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;<br />
<br />
to <br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;true&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;</div></div><hr />

Sure.. Open EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml<br />
<br />
Search for:  &lt;!-- Click Page --&gt;<br />
<br />
That's where the click icons begin.</div></div><hr />

Use the supplied ini file.  <br />
<br />
<br />
That was your answer to my first question. The supplied ini file have been used and all windows are a match, except the spellbar and the buff window. They seem to be proportioned for the larger resolution. The spellbar extends down over the hotbuttons, while the buff icons extend beyond the screen, but are visible if I enchance the resolution to 1280x1068.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps: Do you per chance have a old style spellbar laying around (with a book icon), that can be used after the recent patch? I can't find one:(</div></div><hr />

3) Even if you don’t # the buffs can you just put a line were the end of the 15th buff should be maybe something cool I don’t know.</div></div><hr />

I dun seem to be able to make you people (;)) understand what is wrong:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And everything works fine for me, so I dunno what's up with everyone.  :D <br />

edit:  this is pre-LDoN of course.<br />
<br />
My one request for a future version is to have the name of the spells attached to the lefthand spell bar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PetrosDaroc</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, was just wondering if you were planning on doing yet another patch to fix the problems that have been incurred with the LDoN patch (the UI isn't working anymore, I plan on copying over any missing files from the default directory to my Soes directory later today).<br />
<br />
To the people who mentioned that the spellbar and the buff window are off the screen, here's what I did:<br />
<br />
1) Type &quot;/loadskin default 1&quot; (no quotation marks, of course -- this brings you back to the default UI, but the &quot;1&quot; keeps all windows in place)<br />
<br />
2) This makes unlocking and moving windows much easier since the title bar is back.  Right click the title bar on both your spellbar and buff window, unlock them, then move them towards the center, aligning the appropriate edge to the edge of your viewing area (i.e. the edge of your screen).  You can relock them if you wish, but you may want to wait.<br />
<br />
3) Type &quot;/loadskin soes 1&quot; (once again, no quotation marks and replace the word &quot;soes&quot; with whatever you have named your Soes UI directory.  In my case, the directory is named &quot;soes&quot; so I just tyep in /loadskin soes 1).  This will revert you back to Soes and your spellbar and buff window should now be viewable.  If the alignment isn't perfect yet (in other words, you're anal retentive like me and want the edges to be perfect), you can CAREFULLY right click in an unused area of the window (for the buff window, right click where the names of the buffs are or in that general area -- for the spellbar it's a bit more tricky, you have to right click in the area in between spell gems) and unlock the windows (provided you locked them back in step 2).  Click and drag the windows (the area to click and drag to move the windows is the same area where you were able to right-click the window and get the menu to appear) to where you want them and relock them (so you don't accidentally drag them away).<br />
<br />
I know step 3 looks long and drawn out, but it really isn't, just a lot of explanation which is common sense and a lot of it is in case you didn't get the windows properly aligned in step 2.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!  If it only makes you more confused, well then that's my fault for being so confusing. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
It still works, they changed the way .ini files work... Take the ini file from Soes16.zip and rename it to UI_YourChar_ServerName.ini, for example I'm on Veeshan so mine now looks like this:<br />
<br />
UI_Soes_veeshan.ini<br />
<br />
Before, the ini files used server numbers, now they simply use the server name.</div></div><hr />

The UI loads ok, but the arm slot still comes up rather than the shoulder slot I have defined, are there additional changes I must make to get this working correctly?  I am not too sure.  Thanks in advance for your help on this.  It is really appreciated.<br />

<br />
1) Can you plz make the little black box in your inventory the class animation? I think it would be a lot better then just a black box<br />
<br />
2) Make the window selector the same as the one you made for your Velious ui.<br />
<br />
3) make the spells have # under them so you know when you are full on buffs and need to kill one for hots. if you cant do this can you make a line or sothing under the 15th buff?</div></div><hr />

I'm not savvy at all at xml, but I was looking at the code and tried to replace the code from the pet-window EXP gauge but it (as you're probably already thinking) didn't work.  (It was worth a shot to someone who knows nothing of the code.)  So i simply restored it back and everything works fine.<br />

If its something relatively easy to do, and it isn't too much of a hassle, could you post something on here and let me know?  I love the UI, by the way, I'm an Animation/Design Major and believe me, i searched for a long time for a UI on here that had the right aesthetic feel.  (Or Maybe I'm just a big nerd)  In any case, thank you either way.  And if its not possible, dont worry, I just wanted to see if I could.  I can live without.<br />

I love the UI, by the way, I'm an Animation/Design Major and believe me, i searched for a long time for a UI on here that had the right aesthetic feel.  (Or Maybe I'm just a big nerd)  In any case, thank you either way.  And if its not possible, dont worry, I just wanted to see if I could.  I can live without.<br />

<br />
Easy.. open up EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml, search for:<br />
<br />
&lt;EQType&gt;5&lt;/EQType&gt; <br />
<br />
Change it to:<br />
<br />
&lt;EQType&gt;4&lt;/EQType&gt; <br />
<br />
That will change the AA bar to regular EXP, next you want to change the percentage, so search for:<br />
<br />
&lt;EQType&gt;27&lt;/EQType&gt; <br />
<br />
Change it to:<br />
<br />
&lt;EQType&gt;26&lt;/EQType&gt; <br />
<br />
Should work...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love this interface, especially with the addition of the alternate buff/song windows.<br />
<br />
I do have one request, though.  Is there any way you can make a short duration buff window that aligns on the right side of the screen that I could put directly under the regular buff window?  Basically, I'd like to see the numbers/icons on the right side of the window, with the name of the bard song on the left, if that's possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />

mmm, i had the same problem after patching it the first time.  Before the adventure stats were fixed.  Extracted the UI once again, added the new spells &amp; songs # display again and renamed the UI_mycharname_myserver.ini to my own.  Logged in &amp; worked just as before.<br />
<br />
Dunno if it was SOE's problem or Soes', but I doubt it was Soes' prob now.  Love Sony's new pet buff display, hate the fact that it will probalby change too many of the UI's out there.  <br />
<br />
Soes' have any ideas about what you may do?  Or just gonna ditch the pet window all together to allow display of it?</div></div><hr />

Luckily SoesUI 1.6 still worked with this patch, there was just a red XML error message, so here are the patched files to get rid of that error message, just unzip them to your Soes directory and overwrite the 2 files.<br />
<br />
I've also updated the main file (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1371), if you wanna re-install from scratch (I put in the new buff windows in the main file too).<br />
<br />
For now I've hidden the pet buffs display within the Pet Window, I may or may not rework the UI for it to fit someplace nice... but I am currently working on a fresh UI so we'll see...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have couple of questions/requests:<br />
<br />
1) I used Jaryn interface before switching to this one ( which is actually quite similar) and one feature I miss now that was in Jaryn's is a distinct difference between beneficial and detrimental buffs background colors there (blue vs. red). I don't know how it was done, it was not clear for me from just looking at the Buff Window XML file. I wonder if it would be possible to have some distinction between these 2 types of buffs in Soes UI, be it text color or some unobstructive background.<br />
<br />
2) New pet buff icons: is it posible to add them to main screen area, say below the player buffs or they hard codded to be a part of pet window by SOE? Are there buff labels for pet buffs as well?<br />

The reason I removed it is because it doesn't look good on the left-aligned bard song window, but an easy way to do it is to remove the CS_Buttons.bmp file from the Soes directory and then log in. This will put a small blue or red line on the right hand side of the buff.</div></div><hr />

I have modified some code in your XML file for Pet Info and now I have pet buffs with labels displayed on the main window, next to PC buffs. I'm not trying to impose on your own designs, but I can send you the code if you're interested.<br />

I am trying to propely align pet buffs and I'm confused about a piece of code in your EQUI_BuffWindow.xml file:<br />
<br />
	&lt;Button item=&quot;BW_Buff0_Button&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;Buff0&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt;<br />
		&lt;Text/&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;3&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;3&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;Size&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;38&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;28&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Size&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Checkbox&gt;false&lt;/Style_Checkbox&gt;<br />
		&lt;ButtonDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
			&lt;NormalDecal&gt;BuffIcons&lt;/NormalDecal&gt;<br />
		&lt;/ButtonDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
		&lt;DecalOffset&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/DecalOffset&gt;<br />
		&lt;DecalSize&gt;<br />
			&lt;CX&gt;28&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
			&lt;CY&gt;28&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
		&lt;/DecalSize&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Button&gt; <br />
<br />
<br />
Calling &lt;Location&gt;&lt;X&gt;3&lt;/X&gt;&lt;Y&gt;3&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/Location&gt; should put buff icon on the LEFT side of the buff window (and it does so in pet buff window), but it shows on the RIGHT side in the Buff Window. It looks like as if something overwriting this code somewhere /confused.<br />

You need to copy the EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml file from the default UI directory into your custom UI directory.<br />

Then make a copy of window_pieces06.tga and window_pieces07.tga from the default UI and rename them to something like original_windows_pieces06.tga etc.<br />

One is I did exactly what you told me to do regarding the .ini file, I had hide extentions disabled. I did the server number for berotouxx &quot;33&quot;. Loaded the UI and had the windows all out of order. I exit to check .ini file to make sure I had done it correcty, I had but i noticed something I had a file named UI_Perrin_bertox.ini NOT the code 33. So I changed the 33 to bertox the server I am on and everything ran smoothly. Why my files are in the accual name format instead of numbers for the servers I don't know but maybe it has something to do with what EQ I bought. In your 1.7 update PLEASE state that to change .ini to w/e it is in the folder, I.E. weither the existing .ini file is in name form like bertox or number form like 33. This well benifit many users. Also major problem that is not just me, my computer crashes when I hold the left click on the side edges of windows this really needs to be fixed. Please reply back thanks<br />
P.S I wish I could have just e-mailed you this instead of posting it here you might not get this, because you had e-mailing disabled.</div></div><hr />

However, in the text box in your SS of the UI, the font size is considerable smaller in the leftmost box.  Should it be like that when I install mine?  Or do I need to edit / configure something.<br />

The pictures of the gems are garbled but you can click there and they do cast, I wanted the yellow text off to the right of each spell.<br />

I also added this Spell gems: EtasiIcons.zip from the spell gem area.  In both instances I just let it overwrite your original files.  Can you tell me what I can do to fix the garbled up Spell gem slots?  Thanks<br />

<br />
You don't actually need the # of your server anymore.  Look in the EQ directory, you'll see files like UI_charactername_servername.ini<br />
<br />
Rename the one included to that, and overwrite it.</div></div><hr />

Love the UI, been using it since I started up EQ a little over a year ago.  I'm a 62 Necro on Luclin, and have found your UI the easiest, most managable set-up for necromancers (at least IMO)....<br />
<br />
Just checking on the Pet Buff Display/Window, if I missed out on it, etc.  If not, when should we look forward to this great modification to your UI?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been using your UI for some time now without incident.  Since the implementation of DX9, I've had a UIerror popping up resulting is EQ crashing to desktop.  After which I can no longer log in past the character select screen due to a &quot;client error.&quot;<br />
<br />
The error always being Error: Could not find child A_AttackIndicatorAnim in window PlayerWindow<br />
<br />
<br />
Replacing your UI_YourChar_YourServer file with the EQ default always fixes the problem, but then I have to use the default EQUI (not a good thing :( ).<br />
<br />
I know this issue has been addressed in the past (post #132 (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=66145#post66145)).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13278)<br />
<br />
See?  There is it is!<br />
<br />
The solution, as posted under the Problem:<br />
<br />
IF you have a custom EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml file, open using a text editor (Word, WordPerfect, NotePad, etc.) and using the Search or Find function:<br />
<br />
Find:<br />
<br />
&lt;Ui2DAnimation item = &quot;A_AttackIndicator&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;Cycle&gt;false&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
&lt;Frames&gt;<br />
&lt;Texture&gt;TargetBox.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
<br />
CHANGE:<br />
<br />
&lt;Texture&gt;TargetBox.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
<br />
TO:<br />
<br />
&lt;Texture&gt;AttackIndicator.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
<br />
However, there are now references to &quot;TargertBox.tga&quot; in any of the *.xml files.  There are target lines under &quot;EQUI_CompassWnd&quot; and &quot;EQUI_TargetWindow&quot;, but none reflect the above fix.<br />
<br />
I'm able to reinstall your UI and log in, but then unexpectedly crash, followed by inability to log in due to the client error :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

I considered the same thing when I replaced the tabbed pet/clicky box. An easy answer would be to replace the target box with one of the modified target/ToT/clicky versions, but I like the target window look with this one, so I do without.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The server numbers have been replaced with the approiate server name instead.  Check in your Everquest folder and look under the for your char's name and it will already list the correct info.  I usally choose to rename the current one, copy that name, delete it.  Then rename the new UI file to your char's one.</div></div><hr />

I too had this problem, especially for the smaller window.  I discovered if you press Alt-H (I think that's the correct key combo) and remove your hotbutton window, you can then right-click on the portion of the window in which you type text.  Then you can change the filters to however it suits you.  Then press Alt-H again and you're back to normal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
#2. I have a separate disipline window that i brought up. Is there any way to change the opacity of it so it will virtually dissapear like the Window Selector does?<br />
<br />
TYVM once again. I appreciate all the help...<br />

With a little bit of clicking around you can unlock the spell container and move it up a bit so that it clears the compass</div></div><hr />

Previously it flashed white/red when attack was on, but that's not working. Anyone else having this problem and know how to fix it?<br />
<br />
Also, is there something I can comment out so that I don't see the spell labels? I like it for my buffs, but not my songs/spells. Thanks! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, to make the attack indicator work, open: EQUI-PlayerWindow.xml and change line 12 from &lt;TextureInfo item = &quot;AttackIndicator.tga&quot;&gt; to &lt;TextureInfo item = &quot;TargetIndicator.tga&quot;&gt;. <br />
<br />
Change line 22 from: &lt;Texture&gt;AttackIndicator.tga&lt;/Texture&gt; to &lt;Texture&gt;TargetIndicator.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;.<br />
<br />
Save the file.<br />

Working on the labels for those who don't want them, like me. ;)</div></div><hr />

I do have a question I hope you can help me on. I use to be able to mouse over a buff and see how much time is left, and mouse over an inventory item and see what it's name is. That had just stopped working. I cannot figure out why. Any ideas or tips i can try anyone?<br />

I had been using a custom made one of my own toying for a bit now and LOVE the old style TKing spell icons.

You probably have &quot;Hide Known File Extensions&quot; checked in your windows folder options, check it off and make sure you didn't call the file UI_Username_Server.ini.ini (when Hide Known is checked, it hides the .ini part of the file name)</div></div><hr />

Edit: nevermind, appearantly logging out and logging back in was all it needed =P thanks for the great UI Soes!</div></div><hr />
