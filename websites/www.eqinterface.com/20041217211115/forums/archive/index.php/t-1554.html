<br />
I've been getting at least one a day, and there's never any message other than the subject line. I was just wondering, has anyone else has been recieving this pathetic attempt to infect them with a virus?</div></div><hr />

You're just too loved. :nana:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get about 20-30 emails like this a day...<br />
<br />
its the KLEZ virus.. and damn freakin sneaky.. the &quot;sender&quot; is never who sent it.. (as you can see) and the REAL sender has no idea he is sending a ton of mail... evertime it sends it out, it puts a differnet person as the sender...<br />
<br />
all i can say is... dont download attachements around 110-130k if you were not expecting them, and if you SCAN FOR VIRUSES... even yahoo now catches it..<br />
<br />
good luck..<br />

<br />
Where there's no way to tell for sure, sometimes you can narrow it down a bit. Look inside of the full headers. There should be a section from where the email was originally Recieved from.<br />
<br />
Emails like that are always sent from the person's home system, never from Yahoo, etc. So, it will always be an ISP's SMTP server.<br />
Next step is to look at the domain and see if you know anybody with that domain name for an email.<br />
<br />
It's not guarenteed, but it can narrow it down. I mean, if you see thunder3.gpcentre.net in the original Recieved header, it's me. No questions about that.<br />
(although it won't be me sending you the email. These virus exploits used are 99% Outlook made)<br />
<br />
PS: It also tells you the Email client used on the other side. (normally) ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crinos</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has been happening to a lot of people of late - there have been complaints from EQTraders, Monkly Business, and Allakhazam's that I have seen - that the Klez is using their names in the address fields.<br />
<br />
A caution is in order, to obviously never open an unasked for attachment - and even those asked for attachments should be scanned, many savvy computer users can still be virused and not know it. <br />
<br />
Knowledge is one virus that should always be spread, and hopefully it will infect those reading this and similar posts.<br />
