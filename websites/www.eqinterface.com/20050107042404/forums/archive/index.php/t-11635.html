Also, consdering that this board and website are privately owned and operated they can, and should, post and discuss anything they please.<br />
<br />
If I do not like the subject matter, then I will go elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Fortunatly the admins of these boards are much nicer than I.  I would have suspended anyones account that came on my board and started to tell me what to do.</div></div><hr />

We've already had to delete one post entirely and edit another for content.  Hopefully it'll stop there.</div></div><hr />

As Stated in the first post, I am a former Air Force Vetran, I had friends Die in 9/11 Pentagon attack and have lost friends in Desert Storm and even more recently in the search for Saddam. This is also a Global event that will forever change history. <br />
<br />
I posted this as a congrats to the men and women who died defending everyone's right to vote, think, and pray the way they want. The simpliest thing that people take forgranted is the freedoms they don't even realize are precious.<br />
<br />
I respect everyone's view of the war on terrorism and the war with Iraq. Please show respect for this site, and its owners. I have only twice in almost 18 months posted about real life issues. first was a blurb to the family and friends of those lost in 9/11 the second was this.<br />
<br />
If you find this offensive Athreal I will gladly refund any fees we have charged you, and you can find a new community to help support your UIs. <br />
<br />
Have a good day and may your travels in the world be safe, where ever they take you.<br />

It seems to me that these 2 last posts should have been removed by another admin too or is it only allowed to say &quot;good going america&quot;?<br />
<br />
I, myself, dont like any of the things going on in the middle east either, but it hardly seems fair that some posters get removed and others dont.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If his post has been simply &quot;I dont think war is right&quot; or something simple. then it would not have gotten editted.  what was removed was content that basically was there just to start an arguement, and get people flaming and ranting.<br />
<br />
You can say &quot;Go America&quot; or &quot;Go Israel&quot; or &quot;Go Cowboys&quot; and no one is going to remove it. None of those are saying &quot;XXXXXX is the best country because&quot; which would just start an arguement.<br />
<br />
I hope this makes it clearer why the Admin/Mods would remove part of a post.</div></div><hr />

Please do not start Flaming Others...</div></div><hr />

(sorry 1212)<br />

Good luck everyone. be safe<br />
