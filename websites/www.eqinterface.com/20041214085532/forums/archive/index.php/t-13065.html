<br />
Design Theory <br />
Include the most commonly needed information in as few windows as possible, leaving more horizontal space for a full-screen view. Elements should be easy to read and use. <br />
<br />
Features<br />
*General; horizonal windows to preserve space and make for easy stacking.<br />
*Target window indicates /consider color and integrates casting time meter. <br />
*Group window includes health for all party members, including self. Pet Health show in green. (Self-bar does not have a pet health meter. That's in the Pet Window.) <br />
*Pet Window is tabbed, making showing the pet buffs easy and still giving access to most common commands. Pet name field large enough for long warder names!<br />
*Hot Buttons Winodw includes 8 inventory (bag) slots as clickies. <br />
*Player Window displays Endurance, Mana, Exp and AA Exp. Also shows Stats, Combat Stats, Resists &amp; clicky slots for Primary, Secondary, Range and Ammo slots. <br />
<br />
Known Issues<br />
* Long buff or song names don't fit into the label space well. <br />
* Large (5 characters+) HP values look cramped.<br />
* Hot Button window has empty space along the bottom<br />

<br />
<br />
After playing with it i decided to make some own changes :)<br />
Used normal group window, added player bar in player window, made hp/maxhp bigger, added vertical hotbox window, removed exp/aaexp bar and used the % only.<br />
<br />
Very nice work btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sepherina</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off Lothay, thank you for such a wonderful UI. I have been using version 1 since a few day after you uploaded it.<br />
<br />
I looked at and tried version 2.0. It wasn't what I liked to use. But it did have a few new things version 1 didn't have. <br />
<br />
So now I am useing Lothay version 1.5. I am useing the Group window and player window from Vesion 2 with everything else from version 1. Since I use a different layout than you everything stacks pretty well, or well enough it doen's bother me. <br />
<br />
Bigeest strong points: The oversized group and target windows. And the my own life bar IN the group window. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for a wonderful UI</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't expect it to be all things to all people, but I'm glad that some folks are finding it useful. <br />
<br />
I'm thinking that I'll make different versions of the hot buttons and player window available as an option package.  I'll probably do the same thing with the spell casting window.  <br />
<br />
If I could just figure out the whole Alpha-channel thing (working on it, almost there), I might try my hand at some more grapich tweaks. <br />
<br />
I also use a different layout depending on which character and which computer I'm playing on.  The layout in the screen shot was at 1024 x 768 on a necro that mostly exisits to test the interface.  On my enchanter and paladin I usually play at 1280 x 1024 and have more room to lay things out. <br />
<br />
One of these days I'll get it perfect.  Until then, I'll keep posting versions as I work them out.</div></div><hr />
