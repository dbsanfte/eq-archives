<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about something a little less defined Arch.  I've attached a modification to your idea as a suggestion.<br />
<br />
Also here's an idea for an image source, do a search on google.com for images with icicle as your search... :) hope this tip helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tephrox</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The HP bar actually comes in three parts. There's the bar itself, then there is an overlay on top of that, which goes on top of the color bar (like the red bar for health). On the default, that's what makes the glass shine look like it's on top. Then there is a third bar which is the one that is overlayed on top of them all, for how much of a bubble if filled (the blue bar thing on exp).<br />
<br />
So for that, I would suggest having the back fill up, and then put the triangle shape over that, so that everything outside of the triangle has an alpha of white, so you won't see what's behind it (covers up the hp bar). Then, for the inside, put the texture there, but dim the alpha to probably 20%, depending on how much you want the texture to show up.<br />
<br />
As for having just the triangle fill up with color, and having the rest transparent... i'm not sure that can be done, because of the way the HP bar fills up. It's hard-coded, and can't even be changed to fill up vertically. So I have a feeling it just draws a box the height and width of whatever your bar is, and make a rectangle and fill that up. Something like that =P</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
i need help  on this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All TGA images used in the UI have a Alpha Channel that tells the UI what to show and what to mask out.<br />
<br />
To make it simple think of it as an outline, anything inside the outline will show, anything ouside will not.. (not going to go into shades of grey on this one)<br />
<br />
Sooooooo your HP bar has an outline on the ALPHA CHANNEL shaped just like the bar. If you want to change the bar's shape, you must change that outline too.<br />
<br />
using PSP or Photoshop you can open these files and see.<br />
<br />
hope that helps.<br />
