In all the mods I've seen, when the stamina bar is full, its at &quot;0%&quot;.  But I dont think like that, I'd need it to be 100%.  Anyone know the script on that?  I cant find the tag for ****.  Its just reversed. Bah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karsan</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that's a bug currently.  I don't know if xml supports calculations or not or you could just subtract the current value returned from 100... but I don't think XML is all that robust from what I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furinex</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just want the Percentage to go like everything else does, Health, Mana, and so on, there has to be a way to do this :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelric</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's just the way it shows, currently... I think their thinking was, if the bar is full, you're NOT fatigued at all (hence, 0%). But I agree, it would be easier all around if it was a direct percentage, not a reversed one.<br />
<br />
Watch it during a fight... the percentage will get larger! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Somebody pointed out to me that the Tool Tip over the Fatigue bar shows 100%.<br />
<br />
This makes me think - Yet another VI bug. Nothing much else I can think of and unfortunatly there isn't anything we can do about it. :(</div></div><hr />
