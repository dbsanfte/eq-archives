<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raspen</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the question has been raised by some whethere the mods made available to add to the story line are a violation of the EULA or not. The one's I'm referring to are the ones that allow you to open your story box in game and look at a list of spells by class or level, or the the ones that give specific information to a quest you might be working on. My personal thought is that these mods are OUTSTANDING and my hat is off to the creators of these mods. I use them, I love them, I've even made a few for personal use. Just wanted to check and see if anyone had any information on this. I don't think it's a violation but I'd like to be sure, just in case. Thanks in advance for the input.<br />

his official response was that these &quot;crib notes&quot; were not in violation of the EULA, as long as you do not prevent the storyline files SOE puts in from showing up. They had no proble with people using/making such files.<br />
<br />
You will find most tradeskill guides in our download section along with several others, such as epic list, and such.<br />
<br />
we would not host these if SOE ever told us they were in violation of the EULA.<br />

Does this mean, that I, for instance, cant make a batch file to delete all SoE storyline content?</div></div><hr />
