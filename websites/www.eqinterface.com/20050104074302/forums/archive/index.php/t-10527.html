<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firedrake</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I have no idea if this is possible, so I would like to know if it is, and if it is, could someone PLEASE create the mod for me? :P<br />
<br />
Ok, the idea is this.  I have a hotbutton window with my Pri and Sec slots attached at the top, and my inventory below it.<br />
<br />
I was curious if another 2 boxes could be added to it, which would be a drop down menus, which would give you the list of equipment slots (in picture form) and you can select the one that you want.  Once you have it selected, you would be able to use that box as you would the regular inventory and Pri/Sec boxes, letting you right click the items in it.<br />
<br />
I think I explained this really poorly, I've added an edited pic (in windows paint.exe, expect nothing spectactular :P) of what I think it should look like.  If it were to be clicked on the drop down arrow, it would display your entire equipment list as pictures (remember in pre-newui era, where clicking on inventory button displayed your inventory in a few rows?, like that).</div></div><hr />

Your idea, while nifty, isn't possible. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firedrake</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, so what if it wasnt a drop down menu, but it used a tabs like the action window does.  Each tab would contain a different inventory slot.<br />
<br />
If it got too crowded, only the most used clicky item slots could be put on it.<br />
<br />
Might that be do-able?</div></div><hr />

...snippity.. snip.. <br />

<br />
You already can make tabbed selections of spaces for inventory (usually done for clickies and/or bag slots), and many UI Mods already have them.  Vert, Solaria, Delta, etc. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure how many tabs you can add to a window, but it would be possible to do what you asked.  <br />

<br />
The tabs would be in the same area I guess that the drop down boxes would have been (see picture in original post).  Since it would get really crowded to add every single equipment slot, maybe just the 4 or 5 most used ones? (earring, other earring, mask, ring, ring2 or something ?).<br />
<br />
If someone could even just code it to have those 5 inventory slots, I think I could figure out how to modify it more specifically to be how I would want it, I just cant figure out how to start it from scratch...<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate the help. Thanks a lot!<br />

It gives full access to all inventory and equipment locations via 2 tabbed pages.<br />
<br />
The picture is what it looks like with the default UI.<br />

<br />
Ill try using this, and at least since it has the tabbed window in it already, if I still want to change it later I might be able to figure it out.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />
