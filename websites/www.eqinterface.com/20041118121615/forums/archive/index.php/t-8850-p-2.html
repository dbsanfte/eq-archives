<br />
This is AWESOME!!!!<br />
<br />
I do have a couple of questions though.<br />
<br />
I like to play with a viewport and in 1280X1024 reso, and I like my viewport on the top portion of the screen.  I like to have my UI on the bottom organized in a neat manner with nothing on the left and right sides, nor on top.<br />
<br />
Ber's was good for this, Drakah's etc with a lot of modifying.<br />
<br />
Was wondering if this would be possible without having a lot of dead space like there is currently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually Tinkfu, I think the UI's are entirely different.<br />
<br />
t.Kings are the definition of extremely graphical and the best looking images around.<br />
<br />
ACUI is more of the minimilistic approach, less graphical and more useable.  :)<br />
<br />
I don't foresee an 'overshadow' from that, no matter the release time people will use what they want. ;) <br />
<br />
As for LDoN, I doubt I'm going to get that expansion (Can't really afford it and I don't have a character over level 20 as well as hate to group so there is no point for me to have it.) so I won't hold off the release until then. :)</div></div><hr />

Elezibeth wants 1 pixel borders on spellgems. So I'd doing that. Unfortunately that's a complete reworking of 4 windows. 1 done so far (spellbook).<br />

This is a serious amount of changes (although the end result will barely look different).<br />

After reviewing your post I'm not entirely sure what you mean by your question?<br />
<br />
The design of this UI was to be run without the need of the viewport changing commands so I'm not entirely sure what you mean...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quantic</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh, ok, let me try and explain.<br />
<br />
I like the minimalist look, in fact I love it!  I like the backgrounds, the graphics, everything.<br />
<br />
What I mean about the viewport thing, is I like everything on the bottom working its way up.  I use my mouse extensively for a lot of things, spells, targeting, hotkeys, etc etc so I like all my stuff near the bottom center of the screen.<br />
<br />
I also like my spell buff icons, and casting gems there as well, that way i don't have to look around a lot because it is compact.<br />
<br />
This make a little more sense?</div></div><hr />

Given that description, I'd think the majority of the windows would fit nicely down at the bottom of your screen with the exception of the Spell casting bar which is a vertical window... :)</div></div><hr />

P.S. - I'll post a bunch of mods for this UI tomorrow, at the beta download page. Also, the horizontal container I posted in my last post is organized like this:<br />

Container Type X<br />
2 _ 4 _ 6 _ 8 _ 0<br />
1 _ 3 _ 5 _ 7 _ 9<br />
Combine Button<br />
<br />
It's like this because I wanted it to be organized as if the pack were tipped over on it's left. If there's interest I will release ones in the following set up:<br />
<br />
Container Type X<br />
1 _ 3 _ 5 _ 7 _ 9<br />
2 _ 4 _ 6 _ 8 _ 0<br />

Thanks Caidykat! I'll mod the bazaar search window to fix that. Although it isn't directly my fault, some of the changed graphics makes the Reset button look out of place.<br />

Mods for this UI are coming. I'm just lazy/busy. Moving to a different house (only 4 blocks away, renting sucks) and doing a Hate raid today.<br />

Also guys, just to let you know, I'm in the process of working up an official ACUI WebSite, just currently seeking out someplace that will host an InvisionBoard for me. :)<br />
<br />
I'll keep you guys informed as Release 1 (R1) Version 1.0(f) comes along!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elezibeth</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Guys!<br />
<br />
Lets get those final bug reports in as you find them, I want to get r1 in the box and out the door. :)<br />
<br />
So if you have an issue, let me know.<br />
<br />
Also, just so you know, r3's development plan is a bit different on my end.  There will be NO modification requests until the entire skin is final.  I don't want to distract away from the base development by coming up with Mods before final.<br />
<br />
I got my forums setup for the UI and am getting everything in place. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alehop</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
First of all, I must congratulate the autors on such a wonderful and excellent designed UI, I really like the style.<br />
<br />
I've been playing for a few hours with the beta4, and there are just two things that bother me. First one its the already mentioned &quot;small&quot; pixel to move the windows, specially if you running the ui at 1200x1024 like me, its just requieres some patience but its a bit annoying. The second problem, im not sure if its a design or self mistake. Im adding this image so you can see what I mean.<br />
<br />
http://alehop.homestead.com/files/acui1.JPG<br />
<br />
The chat window &quot;name&quot; it shows half cut to me, as you can see, I tried to make new windows and use shorter names, but I like having the spell/combat windows 0% transparent so the window name has a bad look there. Is there any way I can remove it?<br />
<br />
Once again, very nice work guys, keep it up . Looking forward to new relaease with the stats window, since its the only thing im missing to switch 100% fulltime on this ui :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaros</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haven't found anything new. Just the bazaar one, other than that it's all sweet.<br />
<br />
There was one thing though, you know the hotbutton bar itself, it's transparent. Not sure if it's supposed to be that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elezibeth</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Chat Window's Can be Rid of their titles bye selecting 'Rename' and replacing all text with a simple Space. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaros</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alehop, only way to get rid of that half cut off name is to rename the chat window. Just delete the name and hit the space bar once to make a blank name and that should fix it.<br />
<br />
Now about the moving windows. I admit I haven't tried it, since my windows are all where I want them already. But that was supposed to be fixed, so I'll take a look later.<br />
<br />
If it's still hard to move then really should be made easier, it's such a small thing but really annoying when you're on a raid and you need to make a new window for whatever reason and then you're trying to move it while there's all sorts of chaos going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alehop</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eep thanks, Im dumb :p , didn't notice that just with a space worked :)<br />
<br />
And yes moving windows its still a pain, but well no big deal when you are set.<br />
<br />
Now that im happy, im just going to suggest that the Target &amp; Group windows are maybe a tad to small. As you can see on pic im half blind so I have big fonts on main chats. <br />
Running at 1200 probably the fonts on those windows its maybe too small, specially on the target one where it made me have some targetting issues :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah, forgot I needed to make chat windows easier to move. I'll get right on that. I don't THINK I'll be able to make the player and compass windows much easier to move but I'll try a few things out. The hotbutton and selector windows should be easy to move. If they aren't let me know, I musta screwed up then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunis Marfury</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh... HB and selector aren't easy to move.... but frankly that just minor, we can live with it :)<br />
<br />
<br />
and for the chat windows, another solution is to edit the chatwindow.xml and put FALSE on the &quot;titlebar&quot; tag... :)<br />
<br />
otherwise the only other bug i've seen so far (since the first beta i tried... was it beta 1 or 2 ?) is the &quot;reset&quot; button on the bazaar window.... but, once again, that's not a great deal...<br />
<br />
but what could be really nice, would be a bigger target window...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways Only thing that gets to me is that evertime I zone or hit a button I have to hit alt H ;/ I can't seem to figure out how or if you can make a window permenant from being overlapped in the XML script ;/<br />
<br />
So to me which only leads to reorginzing the bar. Heres a few things i thought off that might help and give ideas.<br />
<br />
1. <br />
_________________________<br />
<br />
Selector | Hotbutton | Spell bar<br />
_________________________<br />
<br />
Firgureing thiers 8 buttons on the selector and 8 Gems this might help the symetry a bit, Plus would be nice close access to spell gems from hotbuttons.<br />
<br />
2.<br />
_________________________<br />
<br />
Selector | Hotbutton | Target Window<br />
_________________________<br />
<br />
Though i doubt it would have the same symetry but would be something to have as a fill in.<br />
<br />
Personally id like to have the first one, with spell, will prolly see how i can do on trying to make it.<br />
<br />
These are just ideas i came across ;)</div></div><hr />

Guess I'll keep my &quot;raid/group focused&quot; version of this UI to myself if I need a rubber stamp for every creative difference I may have.<br />
<br />
Either way... derred, could you send me a private message with the materials for your player window?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elezibeth</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, the only approval you need to mod this is to make sure that you give credit to the original UI, Enok, Myself and the other credits listed in the original readme.  <br />
<br />
If you want (or need, not sure how Mods are handled on the site for download) written permission, just PM or email me. :)  As long as it isn't an abomination shouldn't have any issues from me! :)<br />
<br />
I do ask that no one releases a full UI based on this, independent Mod elements for the core UI is fine but I do ask you don't try to reinvent the concept portrayed here, if you have an idea for it just let us know and we'll see about either official modding it or you can make the mod yourself. :)<br />
<br />
The only rubber stamp is for those who might want to see their Mod bundled in the official package. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand, I raid heavily and the ui works fine just the way it is in a raid setting. I think it all comes down to personal preference and maybe class as well. Most importantly this UI lets me raid without all sorts of needless crap in the way, which I think is most important.<br />

What I was hoping for a bigger cursor, there is a really great one in the UI called Vissage v2, but I have no idea how to extrack them as I know it is part of the animations and that is hard enough to find anything in there...anyways...any large but transparant-ish mouse pointers would be great...thanks...<br />

the uneven bar mod looks great and functions well.<br />
<br />
<br />
honestly I am not running ACUI anymore but I was for a while, right now I am running FU7 (which is currently internal, untill I can get sony to approve the new technology FU Inc. has developed).  The idea of FU7 is mastering your game with a superfast lightweight UI.  I can't say much more yet, but lets just say I run throught the bazaar with all luclin char models on, velious armor enabled with the clipplane at 100, and still get 55FPS.<br />

happy modding :-)</div></div><hr />

Can anyone give me some sort of list of things I still have to fix? I can't find the one I made and it'd REALLY help.<br />

<br />
I just thought that this would be a good time for one of the normally unspoken masses to speak up!<br />
<br />
This UI has great promise and I have really enjoyed using it for the past month or so.  I have been using it for high end raiding without any problem or the feeling that I was missing something that bulkier UIs have.  It is pleasing to look at and very simple.  It conveys the information that it needs to without drawing too much attention to itself, which leaves most of the eye's attention on the viewport.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the Beta releases so far, and I (among many rare posters, I am sure) look forward to future developments with this User Interface.</div></div><hr />

The offset/uneven bar looks nice and works well.  The chat windows are still a little hard to move about, but overall it's excellent.  I haven't had any problems running it at all.  I love the sense of space and low intrusion of this UI you have both done a great job on it.  Thanks</div></div><hr />

I like the flashy red around my target ;)<br />
<br />
Also the casting gauge is layered behind the target name, so can still read the name and see target health.<br />
<br />
All the windows are seperate and completely mobile.<br />

I changed the buffs to be the compton buffs (like it better)<br />
<br />
I also redid some of the graphics again, screenshot not updated...About all that is left of ACUI is the arrows, pointer and hotkey background...Most everything else is mix-n-match t.king and my own modifications.</div></div><hr />

Only issue was having to re-activate Hotkey using ctrl-h (or alt-h LOL.) That was corrected by using the uneven bar.<br />
I will be switching to this on my BST (play him more) and continue testing. Have had issues with him and the guild and group windows not updating properly, but I believe that is EQ and not the UI I am currently using with him.<br />
Thanks to Elezibeth for the concept and Enok for the coding :)</div></div><hr />

If you use the &quot;uneven bar&quot; that Enok posted the hotbutton problem does not exist. Yes, it is a different look but it looks good in the UI.<br />
<br />
Ran around in the world today with my BST using this UI (with the &quot;uneven bar&quot;) and had no issues. I noticed less lag then the previous UI I was using with him. All the windows I have tested are working on this UI. I have not tested the raid window. [2 exceptions that are probably not UI related, the Guild and group windows do not consistently update. Those problems continue for all of my characters and all of my wife's characters (two separate accounts on two computers with about 4 different UIs, including the default) and definately appears to be a bug and not a UI problem.]<br />
<br />
Based on what I have experienced with this UI, I would say that it is ready for release. I would recommend including the uneven bar as an option in the release candidate due to the remaining errors associated with the default hot button bar.</div></div><hr />

I believe he is correct in his assumption as I have had the same problem with the guild window not updating properly and not showing the names of who is on (seems like it shows the one or two most recent logged on or zoned members). I use a plethora of UI's and i have 3 computers and have run into this problem at one time or another using any combo.<br />
Anyways, the ui looks great and i must compliment those involved on their hard work :)</div></div><hr />

He says it's related to ACUI but in fact if you looked at a picture of his skin having no prior knowledge that he used graphics from ACUI then you probably wouldn't even see the relation.<br />
<br />
ACUI on the other hand has all sorts of weird coding to get the hotbar to work and whatever. Plus I think Elizibeth is busy IRL so hasn't had the time to work on it and give the green light to Enok that it's done.<br />
<br />
However, as I have been using it everyday for the last month or more, I can say that it's finished. There really is nothing left to do to it. If you can't stand the hotkey error, just use the uneven bar mod that Enok released and you're golden.</div></div><hr />

I guess it's done. Elezibeth, I'm sorta waiting on you for the final call and whatnot. The patch tuesday won't break this UI, but it may cause the XML Files Not Compatible message to show so I'm gonna wait 'til then in case I have to update the hotkey window (just so the message won't spam your chat box every time you zone).<br />

<br />
Had a few major problems that I'll give you detailed here and then a progress report.<br />
<br />
First off...my grandfather died. :(  I flew half way across the country back to my grandmother to help her get things in order, this was supposed to take a week but it turned out to be more.  I ended up helping her have an auction to get rid of all the extra crap in her house and also have now helped her setup to get moved out by me.<br />
<br />
The bad thing that happened is that my Powerbook's modem connector up and died on me one day into my trip, didn't have the time to take it into a service center but so it left me without Internet.<br />
<br />
Upon returning home I found out that my cat had managed to knock my iMac off my desk and that completely destroied the screen and arm so I ended up sending THAT in also to have it repaired.<br />
<br />
During that time my G5 showed up and thats what I'm writing on now.  I also picked up my iMac from the service center so I have my data again.<br />
<br />
Needless to say I didn't forget about you guys and I'll be back to working as soon as work permits! :)<br />
<br />
Good to be back guys!</div></div><hr />
