I came here to check and see if there was a new or updated Delta 3.1 or something.. because I really enjoy this ui its perfect for me still find it a tad big but enjoy it none the less anyway.. I checked all the forums and edited my EQUI_Animations.xml with the correct changes. The ui now works but I still getting a TON of errors.<br />

I notice in one of the forusm posted by the moderator about dragitems *.tga's but all I seee is pictures no real help in what im supose to do with those files.. and it seems that delta 3.0 only has a  custom EQUI_animations.xml. the rest of the files dont even exist in Delta 3.0. So then what? I tried to copy and paste the EQUI.xml and SIDL.xml into my delta 3.0 folder from default.<br />
and my ini's all contain the server name instead of the old ##'s we had int he file name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those are not errors... Those warnings are saying that the custom interface your using doesnt have a custom version of the file its looking for so its going to use the one in the default folder. <br />
<br />
That is a very good thing. Every one should get those warnings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aenoan</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">uhm....now  I am just confused....that made about as much sense as blind man trying to get his drivers license... err blind person haven't to be polictically correct. <br />
So how does that help me?<br />
How do I stop these warnings then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did I misunderstand you maybe? Your interface now works correctly, right? <br />
<br />
A long time ago you had to make a copy of the default folder and then unzip the files into that copied default folder. Now Sony has made it so you can put just the files that are needed for the custom interface (since most interfaces dont modify all the files) and it will automaticly load those files that are missing from the default folder. When it does that it will write the warning message but its not really a warning.<br />
<br />
Sony should rename it from warning to something else.<br />
<br />
The warnings are not bad... only errors are. I'm sure you will find that many other people can confirm this for you. All interfaces that do not modifie every peice of interface code will give you warnings in the uierrors.txt if installed correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aenoan</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I gotcha now. I was just concered because first time I Installed the ui I copied the defauly folder into a new folder then installed the custom skin. I only had 3 warnings dealing with my bags everytime I opened them. I thought the warnings where bad aswell I mean.. &quot;warning&quot; ... seems pretty clear its a BAD thing lol. Just like Error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sony really needs to change the name from Warning to something else because they are not really warnings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hammerofjustice</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">most likely im missing something obvious but i cant get this ui to work at all. Im not a ui pro, but ive tryed tons and modified a few for myself.  I unzipped to uifiles, have the one folder with the files in it along with the differant reso subfolders so all seems well there. when i load the ui i just get the default ui. any ideas??<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

But I checked my Uierror's text file and I am getting errors when I open my bag...<br />
