I may be dumber than the average EverQuest-er but I took an hour trying to figure out how to download and run Gimp.  Any other editors that I could download or an easier &quot;How To&quot; on installing and running Gimp?  Learning curve on that is just too high for me.</div></div><hr />

It is not user friendly.  PaintShoPro 8.0 (http://www.jasc.com/products/?) has a free trial version you can download and use for a while (30 days? 60 days? something like that).</div></div><hr />

But the GIMP has baffled me. I know it can handle Alpha channels, but for the life of me I can't figure out how to create them.<br />
<br />
If anyone else has used it, and can create an EQ UI image from scratch, including the alpha channel, I'd love some help with it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest, I'd suggest snagging the 30-day free trial of PaintShopPro, then if you decide you want to keep using it, the program is &gt;$100 US to purchase, from what I understand.  That's what I'd do, anyway. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For working with scanned or digital photographs, post processing 3D renderings, web graphics, vector and rasterized objects, .jpg's, .gif's and the kitchen sink, I strongly recommend Ulead Photoimpact. (USD $89.95)<br />

<br />
Jasc Paintshop(tm) Pro 8.0<br />
<br />
For the budget-minded digital artist, and those working extensively with .tga files -- that want Adobe Photoshops layers without breaking the bank, including ease-of-use at the slight expense of tool depth, then I recommend Jasc Paintshop Pro 8.0. (USD $79 download or $87 boxed)<br />
<br />
Get the trial here:<br />

<br />
<br />
The Gimp<br />
<br />
Not a bad paint program really, but not exactly user-friendly either, get it only if you think LInUx rul3z (a joke), and if you don't want or have a buck to spare, also it is suppose to get a new interface, this might help it a bit. (USD Free! for your continued interest regardless of its name)<br />
<br />

<br />
Adobe Photoshop CS<br />
<br />
For professional image editing devoid of budget-minded spending, and if Santa drives through your neighborhood in a Roles Royce Phantom with a 24k gold reindeer hood ornament, then I recommend Adobe Photoshop CS. (USD $649.00)<br />
<br />
Get the trial here:<br />

<br />
I used Ulead Photoimpact with my G2 icons, and all of my interface graphics as a post-render processing tool, Photoimpact is a very low-cost yet elegant image editing solution, it works with objects and implements selections instead of an alpha layer in .tga files, making it only slightly more difficult working with EQ's .tga files, but once you know the process it's a snap, there are trial versions for all of the mentioned software (above), so shop around and try before you buy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyste</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using PaintShopPro right now, I have been for awhile. But lately it's been acting up, and giving me problems saving Alpha channels... I'm ending up saving and re-saving the same file until it finally saves correctly, and it's a HUGE pain in the butt. I'm not sure if something changed in the way EQ sees Targa file formats or my copy of PSP is corrupted or what... but I was looking around for something new to install and The GIMP seemed like a decent enough solution. Just can't figure out how to create an alpha channel from scratch.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Oh well... off to reinstall PSP again and hope that fixes it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, making an alpha channel is simple, just select everything 'outside of the object' you want to be displayed (such as using a magic wand with a 0-22 similarity, then invert it so that only the object itself is selected, then save. (hope that made sense).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inokis</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In gimp, select contigious area tool.<br />
Select the area you want to add the alpha channel in.<br />
Right click on the image to bring up the toolbar.<br />
Select the image menu.<br />
Then alpha.<br />
Then create alpha channel.<br />
<br />
right click again.<br />
Go through to alpha only this time select alpha threshold and set it to 255.<br />
<br />
You can also paint over the area you desire with an opacity % of that which you desire, which will give you the partial transparency effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never had it suddenly change its saving behaviour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArcherPhate</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i chose PSP8 and liked it.<br />
THen i told my mom i wanted to buy it but she said &quot;NO!!!! Your Aunt has a full copy of it .&quot;<br />
<br />
 so i got the full version for free( my aunt payed the full price)<br />
<br />
i like it its nice, but its really hard to draw images with a mouse, says my brother, so i just have him draw them on paper and i scann them into comp and use PSP to do all the moveing around</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lordkylphor</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Usin PSP now..and have been for awhile.  Love the program.  Easy to use and pretty versatile considering the cost.<br />
<br />
The trial is 60 days..but as far as I can tell, the trial doesn't restrict any features...it's merely a time restriction.<br />
<br />
Been reading the posts a bit, and it seems that some ppl are having a lil trouble with alphas while saving in .tga<br />
<br />
I likewise am having the same issue.  Oddly enough, when the image is saved, the alpha...or rather, what the alpha should be... views as white in anything other than PSP itself.  Other's have said black.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Still an awesome program...definately worth the time to download it and give it a go.<br />
<br />
Don't laugh....but actually still use an old version of FLASH for some kinds of graphics.<br />
<br />
I also use Micrografx Simply 3D for some 3D objects and mostly for text rendering.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I found an editor today called Project Dogwaffle, from a mention of it on this board back in 2002.  Version 1.2 is the new free version, and it has a bunch of alpha-channel features (and even an alpha-channel toolbar) that make editing transparency rather easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keld</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone found a reliable solution to the PSP alpha layer problems yet?  I seem to be having the same issue.  I've played around with several UI mods and often have trouble getting graphics to show up.  Right now I'm working on a spell casting bar, I found one based on Thomus' work that is nearly perfect for what I need but the graphic used for the &quot;spellbook&quot; is a bit small since I run in 1280x1024 mode.  I added some new graphics the size I wanted to the existing .tga file and updated the alpha channel.  Now the window displays everything except the new graphics, it's like the new additions to the alpha channel were completely ignored.  I even tried deleting the alpha channel and resaving it....still no success.  If anyone's found a solution for the problem I'd sure love to hear what it is!!</div></div><hr />
