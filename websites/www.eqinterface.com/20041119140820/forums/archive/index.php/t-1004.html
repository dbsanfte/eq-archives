<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trewayn</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone else found that today's patch has led to some severe decreases in framerates with modified UIs?  I have a fairly heavily modified UI and during large fights the frame rate drops to one frame every one or two seconds which, unsurprisingly enough, isn't really acceptable.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having similar experiences?  And have you found any ways of increasing efficiency?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trewayn</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I think I have found the problem.  It's soemthing to do with Gendine's buff box.  For some reason it is a) not displaying the background buff info (red or blue etc) and b) lags the living hell out of me when it tries to display more than 5 buffs at a time.<br />
<br />
May have to remove the damned thing.</div></div><hr />

I don't use Geddine's buff box, but one similar to it which has a smaller footprint.  It also uses a red/blue color scheme for harmful/beneficial buffs.<br />
<br />
I've looked through the buff file but can't seem to find any reference to anything that changed today.  Will be interesting to find out if someone more expecienced at coding the UI finds any peculiarities.<br />

---Late addition edit---<br />
<br />
I ended up making my edits to new EQUI.xml file and using that and it worked.  Not sure what was added, but something was causing the lag.  Before my changes, doing /default was like turning off the lag switch.  It was that noticeable in places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trewayn</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What edits did you make?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apollyon</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only make 3 edits to EQUI.xml.  Two of the edits are commenting out the breath and casting guages (because they appear in my player info window bars instead), and the third edit is an include to EQUI_MyAnimations.xml.  The MyAnimations is a custom file where I do all my animations mods, so I can use the default Animations file every time its patched, and not have to mess with changing it.<br />

It didn't start immediately, I played awhile and then the frame rate just suddently crashed to near zero.  Turning off the compass (alt-D) fixed the problem immediately.<br />
<br />
I suspect the problem was that I didn't correctly add the changes from this patch to my EQUI_Animations file.  There's a TextureInfoItem for window_pieces04 and two Ui2DAnimation items: A_CompassStrip and A_CompassOverlay.</div></div><hr />
