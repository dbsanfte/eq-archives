<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dravenlee</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there anyway that someone could make a window that  text would be capable of being entered into, such as writing down a story or set of ideas, that when saved would be written as a text file and stored into the EQ folder for retrieval later?  I love to write, and would love to be able to be logged in and sitting atop the library in PoK just writing down stories and the such, as the the ambiance of the area and other areas enhance the writing process, especially if I need to do some research of the area that I am involving in the story.  Would need to be able to save and retrieve said text documents whenever I needed.  If anyone can help, it would be GREATLY appriciated in that I would be able to combine my love for EQ and my love for writing finally.  Thank you in advance for any and all help!</div></div><hr />

Don't edit any of the existing ones, but u can make your own entries and pull them up from inside the storyline window.  I do it all the time for quests and other tidbits of info i want to keep handy.</div></div><hr />
