I have tried to turn off then log on then off changed the targeting ring file in the UI skins folder. Is this problem due to the graghics card I have? I have the original card wich is a NVIDIA RIVA TNT2 Model 64/Model 64 Pro with a curent mode of 1024 x 768 (32 bit) (60Hz). Any help somone can give me on this issue would be appricated.<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
Copy the following two files from your default folder:<br />
TargetIndicator.ini<br />
TargetIndicator.tga<br />
<br />
and put them in your custom skin folder that you are using.  If you have already done this, then I have no clue as to why you can't see the targetting circle.<br />
<br />
I thought SOE said they were going to fix this copy problem in a patch but I have not heard anything else about it since.</div></div><hr />

I have the same GFX card and it is currently not supported by EQ - ie. no target ring for us untill SOE gets it fixed, they have told me that they are working on it.<br />
