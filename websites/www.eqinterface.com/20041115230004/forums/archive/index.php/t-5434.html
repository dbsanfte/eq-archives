<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keiz</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just finished my completely customizable Loc Window.  BIG THANKS to Athee for the original Loc Wizard Window!  I used that window all the time, and then when faced with the prospect of adding PoP locs I decided to automate the process and wrote my KeizLoc utility.<br />
<br />
You may customize this Loc Window by editting simple TXT files that contain the locs and comments displayed in each of the tabs (and then running them through my KeizLoc utility).<br />
<br />
You determine how many pages are in your window, what order they are in, and what content they contain.<br />
<br />
1. Find a typo?  Fix it!<br />
2. Not a Druid/Wizard and don't care about the Succor page?  Remove it!<br />
3. Want a detailed listing of tradeskills vendors?  Add it!<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
This window will work in any custom UI that does not already alter the Feedback window.  It is accessible in game by typing &quot;/feedback&quot; and contains a fully functional Feedback page.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/preview.php?id=903 <br />
<br />
Hope that you find this utility to be useful.  :) <br />

<br />
I downloaded this and extracted it to my custom UI directory - it did nothing....<br />
<br />
Theres no EQUI_Feedback.xml window or anything tho, do I need to find Athee's loc wizard to use this as well?<br />
<br />
Looked for a readme with instructions but couldn't find one.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keiz</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a pre-made EQUI_FeedbackWnd.xml file (the one in the screenshot) available here (http://sleinad.homestead.com/files/KeizUI/KeizUI.html), or you can always just run KeizLoc to generate one.<br />
<br />
Sorry that which file was the readme wasn't very obvious, but the keizloc.html file included in the ZIP contains all the instructions. :)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am tryign to figure out the format on a tab for like Tradeskill Recipes.  I keep on getting tons of overwriting everytime I try it diffrent ways.  Is it possible to do this if say I make a tab called Tinker Recipes with a text file of tinkerr.txt.   I did those steps and I am having problems getting it in a format that will work with your utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keiz</div><div class="date">01-11-2003, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first step would be to add the following line to TABS.TXT (doesn't matter where you add it, other than for your tab order in the window):<br />
<br />
Tinker Recipes___tinkerr.txt<br />
<br />
The trick is you need to seperate &quot;Tinker Recipes&quot; from &quot;tinkerr.txt&quot; with tabs, not spaces (nor underlines, as shown here).<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Next, you would set up your TINKERR.TXT file.  Here's an example of how you might set it up:<br />
<br />
[Ak'Anon]<br />
Merchant I_____100___100___Sells item1, item2, item3<br />
Merchant II____200___200___Sells item4<br />
Merchant III____300___300___Sells item5<br />
<br />
Again, the trick is to make sure you seperate the various items with tabs and not spaces (nor underlines, as shown here).<br />
<br />
Or, if all you wanted to do was state the recipes and not the locs of vendors...  You might try this:<br />
<br />
Tinkered I_______Item1 + Item2 + Item3 = Item4<br />
Tinkered II_______Item4 + Item5 + Item6 = Item7<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work (not sure offhand how that would end up looking), try...<br />
<br />
Tinkered I_______Unknown___Item1 + Item2 + Item3 = Item4<br />
Tinkered II_______Unknown___Item4 + Item5 + Item6 = Item7<br />
<br />
The &quot;Unknown&quot; will go in the two loc number slots and the recipe will appear in the LocComment section.  This brings up a good point, and for the next version I'll make the comments a bit more flexible.  For one thing, a way to put up comments without a loc given and without &quot;Unknown&quot; being displayed.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have one question / request tho ( there's always one... :) )<br />
<br />
Can you make it use the Help window, rather than Feedback? I'm using a modified SarsUI and it's already got locs in the Help window... so I'm used to that. Also, the Help window has a handy button on the top action bar that you can click...<br />
<br />
If not, I'll just figure out how to massage the code to fit into the Help window format. Just thouht maybe if you could make an option for which window to create, I wouldn't have to massage it every time I add locs.<br />
<br />
But all in all, REALLY nice work! Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keiz</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Curumtiny: I tell you what, let me know how you'd like it to display and I'll see if I can implement that for you.  Originally, I only intended to use this for locs but a tradeskill recipe tab sounds awfully useful.<br />
<br />
Fyste: Yes, in fact that was already on my TO-DO list for the next version. :) I would like to have it set up to work in a number of different windows, so you can choose whichever you want to use locs in.  I'll set it up for Help first...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JLBIV</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how can i make this a little smaller? i am on an older computer and have a 640x480 screen and this mod is a bit big btw I LOVE IT ! this is better then the help window ! i would also like to add my own pages to it but again run into my small screen size. is it posiable to make the tabs across 2 lines? I have many more questions, but will stiffle them for now. to cool, i am a keyboard short-cut person and /f to get these is awsome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keiz</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">JLBIV: I'm not sure if two rows of tabs is possible (be cool if it is!) but I'll definately add the ability to resize the window in the new version I'm workin' on. :) Was also planning to make all the text colors customizable, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curumtiny</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the bottum of the file cant you just change the 3 lines.<br />
<br />
  &lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt; <br />
  &lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt; <br />
   &lt;Style_Sizable&gt;false&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt; <br />
<br />
Change them to say:<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_VScroll&gt;true&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt; <br />
  &lt;Style_HScroll&gt;true&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt; <br />
   &lt;Style_Sizable&gt;true&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt; <br />
<br />
That should make that window resizable?  So he can do the changes now.  That giving you more time to work with your next release with all the cool add ons.  <br />
<br />
You can find those lines at the very end of the code of the window for feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could probably do it on your own.  As of right now it works best if you do it how I did it with Tinkering.  One regent or name or trival cost per line.<br />
<br />
What I think what would be nice for those that want to put tabs in for tradeskills is this.  Make it so we could use the comments for the long lines of the intire recipee.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
[Animated Bait]<br />
Trivial: 50<br />
Cost: 0.003<br />
\\ Cork, Spriket, Gnomish Bolts<br />
<br />
Right now the \\ comment only allows like 50 characters before it drops to next line and over rights what is under neath it.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this would work though Keiz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though I really like the customisable LOC window keiz has posted, I think this might help y'all a little more:<br />
<br />
http://www.frostwolf.net/EQTC/<br />
<br />
I take no credit for this, obviously, as I had nothing to do with the creation of it, but I've been using this system for quite some time now, and I'm loving it.<br />
<br />
Again, not trying to take away anything from keiz here, just trying to save people some work. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keiz</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ooooooh, hey I like that Tradeskills Companion!  I like it a lot!<br />
<br />
Looks like it will work in Pet, Help, Gems, Feedback, Friends, Bug or Target Window...  So I'll get KeizLoc to do the same in the next version.  That way you could set Locs to Feedback and Tradeskills to Help, or whatever other combo you like.  Neat.<br />
<br />
I'll also go ahead and lengthen the Comments field so Curumtiny's method will work.  :)</div></div><hr />

I'm glad to hear you're doing a version of this for the Help window since its where I currently have a zone-loc guide mod.  Yours is the superior Loc guide, and as soon as you have the &quot;Help&quot; form of this up, I'll be replacing the other guide.<br />

and 1 other question is is there a character limit per line.<br />
<br />
cuz i followed your instructions exactly , Tabs instead of spaces  with the exception of seperating words.<br />
<br />
and it breaks my UI, it loads default instaed of my custome UI.  <br />

What I'd recommend doing until Keiz makes a java script that will gen a EQUI_HelpWnd.xml file is to take the attached file, and save a copy of the file with all the Location data stripped out.  That way, if you need to change/add/modify any of the locations, you can make the changes to the pre-java text files, run Keiz's java script, then copy and paste the loc data from the generated EQUI_FeedbackWnd.xml file into the empty EQUI_HelpWnd.xml file.<br />

Thanks for discovering this bug!  Looks like I will need to mention that in the readme file for future versions of KeizLoc.  :)<br />

<br />
Version 2 of KeizLoc is complete and should be available for download soon.  Changes:<br />
<br />
1. now works in either the Feedback or the Help Window (still working on getting it to work in other windows).<br />
2. all colors are customizable.<br />
3. you can rename the window (change the titlebar text).<br />
4. you may choose to have your window be resizable, or to hardcode it at any size you like.  HScroll available to resizable windows and smaller-than-default windows.<br />
5. you don't have to have a Feedback or Help tab if you don't want it.<br />
6. much longer Comment field so Curumtiny's tradeskill recipe format will work.<br />
7. added a 2nd type of Comment, identical to the original Comment field except for color.  Bit more flexibility.<br />
<br />
And more features to come. :)</div></div><hr />

I checked the loc on the other side of the zone to see if the actual zone loc is used or the cave entrance loc, and it appears that the loc is the cave entrance in Tenebrous.<br />
<br />
That means the loc in Grimling at the cave entrance to Tenebrous should be: +1300, -885<br />
<br />
I have changed it myself for my version but figured you might want to change the official version.<br />
<br />
Great job!<br />

I've been using the /loc guide since Athee came out with it and I find it invaluable.  Of course I changed all the occurrences of the word &quot;succor&quot; to &quot;evac&quot; - coz wizards don't succor.  :)<br />
<br />
This will also make it easier to fix errors (for example, the Rockhopper Cave and the ME entrance and not at the exact same loc in Dawnshroud Peak).<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the work you've put into this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quick question- I saw a bit of tweaking a couple of users made to your original loc tool to help out and fix some bugs.  My question - Is the zip file still okay to download? or should we wait for another release.<br />
<br />
As you can see from my question, I am a noob when it comes to xml and I don't want to mess anything up...hehe<br />
<br />
Thanks Again.</div></div><hr />

I'll correct those locs for the ZIP file for KeizLoc3, thanks for pointing out the errors!  Anybody caught any others?<br />
<br />
Oh, and doey...  Feel free to download it right now.  You can make the few minor corrections yourself in the TXT files and then run those through the KeizLoc program.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keiz</div><div class="date">01-24-2003, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Changes in KeizLoc2:<br />
<br />
1. Now works in either the Feedback or the Help Window, but you don't have to have a Feedback or Help tab if you don't want it.  (KeizLoc3 will work in several more windows).<br />
<br />
2. All colors are customizable.<br />
<br />
3. You can rename the window (change the titlebar text).<br />
<br />
4. You may choose to have your window be resizable, or to hardcode it at any size you like. HScroll available to resizable windows and smaller-than-default windows.<br />
<br />
5. Much longer Comment field so your tradeskill recipe format will work.  Also added a 2nd type of Comment, identical to the other Comment field except for color. Bit more flexibility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am working on an Enchanter Spell tab, but when I load the skin in game, it only shows spells up to a certain amount... (Level 51-54 spells) Is there a max to the size of the Feedback.xml file?<br />
<br />
I love this Loc guide =)</div></div><hr />

Specifically, my loc mod won't load.  It says &quot;error loading loc/&quot;  Other cusom Ui's are loading fine but when i add on this &quot;feedback.xml&quot; it causes all custom UI to change to default.<br />

Any solutions would be appreciated. :cool:</div></div><hr />

As for a maximum size...  The very well could be.  But I haven't ever run into a problem like that.  Mind posting your spell TXT file as an attachment?  And what other tabs are you including?<br />
<br />
Jhade: not yet!  But there should be in KeizLoc3. ;)<br />

Doey: you are the first to have problems since the patch that I am aware of. :( Mind posting your UIErrors.txt and EQUI_FeedbackWnd.xml files as attachments?</div></div><hr />

another note-- loading my character into the game after the character selection screen takes an eternity! Do you think this my be because of the huge feedback.xml file?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keiz</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm...  Well, I ran into the same problem when I tried to run your TXT file through.  KeizLoc generates the XML, but EQ cuts off that page somewhere near the end.  So it seems there is indeed a maximum number of lines you can put on a page.<br />
<br />
It does not seem to care how many pages you have, however.  So I split your spell list into two pages: 1-49 spells and 50-65 spells, and everything worked just fine.<br />
<br />
Probably not what you had in mind, but it works...  I'll keep tweakin' things to see if I can get it to all fit on one page, and if I come up with a way I'll let you know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talon Razeil</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i too, am having failure loading the loc.  it doesn't load up for me either.  i don't see a equi_feedback file in my ui folder, so i don't know if that's the problem.  if you need me to follow suit, i'll post up my ui errors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keiz</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I see your problem.  Ykesha added an LFG Button to the Group window, and according to your UIERRORS that button is missing in your UI.<br />
<br />
If you are using KeizUI4, try downloading KeizUI4LoY.zip and unzipping that into your ui folder.  This should fix the problem.<br />
<br />
And you will definately need EQUI_FeedbackWnd.xml in your ui folder to use the Loc Window...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talon Razeil</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">will do.  <br />

My original plan was to release KeizLoc3 at the same time as KeizUI5.  But I've not yet had the chance to explore enough of Ykesha to get the locs for it. :/<br />

Once I do, or somebody posts the locs (or a ykesha.txt tab file!), I'll release KeizLoc3. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would love to be able to chage some of the windows to include things like spells and descriptions.<br />
<br />
I cannot work out how to change the column widths etc. I have a feeling that this is in the .jar file and is hardcoded.<br />
<br />
Anychance of releasing a version where we can change the field widths</div></div><hr />
