I, as a twitcher (necro) would love this. Some groups are hard for the healer to yell that he's LOM until he's actually out... meanwhile, I'm sitting there just guessing if he needs mana or not. I think that's just as important as being able to watch the tanks HP's. I can't even comprehend the amount of times the puller went out for another mob, missing the healers pleads to stop pulling. If the pullers could actually see how much mana the casters have, it would help alot, and would actually save ALOT of unneccesary deaths.</div></div><hr />

no peeking at my mana!! :D</div></div><hr />

Everything you don't absolutely need to know to show the game environm,ent properly from your side, is not sent to you to optimize network traffic..<br />
<br />
Hell, even your HP is not sent to you very often the display of your HP gauge is always 'laggy' :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xguix</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO, I think it wouldn't be a good idea to have the rest of your group see your mana.  All of a sudden things like &quot;You got 20% mana, that's not LoM, I'm gonna pull!&quot; from your tank.  Basically, people will start telling you how to play your class.  Not that it doesn't happen already, but why invite more?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dillomjm</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not? I dont understand why we need to be so secretive about our mana.  IF, as said above, people are afraid their tank will run off and pull when they are @ 20m, then maybe you need to find a tank thats not a moron.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those do not exist I tell ya!  :p   j/k<br />
<br />
In all seriousness, how would a tank like the status of his Taunt key to be visible to groupmates?  I bet they would often &quot;remind&quot; him to use it when it stays not clicked for more than a millisecond.  Basically it all comes down to people always having their own idea on how to play YOUR class, especially if they have information like your mana or status of abilities, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neiloch</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make that mod and you better give all casters the right to say &quot;shut the fck up you don't know what your talking about moron&quot; when people gripe about how much mana a caster has without any penalty. If they could restrict it to mages and necros some how (no way in hell i imagine) i'd be for it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grottel</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While characters have a sense of their own magical energies, there is nothing that allows one character to ascertain the magical energies of anyone else.  This would be especially silly for melee class to be able to discern the potential of a caster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why you ask?  Well without going into the nitty gritty of networking, lets just say that when you play your game, information is being sent to your computer constantly, information like a MOB's hit points, your group members hit points, and various other bits and pieces of information that allow you to play your game.  One piece of information thats not sent to your computer is other peoples mana information.  Until Verants decides to start sending that information out, there's nothing we can do to allow us to see it.<br />

<br />
Then I guess you should let that tanks hit points go down to 20% and say &quot;Bah! It's just a flesh wound! Walk it off ya big sissy!&quot;.</div></div><hr />
