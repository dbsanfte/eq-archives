<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2660<br />
<br />
without a hitch...right up through last night. Logged on today and ran toon from small bank in PoK to Nexus stone and client crashed....every time I tried to log him on...client crashes.<br />
<br />
Decided mebbe there was something about it needed to be patched. <br />
<br />
Had DL'ed - AYA UI Version 7.00 for Gates of Discord  <br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1881<br />
<br />
earlier and was going to use it for another toon, so decided to try it. Nothing but client crashes right after character select. Cant use any UI but default now. All the UIErrors files looked relatively normal... soandso.xml not found in directory soandso. Attempting to load default.<br />

Heres the last one logged:<br />

<br />
It doesnt sound like an interface problem, but I could be wrong. Your debug.txt that will list any hadware/driver failures I believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
been screwing around with xml files...and think my whole dern problem was a bad target ring.....what a kick in the head.<br />
<br />
Got the Drakah Legacy UI running again and am charged.<br />
<br />
Hopefully stays stable now. Well...the downtime gave me a chance to make a sig for this board ..heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats interesting that no errors were given for a target ring problem. Thanks for letting us know, now that will be one of the solutions I suggest when people have similar problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JezzeJamez</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well...I guess Im just assuming that was the problem, since when I tried Drakah's UI again, only mod I didnt use this time was targetting ring.<br />
<br />
The one I had been using was:<br />

perhaps just this ring was problem, gonna try a new one uploaded post 3-25 later tonight....will post if no problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kasiryn</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been having crash problems in PoK also, found out that alot of other people have been too. Seems like if you hit the backspace key that brings up the map window game crashes. I have heard several people say they have done the same thing and then had to delete the files in the EQ directory that had that toons name in the filename to be able to login. Just an FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raynor</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea whenever I open my map in PoK I crash and you have to delete the chars UI ini file to log that char back in. It only seems to be a problem with PoK it works fine in every other zone I have been to since patch besides PoK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Upgraded to 7 and crash every time I zone.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramsus</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue is known by SOE.<br />
<br />
Some maps appear to have have an invalid LABEL size set (1,2,3 are valid sizes).<br />
<br />
They have stated they have resolved the issue on test and it should go live soon (if it hasn't already).<br />
<br />
I would suggest deleting the PoK map you have in your maps directory and seeing if that resolves the issue.</div></div><hr />

We are looking into this issue, also. Not sure when we'll have a fix. <br />

This issue has been found and fixed. Will be patched to Test server in a little while.<br />
- Rowyl <br />
<br />

03-26-2004 04:08 PM <br />
The fix for this is on test server now.<br />
- Rowyl <br />
<br />
03-26-2004 05:49 PM <br />
The problem was that some of the labels has an invalid size on them (only 1-3 are valid). We fixed it so that it ignored the invalid size and uses the default in that case.<br />
