Here's a little thing I've been working on. Just unzip this file into your uifiles directory and /load fatreduction in game. It only has the essential files, but it works anyway. Lemme know what you think, I'm gonna try to complete the skin because this is how I want my windows to look, but if you folks want a copy of my UI then I'll hook you up as I progress it.<br />

I play at 1024 x 786 b/c I have a laptop that cries when I play EQ and I can't force it to run at a higher resolution. Anyway, ya, this probably isn't the best skin for all you 1024x768+ resolution types, the other stylish, more decorative skins are probably up your alley. This is just the basics.</div></div><hr />

I like having my target bar right above chat and the other two bars get in the way so i want it were i can locate the exp and aa exp anywhere seperate from anything else.</div></div><hr />

Currently having issues moving it around if I make the window transparent, lacking a title bar, and borders tho.... :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">09-22-2002, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This mod's pretty old, been a few changes to the interface since it was released.  haven't seen psychogears even post on the site lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tealen</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I updated EQUI_Animations.xml (contained in this mod) so you can use this with the latest patch...  I didn't get permission, but I also didn't put anything in this saying I did it, its basicly just a cut and paste of the modified parts of the original into the new one.  Enjoy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps.  This is only the animations file, it doesn't contain the rest of the mod.  If you don't go that, refer to the first post of this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madea</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.planetquake.com/bkp/neotic/fat2example.gif<br />
<br />
Here is my version the UI. I used Tealen's animation patch and psychogears original files. I moved the exp bars onto the player bar, changed their colors, added percentages to everything relevant, stacked the group window, put a percentage on the target bar, made the spell casting window invisible, and provided the chat window with a cast bar on it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barshemm</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made a revision of it also. Adding percentages and such. Still testing it but here are a couple screenshots. No zip file yet as I'm still playing with it making sure everything is right.<br />

<br />
cool all the same tho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zzorn</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any way to use this style of gauges with any other UI? I have a UI that I would like to put these bars into. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durnitol</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to recommend changing the stats display. It would be easier to read if the name of the stat was above the corresponding value.. e.g.:<br />
<br />
<br />
CHA DEX STR<br />
100 100 100<br />
<br />
and so forth. Having them side by side makes it more difficult to find the right stat quickly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WaBBiT</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What would it take to make a matching casting bar? And breath bar?<br />
<br />
Matching?  Yes, as in tranparent background window with a gradient bar.  No window or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gixxerryder</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cant wait to get the zip for your changes Barshemm , like the way you have everything set up..<br />
<br />
Also think it would be cool if the guages were released as independent mods..<br />

Thx for the good stuff     :nana: <br />

What files would I need?  I'm not much good at this skin stuff, so any help appriciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barshemm</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been lazy and just running the thing with a few bugs in. Doing a lot of programming at work, and just don't feel like coming home and messing with the xml. Once I fix a bug with the group window I'll release it.</div></div><hr />

Yesterday I fixed the group window bug I had, now I just gotta tweak to make it look nicer. I'll most likely be releasing a 1280x1024 release and a 1024x768 release soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just went through this post, I haven't played for 5 months thanks to the power supply of my computer exploding during a Hate Raid. Plus I've been very busy with work and school. Anyways, it looks like you guys really liked some of my stuff. I've since lost all the dev files for this project, so whatever is out on the net is all there is left. :( Feel free to take it, tear it down, build it back up, etc.<br />
<br />
I still don't like percentages.<br />
