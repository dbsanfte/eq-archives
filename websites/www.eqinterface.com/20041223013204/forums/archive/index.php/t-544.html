<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know anything about making UI skins and such but was wondering if someone could make something like this for me:<br />
<br />
Name<br />
Surname<br />
HP Bar         HP %<br />
Mana Bar     Mana %<br />
Pet HP Bar   Pet HP %<br />
Stamina bar<br />
Exp bar        Exp %<br />
AAxp bar      aaxp %<br />
<br />
And I'd like the bars to be one solid color. What I mean is, sometimes people put in like a background color and a foreground color(like the exp bar...orange=background,blue-foreground.) So I want a normal hp bar if possible ;) Thanks in advance if anyone could help me with this. All of them with the exceptions of the exp bars of course :p<br />
<br />
:nana: <br />
<br />
Also, if someone could do the same  kinda thing for group bars (solid color hp bar, with hp % off to the side. And maybe the bottom half of the bar be a pet hp for those who have pets). Was checking around and didn't see any but I probably missed them. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Will keep checking if someone already did something like that with the group bars.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot one thing. I'd also like my current/max hp added to the right of the name, OR at the bottom of the player info box. Or anywhere there would be fine hehe. Meanwhile I'm gonna keep trying to learn stuff about this :D<br />
<br />
EDIT2: Sry, was just wondering, is there anywhere I could go that has instructions or anything on how to make the changes I asked? Gonna try it myself but I don't want to screw anything up :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
