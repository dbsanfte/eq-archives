(old school FPS player). and I have noticed recently that when doing so I will bring up the right click context menu for a window that doesnt exist?<br />
If I feel around in the area, I am able to move this invisible window around.  It appears to be rather small like about a 1 x 1 inch window, and in the right click context there is no info to tell me what exactly this window is.  <br />
I use the same UI (custom / ecclectic UI) for all my characters, and so far all of them have this werid invisible window.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how I can determine what exactly is causing this.  Once I find out, I can of course mod the correct XML and get rid of it.<br />
<br />
Thanks, your insight and knowledge are appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many UIs chose to hide it like that...<br />
<br />
What I would do is: <br />
1) rename your EQUI_CastingWindow.xml temporarily.<br />
2) get a default EQUI_CastingWindow.xml file from default.<br />
3) Move the casting window to some corner of the screen.<br />
4) rename the original file back.<br />
<br />
That way you get rid of it from middle of screen :)<br />
<br />
Just something to try atleast...<br />

Other than that... I would say tell us which mod it is and we'll tell you what that window is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, in response..,... I dont belive it is the casting bar, because I am not using any mod for the casting bar.  I do appreciate the suggestion though.<br />
<br />
Fozzik,<br />
I had thought of this as well (but again thanks for the suggestion).  Both settings are at 100, so it should be visible.<br />
<br />
I am not getting any particular errors in the UI log that are beyond the norm.  Im not sure if anyone wants me to upload my UI here.<br />
The Files I have modded are:<br />
<br />
Bazaarsearch<br />
bigbank<br />
buff<br />
chat<br />
container<br />
hotbutton<br />
inventory<br />
mapview<br />
merchant<br />
player<br />
shortdurationbuff<br />
spellbook<br />
tracking<br />
<br />
Again, I do appreciate the input.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another suggestion (probably a silly one) would be to play around with your window selector. Open the selector window and see which buttons are pressed... see how it gells with what's on your screen. Might be a way to figure out what window it is. If it is at 100% alpha and still is invisible, it must be set with no boarder, no background, and transparent in the xml. If you can figure out which window it is, you could change that stuff and bring it into view. I take it from what you said that it is not resizable... that narrows the field somewhat... little clues like that might help. In the right-click menu, do you have options like a chatwindow (i.e. make new window, always chat here, etc)?<br />
<br />
I'm just throwing ideas out there... I'm interested to know what it is. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is possible that one of your existing customized files has an &quot;element&quot; outside it's viewing area that is actually &quot;showing up&quot; (via right click menu, as you said).<br />
<br />
Okay, that didn't make sense.  Let me try again.<br />
<br />
Say in your custom Player window, the author wanted to &quot;hide&quot; the mana bar.  Two ways of doing this.  One is to set the size to 0,0.  The other way (and the one I'm suggesting might be the problem in your case) is to put it &quot;off the screen&quot;, ie setting position to some ridiculous number (either positive or negative) that puts it &quot;outside&quot; the visible viewing area of the window.  It's possible that you are &quot;finding&quot; that &quot;invisible&quot; mana bar.  Did that make any more sense?<br />
<br />
So, how to deal with the problem, options:<br />
<br />
a) if what I describe turns out to be the problem, then you could go through, find the elements that are &quot;off the screen&quot; and pull them back onto screen, then size them down to 0,0;<br />
<br />
or:<br />
<br />
b) whether that's the problem or not, you always have the alternative of going into the Options window (Alt + O) and turning off the &quot;Allow Context Menus&quot;.  That turns off the right-click menu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firedrake</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what you're getting the menu for is your cursor item.<br />
<br />
When the new UI first came out, my cursor faded like everything else.  At one point I right clicked while moving the mouse and got the popup menu, where I changed it to be always visible, and it made my mouse always visible (yay, was annoying the other way).<br />
<br />
If when you select the alpha and its already 100%, try turning it to 0% and see if it makes your mouse disappear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lewzephyr</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks again all, I wont be able to take a look see untill this evening...

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To Cairenn's comments about the &quot;element&quot; outside the window.  I didn't think that was possible.  The only things that will show for a window are those elements located within the size block of that window.  (Or so I think!  I could be wrong.)  If possible, I would like to know how this is done because I am one who moves things outside of the window and if this is what it is doing, I want to stop.  (I think I set size to 0x0 also, but would like to know.) ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It &quot;shouldn't&quot; happen, but I've seen it do so.  That's why I always 0,0 stuff out, instead of moving it &quot;out&quot; of the window. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fozzik</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't know about the size=0,0 thing until recently... I've always put the elements I don't want outside the window and I've never had a problem. Maybe it depends on what elements we're talking about.<br />
Check out the player window in my mod... there is tons of stuff outside the window... and no extra clicky areas in-game (I checked just to be sure. hehe), The only way to click on the window or move it or whatever is within the border.</div></div><hr />

I agree with Firedrake. I'd bet dollars to doughnuts this is what's going on. I was gonna suggest (i.e. tell you what's happening) this, but Firedrake beat me to the punch. =D<br />
