<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Izzin</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried numerous times to reverse the direction of the spell buff icons filling in a Horizontal window to no avail.<br />
<br />
Is this even possible? I really would like them to fill from LEFT to RIGHT instead of backwards. <br />
<br />
Also, feature request we should submit to VI is the ability to reference a unique Spell Icon for each spell. I know they reuse alot of the same Icons for spells across classes. Unique Icons would allow us to add a graphic change to each to diferentiate one spell from another. WIthouth having to have the 16-20 character wide text at the end of a icon.<br />

<br />
In my mind this ability is now redundant and should be removed.  I'd say everyone puts there buff window where they want in the shape they want and it stays there unmoving.<br />
<br />
The fact that now we can make any window resizable and shiftable leads me to believe that this coding really isn't needed anymore.  Actual fact I think a post to Verant is needed.<br />
Bye for now :)</div></div><hr />

Geedi!! Go debugg your buff window ;) I stole your bitmaps to use for my &quot;Very small Very Tiny Text Only&quot; buff window. Redid all the code and found...a few problems :p  that is unless you've updated the code in the last few days...and what the hell is up with your webspace.....??<br />

<br />
Here is my reply to it :) <br />
<br />
The locations of buffs are hard-coded (don't think this was changed in the <br />
31st Patch but have yet to log on) so setting the buff locations to whatever <br />
you please it doesn't affect the running of the game. <br />
Descrepancies in sizes?  would you be able to point them out to me, although <br />
I may find them when I redo the window later today. The original buff window <br />
was finalised at like 3AM and it looked fine at the time :) <br />
What changes have you done to the window?  I think I have attachments <br />
disabled on my e-mail account. <br />
<br />
Further to this, I've left the coordinates of Buff0 and Buff1 the same so I'll be able to see when Verant allow us the ability to set the position.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I destroyed that other email program right after it did all that BS.<br />
<br />
When I redid the xml for what I wanted it to do having the same loc on 0 and 1 caused the window to resize the bmp within the window which meant the bmp didn't get shown. Of course it only did this when I zoned(actually one of the ppl that wanted the code told me about it while I was still playing with the UI stuff).<br />
<br />
Sizes on some of the labels were like 260, then 344(on most of them), and I think a 440 or something tossed in there too(don't have the code up right now and about to go to bed).<br />
<br />
What about the NoTitle in the Drawtemplate? I know in the buffwindow it's not that critical but switch those tags around in the other windows and it screws the look up somewhat..<br />
<br />
Hoping to roll out the UI myself and a friend are working on by next week. It's a little different and we're hoping it has a few nice items that will appeal to some ppl in it.<br />
<br />
Holler at me from time to time!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahhhh the text label sizes :)  Thats just my laziness there.  When it got to about 2AM I didn't feel like going through editting 15 slots which had no effect on the appearance.  And since it looked fine I never quite got back to going through and fixing it up :D <br />
<br />
Still stumped about the positioning though, I tried literally for hours to move those buffs with no success.  Just wondering if a patch was out there that changed it.  I did have this buff window completed about 2 weeks into going live on test server. (Well before the new spell gem came in anyways.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Granbel</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After spending about an hour messing with the buff window last night, I was able to reverse the direction of the text labels only.  The buff icons still fill in the normal direction. Hard coded: sure. Fix coming up in the next patch: hope so but doubtfull. Looking at the default buff window, looks like VI intended the buff window to have 5 rows of 3 icons which I can only assume is to give a reference point for wrapping icons in a smaller window or possible just a predefined template for when they actuall do implement client side modification.<br />
<br />
As I am new to the mod scene, I may be a little off base here. I'm sure someone will let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfran</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is they hard-coded the current buff window to work the same as the old buff window; one that you could resize in any way in-game and the buffs will fill the space provided (1x15, 2x8, 3X5, etc).  Could be either something they haven't got to so they made a default, hard-coded window for the beta test; or they intend it to remain that way.<br />
<br />
The game already provides only 15 slots to put buffs into.  Should be rather simple for Verant to keep the current functionality (in-game freedom of resizing) while providing freedom for developers to make the buff window as they wish.  Hopefully they do it.</div></div><hr />
