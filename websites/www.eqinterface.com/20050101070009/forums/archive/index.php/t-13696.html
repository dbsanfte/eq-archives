I downloaded the skin and followed the instructions to a &quot;T&quot;. The interface seems to load OK, except that, it doesn't seem to be the interface that was pictured in the screenshot. It looks to be the Razors Edge UI. I know the same athour did both Slayer v2.2 and Razor's Edge, so I guess my question is, has anyone else had this problem? I can see the Slayer v2.2 has been download 16K times, so I'm sure someone has to have something to say about this UI. Was this a mistake by the author or EQUI? I really like the look of Slayer v2.2, from what I had seen in the screenshot. Am i not however, all that thrilled about Razor's Edge? Can anyone help me correct the problem? Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I'm looking at both screenshots provided for Slayer and Razor's Edge.  In fact...here they are:<br />
<br />
<br />
SLAYER<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/p.php?id=1847 <br />
<br />
<br />
RAZOR'S EDGE<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/p.php?id=1846<br />
<br />
<br />
Now...both of them look almost exactly the same.  Razor's Edge looks like a melee version while Slayer is a caster/hybrid version.  <br />
<br />
Post a sceenshot of your problem and someone might be able to see where you or the author went wrong.</div></div><hr />
