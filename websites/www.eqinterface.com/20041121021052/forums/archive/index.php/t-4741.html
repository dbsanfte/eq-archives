<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stryhf</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used the search function, and browsed as much as possible, as well as checked the FAQ, and I can't seem to find a definitive answer to this.<br />
<br />
Is there a general run down on how Containers are configured?  I know the UI has certain hard coded limitations on how it resizes the actual window based upon the number of objects.  The size you define for the window and it's actual size are 2 separate values from what I've been able to determine.<br />
<br />
It appears you need to use Autostretch alter the Combine and Done locations if you want to remove the borders?  It appears to place the Combine/Done buttons based upon the final &quot;guessed&quot; sized of the container (whether it be 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 slot).<br />
<br />
What I want to know is what are the exact numbers?  I've been dissecting Remelio's Container mod, but the slots there appear to be hardcoded.  Is it the window draw template encoded within that allows it bypass the assumptions made by the UI?</div></div><hr />

Basically, some people want to arrange the inventory slots around the &quot;combine&quot; button in a circle.<br />
