<br />
<br />
* Important Info:<br />
When extracting the files from kaoriv4.zip, make sure you have 'Use folder names' checked and extract to your /uifiles/ folder.<br />
<br />
* How to change colors:<br />
In your /kaoriv4/alternate/ folder, you will find 3 different folders for each color. Open the folder that contains the color scheme you want and copy those files to your /kaoriv4/ folder (choose overwrite files if you are asked).<br />
<br />
* How to change class animations in your actions window:<br />
In your /kaoriv4/alternate/ folder, you will find 15 different files, all numbered and labeled for each class. Find your class and re-name the file to EQUI_ActionsWindow.xml (without the number and class name). Then copy the file to your /kaoriv4/ folder (choose overwrite files if you are asked).<br />
<br />
* How to change inventory slots of the extra tabs in your hotbuttons window:<br />
If you are using the hotbuttons window with extra tabs (see instructions in the next heading on how to get it), you can easily change the slots you want to use. Open the EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml file in wordpad or notepad and find the line &quot;&lt;!-- CAKE INJECTION POINT --&gt;&quot; (don't ask). For the next 20 pieces of code, you will see 'NewslotQ' where 'Q' is the slot number from 1 to 20. In each piece you will see &lt;EQType&gt;W&lt;/EQType&gt; where 'W' is an eqtype number from 1 to 29. Just change 'W' to the eqtype number of the slot that you want:<br />
1 is Left Ear<br />
2 is Head<br />
3 is Face<br />
4 is Right<br />
5 is Neck<br />
6 is Shoulders<br />
7 is Arms<br />
8 is Cloak<br />
9 is Left<br />
10 is Right Wrist<br />
11 is Range<br />
12 is Hands<br />
13 is Primary<br />
14 is Secondary<br />
15 is Left Finger<br />
16 is Right Finger<br />
17 is Chest<br />
18 is Legs<br />
19 is Feet<br />
20 is Waist<br />
21 is Ammo<br />
22 is Inventory slot 1<br />
23 is Inventory slot 2<br />
24 is Inventory slot 3<br />
25 is Inventory slot 4<br />
26 is Inventory slot 5<br />
27 is Inventory slot 6 <br />
28 is Inventory slot 7<br />
29 is Inventory slot 8<br />
<br />
The slots go in this order:<br />
Tab 1 ---- Tab 2<br />
1 6 ------ 11 16<br />
2 7 ------ 12 17<br />
3 8 ------ 13 18<br />
4 9 ------ 14 19<br />
5 10 ----- 15 20<br />
<br />
* Other extras in your /alternate/ folder:<br />
You will see a hotbutton window with extra tabs, a smaller compass window, and the textured target window from v3.0. If you want to use one of these files, rename the file to its proper name (by removing everything before EQUI_...) and copy the file into your /kaoriv4/ folder. There is also a tga file for your compass window that will display location signs (0, +, -), and if you want to use it, rename the file to window_pieces04.tga and copy it to your /kaoriv4/ folder.<br />
<br />
* Other notes:<br />
All windows in this UI are independent. That means that if you want to replace or delete one, you can do so without messing up any of the other windows. If you want to use a window from another UI, you should be able to, as long as it is compliant with the default UI (the one that came with the game). For example, you may want to use one of T.King's spellbooks or spell gem bars, or one of Arista's timers. T.Kings buff/gem icons also go nicely with this UI.<br />
The EQUI_Animations.xml file is extra long in this version, so be careful when you are editing it. Do not use a different T.King inventory window unless you are experienced with xml, because all the inventory's Ui2D animations are now located in the EQUI_Animations.xml file. I moved them so that if you do not want to use the Standard Stone inventory included with the UI, you can delete it and use a regular one.<br />
<br />
That about covers it. This post is subject to change.<br />
<br />
Have fun!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaori</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Regarding the buff window.  I too couldn't find it.  Its just not anywhere on screen.  I have the suspicion this is because i had it right up in the top right corner with the old UI (with buffs going down vertically) and on your screenshot i see the buff window is now horizontal.  Is it possible it has gone off screen? If so anyone know a way to reset it? (I was thinking wipe the correct line in the ini file but i dunno)  Which also brings me to part b) of this... i would prefer a vertical buff window to a horizontal one.  Can i just sub in the buff window from v3? Will save you some trouble :)<br />
<br />
Check out your UI_Yourname_XX.ini file.. find the buff window and make all the coords 0,0 and save.<br />
<br />
4) Bring back the arcane casting window :)  I really liked that.<br />
<br />

<br />
(c) could you make the font size for atk and ac a little larger/bolder/more noticable? (c is the most significant change really)<br />
<br />
I attached a file with the font size for atk and ac larger for the long compass bar. I wouldn't mind that myself actually.</div></div><hr />

i got a question everytime i try to change the inv it crashes ;/ like a bit smaller inv. also will this take tking icons ?<br />
<br />
 also anyway to make the spell names transperent again?<br />
<br />
  Comos  <br />
<br />
If you replace the Standard Stone inventory with another inventory that is compatible with the default UI (the one that came with the game) and is not another T.King inventory, it should work. What is making it crash? Check your uierrors.txt file in your /Everquest/ folder after you try to load EQ with the bad inventory.<br />
<br />
Attached is a mod for the spell gems window that does not have colored backgrounds.</div></div><hr />

Heyas :)<br />
<br />
I really like this mod, my only problem is that Im using 600x800 reso, and thus would like the buff window and the spell icon bar smaller (latter without the names next to them, as I already know what spells Ive memmed, duh :p)<br />
<br />
I downloaded this minibuff window thing (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=163) from marcin, and also tried another (buffwindow-2.zip from geddine) - but I can't get either to work with yours - I keep getting default skin if I try :(<br />
<br />
Ive followed the readme file to marcin, I assume he's using some files that you havent..<br />
<br />
Anyways..Im a complete idiot when it comes to these things, so my main reason with this post was to ask if you would mind releasing a complete set with smaller buffwindow (your current ones are good enough, they just take too much space of my already small screen :( )/ an alternate for the spell bar for us who knows what spells we got up (aka only spell symbol gems, no text)?)<br />
<br />
Either that or if some kind soul will help me getting the minibuff thing to work :/<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)  <br />
<br />
For both Marcin's and Geddine's buff windows, all you need to do is to extract is EQUI_BuffWindow.xml, ignore the other files.</div></div><hr />

i can't get your skin to work, the UIErrors-file is attached to this post.<br />
<br />
it seems as if this skin is an upgrade to some  skin, if it is, where can i get the base-package?  <br />
<br />
Thats really odd.. judging by the attached file, there was no problem except for the last line, which didn't have an explanation. When you extracted the zip file, did you have 'Use folder names' checked? (see pic at top of main post)</div></div><hr />

The 'blue' theme looked a bit too blue (too bright) so I decided to change the skin a bit. I changed most of the gold/brown pieces (like the gauges, window borders, etc.) to gray because it looked better, changed the scroll and title bars to a paler shade of blue, and darkened the background texture a bit. Also included in the .zip is t.king's Celtic inventory mod.<br />

One final note, this mod does not include any new .xml files, it only contains .tga's. In other words, it shouldn't screw up your window mods that are already installed in the mod directory.<br />

Basically added a visable combine button, made it big and added 4 customizable slots that fit at the top of each bag for quick swaping things. This one has primary, secondary, range and ammo as the swap spots, but if you go to the &lt;!-- CAKE INJECTION POINT&gt; each of the four EQTypes is the setting for each slot (use the same guide you did to do the hotbox).<br />

I picture it looking somewhat like Leiloo's mod just with the three equally sized buttons below peth health and percentage.

Not sure what else might be causing problems, I did notice the windows being moved yesterday though I didn't really play that long..  and I'm getting the message that my XML files are out of synch or whatever.. (I haven't applied the 1-17 fix yet) Haven't found anything that's really broke, except that when I use the T.King spell book any scrolls I open to read are messed up.. ;)  (not that that's an issue with KaoUI.. hehe)</div></div><hr />

The buff window is mine, and if you look in the downloads section, you will see where I already have the matching SD buff window.  The book window correction has been on Remelio's site forever.  t.king and Remelio have the inventory with the new charm slot just about ready to go.  As well, they already have the window_pieces04.tga file completed and ready for download.  Not trying to knock your attempts to help, just pointing out that you can save yourself a lot of work as you are basically duplicating stuff that has already been done.</div></div><hr />

If you simply want to have the charm slot added immediately, see my above post with a modified EQUI_Inventory.xml  ..

I'll try to fiddle with it tonight but it sounds like this is gonna be a real mess.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen Kaori on EQ in quite awhile.  /sigh<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With the addition of the new charm slot, I decided to change the inventory I use.  I was using an old inventory mod that was based on the old EQ inventory set up.<br />
<br />
I like the Drakah/Tking inventory found here:  http://www.tarmongaidon.com/download.php?op=viewdownload&amp;cid=5<br />
<br />
I want to implement this into my Kaori setup but when I unzip the files into my Kaori folder I get an error and sent to the default UI.  <br />
<br />
Drakah has a disclaimer on this inventory ...<br />
<br />
***This is a Window Separate File and is meant to be used without an EQUI_Animations.xml file. If you are placing this mod into an existing mod that has an EQUI_Animations.xml file, you may need to edit some or contact the author of your current mod.***<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  I'm guessing something needs to be edited in the Animations.xml file.  Any help or suggestions would be great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my post above I had attached a new inventory xml with the Charm slot added, but I added it next to the Ammo slot.. The only thing is that the background image wasn't changed, just the .xml..  If you want them both to match, it's best to get the new one off of Thomus' site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm using mostly Kaori's mod but I have a few modifications I made to his compass.xml and hotbutton.xml files. In addition, I'm also using a few different window pieces files since they show up better to me than what he originally used. I have a feeling there is a conflict with the new inventory files and one of the window pieces files (4 maybe?) but not sure.<br />

Anyone have any suggestions? Any help is appreciated.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, this isn't true. I've tried TKing's latest G2 inventory setup so the 5 new tkinventory.tga files are there. The problem is, when I try to use TKing's G2 EQUI_Inventory.xml file along with the TGAs, my UI crashes. Artyran's at least worked but it doesn't appear correctly. In fact, it appears that those new files aren't even being used as the inventory window still looks like the old style.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">02-23-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay folks ... I took the current version (kaoriv4[1].1) and fixed the animation file so that you should be able to use this mod with any inventory, including dropping in any new/different ones from t.king/remelio.<br />
<br />
I have not checked to make sure that it is compliant with all the other patch stuff, I JUST cleaned up the coding that was messing things up re the tube gauges/duplicate inventory info.  That's it, that's all.  I'm sorry guys and gals, but I have my own skin I'm trying to keep supported, not to mention all the other stuff I do here on the site, plus life other than this.  Add to that the fact that Kaori hasn't been seen on this board since last November 10th to provide any support ...<br />
<br />
Any way, it should now let you folks drop in other inventory windows.  Beyond that, I've no idea what is going to happen to this skin.<br />
<br />
*edit* Okay, someone has already dropped in this fix and reported back with where it leaves them.  You will have to <br />
update the Animations file using the information in the 4 Feb - UI Changes (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=32797#post32797) thread in the Patch Fixes Archive forum.  You also, apparently, need to also go back and add in the dragitem info listed in the Readme subforum of the Help forum, wrong item icons.</div></div><hr />

As in my last post, how would you edit the hotbutton XML file so that you dont have the extra hotbuttons? i know with kaori ver 4.0 she sent out a patch so that you could get the extra hotbuttons...but i want to get it back to the way the original file was. Also is i hear that you have to alter a .tga file to get the color back to the red from ver 4.0 from the default color of Blue with 4.1? any ideas?<br />

<br />
I downloaded and applied the 2-24 fix for Kaori's mod.  For what ever reason I have a couple of problems with it now.  I can not open the bank at all.  If I click on the banker my inventory pops open, but not bank window.  The new map feature does not work.  And last the Journal window does not work as well.  All 3 do the same, you click or use a hotkey to open them up and nothing happens.  Was wondering if anyone else ran into this yet, or if there is something that I have done wrong.<br />

Curious if there is any way I could change your files XML so that these dont conflict eachother.<br />

Also since I am a rogue, do you have a melee version of your Player Window (one with no mana bar)?  If you could post that, it would be great =)<br />

Thanks a ton for all your help!<br />

edit: these are the files I would like to add but have conflict with current files (same names)<br />

Hotbutton - Drakah/Tking (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1218) <br />
Inventory - Tking (http://home.comcast.net/~nlfalkowski/download/tkingG2Inventory1_Charmed.zip)<br />

edit: btw the reason I am changing the inven window is that the current one doesnt have a uniform charm slot... also I just like the hotkey button menu's hotslots better =) thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
window_pieces04<br />
<br />
file.  If I use your default &quot;window_pieces04&quot; file everything works fine.  But when I load up your alternate &quot;Compass With Location Signs window_pieces04&quot; (and I do rename it).. for some reason it causes the Map/Songs/Journel/Storyline/and Guild Manager icons in the Selector Window to disappear.  I am still able to click on them its just that the icons are not there, they are just blank spaces.  I am 100% sure it is this single change that causes that to happen.  Any ideas?  I would very much like to use the alt compass (the one with loc +/- indicators) over your default compass.  Thanks yet again for all your help! :D</div></div><hr />

Will post a picture of it later in the morning. Those who wish to use the veration that I have are quiet free to it. If I can figure out how to host it here rather then on a site that's not mine :)<br />

The only real problem people might have is with my inventory and spell book *blushes* I like to change those pictures for them monthly.<br />

Updated the interface. Took me awhile but figured out how to fix it. It was behind 2 patches in the dragitem changes.<br />

The line showed up for me when doing the Mistmore adventures. I'll keep an eye on it and see if I can find anything else wrong.</div></div><hr />

Second, i run this UI at 1600X1200 and it runs great but am a little curious if it is possible to get a higher res version of this UI so it will still appear as it would when running the game reso at 1600X1200...even though i might have a actual lower resolution in game? Appreciate any advice as i am not very handy with XML. Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />

I've read the entire thread and tried to do some of the finding of updated tking inventory stuff and I'm clearly not getting something right. I have downloaded Kaori v4.5.1 and created a new directory and my inventory still doesn't have a charm slot. <br />
<br />
Am I missing a step extra that I am supposed to do or can that fix be put in the full download?<br />
<br />
Thanks to all who keep this great UI alive!</div></div><hr />

Second, my thanks to Dolby for making a mistake in the latest patch to the Kaori UI because if not for this silly little annoyance I would not have gotten up the willingness to finally wade through all that code and figure it out! Its amazing what a little obsession mixed with some &quot;I want it how I want it dammit!&quot; can motivate you to finish something.<br />

Love the UI, (of course or I wouldn't be here!). I've read the entire thread and tried to do some of the finding of updated tking inventory stuff and I'm clearly not getting something right. I have downloaded Kaori v4.5.1 and created a new directory and my inventory still doesn't have a charm slot. <br />
<br />
Am I missing a step extra that I am supposed to do or can that fix be put in the full download?<br />
<br />
Thanks to all who keep this great UI alive!  <br />
<br />
I have a charm slot... dont know why you dont. You can see my charm slot in the picture for this interface.</div></div><hr />

First off, my grand thanks to Dolby for trying to support a UI that is not his own. Second, my thanks to Dolby for making a mistake in the latest patch to the Kaori UI because if not for this silly little annoyance I would not have gotten up the willingness to finally wade through all that code and figure it out! Its amazing what a little obsession mixed with some &quot;I want it how I want it dammit!&quot; can motivate you to finish something.<br />

Hmmm pritty sure I fixed these.. didnt test them but I made the code changes. Maybe they were 2 patches behind?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the base EQUI_ActionsWindow.xml (the pally) functioned as in it had a Find button but the graphic that you used was:<br />
<br />
 &lt;ButtonDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
  &lt;Normal&gt;A_BtnNormal&lt;/Normal&gt; <br />
  &lt;Pressed&gt;A_BtnPressed&lt;/Pressed&gt; <br />
  &lt;Flyby&gt;A_BtnFlyby&lt;/Flyby&gt; <br />
  &lt;Disabled&gt;A_BtnDisabled&lt;/Disabled&gt; <br />
  &lt;PressedFlyby&gt;A_BtnPressedFlyby&lt;/PressedFlyby&gt; <br />
  &lt;/ButtonDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
and should have been:<br />
<br />
 &lt;ButtonDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
  &lt;Normal&gt;A_SquareBtnNormal&lt;/Normal&gt; <br />
  &lt;Pressed&gt;A_SquareBtnPressed&lt;/Pressed&gt; <br />
  &lt;Flyby&gt;A_SquareBtnFlyby&lt;/Flyby&gt; <br />
  &lt;Disabled&gt;A_SquareBtnDisabled&lt;/Disabled&gt; <br />
  &lt;PressedFlyby&gt;A_SquareBtnPressedFlyby&lt;/PressedFlyby&gt; <br />
  &lt;/ButtonDrawTemplate&gt;<br />
  &lt;/Button&gt;<br />
<br />
in order for it to match the rest of the buttons in the bank. <br />
<br />
The rest of the class specific files in the Alternate folder didn't function at all (the area for the Find button was completely blank). I didn't dig far enough to figure out why. I figure it was a cut and paste prob missing something. I just fixed em.<br />
<br />
As for the charm slot, you're right there is a charm slot. I was not accurate in my description of the &quot;problem&quot;. Yes the charm slot exists and functions. Its just not &quot;pretty enough&quot; for those of us who get hung up on tiny black lines and other imperfections.<br />
<br />
I really meant no disrespect to you at all in my prior posts and hope that you didn't take it as such. I think you're awesome. Without having updated the mod this far along, I'd be nowhere near where I am in my learning process.</div></div><hr />

For anyone else that wants either the functionality of a different inventory window or wants to use the TKing G2 inventories here is what you need.<br />

Here is a link to the zip file that has the update to the stone inventory which comes packaged with Kaori's UI: http://home.comcast.net/~nlfalkowski/download/tking_StoneInv_v2.zip<br />
<br />
And here is where you can get some of the others:<br />
http://pub165.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=218.topic<br />
though I am sure they are available on eqinterface as well.<br />

<br />
been using this UI since it was first released and never found one that i liked more, thx to all that kept it alive after Kaori first work.<br />
Allways used a diferent spell cast bar, first the SK one and lately the TKing Briar, however I rearranged my resolution and disposition of the windows yesterday, and the one that fits better now is the one that comes with Kaori.<br />
Theres a couple  things about it that i would like to change though, and would be very thankful if someone could explain to me how or point me to the right thread.<br />
1) include a button/animation to open the spell book;<br />
2) I have 2 bars for the cast duration, one in the spell bar itself and the normal one at the top. Would like to remove one of them;<br />
3) spell bar doesnt have the save/delete/load spell set function implemented a while ago, which is very useful.<br />
<br />
I've messed with the files a couple of times but mostly for cut and paste work and my xml knowledge is limited.<br />
<br />
Thx in advance!<br />

Delete your custom interface a folder, download it again and install becuase I get no errors and the compass shows the LDON blue line for me.</div></div><hr />

Here's the deal.  This assumes you know the basics of how to open up and edit an ini file.  <br />
<br />
1.	Make sure you're logged out of EQ.<br />
<br />
2.	Open up your UI_Charname_Servername.ini file.<br />
<br />
3.	Use the search function to find Popdialog.<br />
<br />
4.	The first entry you find should be [PopDialog0]<br />
<br />
5.	Delete this entire section of the file. (For those that don't know, an ini file has a number of sections, each of which begins with a &quot;heading&quot; line that has a word encased in square brackets... for example [PopDialog0]<br />
<br />
6.	To clarify, put your cursor at the beginning of the line you found using the search function, and delete all the text up to but NOT including the next section heading.<br />
<br />
7.	Use the search function again to find and delete all sections that have a section heading similar to [PopDialog0].<br />
<br />
8.	Overall, you'll find and delete a section for [PopDialog0], [PopDiaglog1], [PopDialog2], etc.   How many you find will vary.  Make sure you delete all of them.<br />
<br />
9.	Save and exit this file, and then you should have working confirmation boxes in EQ.</div></div><hr />
