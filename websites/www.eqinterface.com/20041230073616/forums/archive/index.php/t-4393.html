<br />
Oh, and EQInterface is moved too.. (hehehehe)<br />
<br />
But I am glad to say that it appears that all the glitches with the move have worked themselves out, and that all the DNS entries moved over without too much headache.<br />
<br />
Let me say thank you again for your patiences. <br />
<br />
My email box is full right now, and I am filtering through them as I can. If you email me over the last 5 days (since thurs) please be patient. If you needed something that was fixed, I most likely will not reply. If you needed something else, and have not heard from me by this weekend.. sat/sun send me a PM and remind me what it was and I will make sure I didnt miss it.<br />
<br />
Happy Mod'ing!<br />
