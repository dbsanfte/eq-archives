<br />
I downloaded the new Celtic pet window that has Rev3 for the 10/09/03 patch. It now has nifty a tab for pet buff window.<br />
 Only problem I'm having now is, tabs are at the top, making it difficult to use with the Celtic spellbar, where pet window use to nest neatly below the spellbar :(<br />
Unless I'm using them together incorrectly.<br />
Not sure how easy it would be to move tabs to a different spot, but was hoping someone would perhaps be able to?<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

That is the biggest reason, I hated the way they implemted showing pet buffs. To place it where I want it, I would have to practically create an entire new ui for it, just to move the buffs out to a seperate window like the rest of the buffs.  But that wipes out the idea of modular pieces /throws tantrum :mad: <br />
<br />
I had thought about making a verions with the buffs just below it, but it would change the size of the window.  Tabs, unless I am mistaken, can only go at the top.  I would love to have them on the side.<br />
<br />
If you are interested, I can make a version with the buffs on the bottom or a side, but which side everyone uses these mods differently?<br />
