The issue is with some UI that have not had their graphics done perfectly.  This is an excerpt from another post but I feel this is important and needs to be given to everyone.<br />

Here is some of the text that is important to see:<br />
Well it is not exactly related to the gauge issue. But it is similar. It appear that if your background graphics and the size of the window for the Graphics are not the same size then you have a problem. I will explain.<br />
<br />
The hotkeys graphic in my case (ChronRight) is 158,275. The hotbutton window was originally defined as 160,280. This leaves space at the right edge and the bottom of the window. As a result when I try to line up what looks like the bottom of the window with the bottom of the screen you end up with an actual 5 pixel over lap at the bottom. As a result Sony has made things so that if the are off the edge of the screen the are repoped somewhere. I have gone through and reset all the graphics for my ChronRight to be the right size and this should fix the problem for that. If you are using Quartz from Statix I would assume that he will be coming out with a fix but if not I will take a look at his files and see if I can fix them for you. Am doing some final testing of ChronRight right now but as soon as it is done it will get posted to the Download section.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps some.<br />

This will be the case with anyone that has used graphics that were not exactly the same size as the window they are being used with and they are on the edge or inadvertantly over the edge because of unseen parts of the window.</div></div><hr />
