I need a good graphic editor. I was also wondering if you worked on windowpieces as well. I am looking for Gold trimmed or Silver trimmed on all the window pieces. ):) You can reach me at this E-mail address. (Ferg6244@bellsouth.net)</div></div><hr />

If you could make the same inventory with charm slot i would ask you post it for me here ;). i really love the way you made it. It looks sharp. I know the celtic inventory is out on t.king web site. i have already downloaded the invetory with the charm slot in it. <br />

King then you can expect where the charm slot will be. :) <br />
