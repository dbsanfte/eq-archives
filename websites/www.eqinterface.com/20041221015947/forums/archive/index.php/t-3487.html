<br />
1) Not connected to the internet<br />
2) Internet Explorer is set to work off-line<br />
<br />
To fix:<br />
<br />
1) Connect to the internet :D <br />
2) Open IE, Click on File, make sure &quot;Work Offline&quot; is unchecked<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or you may have some form of spy/add ware stuck to your machine...try using ad-aware to kill it http://www.lavasoft.us</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baidieneriy</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried the IE working offline thing.....was unchecked =/<br />
<br />
<br />
and this Ad-Ware thing....i ran the diagnostic......after that what do i check to remove?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well anything adaware detects you will want to delete (just put a check mark in the box next to the detected items). Adaware detects spyware applications witch you dont want on your computer. Its possible a spyware app is reporting back useing a port that the EQ patcher uses. <br />
<br />
did you install any firewall software (McAffee installs a firewall on default install)? If you are using winXP did you enable winXP's built in firewall software? Did you install a router (routers act as firewalls)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baidieneriy</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm....ill try that ad-ware thing<br />
<br />
I use WINXP, how do i do the firewall set-up?<br />
I use McAfee........<br />
And I have a Lynsys Router for cable internet...<br />
<br />
gah i wish i were computer literate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kweil</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dang, sorry it didn't work.  <br />
<br />
What is getting me is the &quot;no internet connection found&quot; message.  Can you get to other sites?  (don't know where you are posting from)<br />
<br />
If you have access to the new files you could bypass the patcher using EQWindows.  Granted its a violation of the EULA but an addict  has to do what an addict has to do.<br />
<br />
And no, I won't tell you where to get the program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baidieneriy</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, when i run said program i get to char select where it promptly disconnects me..........im thinkin about just uninstalling EQ and re-installin it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know where to get the program, and it does a little bit more than just giving you the option of bypassing the patcher:rolleyes: <br />

<br />
Just be forewarned though, that Ad-Aware disables Kazaa as a spyware does linger within Kazaa and you cannot run Kazaa without it. Evil evil Kazaa<br />
<br />
If your on a router, your router might be the issue as sometimes you have to set it. I had to with mine because I kept getting disconnected from EQ as I played for a short while. Did a little tweaking and 'BAM' no more problems..<br />

Hmm....where do i find this &quot;BAM&quot; setting, and what do i do to change it? <br />
<br />
The following is only for those who are operating on Linksys Routers (Dont flame... I haven't had any problems with mine, so I'm going to stick with it. :D  )<br />
<br />
Type in your password and when the setup screen pops up click on your &quot;Advance&quot; tab on top..<br />
<br />
Then Click on &quot;Forwarding&quot;<br />
<br />
In that window click on the &quot;Port Triggering&quot;<br />
<br />
Then type in what I have in my screen shot of the &quot;Port Triggering&quot;... this will prevent you from being dropped while playing the game... then save... Hope it helps!<br />
