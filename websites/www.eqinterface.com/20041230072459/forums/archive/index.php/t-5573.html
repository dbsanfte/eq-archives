<br />
This weekend a close and dear real life friend who was one of the three founding members of the Guild I was leader of passed away. <br />
<br />
Ken Jones AKA Gnar Manaman(and his alt Elmor Phudd) was found in his apt on monday apparently having died from complications from a seizure, sometime on Sat or Sunday.<br />
<br />
Ken and I met in EQ, and became real life friends talk on the phone for hours (he was East Coast, I am West Coast). We have been friends for over 2 years now<br />
<br />
Ken,my room-mate, and I started our guild almost 2 years ago, and Ken left leadership and the guild for personal reason, leaving I and my room-mate to run the guild. We disbanded the guild in July 2002 feeling it was best to end on a good name. We have since both gone on to do other things. But we have kept in contact with him. He became the Guild Leader for Leder'av'ere on Zebuxoruk (co-leader as I understand it) and to them I send out my condolences.<br />
<br />
Ken was seperated from his wife, she did not understand the EQ Life style and he left the game twice to try and save his marriage. In the end his marriage did not end due to EQ, but something else and he came back to EQ when they split. To his wife I offer my heart felt sorrow.<br />
<br />
Ken was a good man, and always did right by the newbies. I would see him sitting in Rivervale or Freeport buffing newbies for no other reason than to see how excited they got. <br />
<br />
Ken, you will be missed.. May you find peace and happiness where ever you are, and may you remember us fondly when you look down on us. Rest easy brother, for we are still guarding the gates.<br />
<br />
with all my love<br />
- Kudane</div></div><hr />

I'm soo sorry at the loss of your friend. nothing like getting the day going with a good cry. i never met him but he sounds like a sweetheart. no i don't refer to him in the past tence because he is still a dear man whether he draws breath or no longer needs to. <br />
I only hope that my simple words somehow bring you comfort.<br />

When I heard the news of his passing last night I was at a loss for words. I did not know Gnar as well as some did but I do remember him always willing to come to the help of others no mater what he was doing. To do a Rez / Buff or just to sit in OT and watch out over a bunch of n00bs.<br />
<br />
We all have heard of others passing on that played the game but when you hear of someone passing that you knew ingame and in IRL it feels different.<br />
<br />
My heart goes out to the friends and family of Ken Jones aka ‘Gnar’. You will be missed but never forgotten<br />

I do not play on your server, being a Xevian, but I think this illistrates a point not many people outside of EQ get. That although this is a &quot;Video Game&quot; it can also be a place for the good people of this world touch each others hearts and minds and real world friendships can spring forth. He sounds like a good man, and I am sorry for your loss.</div></div><hr />

He showed me what playing the game was all about. He would always make me smile by saying Hi Luv.. I am co-owner of the Guild Leder av ere and He is very missed by all of us we are going to stick it out and make this guild work to the end. He was standing by me when i told him that I was going to step down and join a uber guild so he said he would help me and he did but then I decided what the hell I will stay and help the Guild grow and He told me anything I wanted to do do cause He is My Friend thru the Thick and Thin. I talked to him Everyday on the phone and he made me laugh cry and laugh again cause he treated me like I was his little sister and that made me feel great.<br />
<br />
Ken this is you. My Brother My Friend My Leader and My Luv you will always be in our hearts and Ledere av ere will always miss you and hope you look down on me and everyone esle and save our tails like always We Love you so much God be with you forever</div></div><hr />

Man we lost Gnar...  I could try to inject some humor... /shout Anyone able to Cust-Support Rez Gnar donating all my plat!!! but no matter how much plat or how many GMs come along Ken is gone<br />
<br />
Being one of the Founders of ToH and CoF on Zeb server it hit me hard when I heard the truth of the loss when you called me.  My mother-in-law (Risso) has an alt in Led guild, and when she told me she lost her Co-Guild leader I didn't know who it was, but another player... it saddened me then, but it didn't sink in.  When you said it was Gnar I almost cried... Gnarly was like a brother, or as close as someone could be that I haven't seen in about a month<br />
<br />
In Memory of Ken (Gnar) I'm going to have a GM reset my Surname to something appropriate to mourn him properly<br />
<br />
I will be at the Fishing Village in N-Ro, even if I am KOS</div></div><hr />

Wanted to let everyone in EQ land know that Ken's RL family saw the thread and are greatful for the prayers, condolences and kind words.<br />
<br />
We don't know much about the EQ world (I registered this account just to reply), but the comments in the thread tell us that this was a big part of Ken's world, and that he had a good EQ family... THANKS.<br />
<br />
We had a service yesterday afternoon with the Youth Group in Ken's church, and then had a celebration with over 300 in attendance... RL family, friends and coworkers.  We raised a glass in Ken's memory.  We had good food, good memories and lots of love, and the centerpiece of the celebration was a powerpoint presentation with over 300 pictures of family and friends from his short 36 years.<br />
<br />
Thank you all from Ken's RL mom, 2 brothers, sister, 2 neices, 3 nephews, 3 great-nephews, 1 great-niece, 2 uncles, 3 aunts, 1 great uncle, and dozen of cousins.<br />
<br />
Gone but never forgotten.<br />
