Forry made a great interface but it seems in his last version he stated it would be his last revision.<br />

(it currently doesn't in forry for those that don't know).<br />
<br />
I'll post later this week how it goes</div></div><hr />

<br />
But i also like Forry's UI very much. <br />
<br />
I will also look at it and hopefully we can do something. i like it so much i will spend the time i hadnt before on learning to work with the UI.</div></div><hr />

Just let me know and I will try to get this thing up and running properly.  Also, I like my new default compass, but could someone tell me if the little blue mark for an adventure works correctly.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Only problem I've noticed is that there is no Adventure Window (Alt-V).</div></div><hr />

You have no idea how bad I miss your GUI!<br />
<br />
to me it was not only the most functional UI I have used, but the nicest and screen friendliest I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
Please!!!<br />
<br />
Update it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmm....I just used the interface yesterday and tested the Adventure window...it looked ok, but I will check again when I get home from work.  I did update the version on my computer to include the ? in the title bar of some of the windows.  I'll test the Adv. Window to make sure and upload a new version to this site.  I'm thinking maybe you might have an older version of the UI and that is why it isn't there.  We'll see in the morning I guess! :D</div></div><hr />

Make sure you have downloaded the latest version (3.0) and it should work fine.  Sorry you are having the trouble with my UI.</div></div><hr />
