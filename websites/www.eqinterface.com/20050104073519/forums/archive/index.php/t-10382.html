<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teddyboy420</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The satchel and the augments pictures are in some of the new files introduced with LDoN. I THINK the files are windowpieces 26 + 27. The numbers may be wrong but they are the new windowpieces files that have the satchel and augments in them. Your modded UI probably has files with those names in them already and that is why they aren't showing up correctly. <br />
<br />
There are a few threads on these boards regarding this issue. Just do a search and I bet you'll find your answer. Or you could just delete windowpieces26 + 27 and than your UI can use the default files making them show up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At first my Satchel was showing as the pearl neckalce.  I came here and read the information about what I needed to add to my Animations file to supposedly fix this...<br />
<br />
However, now the pearl necklace is gone but there is no icon at all for the satchel.<br />
<br />
If I load the base UI the Satchel shows up.<br />
<br />
I have also copied all the dragitem files over to my custom UI...does anyone have any suggestions?  This is extremely frustrating.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
The patch is in the Patch Help forum. <br />
