<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xxspike</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to get a few ideas for an Enchanter interface.  We have pets, but not all the time like mages/necros so a constant pet window isn't needed.  <br />
<br />
I would also like to see if there's a way to have multiple 'mez' timers.  Friends window and help window?<br />
<br />
Since we have a lot of things going on a flashy UI isn't needed but something that makes it easy to see what's happening.<br />
<br />
Just looking for some ideas.  Thanks</div></div><hr />

We need timers more than most other classes.  I think Arista's timers are great for that, although I prefer a less high tech look.<br />

My personal solution to &quot;What do enchanters need in a UI?&quot; is in the link in my sig.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play a 60 chanter on Sol Ro so i know a little bout what id like in a UI.  Some are minor things others would be a great help so i placed the desired fields i like in priority of how i choose my mods that i use.  If this is of help too others that make the mods for thanks now i will prolly download it when its released.  <br />
<br />
<br />
1. A large field of view.<br />
2. mez timers (2)<br />
3. large spell icons too click quickly<br />
4. a player window that shows <br />
 <br />
Hp/hp%<br />
mana/mana%<br />
pet health/pet health% with a half bar underneath for stamina <br />
exp/exp%<br />
aaexp/aaexp%<br />
wt normal/wt current (can add current Int on same line)<br />
<br />
5. a visible cast timer not one of those that shows a stat box invis for a cast times length.  which makes it hard too determine how much longer it will take too finish casting.<br />
<br />
<br />
thats about all i can think of off of the top of my head.  Hope this helps with the other chanters out there with some of their needs as well.<br />

I had requested perhaps a smaller version to be created or instructions on how to make this work for that size but, unfortunately, nothing yet.<br />
<br />
As a level 62 Enchantress, I've been working with other people's UIs and adjusting things as needed.  All of my chat windows are see through so that I can see everything around me.  I have 2 timers for the 2 different mez times (96 &amp; 54 seconds).  I used to have more timers when I was timing haste but got rid of that and just hasted myself before the melee.<br />
<br />
It just takes some work but eventually you find something that you can work with.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I made a 1024x768 version in November and I have kept it up to date.  You can find a link to that and a lot of other mods to that UI in the XymUI discussion thread (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3671).</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Two Mez timers would be awesome;<br />
<br />
2) I personally use the spell book toggle a lot while playing, but you don't have one on your spell gems window; and<br />
<br />
3) The hotkey window I have now allows me access to my clickable-worn items, which is really handy.<br />
<br />
/Hats off though - your UI is the loveliest I've seen, and very efficient - I'll be keeping an eye out for any of my wish items to find their way into your file. :P</div></div><hr />

I use Arista's timers when I want timers.<br />
<br />
2) I personally use the spell book toggle a lot while playing, but you don't have one on your spell gems window;<br />
There is an optional download that adds the spell book button.  All the mods are linked from the first post in the discussion thread.<br />
<br />
3) The hotkey window I have now allows me access to my clickable-worn items, which is really handy.<br />
There are 12 inventory slots in the spell gems panel, directly above the hot keys.  It is easy to change which slots they refer to.</div></div><hr />

Well, the UI you see is a mix of many.  I have taken bits and pieces from different UIs and combined them together to make one that works for me.  I change it whenever anything else is made that I like.  So, to get my UI all you have to do is browse through all the different UIs people have available for download and pick what you want.  Most are compatible with one another.<br />

<br />
i've actualy been searching for a group window that goes from green to red color,<br />
similar as your char and target window, it's the same for the group?<br />
<br />
similar like this:<br />

<br />
If you look closer at the picture i posted and also on Ainyan's Screenshot then you notice<br />
that there's not extra box on the left which changes the color, the actualy health bars<br />
are colored without any extra box flashing once low HP or something like that.<br />
<br />
Now i didn't try your UI yet since i'm at work but as far as i can see<br />
you got these extra boxes on the left, correct me if i'm wrong here and i'll try it once home.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eidolonfaer</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, first of all, when doing Mez work, I find I am constantly targeting with the mouse.  And therefore I end up casting spells and using hotbuttons far more then I use keystrokes.  At least, in time-critical situations.<br />
<br />
This means I want relatively large spell gems, with the names of the spells ON THE CAST BAR.  Especially since every freaking spell we have uses one of three icons (or at least so it seems sometimes).<br />
<br />
This also means I don't want foofoo filigree all over the place, as it eats up screen space and it takes time to drag the mouse cursor across it.<br />
<br />
A buff-window with the names of every buff is also invaluable.  Nothing sucks worse than having C5 run out and not noticing till you're OOM.<br />
<br />
Lessee...<br />
<br />
Oh yeah...Mez and Buff Timers...<br />
<br />
Arista's UI Timers (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp) does an excellent job, especially since no two Enchanters will have the same duration for every buff.<br />
<br />
I've compiled a Mix and Match setup that I like, and which seems to work well at 1024x768.  I've submitted the UI and it is available here. (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=2396)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laminate</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">very nice job... i like the casting bar thing a lot. Just dont think i could play with all that stuff on my screen. makes me feel like im looking through a carboard tube. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eidolonfaer</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You get used to it...  And it does work in higher resolution settings.<br />
<br />
The Actions Window is left untouched.  I usually minimize it except when actually doing something with it.<br />
<br />
The Inventory Window caught my eye exactly because of this problem.  It has transparent sections, so you can see what's going on even when dealing with inventory, and can close it and act quickly.  The Done button is close to the lower-right corner where my controls are concentrated.<br />
<br />
The Buffs Window is transparent/translucent except where there are active spells on you.<br />
<br />
I'd be delighted to hear suggestions for improvements however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I gave your comment about &quot;looking through a cardboard tube&quot; some thought, and decided that you had a definite point.<br />
<br />
And, since I figured I'd have to rework a few things for LDoN anyway, I decided to attack the problem.<br />
<br />
I swapped up to the next-higher screen resolution, and set up a viewport, to keep the rendering load approximately constant.  I changed the Buff Window quite a bit too, since it was the obvious place to start.<br />
<br />
I submitted the new setup to the moderation queue last night.  In the meantime, you can see the screenshot here. (http://home.sprynet.com/~kubik01/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/eq000207.jpg)</div></div><hr />

I would really prefer to figure out how to make my own, but I am a bit technology retarded..<br />
<br />
Here goes what i want in a UI<br />
<br />
1: Big field of view being when people pull a train on me i have to be able to see all the mobs without moving around the room like the mad hatter.<br />
<br />
2: yes mes timers are good<br />
<br />
3: Hot keys in the middle of two chat windows. I use hotkeys for a lot of my spells<br />
<br />
4: Actions window somewhere near there so you don't have to move your mouse across the screen to let your group know what you've messed.<br />
<br />
4: Big spell gems to make clicking it easier in some of the higher resolution things... (I don't know the word for it) The icons tend to be quite small<br />
<br />
5: Make a chat for the melee honestly i don't care what most people are hitting for. I just care when I'm being hit because in about three seconds i'm gonna drop<br />
<br />
6: our pets have huge huge names at times so a little bigger on the name place for the little guys.<br />
<br />
OK that's my rant and I'm sure most enchanters have posted the same thing. :) I just wanna make sure that eventually there is something really good for chanters</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you look around and download the individual pieces you want and make your own mix and match UI. My main is an Enchanter and with just a few mod's I made a perfect for myself. <br />
<br />
Really most of the things you said you wanted you could do with no problem:<br />
<br />
1. Just find smaller windows so you have plenty of room.<br />
<br />
2. There is a really good set of timers I use, they are made by Arista, here's a link to her site where you can customize the timers yourself by just entering what you want and it will spit out a custom timer for you. http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp<br />
<br />
3. Lots of good Hotkey mods on this site.<br />
<br />
4. I don't use the actions window anymore, I just take my chat macro's and put them n my hotkey bank. Saves space, and you have your spell bar to cast spells with.<br />
<br />
5. You can easily mod any chat window in game by opening the chat window menu (right clicking on it) and set the chat channels and filters. I use 3 seperate chat window, 1 for battle info, 1 for all chat, 1 for guild chat <br />
<br />
6. Look for a horizontal pet window, more on this later<br />
<br />
The base UI that I use is T.Kings Celtic which I find is an awsome UI and has almost everything I need. I than add the mods I want by just unzipping in my modded UI file and overwriting what's there as needed. The Celtic UI can be found under Featured/T.King and look through the rest of the individual window mods in the downloads section and I gaurntee you'll find what you are looking for. Have fun!<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested I could zip up the UI I have put together and mail it to you. Or, I suppose if there is enough interest I could post it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eidolonfaer</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, regarding the melee crap, I just go into the options window...filters tab and turn it all off except me being attacked.<br />
<br />
I don't give a darn about who's hitting for what, either, and see no reason to waste perfectly good screen space on an extra chat window for spam and garbage.<br />
<br />
If I want to check my pet's damage output, I can turn on pet damage for a moment then turn it back off.<br />
<br />
You can quite easily spawn a new chat Window by right-clicking on the title-bar of the default chat window and setting up the options.  And I find that it's not worth doing at all except for my bazaar mule.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree 100% on the large spell gems.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I use the default Actions window, but 99% of the time it's either minimized or closed.  Why spend time modifying something you hardly ever need anyway?<br />
<br />
<br />
The pet window is going to be changing soon, according to the latest info from Test, they're adding some kind of Pet Buff window.  I'll be curious to see how that works out.  They're also adding functionality to the Raid window to facilitate automation of guild DKP systems, and a few other things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, for the big field of view, I've found that a viewported UI actually gives you a much better view (less crap in the way).  Just go to the My Skins folds on the left-hand side of this post and compare the Eidolon (not-viewported) and Eidolon2 (viewported, and one resolution setting higher) screenshots.</div></div><hr />

http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9802<br />
<br />
What I like:<br />
<br />
1. LARGE field of view.<br />
2. Fast access to instaclicks/inventory. <br />
3. Handy pet info.<br />
4. Extensive buff info that does not obstruct the view<br />
<br />
Basically, everything i need to solo/group/raid is right there, but not in the way. Just add Arysta timer and you're all set!<br />
