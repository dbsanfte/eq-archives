Doing one with and one without AAXP would be REALLY nice.  Keep up the good work.  This is code-challenged player that appreciates all your efforts.  :D</div></div><hr />

MIne uses nothing to do with pets other than the default pet info (which you can right-click and turn off)  Although I don't have one without AAXP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a wizard, I poof my pet as soon as I cast it, so I don't care about its HPs.  And stamina is basically useless...<br />
<br />
I'd love a player window that shows the following:<br />
<br />
First name  CurrentHP / MaxHP<br />
<br />
Health       %<br />
Mana         %<br />
XP              %<br />
AAXP          %<br />
<br />
No pets HP and no stamina.  Optionally, an area under AAXP for spell casting time would be cool, as would another area for breathing (when underwater or in The Grey).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">07-28-2002, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted a mod in the Release forum.<br />
<br />
It contains the HP and Mana bar. And that's the only bars.<br />
<br />
Under it, it contains the AC, ATK numbers and XP, AAXP percentages.<br />
<br />
Oh, HP values are also in the top right corner. Check it out, it might be what you're seeking.<br />
<br />
I did that to suit my caster chars and Melee chars, thus the reason for leaving the mana bar in. STA means jack, even to a Melee, removing that was a service to man kind.<br />
<br />
I also prefer to keep the spell casting stuff with the spells, so no sorry, mine doesn't have that.</div></div><hr />
