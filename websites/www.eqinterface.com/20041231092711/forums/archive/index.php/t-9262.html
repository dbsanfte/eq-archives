<br />
Please stop by and read the whole story (http://www.deepfriedforums.com/showthread.php?threadid=44367). Woody is in positive spirits about it, but has offered to sell the original panels of some of his work to help fund his move. And of course if you want to donate, he is accepting that too. I for one want to insure that he is able to get back to his drawing board very soon. soo please stop by and give what you can, if you can.  I have been through a big move like he is doing, it is scary and expenses always pass what you calculate for. soo don't let him &quot;hitting his goal&quot; fool you.. If you can help please do.<br />
