I just added the text myself using Microsoft Word 2000 and continue to do so whenever I need to make changes. No problems. =]</div></div><hr />

<br />
[list=1] Make a temporary working folder Make a copy of your animations file and place it in this temporary working folder. Run t.king's install program and unzip the files into your working folder, but do not run remmy.exe (uncheck the box). When t.king's install program is finished you will find the graphics files and two text files in your working folder. The text files contain the required code to update your animations file. Copy the contents of rem_tex.txt into your animations file Copy and paste the contents of rem_anim.txt over the existing class animation you are trying to update. Copy your working folder into your EQ uifiles directory and test the new animations file in EQ.[/list=1]If all goes well you can copy the animations file and graphics files into your custom ui folder.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

It seems when Remmy goes to edit the EQ_Animations file, it kinda forgets what its doing.  I saw my EQ_Animations file continually go from 190 something kb to 18kb every time I ran it.  I had to go through and change everything by hand using my working Steamworks UI's EQ_Anim for another toon as a guide.  I wish I saw this first :(<br />
<br />
What Kuvasie says will work.  Remember to use &quot;A_ClassAnim##&quot; instead of &quot;A_ClassAnimHighlight##.&quot;  I made that mistake the first time, and I had to cut it out, replace it from Steamworks EQ_Anim, and then sift up farther to correct it.  GL</div></div><hr />
