Took them long enough to do the Press Release.  Now I can publicly congratulate Thomus.  Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy,  congrats again Tom!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomus</div><div class="date">12-03-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all!<br />
<br />
Since I joined the Sigil team, I've been humbled by the amazing talent that surrounded me, it was nothing less than awe inspiring to see not only the original talent that created Everquest to begin with, but to see the industries finest brought aboard as well, I've already begun work, and I am putting my best efforts into designing a next-gen UI, it will be my best work ever, and I'm very happy that so many of you have been rooting for me, you all helped me get recognized, and I'm truly grateful for it, I'm glad that all those nights I traded sleep to create art, would someday lead to something as amazing as this.<br />
<br />
Please visit the Sigil Games forums and say hello in Art &amp; Graphics, I have to go get photos taken right now, but I'll be back soon to respond over there, thank you all again, I'm very honored by your blessings. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ascher</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To see Thomus's name mentioned in the same paragraph as industry leaders like D. Maitz and Den Beauvais shows just how far he's come.  Read the article and go to the other artists' homepages and you'll see just how great this is.  A very fine group of talented people.<br />
