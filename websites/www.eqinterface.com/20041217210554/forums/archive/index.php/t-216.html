<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scioned</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, i'm following the directions for downloading and loading the skins/mods, but i can't seem to get them to work. Can someone tell me what i'm doing wrong?  Here is the steps i'm following:<br />
<br />
1-Opening C:\Program Files\Everquest\Skins<br />
<br />
2-Making copy of Default folder and renaming it  SCIONED.<br />
<br />
3-Downloading mod old_style_inv_072402.  Unzipping to desktop.<br />
<br />
4-Opening SCIONED folder (inside is an Images folder and a Default.XML file).  <br />
<br />
<br />
OK here's where i get a little lost--I've tried dragging the whole unzipped old_style_inv folder into the SCIONED folder, and i've tried opeing the old_style_inv folder and dragging the EQUI_inventory.xml file (which is the only thing in the old_style_inv folder) into the SCIONED folder and neither work.   Not once did i receive a &quot;Do you wish to copy over?&quot; message as stated in the directions.  Can someone please help clear this up for me?  I've tried this on several different tested and untested mods and haven't had any luck.  Also if anyone knows a for sure way to maintain the window placement settings after using a /loadskin command then please post how as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As to keeping the placement you would have to edit your players UI*.ini file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scioned</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I don't have a UIfiles folder.  Only the skin folder under EQ directory.  Tried turn /newui off then turning it back on, and doing a thorough file check, but still nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faeriemage</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check under the advanced button on your patcher and make sure you have luclin selected as patches you are loading. If you do not have a UIFiles directory then you will not have th new UI. Also check to make sure you do not have 2 EQ directories on your computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scioned</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do have the new UI up and running, but i turned it on by placing a NewUI=TRUE line in my eqclient.ini file instead of the /newUI command. Here's a bigger problem now---I tried removing this line from the client file, and i've tried setting it to TRUE an FALSE, but now i get a crash message after server select screen and can't log into game.<br />
<br />
Btw, how could I have the new UI up, but NOT have any UI files in EQ folder?</div></div><hr />
