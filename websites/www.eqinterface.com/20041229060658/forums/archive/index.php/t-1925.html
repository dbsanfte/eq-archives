<br />
Sooo I figured I would post the question to everyone..<br />
<br />
remember that chat windows include any windows you open to filter damage/ chat/guild chat/ etc<br />
<br />
just vote below<br />

1) Main chat (say, gsay, gu, tells etc)<br />
2) You hit X<br />
3) X hits you<br />
4) Spam (ooc &amp; auc)<br />
5) Ability spam (You taunt X to attack you and ignore others.... you taunt X to attack.... )<br />
<br />
(Number 4 and 5 are *really small* 100% transparent windows, only 3 or 4 lines tall)<br />
<br />
But for my merchant its<br />
1) Main chat<br />
2) OOC auc<br />
3) Tells<br />

Sure, it would be nice to have more than that open, to break things down more, but for those of us who can't run in anything higher than 1024x768, it just takes up waaaaayyyyyy to much screen real-estate.  I've found that I can have 2 easily in 1024x768, and my daughter is able to work with 2 comfortably in 800x600.</div></div><hr />

4) Tells/Group/Guild to the right of main bigger than melee smaller than main.  <br />

Ack just realized I have a 5th I keep minimized with all my skills stuff.  That way I can look if I want but doesn't clutter / spam me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i use 2 main windows, and 2 &quot;closed&quot;windows, let me explain.  pretty much i am n a guild that just raids, so usually dont pay attention to ooc and shout, if they are on at all. i use the crystal meth vert mod, am a wizard, here is my set up<br />
<br />
1) main window for guild and grp chat<br />
2) second window for tells and an &quot;on log in&quot; chat window<br />
3) i have a 3rd window closed to nothen more then a bar that has all the crappy spell emotes that come from 4 focus items but that i didnt not just filter out cause it nicely filles a small gap in my layout below my compass to offer i nice flat foot print. in this window i put my hits, my misses, rampage, enrage, and all that. as a caster i have no need to see anything but whats hitting me.<br />

well, there ya go, 3 i guess<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corevus</div><div class="date">09-10-2002, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use 7 windows.<br />
<br />
This is with 200 pixels of viewport at the bottom of my screen. Every window's chat entry is set off screen. The two far right windows have their scroll bars set off screen (thinking about how to make windows that don't have the buttons or bar for scrolling but will still scroll), and those windows whose chat entry and scroll bars can't be set offscreen have those areas overlapped.<br />
<br />
The chat entry area set above the bottom left window is a whole window, with the window area shrunk down so all it is is text entry, and set to &quot;always chat here&quot;.<br />
<br />
As you can see it makes for an incredibly smooth, uncluttered look. When I am not fighting the window which catches ooc, shouts and auctions I just stretch to overlap the hits and spells windows.<br />

<br />
one for battle spam, spell spam and all other things that are meaty...<br />
<br />
second one for tells, group chat, guild chat (if there is any), and specified chat channel<br />
<br />
I frequently have to minimize one of these windows when things get a bit to jerky for any usable travel to take place.  Mostly in my case it's because my computer just isn't up to par, some of the other ideas up there are pretty cool for all the windows, and i would consider using some of those schemes if my computer could handle it a little more smoothly.:)</div></div><hr />

1 big window: all chat<br />

1 1/4 size window: stuff hitting, missing, etc vs. me<br />
1 1/2 size window under the 1/4 sized windows: all other forms of combat and spellcasting spam.<br />
<br />
I do a lot of log parsing, so I need the stuff to show so it is recorded, but I don't want it cluttering chat.  My chat colors make determining who is speaking on what channel quite easy to discern.</div></div><hr />

The hitsmode windows (the single digit columns are my MY and ME hits while the one to the right of those is the Other) are at /chatfontsize of 2 or 3 (I forget)<br />
<br />
Chats are all at /chatfontsize 4<br />
<br />
I have a 21 inch monitor so the screen is easy to read actually.<br />
<br />
Sure is easier to read that screen than my MDT in my squad car going 75 miles an hour. LOL<br />
<br />
I also find that EQWatcher help as it speaks the text of messages sent to me in tells and chat so I do not have to actually read it. The Hitsmode is more for knowing that I am actually hitting something instead of for watching (unfortunately VI screwed up by not storing the entire line in the log if you use Abbreviated Mode so I cannot get my DPS)</div></div><hr />

On top of those three is one chat window that is reduced down to the size of only the text entry window but stretches across the better part of them.  All text entry defaults there.  :p<br />

     I only use/need 2 windows (usually just 1 suffices). <br />
<br />
1) Everything (have others hits/misses off, auction off)<br />
2) Guild/Raid channel (only use a window for this if doing a multiple guild raid or my guild is doing something 'complicated' that we decide to devote a channel to).<br />
3) Rarely, I will use another window if in 'tell hell', but will never have it up as a 3rd window.<br />

top right:  Semi-relevant info.  OOC, say, socials, etc. All the stuff that if I didn't see it for a couple of minutes, wouldn't impact the game significantly.<br />

I had to go back to 2 because of the &quot;you cant see your target message&quot;. There was no way of putting it in the your hit window and having this message or the &quot;your too far away&quot; message not in the same window of your hits can be very confusing.<br />

<br />
I'm kind with you on that.  I like two.  All combat spam and skills in one and everything else in another.   Much easier to read everything in one place then three or more places.  The main reason I don't have combat stuff separated is that I need to see what is hitting me and can't just do the numbers.  Got PKd and didn't even know it in a few fights when I tried that.  I couldn't tell that the red numbers were coming more from a rogue then the mob I was tanking.  My screens have to be wide enough that there are very few lines that wrap around, too so now no narrow windows for me.  Not sure why that bugs me.   I also like combat all in one window to give me reference to when everything is happening.  I'd see movement in the window and I would look and think... Crap, that PK is back when it was me just passing someone in combat and seeing that chat window move.  I just couldn't get used to it.</div></div><hr />

any skin or mod that has more than that I wont use, it's just too many places to look for data, and its hard to tell when something happens versus something happening in another box.</div></div><hr />

Then by using the right click in the new window you can rename it and add anything to go in the window by selecting which filter you want to go in the window.</div></div><hr />
