<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asele</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I logged in after the patch and decided after spending far too many  hours in the sewers of CT to go back to CS and club.....err quad some otters.  Being Level 60 wizard I have (in the past) had the luxury of just snare pulling singles to get my quad.  Well today was different.  Lo and behold that Chief Kalan will now aggro me from the middle otter camp, when in the past I could snare pull one that was not 5 feet from him.  Now he will add from across.  Needless to say I wasn't happy when he dispelled my epic shield and ebolted me, chasing me to SS (Where I am also KOS due to NToV raids), I was alittle surprised.<br />
<br />
So just a heads up to all you quad kiters out there looking to farm some crusty and quest gems to vendor when you are bored and need a little cash....Chief Kalan will dispel and ebolt.  He also is not snareable or rootable.  He's damn fast like most otters but if there is no shammy within range of him he won't be fatser than jboots on an erudite wizzy with only marginal agi.<br />
<br />
P.S.  If he does chase you climbt the wal and run it's edge with lev.  This way he has to run up and down and up and down while you just lev across the little edges.  Helps you get some distance.</div></div><hr />
