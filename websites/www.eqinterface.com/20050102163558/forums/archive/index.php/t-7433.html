<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gricksym</div><div class="date">03-09-2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep crashing to the desktop while zoning. This just started happening a few days ago; it was perfect before though. I never had a problem until wednesday or thursday. I'm using Drakah's UI and all my drivers and stuff are up to date. My UIError log says a lot of stuff is missing but it was 100% just a few days ago which confused me.<br />
UIerror (http://www.geocities.com/gricksymx/UIErrors.txt) <br />
Please help. :o<br />
<br />
-edit- Here's a pic of all the files that came with his UI, if it helps any.<br />

IT just says that the UI you have doesnt have a certain file so its going to use the default file. That is a very very good thing. If you didnt have those errors you'd get yelled at here cause you did a no no. ;)<br />
<br />
I dont remember the name but look at the other text files in your Everquest folder one of them will list driver failures and game failures. Post those and some one might be able to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryck</div><div class="date">03-11-2003, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The most common cause of continual zone crashes these days is corrupt texture compression files.  Depending on your video card and drivers Eq may have defaulted to using texture compression.<br />
<br />
Do a search in your EQ directory for .txc files and delete any that you find.  If that fixes your problem then make sure to go into your options (when you first start EQ) and turn off compression.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gricksym</div><div class="date">03-11-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's probably because I'm stupid but I couldn't find the files you were talking about, Dolby. I'll try out your suggestion, Garryck. Although, DAOC is starting to be fun again... leveled a Necro to 15 in 6 hours so I'm not sure if I want to play EQ right now. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gricksym</div><div class="date">03-11-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, just did a search for any .txc files - none were found. o.O<br />
What now? &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">03-11-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check and make sure whether you are running in 16 bit or 32 bit (options window, display settings tab).  That can cause problems if you are running in the wrong mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gricksym</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's set to 32 bit which is what I use. I've switched between numerous UIs; it's still not working - including the default. I crash every single time while zoning, and everything I've tried has failed. Right now I'm using Grown's updated UI thingy.<br />
<br />
The UI error log I have now is the exact same damn thing as the last one except now it has &quot;[Thu Mar 13 15:41:42 2003] Error: Could not find child LFGButton in window GroupWindow&quot; there. How the hell am I missing the files in my folder if THEY'RE THERE?!?! Jesus Christ this is so frustrating, I'm thinking of just quitting altogether. There's absolutely no reason to get frustrated over a problem in a game that seems unfixable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;[Thu Mar 13 15:41:42 2003] Error: Could not find child LFGButton in window GroupWindow<br />
That line means that the last skin you tried to load didn't have the Group Window up to date with the LoY changes.<br />
<br />
If you are having problems even while using the default UI, then it would seem that UIs aren't the problem.  I'd strongly suggest you try talking to the folks at SOE.  Try dropping a note explaining the problems over at the Tech Help forum of the EQLive site.  (Remember to read their post about information they want, first).  If the default UI is crashing you out too, then there is something else that is causing the problem.  They are much more likely to be able to help you than we are, at this point.</div></div><hr />

Bah dont say that... your not stupid. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauraOrganaSolo</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish I had seen this thread before I sat twiddling my thumbs wiating for a response from the Sony techs. I reinstalled EQ completely and that solved the problem.<br />
<br />
Nine days later, Sony techs e-mailed me and said they still didn't know what was wrong with my files and that I would need to send them some more.<br />
<br />
*sighs* I miss the old days when it was more Verant and less Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gricksym</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went to the EQ Tech Board and found a thread with my exact same problem - none of the suggestions worked so I'm going to try to uninstall EQ to see if that will help. It takes 15-20 mins to cross 6 zones because I constantly crash and have to log back in to zone again. Bleh. &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gricksym</div><div class="date">03-17-2003, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, that didn't work. I'm done with EQ and this BS. Later all. =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found out my friend had the exact same problem, and he said all I had to do was delete all my logs and any file starting with &quot;CJ&quot; or &quot;GN&quot; and it works now. Yay. If anyone else has this problem then do that first. :D</div></div><hr />
