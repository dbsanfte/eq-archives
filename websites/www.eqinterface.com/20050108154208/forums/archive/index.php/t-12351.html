<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you have done as much software fiddling as you can and it is still causing problems...there really is only one answer....format.<br />
It sucks to do but it really does help a system run smothly...windows builds up so much junk that format evey 3-4 months does wonders for system performance.<br />
<br />
One thing you can do to make the formating a little easier in the future is when creating the partion for your hard drive make a second one with 10gigs of space and put EQ in there. Eq does not write anything in the registry so you can format your windows drive and leave the EQ one alone to save the re-install/patch time.</div></div><hr />

I was afraid of this. But heck, things happen beyond my control. I have two people using this PC. So it could of been anything. I'll have to wait, or just break down and build a new pc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sundanzkid2001</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a machine that is also doing this. When I defraged the hard drive, I found out im almost out of space and that I need a new drive . I will post the results when I install new drive. I think its something maybe with this almost g.o.d release as my EQ directory is almost three gig now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bossmaximass</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to say it but set your resolution to 16 bit instead of 32 and try again, it worked for me I had same problem.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before you go and reformat your drive... Try giving your computer a test run at PCPitStop (http://www.pcpitstop.com) and click on the key (which says 'Ready for a free PC tune up?') to start the run. Once it finishes it will tell you what is wrong with your system and what to do. You can click on the Windows link under the Subsystems heading and it will tell you what is running in the background and what you should turn off. I found this site extremely helpful when my system was lagging at load ups and such and found a few programs hidden that were consuming power and making my game play a pain. Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delko</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bossmaximass - lol, it was set under 16-bit. So that's taken care up.<br />
Zantaklawz - thanks! I forgot about this site. woot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delko</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well - I found out what was up. Don't ever, ever download Nielson Net rating software. It's eeeeeevil! I can't believe I didn't delete that sooner. Thanks for your help guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh my goddess! Delko you did the same thing huh? The very same night I downloaded the Neilson Rating program my game dragged and I mean dragged extremely slow. I pretty much assumed that program was the problem an deleted and viola' it was back to normal. *chuckles* Its good to see that I wasn't the only one with that program problem.</div></div><hr />
