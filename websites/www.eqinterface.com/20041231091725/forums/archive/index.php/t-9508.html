Lost Dungeons of Norrath - Raid Content<br />
In designing Lost Dungeons of Norrath, we haven't forgotten about those who enjoy raiding.  In addition to the multitude of rewarding single-group adventures, LDoN also includes exciting and challenging events targeted at six groups or less.<br />
<br />
For the first time, raids take place in truly private zones, where your groups can test their mettle and focus solely on the task at hand.  Instead of limiting the availability of content by who can get there first, this new system only limits participation based on whether or not you have recently succeeded or failed at each event within a given period.  This allows us to place a heavy emphasis on skill, while remaining in control of the influx of new items into the game.<br />
<br />
While our primary focus for LDoN is the single group experience, we are working diligently to ensure that these new raids are centered around the principles of organizational tactics, individual skill, and most importantly - fun.  <br />
<br />
We feel that the core content and rewards in the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion will entertain and benefit even the most experienced players.  We are aware of the desire for high-end raid content and will continue to address and meet those needs over time.<br />
