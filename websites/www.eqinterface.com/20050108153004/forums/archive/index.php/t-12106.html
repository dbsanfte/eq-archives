<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nortan</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there... perchance someone can help me out here? I am looking for a small UI with little to no ornamentation, similar to the stock UI, but a much smaller presentation in the 1180 x 768 resolution... I had one I loved, but it is so out of date I am starting to loose functionality. I prefer separate components, rather than &quot;consolized&quot; set ups...</div></div><hr />

<br />
 1180 x 768 resolution.  That is an odd resolution, do you mean 1024x768?<br />
 What UI have you been using that you liked so much?  If you posted here (UIErrors.txt) the troubles that you are having, we may be able to help you update it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fangarr</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My UI components for Player/Group/Target and the Pet window all provide lots of info while taking up minimal room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nortan</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, thanks for the input... I have assembled a mish-mosh of parts from various places... ultra tiny standard buff/bard icons a friend shrank for me, a custom written horizontal spell bar another friend made, etc... what I am really concerned with are the new discipline window, a smaller inventory window, a horizontal layout for the pet window with a reduced buff box, etc.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I guessed at the resolution, I have to check specifics and post the correct one...<br />
<br />
I will snap a screen shot of my current elements, and post it. Then we can compare and maybe ya'll will have some recommendations from there...<br />
<br />
Thanks again, people. Sorry if I was unclear...<br />

<br />
I actually use the 1152x864 resolution (maybe that's what you meant?) and designed the UI to have a lot of functionality but not take up a lot of space.<br />
<br />
Check it out here (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=3003) and let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
I'd appeciate your feedback and I'm very open to suggestions for making it better.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
