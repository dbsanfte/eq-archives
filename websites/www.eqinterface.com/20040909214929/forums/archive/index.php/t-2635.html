<br />
In addition to my Necro Skull Spellbook and Necro Skull Compass, I have now released the Necro Spectre Pet Info (box?) to tthe Misc. area!<br />
<br />
I should have a version with a combined group window (for space saving) up for grabs tomorrow night. Would do it tonight, but I gotta get some sleep... damn sleeping. Wastes so much precious time!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DataCrypt</div><div class="date">10-03-2002, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice please release a complete set for us necro with no good UI's to DL</div></div><hr />

(attached a screenshot). That is something that wil come with the completed UI.<br />
<br />
Like you, I was actually sick of looking for a good Necro mod and seeing frilly, treehugger stuff. I wanted something a bit darker... ok, REALLY dark... and EVIL. I wanted to be able to see my screen and remember what I am, and what I can do!  )<br />
<br />
BTW... I've been noticing that soloing is a bit more fun... don't feel so alone with my spec staring at me  )</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I've been looking for. I'm gonna wait to see what your group/pet combination looks like before I DL this one.<br />
<br />
Great job!!!:nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's great! Do you plan on making things for other classes? I'd like to see what you could do with shamans. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I may do a shaman one... not sure tho. Once I get this one done, I'm gonna tweak it just for SK's.<br />
<br />
I started playing right before the Kunark expansion (got a barb war up to L2! lol). As soon as Kunark came out, I promptly made Quesarr, my original Iksar SK. My next character was Verflixt, another Iksar SK, and then Leger, my supertwink Iksar Shammy. Then I decided I was tired of playing SKs, so I made an Iksar Necro, named Sssissy Lallaa (yeah, joke... think about the Necro best of the best, lol) who is now my main... and Im loving the damage I do  ). <br />
<br />
Since my Shaman is only L19, I'll have to consult with my friend who plays Macabre (just hit 60!). Damn us Iksars, lol. If I do, it won't be all nature treehugger tho, but it won't be anything like my necro skin either... we'll just have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthscum</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah... forgot to mention that I'm not going to do a combine with the group window since I can't move the invite and disban buttons, but I am going to do something with the group window... for right now it's all a secret.</div></div><hr />
