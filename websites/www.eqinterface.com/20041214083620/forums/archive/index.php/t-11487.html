EQ PDA Version 3.5 plus Dreamlife's Complete UI Version 3<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I'd like to thank the following people for thier great work in either having a great mod for me to include, mod, or inspire me to create something new.<br />
<br />
Kudane<br />
Sokol<br />
Drakah<br />
T. King<br />
Calael<br />
Keilha Sharpleaf<br />
Tephrox<br />
Aya Nanase<br />
Grottel <br />
Calluna<br />
Lunakin<br />
Heals<br />
<br />
Forgive me if your name is not here and should be. You are appreciated!<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Copy all of the enclosed files into the ../everquest/uifiles/EQPDA directory<br />
Rename your UI_(yourcharname)_(yourservername).ini file for a backup in case you wish to revert to your old UI.<br />
Copy UI_Dreamlife_Xegony.ini to the ../everquest directory and rename it to UI_(yourcharname)_(yourservername).ini.<br />
<br />
This UI contains 2 custom folders for your own customization options.<br />
<br />
../EQPDA/Pure Mele<br />
../EQPDA/Caster Hybrid<br />
<br />
First choose pure Mele or Caster versions. Copy the EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml and EQUI_GroupWindow.xml files from the ../EQPDA/pure mele OR ../EQPDA/caster hybrid folder into the ../EQPDA folder.<br />
<br />
UI_Playername_Servernumber.ini, Must be included for placement of windows. If you do not use this file the UI will function but will look like a puzzle waiting for help. All the windows are locked in place by the ini included with this UI. If you choose not to use the included ini or want to move the PDA from its location you will need to unlock and move each window individually. You WILL notice if they are not lined up perfectly.<br />
<br />
AFTER YOU HAVE COMPLETED ALL OF THE PREVIOUS STEPS.....AFTER... Log into EQ. If you used my INI you're done. If you did not use my INI, at the chat prompt type /loadskin, select EQPDA and have fun moving windows!<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The following windows are included for the sole reason that they have been intergrated into the EQUI_HotButtonWindow.xml window and are no longer required to be visable.<br />
<br />
EQUI_BreathWindow.xml (zerod window)<br />
EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml (zerod window)<br />
EQUI_CastingWindow.xml (zerod window)<br />
<br />
The following windows have been modified to work together and must ALL be used for the UI to look correct.<br />
<br />
EQUI_CompassWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_GroupWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_TargetWindow.xml<br />
<br />
The following windows have been modified to fit with or look like the EQ PDA UI. You can choose to not use these windows if you do not like the way they look. Simply delete them from your custom UI folder if you do not want them.<br />
<br />
EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_ChatWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_MapViewWnd.xml<br />
<br />
The following windows are just great mods I am including just because they rock. Most  have been modded by me before release but are not my original code. (is anything in the EQ UI really?)<br />
<br />
EQUI_AAWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_Container.xml<br />
EQUI_LootWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_MerchantWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_StoryWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_BuffWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_Inventory.xml<br />
EQUI_BuffWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml<br />
TargetIndicator.ini<br />
<br />
<br />
The Vert mod requires the following file to function. All my non visible windows are vert or some modification of Vert. So don't delete it and I will be patching it as needed!<br />
<br />
EQUI_Animations.xml<br />
<br />
The following art is a combination of things I have taken from Kudane/Sokol Enok, Drakah, T King and my own work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm getting a lot of emails about crashes when installing my UI. <br />
<br />
To be sure I am not sending out a bad product I downloaded the same Zip thats in the downloads section and installed it 2 ways. <br />
The first following the directions in the readme the second just unziping the files into a folder. <br />
<br />
The second caused a crash. Please follow the readme to the letter and the UI will work perfectly without fail.<br />
<br />
I have been able to make it crash on install but ONLY by not following the directions.<br />
<br />
There are 2 files that are different for classes without mana or spells. They are kept in folders called /pure mele or /caster hybrid. You MUST choose what is appropriate for your class and copy the TWO files contained within either of these folders to your .../EQPDA folder or the UI will crash. It wont work no matter what else you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">catmatik</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well according to the log, there is nothing wrong. I think it has something to do with the other UI's I have. I did everything right too.  But I tried loading a different skin, to find half of a completely seperate skin in front of me. Not to mention I logged in with my chat windows mixed up. So maybe if I delete all the folders except default it will work. As for the log...It is displaying errors for 1 UI that loaded the right way, but not your UI. Time to fool around I guess, unless these are then 1 window pieces error made my log say about 50,000...<br />
