dont really have to be epic. But i would like a very nice looking sword with spell gems in the middle of it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh and on subject. Some of my friends thought it was a nice idea. for other class. like wizards staffs and mage staff. Not much but everyone i talked to thought it was a neat idea</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AloneStarwalker</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what would be neat, is a 3d rendering of the ranger epic sword, ligtning shimmering up its blade.. and the spells centered up the center of the blade... maybe it would be too big, but would look neat.<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried some 3d modelling, but my design skills for graphics is non existant. but i sure as its cold outside right now, program it easy.</div></div><hr />
