I noticed his site is no longer up and the link was removed from here..  I would take it that the new job may have caused a move and being that it seemed to be hosted by his IP it got killed when the service was cut?  Of course that's an assumption..   :) ..  Where oh where is our fav UI artist?</div></div><hr />

Kings EZBoard site (http://pub165.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10) is also available if that is what you are looking for as well...</div></div><hr />

I guess it was broken because it was the old address? (I had gotten a message that &quot;this site is unavailable as of Dec 2&quot; .. )   Anyway, thanks for pointing me to the right place!</div></div><hr />
