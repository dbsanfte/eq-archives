<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corevus</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't like the default guages, so what I did was cut and past some guages from a skin that I did like over those in windows pieces 1, using Photoshop 7.<br />
<br />
Problem is, that now when I load that folder with that tga in it, none of the pieces in windows pieces 1 appear anywhere on screen.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated. I've seen some vague references to layers and transparencies in various threads here without any explanation of what they are for or how to implement them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With Photoshop 7, you dont have to declare and alpha level, but you have to save it in 32 bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corevus</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That got the pieces loaded ... but all the colors are screwed up, and pieces of them are missing.<br />
<br />
Does it mean anything that each time I paste something onto the windows pieces 1.tga a new layer is created?</div></div><hr />

If you change anything, you have to make sure to either 1) the overlay is EXACTLY the same size as the old one or 2) rewite the plotting of that element in the animations file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok if you start using an existing TGA file from the UI you will see by clicking on 'channels' that there is a alpha channel and if you select it yo ucan basically paint the 'opacity' in range from black (transparent) t owhite (opaque).<br />
<br />
What you do is yo uselect tjhe layer in the color layers, switch the the channels tab and select the alpha channel, then while the selection is still on, use alt backspace to fill it in with white (press D for default black/white colors).<br />
<br />
then you save your TGA and everything should show up.<br />
<br />
to makea drop shadow for example, you leave black in the color channel, make a selection of the shadow shape, then in the alpha channel you fill it in with gray ...<br />
<br />
hope that makes sense<br />
<br />
if you start from scratch,<br />
go the 'channels' tab and sim,ply click the new channel button, it wiall automatically adda ALPHA channel after the R G  B channels (or the cmyk oneswhatever they are  I dont remember right now)</div></div><hr />
