Are any other servers having this problem?  Just once in my time I'd like to go to FV and not worry about a drider using one of those legs do reinact a prison scene.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">all servers are like that, except test, I hear they are planing a total revamp to the boat system with LDoN since it is going to be a oldworld expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azuth</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks.  It would be nice if there was a second translocater at the TD docks.  If there is a second one he's well hidden.  I may be 51 but driders still scare me.  Best thing I can do is send a pet on a suicide run and use a SoW potion to run to the out post untill they fix the boats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tellgar</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright...<br />
... what the heck is a drider? :confused: <br />
<br />
(Oh, and translocater... well hidden... are you talking about a spire? Forgive my ignorance - I'm a druid so I don't hit FV that much. Though I do go through with an alt once in a while, I generally use the PoK stone for that though.)<br />
<br />
Er.. yeah,<br />
Tellgar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azuth</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Drider is a D&amp;D monster that is part Drow (Dark Elf) and part spider.  Sony calls them drachnids.<br />
<br />
The translocater is an NPC the when you say the proper trigger words will send you to the docks of the stopping point for the boats.  The one in EFP will send you to Erud's crossing.  The one in BB will send you to TD.  I haven't found one from ECing or TD to finish the trek.  I was stuck in Ecing for a few hours before I just used gate and left.<br />
<br />
But on a side note I don't have as much a reason to care, I got my 50+ mage spells with the help of a good friend of mine.  She took the driders far away from my path and I ran with an SoE to the out post.  Now to just sit back and wait for the boats to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oblivion_Angel</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">after pop came out i really havent found any reaso to take and of the boats, im a duid so just about everywhere i go i can either port myself to or just use the stones in pok, boats were never worth the time, even though i never had any problems like the ones your tlaking about:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have played all classes and all races (except stupid froggies) and even as a druid or a wizard I found myself on the boats...  just for realism...  I allways thought the journey should take at least 5 RL hours *which is nearly half a year in EQtime if I got my timetable right*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantral</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how can 5 rl hours be half a year.  SK harm touch is on a 24 hour timer ingame and refreshes after 45 minutes RL time.  so if 45 minutes is 24 hours ingame than 5 hours RL would be 9 days EQ time  <br />
<br />
Dont mean this as a flame sorry if it comes across that way.  I may be wrong about 45 minutes.  I havent used HT in a long time.  its the same timer as Lay on Hands.  its either 45 or 90 minutes.  either way its still only 24 hours EQ time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vampris</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think we have any problems on E`ci but i dont think anyone uses the boat except to go to OOT... and i know that boat works fine.. with PoP you dont really need the boats any more. unless going to a zone the boat passes through... OOT, TD exc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azuth</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only reason I want the boats back is because some spells I need are only for sale in the bazaar for several grand or in the FV out post.  I just wanted a way to get there without running past half a zone of angry driders.  Luckly for me I got my friend to run interferance so I could get to FV easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantral</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe I have POP but i refuse to use the books for transportation.  Its no fun.  Wizards and Druids used to beable to make money by porting.  Now the only way for them to make money is to farm, And I hate farming.  My SK runs everywhere because the real adventure and fun is getting to where you need to go.  Sure my wizard ports where he can.  But I love a boat ride just as much as the next guy.  I wish they were back too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too like running to destinations, but unfortunately I have encountered just recently a caster who wanted to port me to a location for 100p! I told him 'Thanks. But no thanks.&quot; At which he shouted, &quot;Fine! Use the books then!&quot; That kinda turned me off of porting casters for a while. Looks like its back to SOW and running and the occassional books.<br />
<br />
I vote for the boats back too!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 real minutes is one in-game hour.<br />
72 real minutes is one in-game day.<br />
<br />
Many timers are a multiple of 6.<br />
Spawn times for instance. 6 minutes is a quick spawn and is 2 in-game hours. The luggalds I've spent days camping in torgiran are 24 minute spawns (8 in-game hours).<br />
<br />
A tick is 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure Lay Hands and HT are a base of 72 minute reuse.<br />
For mages, Pet Lay Hands is a base reuse of 36 minutes.<br />
<br />
That's a good summary of timings in EQ. If you can think of anything else, add it.<br />

Pfff, who would ever want resists about 250 each... who would want dungeon mobs lulled to prevent adds... who would want adds charmed, or aoe mezzesd... who would want stackable haste songs... who would want hp/mana regen... and selo's, pfff who needs to run fast =P  Bards are in fact uber.  Because not only can they do all that and more, they can do 3 at a time =D.  I think people who think bards suck haven't seen a good bard.  I'm friends with a bard who can do many things, like solo Phinny (a bard could never do that eh), pull Tawro and Radir across UP to the entrance (and not get adds) then proceed to tank them.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone of us are hardcore gamers whose only purpose in the game is to power level ourselves to 65 in a week and see what kind of uber items we can get before anyone else (assuming there is any more to get that no one has yet.. well aside from anything from LDoN). There are those of us who are RP'ers in the game and play the game to interact with other RP'ers out there, who don't have access to an RPG P&amp;P game. So this is the 'other white meat' in the RPG world. We just enjoy what we see and interact in, and are in the game to enjoy what the developers have created. It may be all hack-n-slash and uber lewt for you, but others out there, its a little more than that. Its also a RP'ers community.</div></div><hr />

The boat rides can be pleasant. Imagine this, if you can:<br />
<br />
You're NOT grouped.<br />
You don't want to be grouped.<br />
You want to socialize.<br />
<br />
I know it's a really concept for some people, but, just try...<br />
<br />
Let's also imagine you don't want to do it in a laggy zone. And besides, what better place to meet people than a boat? You're both going to be there for atleast a LITTLE while.<br />

I was going to ask what I said that was any worse than the snide condecedning comments made to me and wonder why a board admin got involved only when the &quot;unpopular&quot; view replied...forget it though...enjoy...not worth the time. <br />
<br />
The board admins only got involved when we actually read through the entire thread.  I had skimmed it early on, while it was still only a few (less than a dozen) posts long.  At that point in time, it was just an interesting discussion.  I hadn't really looked at it since, until yesterday, when I posted what I did and brought it to the attention of the board owners.  Contrary to popular belief, we all have lives other than this board, so we don't necessarily read every single post in every single thread on the entire board.<br />
<br />
It was in no way directed to any one person, nor did we wait to &quot;get involved only when the unpopular view replied&quot;.  Had I read through the entire thread earlier, the same thing would have been said earlier.  The thread was getting out of hand.  By more than one person.  All that was said was for folks (general) to calm down and either take it to PMs or to FlameVault, or to go back to discussing it in a calm, rational and respectful manner.<br />
<br />
If you want to view that as an attack directed solely at you personally, simply due to the &quot;timing&quot; of the admin posts, there obviously is not much we can say to make you feel differently.</div></div><hr />
