<br />
I have several common UI mods installed, such as tking's spell books, some of his animations, etc.  I have a customized UI per character to give a feel for that character, especially when my g/f is playing.  The patch before the 04/23/03 patch made it more severe, I used to be able to switch characters 2 or 3 times, now I cannot even do this once.  I have to log all the way back to the login to prevent a crash.  It is like, something is stuck in memory. I could rebuild them from scratch, and make my modifications where they are needed, and so forth, documenting in my UI where I changed things, as I have once before, but I don't understand why this is happening.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else having this issue?<br />
<br />
I am running Windows XP fully updated, hardware consists of a P4 1.6 GHz 640 MB ram, GeForce4 64 MB.  I have 3 systems that this issue is happening on, one of them almost mirror's the one listed, the latter is my &quot;mule&quot; system with lesser equipment.</div></div><hr />
