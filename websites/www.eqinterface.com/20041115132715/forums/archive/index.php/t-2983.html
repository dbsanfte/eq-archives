Player Window:<br />
<br />
The Player window is a modification of the Remelio player window. Only addition is, as you see in the pic, the casting bar will cover the mana bar when you cast.<br />
<br />
Pet Window:<br />
<br />
The Stat Page of the Pet Window is a modification of I Can't Remember Who. Changed to mesh with the Player window for stats (added in the Attack so all are available). Also made the window moveable.<br />
<br />
The Pet Page of the Pet Window eliminates the /pet get lost button and doubles the size of the /pet back off button.<br />
<br />
The last page adds some right clickable and frequently swapped items, Primary and Secondary, and the last bag from the inventory where I keep swappable items like weapons and clickies.<br />
<br />
Inventory:<br />
<br />
This is a truly stripped down inventory. No stats (you can find them on the player and pet window) no class symbol, no title, very little wasted space and redundancy. The tall autoequip window is because I do tradeskills and it is useful to have a larger drop window.<br />
<br />
I've been modding my own and tweaking others' mods for my personal use for awhile, now, but this is my first post to a place like this!</div></div><hr />
