<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ommina</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there, perhaps, some interesting trick to have the pretty little coloured con graphic (new with Nov 05 patch) that appears in the Target window to display somewhere OTHER than the far top left hand corner?<br />
<br />
I'm using a modified TargetWindow that is both deeper and wider than the default, and having the colour appear in the top left just looks... silly.<br />
<br />
I tried adding &lt;location&gt; and &lt;size&gt; tags to the new &lt;StaticAnimation&gt; tag with only partial success.  It will happily move around a white version of the texture, but as soon as I target something, I get a -second- copy back in the top lefthand corner.<br />
<br />
So - I'm either doing something remarkably wrong (and I'm willing to believe that), or the programmed nature of the element is giving in an effective location of 0,0 regardless of where I might want it.<br />
<br />
I looked at one of the new UI modifications for today's patch, but it's solution was to just get rid of the coloured bar entirely.<br />
<br />
A tempting solution and the one I've adopted for the moment.  But I'd kinda like to keep it if I could...<br />
<br />
And thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can't figure it out, give me the spec of yout target window or send it to me and I'll make the graphics file for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ommina</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm.  That could work too, good idea - thanks!  I think that I would still prefer the indicator just be moved to the center to avoid it cluttering up too much with the existing elements, but if that isn't going to happen, resizing the graphic strikes me as a good solution.<br />
<br />
And thank you very much for your kind offer to resize the graphic on my behalf (especially given how helpless I am with graphic tools).<br />
<br />
I'll likely, though, inflict the task on my esteemed sister, who has both a love for, and talent with, such graphic work.  (Really, she lives for this kind of thing.)<br />
<br />
Again, though, your kind offer is very much appreciated!<br />

If this thread is more appropriately placed in the 'developer' help section, please don't hesitate to move it.</div></div><hr />

Make a new graphic (.tga) that is the same size as your target window. Make the whole graphic transperant in the alpha channel... all except for the box where you want the color to show. If the graphic is the same size as the window, you can put your visible box anywhere you want in the window... and the graphic will still start at 0,0.<br />
<br />
hope this makes sense.</div></div><hr />
