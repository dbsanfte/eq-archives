<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranger_Lahru</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I don't know squ@t about XML and how to manipulate it to do what I want so its not viable for me to try to create this, there fore I am requesting it as I haven't seen  someone else request this too, course I might be blind to it.  =-\<br />
<br />
I believe I saw what I want in one of the complete sets SOMEWHERE   but I can't seem to find it now.  <br />
<br />
What I am looking for is a horizontal PlayerWindow that I can place on the bottom of my screen under the chat windows and what not that displays AC/ATK, Name, Lvl, HP w/%, MANA w/%, STA w/%, XP w/%, AAXP w/%,  STR, STA, AGI, DEX, WIS, INT, CHA, MR, PR, DR, CR, &amp; FR.  <br />
<br />
All of this in a single or double straight line that will run the length of a 1024 x 768 Resolution. <br />
<br />
It would also be nice to have then background transparent so that all the player sees is the bars and the texts.<br />
<br />
Now the one I saw wasn't exactly like this but similar and if you know what I am talking about please post the link</div></div><hr />
