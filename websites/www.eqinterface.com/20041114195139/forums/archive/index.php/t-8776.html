<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to give this UI a go again but for some reason I can't get it to load with all of the windows in place, they always end up in the default positions. I'm not exactly a GUI dummy which is why I'm so frustrated at this. I put the EQPDA folder where my other UI folders are, renamed the UI_blahblah_01 with my character name and server #, and put it in the main EQ directory. When I log into EQ there my character is with his existing UI but instead of the windows being in the proper place for when i load EQPDA, they're just all in the default position.<br />
I'm going to keep trying to get it right but in the mean time does anyone have any pointers on how to assure that the windows load where they should be? Am I just missing something?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also are you using the command /loadskin EQPDA 1 when youre in game or /loadskin EQPDA ... that 1 makes a huge difference.<br />
<br />
Next when renaming the INI are you using the correct capital letters? This is one case where capitals count.<br />
<br />
Ill try loading the PDA in other rezzes to see if I can duplicate your issue.<br />
<br />
What res are you running?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this skin made for one specific resolution, and if so what is it because it isn't mentioned anywhere. I run 1280 x 1024.<br />
It seems like there's more to it than renaming the ini, plopping the folder in uifiles and loading it with the &quot;1&quot;, I've done all of that with 2 different characters. Could there be something in the eqclient.ini or in some other settings that's making this not work? I am however getting the /viewport setting, that seems to be the only thing that's working atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried it at your resolution and it worked fine. <br />
<br />
It really is that simple Eloora.<br />
<br />
Copy the files in the EQPDA folder. Choose pet window right or bottom. Choose mele or caster. Copy the INI to your EQ folder, rename it to your char name your server number, enter the game and /loadskin EQPDA 1.<br />
<br />
Again it should work at any resolution. The only thing i can think of is up untill today I had never run the INI i sent you at your resolution so it had no settings for that resolution (aka default) which is what happened to you. The PDA doesnt have that many pieces to puzzle together. Compass, Hot Button, Group, Pet window and possibly cast spell. They are locked by the INI but are all movable and lock / unlockable. <br />
<br />
Something else to note. Once you do /loadskin EQPDA 1 when there were no settings for your res then default would be used. Well now the INI has settings for your resolution but sadly they are default locations for all the pieces. The INI is now &quot;corrupted&quot; until you move the windows and relock them in place in turn updating the INI with good locations for your resolution and screen placement.<br />
<br />
If you were to move the PDA to somewhere else on your screen like many people do you would need to unlock all the windows and move them as if they had no settings at all.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry youre not having a good time with my PDA I thought I had made it very easy to install. I guess I have some more work to do on the install front.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had Eloora's issues with the PDA install?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eloora</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i guess i'm not going nuts after all, perhaps it is the ini. And i suppose it wouldn't kill me to just move all of the pieces where i want them, i just wanted to get the best possible configuration if i could.<br />
Sorry 'bout the trouble, ima go play with the ui now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've thought about changing the group / cast spell bar button a little. Do you guys like this better?<br />

PS. I repaired the LFG button. It really works now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Repair for LDoN is awaiting moderation. If you would rather not wait all you need to do is delete the EQUI_Animations.xml file from your EQPDA directory. This assumes you have no other mods mixed with the PDA. The PDA had a small charm slot mod I included cause SOE messed it up on release. Most people dont know its there and wont notice when its gone. So go ahead delete it and save yourself future headaches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Otherwise I love this UI.. I applied Cairrens changes and except for hte part Sony forgot<br />
<br />
[Thu Oct 09 13:10:28 2003] Error: Could not find child AdvLeaderboard_RiskCombobox in window AdventureLeaderboardWnd  I<br />
<br />
Its workin fine for me.<br />
<br />
I dont know much about the pet buffs yet.. Goin to play my necro now..I assume I just wont see em. Might be nice to have an option to have em .. I dunno</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">functional patch for 10-09-03. I will work on the pet buff icons later. Wont be easy to find room on the PDA =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasus</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah when I manually fixed mine.. the buff box blocked part of the pet bar..and I am completely stupid when it comes to doing XML other than if someone like Cairenn gives me EXPLICIT instructions.. I hope yer patch might move the petbuff window a bit.<br />
<br />
Thanx for the speedy patch.. Im gonna try what u did to pet window ot see if its any better than what mess I made of it.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you think you will be able to put F2-F6 on the group.. just curious .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreamlife</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could but I just dont like it. Feel free to alter it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasus</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heeheh dont look at ME to change it &lt;GRIN&gt; I can follow simple instructions that Cairenn gives to fix these things.. BUT I have no IDEA what I am doing other than cut and paste.<br />
<br />
If anyone else feels like doin it.. great.. But prolly more important is the pet buff.. I use the one that goes under the PDA thingie.. Would love to use it.. However when I make the changes.. the lil buff box covers the  buttons somewhat.. Can someone just make simple change (I hope) to move the buff box off to the left or right of the BOTTOM positioned PetInfo window?<br />
<br />
Why in the world SOE wouldnt make that its OWN window .. well is beyond me &lt;GRIN&gt;  Maybe there is a reason xml stupid me cannot even begin to comprehend.<br />
<br />
So please.. if ya can make that bottom petinfo window have the buff window just shifted off the buttons for the time being.. I would be most grateful (and if ya really want me happy anyone put F2-F6 next to the group members for my cleric and necro )</div></div><hr />
