<br />
Timer is for those headaces, am i counting too fast, too slow???  anyways its a great thing to use!<br />
<br />
Maps usually i have it streched out across the entire screen but i had to limit it so i could post this.<br />
<br />
Rombus's UI and crap to get there you can go to the FoH board go the the thread probly on bout the 6-10th page now and it has numberd %'s or something in the title, anyways rombus rocks<br />
<br />
I have Tkings spells and stuff like that, my spell book is a cleric healing or rezzing some girl which i thought was a little better for me since i am a cleric then the Neriak spell book ive been using, which is on the old page under spell booksm both look great.<br />
<br />
The compas Thank you VI is great and unchanged, you cant reallyu improve on that anyways.<br />
<br />
Well sorry its so cluttered but i had to get it all in there so here it is if you want to know more specifically where i got any of it i can direct you where i did it, dont really know how to zip up files =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blyte</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how does that timer works? can you reset it without /loadskin &lt;name&gt; 1<br />
<br />
if so, how about a clue on where to get it from?<br />
<br />
I like the idea of combining it with the hotkey window though.. nice work and good idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dastante</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK i never reset the timer but i hear you can by doing what you said... both links to those are found here ...<br />
<br />
[url]http://eqtoolbox.not.net/modules.php?name=Downloads&amp;d_op=viewdownload&amp;cid=31[/ur<br />
<br />
<br />
i forgot to mention the timer resets at 1 hr, so it goes back to 0. no real need to reset it<br />
 ive found this really really helpful cause every 2 hours or so i have to log to restart my comp or the Dorms computer system boots me =/<br />
<br />
Also on the maps ive found 3 mistakes or porblems just to help yout out   there is no Grey map there is no Vex thal map and Kael is in KUNARK NOT VELIOUS  but its not too hard to figure out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dastante</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea whatever i worded that wrong, they put the map in Kunark not in velious  is what i was getting at. unless they have released new versions of the mod</div></div><hr />
