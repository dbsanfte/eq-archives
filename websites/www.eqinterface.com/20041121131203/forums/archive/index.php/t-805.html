<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some aspects of a design that have nothing to do with graphics or making things pretty, but with how to arrange an interface.  It's partly about what controls to put in each window, and partly about the size and location of each window.<br />
<br />
Clerics (and other healers) like elaborate group windows with percents, labels, full size pet bars, and no transparency.  Most classes don't.<br />
<br />
Warrior/monk types like to see their ATK, AC, STR, STA, DEX, stamina, and so forth, but don't need spell gems and mana bars.  Casters are the opposite.<br />
<br />
Rangers and bards like to have a few inventory slots shown so they can switch weapons easily and often.  Sometimes others do too, but not so much.<br />
<br />
Certain classes obviously don't need a pet window, certain other classes obviously do.<br />
<br />
Buff icons aren't sufficient, not even when they're huge.  The actual text names of the buffs are needed.  The text names of memorized spells aren't always needed though.<br />
<br />
It's annoying to see the top line of text in a window cut off so you can see only the bottom half of the letters.  (or is that just me?)<br />
<br />
If you put all your controls along the bottom of your screen you won't be able to loot corpses without looking down.  You won't even be able to see the corpse if the controls aren't transparent.  Changing the viewport helps a little, but if you reduce the height of the viewport without making it narrower you still cut off some of what's at your feet.  Either find a way to put more controls along the edge of the screen instead of the bottom or leave a gap underneath the controls for clicking on corpses, snakes, and other short things.<br />
<br />
Most title bars should be removed, only a few windows need them.<br />
<br />
Just like people can tell which window is which without the title bars, they can generally tell that a number is a percentage even without the little % sign next to it.<br />
<br />
It's possible to remove every single gauge and replace it with a percent but most people like the gauges, and often want them to be even bigger and more readable.<br />
<br />
New windows can't be created, you can only re-use the standard windows.  Buttons cannot be moved between windows.  Hotbuttons, spell gems, buff icons, coins, and the autoequip box are also stuck in their original windows.  The player window blinks red when autoattack is on, the buff icons arrange themselves, the container windows resize themselves, the breath and casting windows open and close themselves, the merchant slots have a yellow box when selected, all the chat windows have an edit box, and many tooltips are set automatically -- those things can't be changed.<br />
<br />
Mixing the breath bar in with the other bars is not such a good idea -- it becomes too easy to miss or ignore the fact that you're drowning if there isn't a pop-up box.  You can't use the breath window for anything else anyway, it doesn't stay open.<br />
<br />
If you set Style_Titlebar to false, you better set Style_Minimizebox to false also.<br />
<br />
Don't delete buttons or other standard controls, just set the size to 0 by 0.<br />
<br />
Anyone have more rules of design that everyone should follow?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To load your skin without changing your window locations use a 1 and the end of the loadskin command. <br />
/LoadSkin Name 1  <br />
<br />
Just place the changed XML files in your skin folder. You do not have to copy all the default directory files in there.  Will make your life easier if VI add any more files to default.<br />
