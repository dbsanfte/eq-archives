If there is not a tool... please try to explain how to create a own mod since it seems I can't find out myself :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlorepdarkhelm</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.... there's no quick and easy way to make your own mod.  takes a little patience, as you have to read through and learn the XML (which isn't overly complicated), if you want new pictures, you prolly will need some sort of graphics editor (I use the one at www.gimp.org, but that could be a massive undertaking just figuring that one out on it's own - as it wasn't designed to be.....user friendly).  for reading the XML, just use a text editor (in windows, there's Notepad and Wordpad available under accessories - of the two, I'd prefer the latter, not the former).  And umm.....  look around on this site, there's been a couple &quot;howtos&quot; written and posted in these forums - but there is no *easy* way to explain how to do this, nor a quick and easy method to build your own from scratch, especially if you have never dealt with XML before (or it's predecessor, HTML).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HONTER1</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hiya when i first started doing this and am still vary new at it but the fist thing i did was open up people custiom xml files and compare them to the orgnail then i go in and change the size of the window or change the color of the text some where and get a fell for what its doing there is no real problem with totly messing up and not being able to fix back to the orgnail since all you have to do i run patcher and set it back to the defalut as far as makeing them i have to save after ever lil change and befor a change i mess up that much lol but its quite fun to do lil things i made a few mods that people have asked for dunno all i can say is play around with it get a fell for it :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Honter said. Don't worry about Gimp yet. Gimp is a graphic editor and I will tell you now, if you don't know how to modify the XML, you're NOT gonna get trying the images.<br />
<br />
Play with it and for gods sake, use your UIErrors.txt file! It's located right in your EverQuest directory. When you skin crashes EQ or fails to load, the error is always written into that file.<br />
So many people ask questions here when their answers are located in the error file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrancelee</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My question is, once you change code, how can you view it?  I may be overlooking the obvious here, I don't know.  Do you have to open up eq and load it, just to see how it will look?  Or is there a way to view each mod individually?  With all the mods out, I don't need to write my own, I will just hunt and peck through all that's there already.  However, I might not want the whole package, but instead just one window here and there.  I have what I like now, but I'd like to be able to compare, say two inventory windows, side by side out of game to see which I like better.  Is this possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

*cought*the obvious<br />
<br />
And your second question should be answered really by the first.<br />
<br />
Since you can only, for now, view/preview the UI within EQ, there is no way to look at two identical windows side by side.<br />
<br />
Well, there &quot;is&quot;, but that requires killing one window and making it also an INV window. Far too much work to even think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Silver</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually - as for viewing the windows side-by-side outside of EQ, do what I do whenever I'm making adjustments to one of my windows: in EQ, screenshot.  I then open the screenshot in Photoshop (any graphics editor will do, of course), the crop the image down to the one window.  Do it for the other screenshot, and now you have a view of both windows side by side.  Or in your face if you're debating exaclty what adjustments you were wanting to make.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, screen shots work two. You can can both ui mods in two different directories and use /load &lt;&gt; 1 to load each of them.<br />
<br />
I can't recall if /load &lt;&gt; 1 will also close the normally closed window or not (like INV).<br />
<br />
But, using a screeny works well. Just screen shot each of your INV windows and you can view them side by side offline.<br />
<br />
<br />
And .. Lets work on leaving out speak of that one program now. I think it's got enough say here, time to keep it's speak behind the scenes now.<br />
It's not that I don't like it, it's that I'm trying to protect it. More speak of it means more poeple using it which means more VI might try to intentionally break it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zublin</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here is a program you can see what you have created and such<br />
http://www.sidlwidl.com/downloads/sidlwidl0.2.9.zip<br />
<br />
You NEED THE .NET FRAMEWORK FROM MICROSOFT or it will just crash on startup. You can download it here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads...ompositedoc.xml<br />

While this is a great file - unfortunately for those of us who are not familiar with scripts or any kind of html or anything - its still a bit confusing to figure out exactly what its saying. <br />
<br />
But I am definitely going to download sidlwidl and i'll let you know how it works...<br />
<br />
completely html/xml illiterate but very creative :)<br />
<br />
OK Ill just add to this instead of creating another post - <br />
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU so much Zublin :) :)<br />
<br />
I downloaded those two programs you listed, went to http://home.triad.rr.com/slkerr/files/XML_T_1.htm  and found out what to look for and how to use sidl and http://www.amaprotu.net/eqtypes.html to find out what i could change. i havent tried it yet but this is the most newbie information I have seen. Thank you so much!</div></div><hr />
