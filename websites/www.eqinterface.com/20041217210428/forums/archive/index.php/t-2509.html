<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alpacapagani</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in my opinion, it'd just be useless......I mean seriously why would anyone want to /loadskin random_holiday_ui for one day and then switch back to their default skin?  Doesn't seem like it would be a big hit.  Not to burst your bubble or anything tho ;) <br />

Jeez, that'd be like putting up Christmas lights and decorating the tree... and tearing it all down the next day :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pheonixheart</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey I'd like it!  hehe i'm always changing things on my pc and whatnot, even in eq i change things around all the time for something new.  I love samhain!  w00t!  Granted nothing too outrageous or distracting that would take away from the game, but if you type in the &quot;/loadskin holiday 1&quot; instead of /loadskin holiday it keeps your old settings so you wouldn't have to re do everything =P    Anyhow I think that's a nifty idea  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vixyn</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol :) Was going to work on one for christmas (my buddy is a big fan of christmas stuff)... is is harder than heck to find good images on the net :( I searched for elves... and I won't even repeat what I got back ~shudders~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think on the week of Yule that Verant should alter the program in the game and make all the elves look like the elves we've all grew up on with Santa Claus.. that would definately throw people into a loop... let alone a complete laugh... Just imagine a week before your elf was completely decked out (on pun intended) in shiny plate and weilding a beautiful shimmering long sword, only to find on the week of celebration walking around in tight green tunics and red/white striped pants with a pointed green cap, and the sword becomes a huge candy cane... Hehehehe!<br />
<br />
/sniffs the air.. Thinks to himself &quot;Wow I feel real good! Say is that natural gas I smell?&quot;<br />

<br />
Could have all the Sarnak become elves or just wear the hats.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.<br />
