I was wondering if anyone has some sort of UI editor, anyone will do i suppose, i just want to try them out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try search on &quot;editor&quot;  =)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, Notepad seems to be the popular choice. Or just any XML editor.<br />
<br />
There is (currently) no Graphical EQ UI Editor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've looked all over the place for a good XML editor, but having no grounding in the subject, found all the specific XML editors to be more complex than raw code in Notepad. Although it looks daunting initially, start small with simply adjusting the x,y positions of pieces of an existing window. Once you get the hang of that, look at how files are kinked through things like EQUI_animations.xml, and an understanding of the syntax begins to form.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the code itself is fairly intuitive, and you can get most simple things done by just adjusting existing files. If the original files don't have all the items you want, find a mod that does, and tailor that to your needs. Unless you're trying to do something way original, there are so many mods out there, one of them probably has all the elements you need in a window, even if they aren't laid out exactly how you want.<br />

Take your Notebook in your hands, and go fiddle. You can't permenantly break anything if you're working in a non-default directory</div></div><hr />

<br />
UltraEdit is a  good choice for a editor I know quit a few people on the these boards use it. It lays out the XML code and has lots of options to customs the editor the way you like it.<br />
<br />
-Dark</div></div><hr />

Honestly, it's what your comfortable in.<br />
I just like setting up hotkeys I already got and such in Coldfusion with tag auto-complete on to save me finger pain on adding those, hehe.<br />
That's why I quit my bard, Programming + bard = p41|\|</div></div><hr />
