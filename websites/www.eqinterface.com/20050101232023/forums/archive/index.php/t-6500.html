Romelio, thank you for the fix to put the charm slot in the King Inventory XML.  It went in there perfectly.  The only question that remains for me is that using that patch on the ornate versions like the &quot;king-inv-1&quot; on the UIBuilder, the charm slot seems kind of generic, and looks exactly like the one used by my characters that use default (an impression of a charmlike item).  Is this something that needs to be customized by the original author?  Wait and see sorta thing?<br />

A Skinner is someone able to figure out how to use the layers, has software able to do layers and good enough with art to give the rest of us something to use other than the old black marble look of things.  I imagine that Remelio will get around to adding the Charm slot as soon as all the many changes start to stabilize, so I would just wait it out. :)</div></div><hr />

Someone just needs to modify it to make it match your other slot graphics..</div></div><hr />

t.king and Remmy have inventories with the new charm slot just about ready to go.  At least one (probably more) will be ready to go before LoY actually goes live.</div></div><hr />
