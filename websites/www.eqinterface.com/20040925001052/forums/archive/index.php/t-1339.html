<br />
I've been working on new window backgrounds for my UI.  It all works well, so that's great.  There is one problem, in Paintshop, the colors are bright and vibrant.  Once I get the graphics into the game all the color seems to fade out.  Kind of like I washed my UI too many times.<br />
<br />
Anyone else encounter this color washing phenomenon?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure this isn't caused by setting the background colour of your EQ windows to a bright colour?<br />
<br />
Also check the Gamma Correction setting of EQ. Chances are, if things are too bright/dark in EQ, it's because the Gamma setting is off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Inertia</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try looking at settings concerning your printer setup, even if you have no printer.  I know Corel has a default setting to &quot;Autocorrect&quot; your colors to match what the printer will put out.  Maybe what you are using does as well.  This results in exactly what you describe.  Turn this feature (bug) off, and it may help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pure</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have this version or close. Once you have chosen the graphic file to edit goto COLORS - ADJUST<br />
<br />
That will bring up a list of changes you can do. Most popular I use for EQ are Gamma Correction - Red Green Blue -  Hue Map - and Brightness/Contrast.<br />
<br />
As far as how to use each that just takes patience and just do a simply change at a time and KEEP PSP OPEN - That way just a simple Undo away from fixing :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
After drawing everything the way I liked it in paintshop, I reduced the picture's gamma by 50%.<br />
<br />
I'll have to look more to see if the colors are bleached.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone.</div></div><hr />

Most people crank them up a bit to make seeing easier</div></div><hr />

<br />
for my avatar/sig, I had to adjust the color (wolf had a large red tint to it because of lighting)   still has some.</div></div><hr />
