<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilcure</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buddy of mine in my guild is our target caller, and he said he's been having problems picking his cursor out of the raid crowd, due in part to the fact that he's color blind.  I asked him what colors would work best and he said Blue and Yellow.  I suggested a flashing cursor of those colors with a targeting area in the center and he said it sounded like a good idea.  So I got to working on it.  Here's first prototype, the colored area cycles through and the center is semi-transparent.<br />
<br />
If there's interest i'm also thinking of making all the dragging cursors and such along the same theme in a grey scale format for others to use. <br />
<br />
Comments Critisizm?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, I should talk, I haven't even made a linear one! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issey</div><div class="date">01-17-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice idea and result! I like that it is (or seems to be) a stand alone - one could get their ui the way they liked it, copy it to a second folder called fight - add your cursor and then just switch between skins depending on which they needed. (I'm thinking this because tradeskills with your idea would most likely be a pain) The color changes are a great idea, too.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, could they cursor be made to flash like the player box does when attack is on? Me hates when I stand there like a goof and miss a few swings cause I hit the wrong button. Wanders off to read 'what the ui can't do' once again. . .</div></div><hr />

<br />
as for the animation i would make it ramp up and down in a few frames  rather than have it flashing all the time.. just something a little smoother</div></div><hr />

I agree with the suggestion on the not constantly flashing part.  Maybe every 30 seconds or less it does the flash.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilcure</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finished the greyscale version today and posted it in released...unfortunatly there's no way to do a cursor without changes to animation file but it's in one section of it and will be very easy to track.  It ocsilates pretty slow and isn't obtrusive I've been real happy with it.<br />
<br />
I'm posting the colorized  version of it tommorow it took a little more work then I thought it would.<br />
<br />
Look for colorized one in the released section in next day or so.</div></div><hr />

It's not really a flash it's kind of a slow oscillation between the tones.</div></div><hr />

When you think it'll be available?  I'm excited to try it.  :D <br />

Not known too many people who are partially color blind.  Maybe we just don't mention it ;)  I am pink/purple (or at least that is what they called it) color blind.  Had never heard of it until I joined the military.  But I can't distinguish certain shades - really bites because I like to fool with graphics and such - lol<br />

might be easy to code in...<br />

will find out.. <br />

but great idea.. cant wait to see it completed..</div></div><hr />

Pop over to that thread I realease and uploaded the files yesterday.<br />

There is both a greyscale and a blue and yellow one there.</div></div><hr />

It kinda takes control and wanders all around til it finds a nitch to rest in. When I close the spellbook, it's back to normal.  Any solution for this, perhaps?:confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks for any input.<br />

While i suffer from mild colour blindness, its never really affected my game play, however, i have a friend who is severely colour blind, and often looses his curser... as a result neither of us is much on clicking.  <br />

It amazes me however that no one has thought of this idea before... big kudos to you !</div></div><hr />
