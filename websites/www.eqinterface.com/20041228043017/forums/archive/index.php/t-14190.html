<br />
One <br />
The beginning of our new advertising contract with SOE! Yes, we have finally gotten recognized by SOE and we have worked out a deal to advertise for them. <br />
<br />
We want to thank our previous advertiser. They were there when we needed them and we only wish them well in the future! <br />
<br />
Second<br />
EQ2Interface.com is open! Right now we only have a couple of forums, but we have been told that SOE will read often. So head over and introduce register and introduce yourself!<br />
<br />
We have it on good authority that when EQ2 gets into beta we are on the list to be offered beta slots. Don't email us with questions, as one Dev said &quot;When I know something, you will know something!&quot; When I get details I will post them over there!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qinadwen</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I can understand why Kudane has &quot;An_Admin_01&quot; under his name as a title - how did you, Bikther, get &quot;99% EVIL, 1% Cute Bunnies&quot; ?? Is it a  right to change that comes with a certain number of posts?<br />
<br />
And is it possible / will it be possible to change ones display name ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">200+ posts you get custom title</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qinadwen</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oj, thanks m8 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">200+ posts you get custom title<br />
Well I got over 600 posts and I don't see the option anywhere?? Could you possibly show where you can change this option?? Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well with the forum update the way custom titles are handled have changed. Now its based upon usergroup and not post count. I could make it so your usergroup changes to a group that has access to custom titles after 200 posts but then its a mess because I have to set a tun more permissions just for that group.<br />
<br />
I may just open the custom titles up to every one. Just need to think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh no worries... I was just wondering... Don't implement it on part of my behalf.. *chuckle*</div></div><hr />
