<br />
then everytime you launched eq, it would check to see if your current default files and the backed up was alike, if they werent, it would generate a few patch files with the changes in, that could again be injected into any mod you choose?<br />

I am not a very skilled programmer, but given time, probly months i could probly get something like this done... but i know there is alot of extremely skilled programmers out there, maybe a good idea you could look at.</div></div><hr />

That's really not a bad idea. That would save this server alot of load, as well as saving alot of headaches. One thing tho is that there's a possibility that it would get messed up with a bad patch (which are so frequent). BUT, if you could make it to recognize the changes done with certain skins, and record them, alot of skins may be fixable... and if they aren't, then the skinner should possibly have an easier time tracking down the problem.</div></div><hr />
