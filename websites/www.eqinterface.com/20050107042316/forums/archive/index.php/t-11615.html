<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andernew</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking for a bit of help finding an adventure window and all the LDON related windows to plug into my UI. For some reason it does not seem to want to allow me to view my adventure status, leaderboard, or adventure merchants. If anyone can point me in the right direction or maybe show me a list of what adventure files need to be in the folder I would be much obliged. :) If you need anything to help me figure this out dont hesistate to ask. I am still pretty new at this.</div></div><hr />

Do you have a custom EQUI.xml file?  If so, does it have the appropriate &lt;Include&gt; lines?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilee Castus</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh wow, I have been scouring the site looking for answers to this problem.  Let me see if I can explain the problem a bit more &amp; I hope it helps in finding a solution.  Please bear in mind I am a total newbie when it comes to UI stuff and I am just happy to be able to install one :o .<br />
<br />
OK, I am running a custom UI based on an older version of Talyn's Tablets UI.  I have added different individual mods to tailor it to my needs.  ie. Spell buttons, 80-slot merchant window, different bank mods.<br />
<br />
When in game I pull up adventure window at any given time and under the stats/records option the button just presses but the only screen available is the main adventure screen(the one that tells you the mission, progress &amp; time left.)  In order to see my stats or leaderboard I have to load default UI then switch back when done.  Is there some file I need to move or change in order to access Adventure stats/leaderboard with a custom UI ?<br />
<br />
I hope this got explained clear enough as I am not real good at this UI stuff.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any ideas or help.<br />
