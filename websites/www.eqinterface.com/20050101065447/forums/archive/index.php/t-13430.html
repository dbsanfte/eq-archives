<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">moix5th</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If at all possible i would like to see IceBlast (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=1997) updated. I've been trying to find a good all around UI for quite some time now, I used to use this one and want to go back to using it but its broke due to many many patches. Please if anyone has the time or know how to update it I would be very appericative!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kasiryn</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoever did that UI based most of it on the Vert UI and a few window seperates from that section, at least that is what it looks like to me. Go to the downloads section then featured section then Vert section, I'll bet you will find what you want there updated and ready to install. The inventory window is in the inventory section (sorry cant recall name), but the mp3 player i have not seen before.</div></div><hr />

Im going though all the patch updates in the Archives and fixing em one by one, if anyone else cares to help by all means the more the better/easier!<br />
<br />
Also i keep getting xml errors like this one for example:<br />
<br />
&quot;XML reference error! Ui2DAnimation[6]:A_BuffFrameTop[502] referenced but NEVER declared!&quot;<br />
<br />
If you know whats wrong and mind helping me out tell me what it means, im new to xml and learning fast :)<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
