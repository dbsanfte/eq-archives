<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eriadoc</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I copied EQUI_RaidWindow.xml from default into my custom UI directory.  I then made sure that my EQUI.xml had reference to this file.  Furthermore, I copied dragitems_23/24/25.tga to my custom UI directory.  Take a look in your UIErrors.txt in your EQ directory to see what is failing when you try and load your skin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tapioka</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After todays patch (10/31/02) I was crashing to desktop after character selection screen trying to load a character using a Vert 2.2 based UI. Looking around for a fix, I collected some tips from different threads and posts and now have my vert mod working. Hopefully this will help some of you.<br />
<br />
1) Copied the file EQUI.xml from my default folder to my custom UI folder (where you are keeping your vert mod files).<br />
<br />
2) Once EQUI.xml is copied over to your custom directory, delete line 20 and 21, should be these:<br />
<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_LoadskinWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_AlarmWnd.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
These lines should be towards the bottom of the text after:<br />
<br />
        &lt;Include&gt;EQUI_PlayerNotesWindow.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
3) I also followed the directions in this thread <br />
<br />
EQUI_Animations.xml changes  (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3192)<br />
<br />
I am still getting the message something like &quot;Some of your XML files won't be working correctly&quot; (sorry don't remember the exact text) when I log or zone. I also now am able to use the raid window using the vert mod, something i wasn't able to do before todays patch. I am still not able to use the newer minimum/maxiumum price option in the bazaar window, I think i saw a fix for this in another thread, but i'm just happy to get vert working again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Made no changes at all to my situation. I still crash to desktop from char select screen, even with all this done, and done correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalara2002</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just copy EQUI_RaidWindow.xml to all of your custom skins folders. Thats it! Unless you don't keep up-to-date with the game then you may have to copy more files. Which if so read error ui.log and replace all those files that have problems. =) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eriadoc</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Omnedon, what is your UIError.txt reporting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dsipo</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok well i will put in my 2cp here. If it hasnt been said in which im sure it has been, there are ways of fixing the crash for eq when you log onto your character after the new patch. It is because these lines:<br />
<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_RaidWindow.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_RaidOptionsWindow.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
Are not in your Equi.xml file in your customized ui folder. Just open up Equi.xml with notepad and add in those lines in the arrporiate place and add the 2 new XML files to the directory as well they should be labled raidwindow.xml and raidoptionwin.xml not sure though but it helps. :D <br />

I deleted my custom UI.<br />

I made a new folder in my uifiles.<br />

I copied ALL FILES from my uifiles\default file.<br />

I pasted them into my new, uifiles\new folder.<br />
<br />
I downloaded my UI again and unzipped it into the uifiles\new folder and let it overwrite all the files.<br />
<br />
I changed my UISKIN= &quot;old UI&quot;, in the eqclient.ini  back to UISKIN=Default.<br />

I logged into game...hurray! I got in without being booted. Default mode is working at least...now time to see if I can load my old custom UI.<br />

I cannot right click to make a new chat window.  right clicking on any window anywhere brings a tiny little object that looks like it is supposed to pop up and say something...   Raiding with my guild in ToV last night was neat because I had to know what spells I was getting from my spellbook from memory</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futility</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK... here is a last ditch fix for anyone who just wants to get in.<br />
<br />
Go to the UI_&lt;charname&gt;.ini file for the character you want to sign on with.<br />
<br />
There is a setting called 'UI(something)=&lt;name of your custom ui&gt;<br />
<br />
Change this to 'UI(something)=default'<br />
<br />
This will reset the ui for that character to the default ui.<br />
<br />
This will of course not fix the problem with your custom UI, but will at least allow you to get into the game and zone reliably.<br />
<br />
Also, once in a zone, you should be able to /load &lt;customui&gt; 1 while you are in the zone.  Don't forget to /load default 1 prior to zoneing or you will get booted.<br />
<br />

<br />
PlayerWindow.xml<br />
<br />
For some odd reason this window has given me many problems since I removed the PetHP tag from it. (I moved all the info from this window to my group window). Even though there is absolutely no reference to this child tag PetHP, it still seems to search for it. So I put it back in and located it off the viewing area and problem was solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are using certain mods (mine, Kaori, Vert and others included) that modify EQUI.xml or EQUI_Animations.xml, they WILL NOT work if you copy the default one over. Same goes for various other files, depending on the mod. If you want to use a complete custom UI developed by somebody else, you have two choices when Sony patches: either use default till the developer comes out with a fix, or know enough about xml that you can go into your UIErrors file, figure out what's wrong with which file, and fix it. If you start just deleting/copying over whatever file somebody tells you to, you'll most likely only end up making things worse for yourself.<br />
<br />
Oh, and re: the playerwindow thing, I had same problem, you just need to put the pethp gauge back in and set it to size 0,0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnedon</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a mix of Vert, Zeremus, and the Old EQ UI. The way that I did it works fine, but I don't plan on leaving it that way, because the files will be affected every time there is a patch.<br />
<br />
It worked well for me last night, when no one could figure out a fix that would work in all situations.<br />
<br />
The fix that I posted on this thread worked for everyone in the Chat last night, literally hundreds of folks.<br />
<br />
I DO understand that when you copy/paste the uifiles default folder contents into a blank cutom UI folder, and then unzip or paste your custom UI OVER the copied/pasted default files, you leave your Custom UI open to get screwed in the next patch that changes any files.<br />
<br />
So, although it is not a perfect fix, at least it worked for now, and we all were able to get back on and join the Halloween quests.</div></div><hr />

where do you go to download UI?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnedon</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now the UI I use has been updated, so you can download a new version...well the main one. I use a mixed version.<br />
<br />
Let me explain. Perhaps 'download' was not the correct word.<br />
<br />
I did a select all\copy in my custom UI folder. I pasted it into a file on my desktop. Then I deleted my custom UI folder and made a new, empty one.<br />
<br />
So, I &quot;select all\copy&quot; from the &quot;uifiles\default&quot; file.<br />
<br />
Pasted it into my brand new, empty, custom ui file.<br />
<br />
Then did a &quot;select all\copy&quot; of my custom files that I had moved to the file on my desktop.<br />
<br />
Opened up my new custom UI folder, which now has all the default files in it, and pasted the custom files back in....when it prompted me about overwriting I selected &quot;yes to all&quot;.<br />
<br />
What that did was put ALL the default files in my custom folder, then placed my ui files over them. Any NEW files made by the patch on the 31st were now in place in my custom folder, allowing the UI to function properly now.<br />
<br />
But understand, when you have all the default files in your custom UI, it leaves your UI open for getting screwed with each patch that changes any of those default files. So this was only a temporary fix.<br />
<br />
Now, my main UIs, Zeremus and Vert are both updated, so I just use the updated version now and have deleted that other folder.<br />
<br />
It worked for many, many people who were in the chat room, freaking on the GMs, who could do nothing but sit in there with their tongues hanging out..<br />
<br />
If I were you, and hadn't been able to get my UI working this long after the patch, I woul delete my UI completely, go to Vert, or Zeremus (ZW3), or whoever,  and download their version anew, as if it were for the first time.<br />
<br />
If you like some of the things, but not all, then do like me....use their UI as a base UI, and add changes to it as you like.</div></div><hr />

First I got the XML isn't loading upon zoning crap. Then I got the &quot;crash to desktop when you enter game or try to zone with UI&quot; crap.<br />

This is the only thing I did.<br />

I put the EQUI and latest Raid window stuff in my CUSTOM folder.<br />

I then opened my XML File and added these two lines to the end of the area where INCLUDES are, since it was not there.<br />

&lt;Include&gt;EQUI_RaidOptionsWindow.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
