Like the failure of lords of everquest... all they market to is existing EQ customers... as I don't see any heavy duty advertising to pull new people in...</div></div><hr />

There is nothing truely compelling in EQ2 to get me to switch.  I'm actually looking at World of Warcraft for my next MMORPG whenever I decide to leave EQ.  Now that's compelling to me.<br />

While I'm no advocate of Micro$haft, in reality there is only so long they can support a 5 year old OS. It stretches there &quot;Live Team&quot; to thin. <br />
<br />
I know the initial upgrade for me from Win2K to WinXp Pro was a difficult one so I can sympathize.  But just buckle down and make the transition.  WinXP is a good stable OS (If you take care of it) with lots of nice features.<br />
The price does kind of suck though.  <br />
Here is an idea...  Do what I did.  Ask a friend who's in college to get you a copy.  They get a nice discount on &quot;Student Versions&quot; which are identical to &quot;regular versions&quot;.  If you don't have any College buddies just get the Upgrade.  It's the exact same version as the full except for the little script that askes for your CD of your previous OS (In your case I guess that would be your Win98 Disk) and VIOLA!  You're cooking with Gas.<br />
<br />
Happy holidays!</div></div><hr />

The game is not just a new version of the current game.. its a whole new game concept set in the EQ world..<br />
<br />
SOE doesn't expect its current player base to switch.. the hope some will play both (thats why they have incentive). But with over 450,000 subscribers they won't be closing the doors on EQ anytime in the near future.. <br />
<br />
I know there is at least 1 more expansion behind GoD, (hinted at 2) just from my visit.<br />
<br />
The MMORPG market is growing, not just in the games coming out, but the people playing them. One study says that by 2010, as many as 1 in 4 people around the world could be playing a MMO game of some sort. (don't have any idea how accurate that is though). <br />
<br />
Sooo have no fear, EQ 1 is in no danger from EQ 2.. mmaaaaaaaaybe it could be in trouble from EQ 3  if they make that down the road (say 3 to 5 more years).<br />

<br />
Let me say that again:  <br />
<br />
As long as you continue to pay for EverQuest, and it makes money, Sony will keep it running. <br />
<br />
So it doesn't matter how many games come out, what new games SoE makes, etc.  As long as enough money goes their way from EQ, it'll still be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sokol</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also have to understand every game has a life span, and EQ is on it's down fall. It may last a few years yet, but it will come down. The fact is when you have a EQ1 and EQ2 when a NEW person goes to the computer store they see 2 titles, they are going to buy the sequel it's inevitable. Now sure there may be a few who get EQ1 due to their friends playing etc, but with new sales not hapening, and only new income coming from Expansions, and the adventual lack of material for expansions it IS inevitable EQ will stagnate. You will see more accounts sold on ebay for less and less when this begins to happen. It's only a matter of how long the current subscribers remain. Sony knows this, and thats why the all access pass. that way you will buy EQ2, as will all the new comers and yet you will STILL pay for EQ1.<br />
Now I'm NOT saying it's going to decline quickly but it will decline just because of the sequal part. Now if they named it &quot;Avalonia World of Wounder!&quot; Or some such not Everquest2 this may not have happened, but it will. <br />
<br />
MMPORPG's are the way of the future every game even the crapy ones take a few more players with every realease. With the new player base going to EQ2 it's only a matter of time. Some may disagree but sequels ALWAYS outlast the predecesor. For those that played EQ1 as their first MMPORPG is will always have a special place in your heart, like UO did for me (Love player housing and GOOD player tradeskills) but to all things a time comes to move on, and where the game stagnates. You will adventualy see every one having a 65, or yes adventualy 70th lvl players (Or whatever they up the levels to next) every where you turn. <br />
<br />
As long as you continue to pay for EverQuest, and it makes money, Sony will keep it running <br />
<br />
That is what will keep it going, but it will be a stagnated Eq full of only ALT's and 65th lvl characters. and then attrition/boredom set in. Who knows how long it will take but thats the future of any MMPORPG; Stagnation. Every thing has an end, some things just clutch to life longer.<br />
