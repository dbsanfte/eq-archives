3 guilds on the rallos zek server have awoken and killed the sleeper, a wizard whos name begins with a T got the kill shot.  So what happens if the sleeper dies?  no one knows yet, but remember the first line in the EQ2 lore states<br />
 &quot;Five hundred years have passed since the Sleeper was awakened, and a turbulent new era has fallen upon Norrath.&quot;<br />

No loot, no faction hits, no storyline text, just the respect of the 4500+ people following through chat channels and countless more who will learn of this feat tomorrow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taleisin</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well it did do one thing, for the first time in 5 years the game virtually stood still no hunting, no camping, no XP grinding.  almost ever just stood still waiting for news of what happens when he dies, what does he drop and other such questions.<br />
<br />
also the sleeper never respawns once he has been awakened, win or lose, Rallos Zek is one of the last servers he had not been woken up on.  as far as I know the UK server, Firiona vie, and the asian server have not woken the sleeper.<br />
<br />
grats to everyone who fought the bastige :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Profett</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sat there for like 3 1/2 hours, from the first warder to Sleeper waiting for them to kill him. It was just intense sitting there hearing the HP updates, and how the battle was progressing.<br />
<br />
I was on the phone with a RL friend of mine while he was fighting Kerafyrm, clerics had to practically chain rez.. as soon as you started attacking *blam* hit for 7k and dead again.<br />
<br />
I was disspointed to hear that there was no loot, no serverwide announcement .. nothing.  I heard that there was a faction hit but not sure what it was, he had too much battle spam to tell me if he got one or not.  The post on eqlive.com about the Sleeper encounter was simply stupid as well,  oh well.<br />
<br />
The name of the wizard who got the killing blow was Trylun, a big congrats AD, Wudan, and MIM.  You have the respect of thousands of players now, too bad the kill didn't have a more satisfying reward .. like some kinda Death Touch proccing sword.<br />
We can always wish, eh.</div></div><hr />

But I had to shut off my ooc/auction/shout/guildsay just so I could get on with my game. It was being spammed up one side, down the other of every single zone.  It got frustrating.<br />
<br />
Congrats to the folks at Rallos who did it, however.  As someone else told me, 'The King of all Zergs' was successful.</div></div><hr />

Like a staff with 200int or a bracer with like 2khp. That wouldve been cool, or some kind of symbolic item that you can equip , like a staff with a huge dragon head that has no stats, just to show you killed it. Believe that wizard got a title out of it.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I have to give this event my &quot;Whoopty sh!t&quot; award. About as impactive as if some guild killed the whole coldain city.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
It was killed, there are some screenshots located in this thread at the mage compendium:<br />
http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=9189<br />
<br />
What happened was, 3 guilds came together the first time, to try, even though they figured they would probably not succeed.  However, they ended up having enough clerics that they just chain rezzed tanks as they died (with pets, archers and unresistable spells doing the real damage).  The sleeper ended up slowly losing HP while they were managing to keep a steady number of people up against sleeper.  In any case, they got Sleeper down to 30% or so, and then it disappeared, which they assumed was due to GM intervention.<br />
<br />
However, SOE concluded that it was a minor bug, fixed it, and respawned Sleepers zone, with sleeper, so they could try a second time.  The second time, they did succeed, since no bug/gm interefered.  There was no death message, no lore message, no loot, no script, etc...<br />
<br />
Please someone correct me if any of my information was wrong.</div></div><hr />

I knew they would fix the bug and let them take another swing at it.</div></div><hr />

So evidently the death of the sleeper is yet another mob which hits the dust only to respawn later for another guild(s) to kill later. No biggie in my book. Too bad it doesn't make at least 'something' happen... oh I don't know... maybe an earthquake which would change the foundation of the continents. Ahhh that would be asking to much...

<br />
it didnt respawn... it was FORCED reset (and inturn respawn) for the guilds that did it the first time, and had it removed. The sleeper (Karafymn) is a one time only per server mob. <br />
<br />
Karafymn was never designed to actually be killed, soo it doesnt do anything, because they litterally did the impossible. <br />
<br />
Imagine it kind of like Wil-E-Coyote catching Road-Runner... the one time he did, he shrugged and held up a sign that said &quot;Now What?&quot; hhehehe</div></div><hr />

Or maybe everyone who was part of the kill should have recieved a braclet with +15 to all stats and sv's or something. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zantaklawz</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now if the programmers didn't think that mob was ever going to be killed, why then assign hit points. If it was never meant to be killed, programmers can simply make it unable to be attacked (i.e., like the scarecrow in Misty Thicket that is surrounded by rats. You can't target it, so you can't kill it). So the programmers had some inkling that someone(s) will be able to do it. They didn't know when, but they knew it would happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not that the programers never wanted the mob killed, its that it was designed to be unkillable within the rules of the game. IE it had hit points, it could take damage, it had a mana pool. And I am sure your right that they said &quot;some day this guy will go down too&quot; but in almost 5 years, he hasnt..<br />
<br />
The Scarecrow in Misty Thicket is for a quest BTW.. he becomes targetable when &quot;activated&quot; just so you know.<br />
<br />
I remember when the sleeper was woke on Zeb...*shudder* it was talked about for quite some time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Big Congratz to all involved, and the effect was much farther reaching then they may have realized at the time. The effect on the EQ2 storyline remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
Kinda annoyed that there was no serverwide/systemwide announcement of Kerafym's death by SOE, not that it was really required as I am sure that 99.9% of the people on at the time knew it happened through /ooc's/guild chat/group chat/channel chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togras</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I think it takes some of the fun out of it.<br />
<br />
The mob's entire charm was that it was a massive, unkillable mob that would strike fear in the hearts of the people of Norrath. A destructive force that couldn't be stopped...<br />
<br />
...until today.<br />
<br />
Now it's killed, with a fairly primative tactic (just assembly line ressing). I say Kerafyrm should've AE dted at 10% with a shout like 'I've just been toying with you, mortals! Begone, inferior spawn of Norrath!'<br />
<br />
Kerafyrm was a power that could kill Veeshan. What does this say about the Wurmqueen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aumelen</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The storyline doesn't matter. It can be changed in light of the Sleeper being killed. Perhaps in EQ2 it comes to light that it was a ghost that was on the rampage while the real Sleeper hid away. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azuth</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually tonight SOE had several server wide messages.  Each one just a bit about the epic battle.<br />
<br />
Wish I could have seen the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catweazel</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those interested here is the systemwide announcement (with a couple of comments added in):<br />
<br />
&lt;SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE&gt;: Brenlo : In the darkness the shout to engage was heard. Seconds later a huge burst of magical energy could be felt as the Wizards and Shadow Knights engaged, and huge volleys of arrows begin to rain down as one against their target.<br />
(for those interested most dmg was done by wizards and rangers, melee was present to take the DT and melee damage and clerics rezzed them as they died)<br />
&lt;SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE&gt;: Brenlo : Over three hours had past since the epic confrontation began, then there was silence. As a cold freezing wind blew across the field of battle, hundreds had died and many more lay injured on the ground.<br />
(according to logs of the battle over 1300 deaths counted)<br />
&lt;SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE&gt;: Brenlo : All was silent again for a brief moment as the image of the legendary Kerafyrm lay lifeless at their feet. Suddenly, the cries of joy and accomplishment began to echo through the decrepit hall and then rain across the land of Norrath.<br />
(thousands listened in on serverwide chat channels)<br />
&lt;SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE&gt;: Brenlo : The once warring clans of Ascending Dawn, Wudan, and Magus Imperialis Magicus had put there personal battles aside and come together united as one to accomplish the impossible.<br />
&lt;SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE&gt;: Brenlo : They had triumphed where all others before them had failed, they had slain the Legendary Kerafyrm. As the victors departed the ancient tomb, rumors began to spread across the world of Rallos Zek. Rumors became Stories. Stories became Legend.<br />
&lt;SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE&gt;: Brenlo : Yet, the Legend of the impossible task they had accomplished together could only be truly told by those that were there. Their story will be remember on Norrath forever.</div></div><hr />

I actually felt a little bit of a chill, and a deep sense of awe when I read the system wides...

Like bankers in citys, or the boats way back when FoH sank it lol. He is a BIG part of the story lines of EQ and EQ2, one thing I think is kinda dumb though... is how he can only be awakein one time..... that to me is kinda retarded... why not do that then with Quarm? hes got a part in the story too.... as a matter of fact why do ANY of the gods respawn? The sleeper being a HUGE part of the origonal EQ the one I started playing on and fell in love with. oh well... what does my say matter = ) no one listens to the little guys. Big gratz to you guys for killing the seemingly unkillable almighty sleeper!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Irras</div><div class="date">12-02-2003, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People are saying that now they will have to change the story line between the Sleeper and EQ2, but I think they'll just play it off as there were only rumors of the sleeper being overcame once.  <br />
<br />
The system wide message may have hinted to their intentions with this line - &quot;Rumors became Stories. Stories became Legend.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sounds to me like it's just gonna be a &quot;story&quot; people tell their children 50 years from now (EQ2).<br />
About how the heros may one day return to do battle with the Sleeper and set the citizens free. <br />
<br />
/shrug just an interesting thing to think about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikther</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since Lucan spawns into a Skeleton when he is killed that would mean that he is undead in all forms.

Two sides of a coin can't have one without the other</div></div><hr />

If you speak to the crusaders in SS, on a server where the sleeper was awoken, they all talk of how the evil we mortals have unleashed by awakening the sleeper cannot be forgiven. <br />
I think he was made to be 'unkillable' specifically to support the storyline behind the events that happen in ST after his awakening and subsquent escape. The ancients that supported him before his imprisonment in ST spawn in place of the warders, and are there to gather power to him for whatever his future evils on velious / norrath were supposed to be. If you support this theory , it also makes sense that he didnt drop any loot as well since he was never supposed to die. <br />
<br />
Just my personal spin on the whole thing =)<br />
<br />
Kudos to the collaborative efforts of the guilds involved in the kill, at any rate.</div></div><hr />
