<br />
How? It's HTML my dear Watson.<br />
<br />
Still appears to be a bit buggy. A guildmate posted on my forums apologizing for crashing a number of people.<br />
Apperently, he found out about the HTML coloring of text and was using it in GC. It was locking up a number of people. But again, others where uneffected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they messed up by allowing players to have control over what colors others see when they shout, auction, etc.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm the only one who thinks this way, but with the average maturity level of EQ players, it should probably be restricted to more private channels (tells, groups, guild chat, etc.) or be a gm/guide ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Umbrae</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must agree, this was a bad idea. <br />
I personaly change the color of /shout /auc /ooc /everything else. so I can tell WTF comes accross my screen at a glance.  allowing players to change the colors of thier messages blows that system all to hell.<br />
not to mention alot of colors show up badly aginst my screen, one of the reasons I edited the colors to start with.  the first time some one shouts in bright orange I am going to automaticaly hit R.  I have just been trained that way :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nennayan</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, me too.<br />
<br />
One time, not long after they first implemented the /usercolor command, I found out the hard way that setting a text color to r225 g0 b255 would make it invisible, when I had set tells to that color.</div></div><hr />
