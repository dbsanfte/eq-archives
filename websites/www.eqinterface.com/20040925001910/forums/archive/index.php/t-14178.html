<br />
e.g. <br />
Currently, if for example you wanted to change your spell casting bar to neon pink, you would have to copy the .xml file that has the casting bar in it into your custom directory and modify it. This means that you also have everything else in that file in your custom directory.<br />
<br />
Maybe the casting bar wasn't the best example.<br />
<br />
Try this...<br />
<br />
Say there was a Bars.XML file, that contained every 'bar' in EQ, casting, breath, health, etc and you wanted to change the casting bar to pink.<br />
<br />
You would copy the 'bars.xml' file to your custom directory and mdify the colour. You would also have the other bars in your custom directory, and if SoE modified, say the breath gauge, you wouldnt see that change until you modified your custom file.<br />
<br />
What I would like to be able to do would be have EQ look in the custom directory and see what is there and then get everything else from default (as it does now) BUT (and heres the good bit) if it hits a duplicate it should use what it found in the custom directory and continue, NOT crash.<br />
<br />
So, for the 'bars.xml' example you could have a custom file named 'bars.xml' that ONLY contains your modified casting bar, and when EQ loaded the UI it would take your new casting bar, then look in the default 'bars.xml' file for everything else, and skip over the default casting bar.<br />
<br />
What do other people think ?<br />

By allowing what you are requesting, you are limiting compatibility between different UIs, and basically gives the end user a work around for sloppy programming.<br />
<br />
By learning the correct interaction between the windows, with correct name conventions, etc., you can create a product that will work with other peoples work.  <br />
<br />
For example,<br />
Bars.xml has the casting gauge in it.  What is the person is using Turlo's Casting Window?  All of a sudden, you have two casting guages in the same directory.  The result would cause it to crash to desktop, and well it should.<br />
<br />
If the designer of Bars.xml used Bars_Casting_Gauge as the piece utilized within the window, the naming conventions are kept seperate, and there is no compatibilty problem with other components.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure why you think that this would cause problems between different UIs.<br />
If the people creating the UIs use reasonable naming conventions, (which they have to do currently to avoid conflicts) allowing overloading shouldnt change anything.<br />
<br />
e.g. Fred creates his super ui and adds a new gauge, calling it FredGauge and puts it in a casting window.<br />
Then Bill creates a gauge and calls it BillGauge and puts it in the breath window. No problem.<br />
<br />
However if both Fred and Bill modified one of the default UI gauges there could be problems. But having overloading would not make this any worse.<br />
<br />
For example,<br />
Bars.xml has the casting gauge in it. What is the person is using Turlo's Casting Window? All of a sudden, you have two casting guages in the same directory. The result would cause it to crash to desktop, and well it should.<br />
 <br />
<br />
This is a problem with the current setup so I'm missing the point?<br />
<br />
What should happen would be the Bars.xml would have a casting gauge, named BarsCastingGauge, and the Turlo's casting window would have a gauge named TurlosCastingGauge (for example).<br />
<br />
What my suggestion would allow would be to have, for example, if you wanted to change a single element that is contained in one of the large .xml files, you could simply have that element in your custom UI and not have to worry if the default UI changed something else in that file.<br />
<br />
Does that make things clearer ?<br />
