<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KelricStormwolf</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, this is right weird... and I'm pretty sure it's not a visual illusion... <br />
<br />
I hand-coded percentages to display to the right of the gauges on the Player Window (not an original idea, I know.. :rolleyes: ). Everything was fine, 'til I noticed the Mana percentage number and percent sign, both the same blue as the gauge (0,0,240), were offset to the right about 1 pixel. I moved them to the left by 1 pixel, they looked okay, though not perfectly lined up.<br />
<br />
Perplexed, I double checked the XML. All the percentage numbers and signs were identical in XML, save only the names, eqtypes, locations, and colors. Everything else is IDENTICAL.<br />
<br />
So I started messing around... I changed the EQType... nope, still offset... I'd already changed the location, but the whole point is identical locs should display identically... so I changed the color... VOILA! Now it's lined up! Changed it back... it's offset again! :eek:<br />
<br />
So has anyone elses noticed this? Why does blue display offset right, while every other color displays correctly? And most importantly, can it be fixed?</div></div><hr />

That's probably not the answer.<br />
