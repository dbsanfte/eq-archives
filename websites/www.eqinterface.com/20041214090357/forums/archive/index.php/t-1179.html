<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drilok</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded a couple UI's I liked and have been playing with them lately but I run into some problems with certain UI's. I downloaded Drakah's and Quartz for example. Both these UI's say they have files for the user to put in either the INI or in the actual EQ folder. Now how do I do this? I keep putting them in the EQ folder and they never seem to work. Do I need to replace somthing with this file? If so how would I do that. Do I need to put it somwhere else or do they somtimes just not work? Any help is very much appreciated! I would love these UI's to work just becuase they would be perfect for my chars and play style. <br />

Thanks for your time!<br />

IE for Quartz.<br />
<br />
he sent UI_Stratix_31.ini<br />
<br />
When you look in your Everquest folder you would see for you<br />
<br />
UI_Drilok_40.ini<br />
<br />
(i am guessing at 40, it may be a different number)<br />
<br />
you remane UI_Drilok_40.ini to UI_Drilok_40-OLD.ini<br />
<br />
<br />
then rename UI_Stratix_31.ini to UI_Drilok_40.ini and keep it in the same folder with your renamed ini file<br />
<br />
then when you start EQ it should work the way the author designed..<br />
<br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />

Sorry for the repeatition, I am just trying to be clear on this becuase I have been strugling with it for a couple weeks hehe<br />
<br />
Thanks much for your help!!<br />
<br />
P.S. Also is it possible to do this with two different files for the same char? Or would I just have to keep renaming the files depending upon the UI?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

Yes, you got it.. again, the &quot;40&quot; will prolly be a different number i picked 40 for the example<br />

would need to keep changing it.. but you can do it for different characters..  i wont even try to get into explaining how to combine two major mods... (dont think i could do it myself)<br />
