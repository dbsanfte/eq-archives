<br />
My girlfriend is using a modified Soes UI, and I made all the changes in the Patch forum to it. When I try to load the UI though I get this error:<br />
<br />
[Thu Oct 09 12:32:02 2003] [Line:3121 Source:UIFiles\soes\EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml] Couldn't find class:item 'PIW_BuffWindow' reference in FieldParseItemOfClass()<br />
<br />
Now, the Soes UI uses the pet window to show a few different things using different tabs which is what I think is messing it up. Does anyone know a quick and easy fix to this short of just not changing the pet window?<br />
<br />
I've also attached the PetInfoWindow if it helps any.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions and help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried to have a look into it, can't find the problem, just the same error as the poster above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sokol</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you look in the default petinfo window you will see it has 2 screen section, one is the pet buff window as stated in your error.<br />
what you need to do is copy it into your UI, and change the anchors all to false, and offests to say -1000 to esentialy make them invisible. here is what I would add.<br />
<br />
<br />
	&lt;!-- Pet Buff Page Begin--&gt;<br />
	&lt;Screen item=&quot;PIW_BuffWindow&quot;&gt;<br />
		&lt;ScreenID&gt;BuffWindow&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
		&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />
		&lt;Location&gt;<br />
			&lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
			&lt;Y&gt;-1500&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
		&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
		&lt;AutoStretch&gt;false&lt;/AutoStretch&gt;<br />
		&lt;LeftAnchorOffset&gt;-400&lt;/LeftAnchorOffset&gt;<br />
		&lt;TopAnchorOffset&gt;-400&lt;/TopAnchorOffset&gt;<br />
		&lt;RightAnchorOffset&gt;-400&lt;/RightAnchorOffset&gt;<br />
		&lt;BottomAnchorOffset&gt;-400&lt;/BottomAnchorOffset&gt;<br />
		&lt;TopAnchorToTop&gt;false&lt;/TopAnchorToTop&gt;<br />
		&lt;BottomAnchorToTop&gt;false&lt;/BottomAnchorToTop&gt;<br />
		&lt;RightAnchorToLeft&gt;false&lt;/RightAnchorToLeft&gt;<br />
		&lt;LeftAnchorToLeft&gt;false&lt;/LeftAnchorToLeft&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_VScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_VScroll&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_HScroll&gt;false&lt;/Style_HScroll&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
		&lt;TooltipReference&gt;Buffs on your pet will show here&lt;/TooltipReference&gt;<br />
		&lt;DrawTemplate&gt;WDT_Inner&lt;/DrawTemplate&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;false&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Closebox&gt;false&lt;/Style_Closebox&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Minimizebox&gt;false&lt;/Style_Minimizebox&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Border&gt;false&lt;/Style_Border&gt;<br />
		&lt;Style_Sizable&gt;false&lt;/Style_Sizable&gt;<br />
	&lt;/Screen&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
then remeber to add <br />
<br />
&lt;Pieces&gt;PIW_BuffWindow&lt;/Pieces&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
with the rest of of pices at the end of the file.<br />

Exactly the same problem using Caleal UI which has 3 tabs under the pet window xml file.<br />
<br />
I tried to have a look into it, can't find the problem, just the same error as the poster above.  <br />
<br />
You can ignore the error for now, it doesn't affect the performance of the UI at all.<br />
<br />
I'll have an update for it sometime soon. I'm not sure when though, it may take a complete redesign of the entire window, wich is a pain with all the tabed pages.  =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miele</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in my first attempt to load the UI the xml error forced the default UI skin to load, so I had to remove the xml file from the folder to see the rest of the UI.<br />
The bad part is I don't have the xp bars and the stats now :p<br />
<br />
I did the modification posteded by Cairenn, adding all the stuff into the file and doublechecked it was in the correct place, am pretty sure it's only the pet window causing issues.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm definitely addicted to this UI (thanks for the great awesome job Caleal!) and will wait patiently for the fix :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scorrpio</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday, I set out to update my pet window to accomodate the latest changes.<br />
<br />
My pet window is a tabbed contraption, stats on one page, and pet command buttons on the other.<br />
<br />
The goal was to add a new page there, and have the pet buffs go there.<br />
Adding an extra page to a tabbed set was not hard.  The button animation, red/blue backgrounds, and actual 0-29 buff definittions I simply copied over from the new default pet window version.<br />
<br />
However, here are some architectural caveats:<br />
1. default window structure is:  Screen item PetInfoWindow now houses and additional element, a Screen item BuffWindow.  That, in turn houses 30 Button items (Pet Buffs).<br />
<br />
My first idea was to replicate this, by keeping all 30 buffs inside BuffWindow, and stuffing the BuffWindow into the newly added page.  So, my custom UI now had:  Screen item PetInfoWindow, containing a TabBox item, that contained 3 Page items, and one of pages contained a Screen item BuffWindow with all 30 buff Buttons in it.<br />
<br />
That arrangement crashed and burned, refusing to even load.  An intuition told me that Screen item cannot be stuffed into anything but other Screen item, so I decided to dump BuffWindow completely, and arranged all 30 buffs directly on the tab Page.<br />
<br />
Results were a tad better, skin loaded, but pet buffs did not show, and EQ complained about not being able to find BuffWindow.  What I did then:  I added BuffWindow back, but put no Pieces in it, made it 0x0 size and 0x0 location.  Then, I put that dummy window into main PetInfoWindow, along with the Tabbox item.<br />
<br />
The results were perfect.  Incompatibility messages went away, and pet buffs started showing nicely.</div></div><hr />

Ermmm...I spent time in game last night and had no issues outside of the error message when I first loaded.....</div></div><hr />

Instead of getting my pet buffs icons in the tab, I get the Pet...Red/Blue...IconBackground.<br />

<br />
Any idea?<br />

Btw... Thanks for this site 8)</div></div><hr />
