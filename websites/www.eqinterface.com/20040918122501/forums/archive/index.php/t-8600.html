<br />
I've used this UI (or some incarnation of it) ever since Sony added the new UI, but never posted it anywhere for others to use, so I figured wth. minui is almost at a &quot;release&quot; point, hence why I am posting this in the Beta thread and giving it it's first version number: 0.9. I still have some stuff to work on. Anyway, I'm a minimalist when it comes to GUIs, and as such I developed an EQ UI that will let me see what is going on and maximize my real estate. I'm trying to balance usability/features while keeping my screen uncluttered. I run EQ at 1024x768 resolution, so that is what the UI is &quot;designed&quot; for, though if you use INI settings it shouldn't matter. Okay enough with this, on to the pictures! If the pictures look odd to you, keep in mind I use Linux as an OS and run EQ through WineX, which is why my fonts (over my head) are screwy and colors might be messed up. I played with the brightness and color balancing to get a recognizable image from the screenshot...and don't worry if you use a smaller resolution, there are smaller screenshot links of the different UI pieces lower down.<br />
<br />

<br />
That is the UI as a whole. Usually I arrange the windows around the borders and make them 100% transparent, but I didn't bother for this shot (oh well), you can get the idea. Now the individual parts.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com//skins/interfaceblue/vb_bullet.gif (http://www.endries.org/josh/projects/minui/minui-0.9-spells.jpg) First up is the spell window (or &quot;spell casting window&quot;). Not much is changed here. I reduced the size of the icons and rearranged them to fit. I will probably get rid of the Spellbook button on the bottom, since its just as easy, and faster for me, to type &lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;B&gt;. I usually use the &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;#&gt; keys to cast spells, and since spell names pop up when you press &lt;Alt&gt;, I don't need spell names out in the open. I always know which spells are in which slot anyway, and usually don't have to look (I used to play without the spell icons visible, until I made alts).<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com//skins/interfaceblue/vb_bullet.gif (http://www.endries.org/josh/projects/minui/minui-0.9-buffs.jpg) The buffs window uses the same size icons as most of the other images in my UI, and is arranged vertically. I envision the buff window being in the upper-right corner, so the buffs will append from top to bottom and fill up at 15 buffs. Again, since pressing &lt;Alt&gt; brings up the names of the buffs, I didn't bother to do anything with buff names.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com//skins/interfaceblue/vb_bullet.gif (http://www.endries.org/josh/projects/minui/minui-0.9-extra.jpg) The extra (or &quot;short duration buff&quot;) window is basically a horizontal buff window. The icons append from right to left as i envision it being in the upper-right corner also, just to the left of the buffs window (see the large screenshot above). Basically the buffs &quot;grow&quot; outward from the upper-right corner. Of course, there are no songs affecting me in this screenshot, unfortunately, but it works. Again, names are too much clutter.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com//skins/interfaceblue/vb_bullet.gif (http://www.endries.org/josh/projects/minui/minui-0.9-target.jpg) The target window is almost the same as default, except there is no title and  the pieces are arranged slightly to save about 8 pixels (had to justify having yet another .xml file). The percentage is there, too, and has always been, for fast glances at how long I have before my quad kite ends me.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com//skins/interfaceblue/vb_bullet.gif (http://www.endries.org/josh/projects/minui/minui-0.9-party.jpg) I only had one person in my party for this screenshot, but you can get the idea of the party window from this. The health percentage would be over his bar, just like the target window, if he was in the same zone as me (I just ported him). I will probably make this text smaller and tighten up the window a bit. Pet health is the default green-under-red bar. I squished the buttons to one row and put them on the bottom of the window. I might get rid of them altogether since I use keyboard shortcuts for this stuff too. Sometimes I forget or don't notice if I get invited to a group, though, so they might stay...<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com//skins/interfaceblue/vb_bullet.gif (http://www.endries.org/josh/projects/minui/minui-0.9-player.jpg) The player window is the first window I changed. it has percentages, of course, and is pretty compact. It shows (from top to bottom) name, HPs/max HPs, health, mana, stamina, XP, AA XP. I got tired of checking my XP via the inventory screen after every kill just before levelling. This was the annoyance that started my whole UI, haha. I plan on moving the HPs/max HPs part down in between the name and guages, because long names get cut off and make things look funky. I found this out with my second character, a Bard, Acapellallepaca Musicanacisum. I might put ATK and AC there along with HPs when 1.0 comes out. Okay moving on...<br />
<br />
http://www.eqgui.com//skins/interfaceblue/vb_bullet.gif (http://www.endries.org/josh/projects/minui/minui-0.9-hotbuttons.jpg) The Hot Button window is changed a bunch, too. I squished it down and added some inventory slots. The buttons are smaller, but I don't put much text on them anyway (the only button on right now reloads my minui, I was testing stuff...). I'm sure people won't like this, but I do! I added the inventory slots because, again, I was annoyed with opening inventory, then a bag, then doing something, etc. But there are only 8 inventory slots, and 12 slots on the bar, you say? Why, yes, of course! When I made Acapellallepaca, I found out that I wanted to switch weapons quite often, so I added the center row. This row is your primary, secondary, range, and ammo slots for easy switching from your inventory.<br />
<br />
Well thats about it. Still a few tweaks to do, but it is done for the most part. Let me know what you think, and if you think of any improvements or other suggestions. Feel free to use it, it would be cool if someone other than me appreciated it. You should be able to download 0.9 here (http://www.endries.org/josh/projects/minui/minui-0.9.zip). Just unzip it into your uifiles directory, and /loadskin minui 1 when in EQ.<br />

It's not completely true that pressing alt shows buff names; you have to move the mouse over the buff window at least once first. Personally, if it doesn't work from the bigging (you have to open a window every time you zone, mouse over at least once) it sucks so I opted for always showing buff names.<br />
<br />
Here's my rating of your UI:<br />
<br />
Compressed spellcast bar: excellent (leave the book)<br />
Player window: good, but dump the player name<br />
Group window: just dump the buttons, actions window has them if you really care about seeing if you've been invited<br />
Target window: perfect<br />
Chat window: strip off the fancy borders (change to WDT_Rounded)<br />
Song and buff window: good, but like I said, alt only shows names after mouseover<br />
Hotbutton window: boo! make the hotkeys standard size and ditch the inventory. Non-standard hotkey sizes deform text for abilities and make items look freakish. Inventory slots should stay in the inventory, if you want fast swap buttons, hotkey inventory slots.<br />
<br />
So I guess my only real negative criticism is the hotbutton window and that's just a matter of personal taste. I promote the use of the friends window as an alternate inventory, but even that is iffy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fzzzt</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked out your ui. I like your chat window, not to say that I don't like the rest of it, but I haven't been able to change my chat window's borders very much, right now it is WDTRounded and I think that is where it will stay...<br />
<br />
Yeah, I knew about the mouseover issue with buff names, actually. Usually when I want to know the name of a buff, it is to click one off, so it isn't a big deal to see the names all the time for me.<br />
<br />
I condensed everything down some and got final touches in. I dropped the player name and party window buttons; I agree on those points. I didn't think about abilities when I changed the hot button size and, after checking out a couple AA abilities I decided yeah I should change those back to 40x40. I also removed the inventory part of the hot button window above and put that in the friends window. Unfortunately I can't figure out how to get the friends window to be visible automatically. As far as I know, you cant swap inventory through hot buttons. You can use clickies, but you can't swap weapons and armor, at least I don't know how.<br />
<br />
It is almost done, yay!<br />

Thanks for the reply!</div></div><hr />
