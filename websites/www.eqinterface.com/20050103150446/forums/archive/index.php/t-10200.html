I would love to see a timer section and some nice timers posted. Bar's that have positionable start arrows are nice, with instrustions on how to adjsut the time would be perfect.  hehe I can figure out some things but never had timers to play with. <br />
<br />
I am also looking for a VERY clean straightforward ui.. I have looked at tons of them here and all are very nice. but in the end I want a very plain, not really artsy UI.  Some one remade one of Drakkah's once and I loved it but was never updated.  Qbox was almost perfect but I needed to change a few of the items and I never had timers with it. Can any one point me in the direction of a non frilly, non cool, very generic but straight forward ui?<br />
