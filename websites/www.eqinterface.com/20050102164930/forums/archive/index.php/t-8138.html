<br />
I was wondering if anyone else is having these issues too?<br />
<br />
Last night i went LD 3 times,<br />
1st time after 1hr of play<br />
2nd time after the 3rd hr of play <br />
3rd time after the 5th hr of play<br />
<br />
I am networked on 2 machines but my wife was not using her computer at all last night and this is starting to become a burden as im a pet class.<br />
<br />
I dont know if its EQ thats booting me or if my Service Provider is to blame?  Is there a way for me to check this out?<br />
any help would be great.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melosa</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being networked, I'm assuming that you're using a router; if that's the case, EQ does not support routers/firewalls/all that other nifty neat stuff people use. :(  There are work arounds that have been posted, I think that the EQLive site even has links to them, however, don't quote me on that. I'll look around a bit and see if I can't find out any info for you aside from just contacting there tech support. <br />
<br />
Keep your fingers crossed! ;)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Just popped over to the EQLive site and got the little address for their router support section. With any luck, it'll help you out. I remember that problem all too well, and it became quite the joke since you could (literally) set your watch by my LD's. <br />

Good luck, I hope it helps.</div></div><hr />

I believe I ended up setting the DMZ Host settings to the IP address that my Everquest computer had.  There has to be other ways to do it though because a lot of people use more than one computer to play EQ.<br />
<br />
EDIT: change it to the correct settings that I changed. :p</div></div><hr />
