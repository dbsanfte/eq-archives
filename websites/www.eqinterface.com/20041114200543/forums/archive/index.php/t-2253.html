I say, post this (with the creator's permission, of course) on remelio's mod feedback forum, have him ship it off to t.king, and see if he can make it look all...fantasy-like. It looks great as it is. I mean, wow. banana for you.:nana: <br />
<br />
Oh, and that hammer in the picture--is that a cursor? If so, I *have* to get it! woot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onnatop</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha, no, that's my cleric pet, but I have a feeling it wouldn't be that hard to make it into a cursor =P<br />
<br />
As for t.king, I've already got it up on his forums asking him to do some decent artwork, because basically, I suck =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really, you aren't bad at all. The orbs have a very neat, clean, techy feel to them. It just takes someone with the supernaturally-grotesque level of talent as t.king possesses to give it a fantasy touch. And I think the cleric basher would look great as a cursor--perhaps you could get multiple screenshots and have it animate 4 or 5 frames up and down ^.^<br />
<br />
Very nice work, again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miah</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I am very happy using it as it is. I love it! Allot of times I get carried away and don't watch my own health. It sticks out and the graphic is pleasant to my eyes.. no frilly stuff to it. I wouldn't want an UI with everything like it, then my stats would get lost again. That is why I don't prefer UIs like the Dragon or Angel. Very nice pieces of work although:)<br />
<br />
thank you for sharing this!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiradok</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if this would work, since I know nothing about code... but here's an idea.<br />
Would it be possible to make the pet health bar into a ring around the player health bubble?<br />
<br />
Or if that doesn't quite work, maybe an arch around the top half.<br />
If it would work, I think it would look great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanunda</div><div class="date">09-20-2002, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He couldn't do a ring, but he could certainly do a semicircle.<br />
<br />
All guages are hardcoded to unfill pixel-by-pixel right to left. He could easily run a semicircular graphic overlay and it would unfill just the same--the animation wouldn't actually &quot;curve&quot; as it unfilled, exactly, but it would still look good. I can't wait to see the next version.</div></div><hr />
