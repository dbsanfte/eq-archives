So I'm talking about tking_g2celtic (http://eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1931). It's incredible looking. I'm taking it, and removing the title bars, backgrounds and borders of all the windows, fixing a couple graphical bugs (things that are off by one pixel, etc.), and spitting it back out. Here's a chopped up preview pic. Should be ready in a few hours.<br />

That looks fantastic! awesome work!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should I upload this as a &quot;complete set&quot; or as &quot;mix and match?&quot;<br />
<br />
I know it's mostly NOT my work, but it's not &quot;mix and match&quot;ed at all; it's a modified complete set. I'm putting in full credit to t.king and dedara obviously, but still want some input on this...<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - Again, thanks for this UI you two, it's incredible... now to get to work on a full mod (rather than just making it all transparent and hard to move; only the left edge of one pixel can move each window with fancy graphics).</div></div><hr />

Just my thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerasin</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Solid design!  If I had one suggestion to make it would be to mirror the player and group windows so the celtic squares are flush against the right side of the screen and the bars protrude to the left.  Probably a lot of work tho. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another preview, decided to add a few things...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought about mirroring them, but after making the windows (shown in previous preview pic) all the same width, and putting one pixel of drag-ability to each side, I found lining them up was easy, and it just looks so sweet. /drool<br />
<br />
This is turning out better than I expected. I hope I don't get addicted, need to remember to switch back to my own, Enoks UI v6 after I finish...<br />

Still want to know if this should go in &quot;mix and match&quot; or complete sets. It has many hours worth of work in it, and is not &quot;mix and match&quot;ed, but obviously I did not create it.<br />

maybe make it ================ and fit it between the compass and player window<br />
<br />
awesome work!</div></div><hr />

That's the MP3 player. It's sizable, and I just made it small during this screenshot. I loves my MP3 player, and you should too. =D<br />

P.S. - Organizing everything, making readme and also prepping my two other UIs for uploading. Enoks UI v6, Enok UI Mini v2, and Enoks UI tking dedara v2 are getting ready to be shipped!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All three are now uploaded including Enoks UI tking dedara v2. Watch for it. Anxiously.<br />

Any chance you could flip the grapic a bit?<br />
Hard to describe but have the t.king grapic on other side against right and the buff/text on left?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not hard to describe, you could just say mirror the buff window. Anyway, tonight, no, go die. I spent 6 hours today making this. Hehe, just joking, I'll do it eventually. I plan to mirror the WHOLE UI.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mirror eh? Yes that was the word i was looking for ;)<br />
Thanks, i will look forward to it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melosa</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beautiful!!!<br />
Love the buffs!<br />
T. King's graphics are so gorgeous, and I fell head over heals the moment I first saw Dedara's group window. I've been fiddling around trying to piece together a UI around all of that, but the buff window has been a royal pain in the neck. As usual, if I just wait a few minutes, one of the &quot;UI Gods&quot; (as I've dubbed y'all) has already outdone anything I could have thought up. <br />
<br />
KUDOS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaylin</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, am waaay new to this stuff.  Actually just started playing with UI stuff today.  I have tried several different downloads from this site and am pretty happy.<br />
<br />
I have a question about the UI you are previewing in this thread though.  First I was wondering how long of a delay there usually is from when an artist like yourself uploads their work until when it is available to the public, because I can't seem to find the download that matches what you have shown here.  And second, I was also wondering if there is a way we can pick out just parts of &quot;sets&quot; like these.  (For instance, I really like the player window, group window and target in your set here, but would like to mix them with other things.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for your time.  Really amazing work you are all creating here.  <br />
<br />
*hugs*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaylin, the delay is usually a day. It hasn't been approved yet. When it has I'll start a thread in the released forum called &quot;Enoks UI tking dedara v2&quot; and link to the DL from there.<br />
<br />
Some UI's you CAN take elements from, some you can't. This one you can take any of the graphic windows as long as you DO take the group window (most the graphic code is in that file, next release I will make each window work independently of each other). So you could use just the group, player and target windows if you so desired.<br />

<br />
Haliken, I have been wondering about this myself.  How much does it add to load times / system strain to have the essentially the same graphic (but used in mutliple places) coded seperately for each window?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haliken</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Load time is probably in the realm of 1 to 2 seconds longer in EXTREME cases. My RAM is standard SDR (not DDR) and MY UI (Enoks UI v6) which uses window independent coding takes a few seconds to load. This UI (Enoks UI tking dedara v2) loads faster than it, and, even after I make the windows independent, won't load or run any slower since each window has its own graphics anyway. Loading the actual texture files (*.tga) is what takes time and memory (also, processing the XML takes time, that's why Enoks UI v6 takes longer to load), cutting them up into components takes very little. To make these windows independent I'll have to set up the color-coded squares and gauge graphics in each window graphics file, which I have plenty of blank space (in each windows texture file) to do.<br />
<br />
Basically, in the next week I will make the windows work independently of each other, write detailed instructions for mix&amp;matching, and make a mirrored version of this UI.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />
<br />
P.S. - You will be able to mix&amp;match elements from the normal and mirrored UI to suit your tastes.</div></div><hr />

Sure you want to power level me?  ROFL :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Oh well, in the mean time, while you wait for it to be posted, I'm working on Enoks UI tking dedara v3 which will have the following improvements:<br />
<br />
- Each window will be independent of each other so you can mix and match easily.<br />
- Major graphical fixes, t.king makes gorgeous art but it sure is sloppy in some places.<br />
- Resized hotbutton window so that things aren't squished, I wish EVERYONE would stick to the standard 40x40 pixel box (for item slots and hotkeys).<br />
- Umm, yeah and more graphical changes, cleaned up edges, some other cool stuff.<br />
- My personal mouse cursor design, which, uhh, looks like, a little ivory triangle for this UI (with Enoks UI v6 it's gray).<br />
<br />
It's just a better version. After I settle on a fixed v3 I'll develop a v3 Mirrored.<br />
<br />
Enok<br />

P.S. - I have PM disabled so I can't PM anyone.</div></div><hr />

You probably shouldn't have used Haliken's name if you didn't want anyone to be confused.  ;) For a long time I thought you and Haliken were the same people until he mentioned he was your brother and you shared computers. ((This is Starlene by the way. :) ))  Anyway keep up the great work on the UI's! You've done a really nice job.</div></div><hr />

My board name is Amitan after my SK and main name is Enzo.<br />
A mage as you :)<br />
Summons beer for Enok<br />
<br />
On a side note... Enok ver 6 is nice work.<br />
The new lag bar you made (but havent a clue how you did it) is great</div></div><hr />
