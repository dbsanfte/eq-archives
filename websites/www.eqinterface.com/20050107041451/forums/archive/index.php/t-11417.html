<br />
We have seen the posts.  We have not deleted them, we have moved them to an Admin-only forum, so that we can follow the links provided in order to investigate it.  We are looking in to it.  We will post a response once we have a handle on it.  Thank you for bringing it to our attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudane</div><div class="date">11-29-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dolby and I are investigating the post that were moved.<br />
<br />
First let me say the person accused in the post is not someone either of us have ever heard of at IGE. Our dealings are with the President of the company and the person that was accused in the other post has never even been mentioned<br />
<br />
Secondly, Unless it comes to light that IGE is some how directly envolved it is not fair to hold the entire company responsible for the actions of someone that we have never heard of. If it comes to light that IGE was some how helping (hosting, hiding, etc). The we would take steps and actions that we seem fit.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the person that posted this &quot;great info&quot; has never posted here before, best we have found he is going to everyone of IGE's advertised sites and posting this info.. He also didnt use his real name and this doesn't add any credentials to the post.<br />
<br />
We all want the people that play EQ to be safe, no one here at EQInterface OR at IGE want them exposed to anything bad. Please don't light the torches and get out the pitchforks yet, there is no reason to start hunting &quot;the monster&quot; untill we have REAL facts.. As soon as we hear something official, we will let you all know.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have any concerns, feel free to email Dolby or my Myself. we will give you any information we have gathtered.<br />
