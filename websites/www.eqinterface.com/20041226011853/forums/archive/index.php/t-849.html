<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PettieTheft</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there. <br />
<br />
    This is my 1st time posting here, just wanted to let you know that I LOVE this site!!! Its amazing!!<br />
    Now to what im looking for.<br />
    Im a Rogue and I have downloaded Quartz with the new spell icons.  That's ok and all But what Im really looking for is something that look's like quartz but more Melee friendly, Right now Im trying to figure out how to place 3 different chat screens without taking up the entire screen. 1 screen is for Guild Chat 2nd screen is for Raid Channel and everything else (I.E. spells ooc shout blah blah blah) and the 3rd is Damage dealt and taken.<br />
    Fitting all of these on Quartz is tough to do without the chat screen's being so small that I can only see 4 lines at a time on any of them.<br />
    So I would like to test you UI gods out there in asking for something Rogue / Melee Friendly with all that stuff that Quartz shows (like all the stats xp aaxp %'s so on) that does not take up the entire screen and a skin that look's like something that a Rogue would use.<br />
    I cant wait to see what yall come up with Im excited :D <br />
<br />
Thank you and take care<br />
:nana: <br />
<br />
PS this is what my current UI look's like</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-10-2002, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pic isn't loading cause it didn't successfully completely upload. If the image is over 200k, the upload got cut off, unfortunatly.<br />
<br />
Do to bandwidth restrictions and the traffic on this site, Dolby was forced to lower the upload size limits.</div></div><hr />
