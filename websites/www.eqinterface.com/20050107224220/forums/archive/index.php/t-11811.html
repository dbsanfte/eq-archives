I keep getting punted when I try to change the inventory.  Can anyone help me change the Inventory so that all I have in it is a place to auto equip, All the buttons, and money of course.  Since Carienn has all of the other stuff on the screen that would orginally be in inventory dont see a need to have it twice.Keilha's mini Inventory with AutoEquip (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?s=&amp;op=showfiles&amp;catid=16&amp;sortby=date&amp;sortorder=DESC) <br />
<br />
Is a good example and I have tried to just replace Cairenn with this one but get an error.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Had to edit this.....Im so happy=)  Woot I did it! Adjusted the Inventory mod in Cairenn UI myself added a bunch of other things.  Didnt think I could do it I couldnt get sid. to work so I just did the coding by trial and error my computer is on fire! hehe.  Just uploaded it and hope to see it up soon I hope you like it.  Here is a screenshot of what I have there is much more to it but couldnt fit it all on one screen.......</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm rather on &quot;vacation&quot; right now, my husband is home for two glorious weeks (he works in NYC, we live in Canada, see each other at best every six weeks, tends more to ten or twelve weeks between visits), so while I swing past the boards every now and then right now, I'm not really here very much atm.<br />
<br />
Yes, the inventory is one of the t.king/Remelio ones, and it has coding in it that the rest of the UI requires, which is why it crashes if you try to substitute someone else's inventory.  That being said ... http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11313  ;)<br />

I'll be back to a bit more usual schedule in the new year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Storam Abruwin</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for taking the time to answer my post I didnt think i had the guts to try to do any coding myself but I did and it turned out just the way I wanted.  I have a screenshot in my first post how i wanted my inventory to look and it works great.  LOL all i did was take everything i didnt want in it and shoved it in the bottom right corner and put everything I wanted in the upper right corner.=) <br />
<br />
Figure everything that is in an inventory is already on the ui right in front of me.  So all I needed was the basics in the inventory buttons and auto drop and money.  I can now have my inventory up and forage and drop without having a big mod in my way.  This is one heck of a UI.  Thank you and everyone else that has worked so hard to make ppl like me happy.  That inventory I did took hours to do I cant get SID to work so I did it the old fashion coding way trial and error.  <br />
<br />
Hope you and your husband have a wonderful Christmas and Happy New Year.</div></div><hr />
