<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damisela</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using Vert 2.4 with the 2.5 LOY fixes. For the past 3 weeks I have experienced random game freezes in game and have to manually reboot my system only to have it happen again and again. I have tried every fix imaginable, from sound to nosound, reinstalling Directx 8.1 then installing Directx 9, reinstalling EQ altogether, deleting the DLL files and letting the patcher find them and reinstall.  I played on the testserver without one single problem, so today I had a thought and tested it. What if my custome Nexium UI was the culprit? <br />
<br />
Well I loaded my UI and froze about 6 times in one hour. Then I loaded the default UI and have not crashed yet - been on continiously without a freeze for about an hour.<br />
<br />
I was curious if anyone else using this UI was having similar problems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah you never told me in game you were using a custom UI otherwise I woulda told you to unload that sucker!!!<br />
<br />
Yes I do remember some people freezeing up useing vert and some other UI's however there was never a solution posted that I rememeber.<br />
<br />
Whats the file size of your uierrors.txt file? If its large in size (5mb - 1gb +) then its a loop error bug. I cant remember the solution to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damisela</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">17 KB Dolby is the size of my UIerror file. I have used this UI without this problem since before LOY came out then used the patch for LOY and it worked perfectly.  I didn't start having the freezes until about 3 weeks ago. <br />
<br />
I have been using the default for a few hours now without a problem, so I am pretty sure its the UI. Any ideas to fix? I so love my pretty purple. : sobs :</div></div><hr />

By the way, my freezing problems started 3 weeks ago as well.</div></div><hr />

I tested out the Crystal Meth that my sources said was still up and running, I copied the TGA files so it would be purple and had 3 complete lock ups in 30 minutes, so it's not a fix. ;-(</div></div><hr />

never heard of this solution.. but its worth a try..<br />
<br />
the biggest thing i have seen is two parts<br />
<br />
1. Vert is in 32bit, if your running in 16bit you will get horrid lag..<br />
<br />
2. P-of Fear and SSRa temple both have a memory leak bug that seems to be relieved when graphics are not 32bit.. many vert users have reported less lag in these two zones when disabling vert. we are still checking the code.. but since its only two zones.. its seems to be server side.</div></div><hr />

I am using Vert 2.4 with the 2.5 LOY fixes. For the past 3 weeks I have experienced random game freezes in game and have to manually reboot my system only to have it happen again and again. I have tried every fix imaginable, from sound to nosound, reinstalling Directx 8.1 then installing Directx 9, reinstalling EQ altogether, deleting the DLL files and letting the patcher find them and reinstall.  I played on the testserver without one single problem, so today I had a thought and tested it. What if my custome Nexium UI was the culprit? <br />
<br />
Well I loaded my UI and froze about 6 times in one hour. Then I loaded the default UI and have not crashed yet - been on continiously without a freeze for about an hour.<br />
<br />
I was curious if anyone else using this UI was having similar problems?  <br />
<br />
Well Both Sokol and I use this UI, neither of us have had any lockups..  as I posted before though, we have both switch out setting to 32-bit graphics.. (found in the display tab of the options window... click VIDEO MODE) <br />
<br />
BTW when you say lockups... are you saying you have to reboot your computer? or just it freeze's for a moment and then continues?</div></div><hr />

I ditched the Vert UI and my lock ups have stopped. Complete game freezes, No control over movement. I can hear sound still in the background, but I can't CTRL+ALT+DELETE it, nothing works. I have to manually turn my system off and then back on. Been using the default ui and haven't had any lock ups. I swapped back to the Vert UI briefly today and had 4 lock ups in 30 minutes so I ditched it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damisela</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something I did to test was copy the default folder into my vert folder before I copied the UI files there. This has significally helped the freezing problems. I've frozen only twice in a week's time frame.</div></div><hr />
