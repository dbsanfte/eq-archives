<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerasin</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, I'd like to thank petelusk for suggesting this.  I've started working on a spell bar that looks like a sword.  This might be of interest to you melee hybrid casters. ;)  I've mostly got the graphical work done, but I've still got to code and arrange it.  If I keep at it I might have it released by tonight, although I doubt that.  :)<br />
<br />
And here's a screenie:<br />

<br />
This graphic was done completely from scratch using Paint Shop Pro 8.<br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
<br />
The sword spell bar is now in game and almost finished.  Here is another screenie:<br />
<br />

<br />
It seems more or less in-tact, if somewhat granulated.  I still need to make a spell-book button as you can tell.  I also noticed that the sword is somewhat bright, so I am going to make a dark variation.  I'll most likely package them together for convenience and upload them when I'm done.  It should be done today if I don't have too many distractions.</div></div><hr />

It hurts having all these ideas in my head and no ability to get them out  - I envy you =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you ever decide to make that into a vertical hotkey mod I would be all over it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerasin</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EDIT: Sorry, I misunderstood the last post and did not give a relative answer.  I would like to make a matching hotkey box, however it might look better if I make it so its not identical.  I could start on something like that once I get on top of some of my current projects.</div></div><hr />
