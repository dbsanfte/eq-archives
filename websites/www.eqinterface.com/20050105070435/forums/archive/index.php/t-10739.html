How do i delete them out for good? They take up space and i dont wanna see them in the window anymore. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dolby</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you'll need to make a blank text file with the same name and set the file attributes to Read-Only. Compaired to the amount of space Everquest takes up the story file sizes are pocket change.<br />
<br />
or maybe set the story folder attributes to read only... that may be easier.</div></div><hr />

It would just result in the file still showing up on the story window, but when clicked on it would be empty.<br />
<br />
Sorry dude, but there's no way to get rid of them.  You just have to live with the fact they have to be there.  The only problem with this is, EQ is still hard-coded to show only a certain number of stories (i think it's around 20 or so).  <br />
<br />
They didn't expect users to use this window in such clever ways as we have, so they didn't expect people to have a ton of story files in that folder.<br />
<br />
I've sent numerous /FEEDBACK requests to fix this, but nothing has happened yet.  Please do the same and maybe Sony will take notice.</div></div><hr />
