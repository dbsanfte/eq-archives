<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arimus</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Odd thought... since it looks at least like you didn't do anything wrong...<br />
<br />
Depending on which version of EQ you bought, it is possible for you to have 2 EQ folders...<br />
<br />
Folder 1 = C:\program files\Everquest<br />
Folder 2 = C:\program files\Sony\Everquest.<br />
<br />
I believe that your UI mods would have to be in folder 2 if you happen to have this setup for your EQ and subsequent expansions.<br />
<br />
again, just a thought, but happened to my wife with an old EQ install setup.  Bought EQ and all expansions in one box for my account, and only had 1 folder.   hers had both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This seemed to be a common problem with many of the custom UI's after the Sept. 9th patch.  From your UIerror.txt, it looks as though you have a custom EQUI_Animations.xml file in your Onenote folder.  If this is the case, just follow the directions located in THIS POST (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10083).  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just checking the actual Error lines in his uierrors.txt file...It may actually be his default EQUI_Templates file that is the problem. It may not have gotten updated for some reason. My advice would be to delete all files in your default folder and let the game reload them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forry</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know the error says it is the template file, but what its saying is that the template file is calling for that item, but can't find it.  That's because the actual ? item is defined in the EQUI_Animation.xml file and if there is a copy of the animation file in the custom directory, it hasn't been updated.  Either way, the link from my first post should cover both problems.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onenote</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I deleted everything in my Everquest\Uifiles\default folder.<br />
It didnt help.  I still get only the default UI.<br />
<br />
 Then I went to your link Forry .... its kinda obscure and for a NON techie like me Im totally lost about it all.  <br />
<br />
Am I supposed to do ALL that or step by step till it fixes it?<br />

<br />
You will need to find the EQUI_Animations.xml in your custom folder. Use Notepad or Word to open the file and then you can perform the changes. You should only need to update the Animations xml (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?postid=53176#post53176) from the link forry gave you.<br />
<br />
If you wish attach the EQUI_Animations.xml file here to your post and I'll update it for you. I do suggest you try it your self since it’s something you’re going to have to do in the future when SoE releases another patch that breaks custom Interfaces.</div></div><hr />
