So anyone know how I can fix this?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try redownloading and installing it in an alternate location and check that you have all the files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilyin</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thanks for all the help! /sarcasm<br />
<br />
Anyway I've narrowed it down to the EQUI_Spellbook.xml, removing that allows me to load the patched Vert. Still doesn't tell me how to fix it, nor explain why this problem is occuring (the EQUI_Spellbook.xml wasn't even modified with the patch) at all, but it's better than nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at your error log, the relevant lines are the following:<br />
<br />
[Fri Feb 13 21:26:02 2004] XML reference error! Ui2DAnimation[6]:A_SolSpellBook01[644] referenced but NEVER declared!<br />
<br />
XML reference error! Ui2DAnimation[6]:A_SolSpellBook03[645] referenced but NEVER declared! <br />
<br />
This doesn't say which XML file is the problem, but since removing the custom EQUI_SpellBook.xml file got the UI to load successfully, more than likely the problem is with that file.  Specifically, on lines 644 and 645 of that file, a reference is made to a graphic/animation called A_SolSpellBook01 (line 644) and A_SolSpellBook03 (line 645).  Problem is that those graphics are not define anywhere.<br />
<br />
I may be wrong, but this is what I think is happening.  Were you mixing together two different mods??  The vert mod and a mod for the custom spellbook??  It seems as if both mods were using custom graphics, and that those graphics were defined in EQUI_Animations.xml.  With the GoD patch, the default version of this file was modified, so it became necessary for custom mods with a custom version of this file to to be updated.  When you downloaded the Vert patch, you downloaded a custom version of this file that was compatible with the GoD patch.  However, this updated file did NOT contain the definitions for the graphics/animations needed for your spellbook mod.<br />
<br />
To clarify, prior to the GoD patch, your EQUI_Animations.xml file contained the standard pre-God definitions (i.e, default), definitions for Vert, and definitions for your spellbook.mod.  When you downloaded the Vert patch, the file contained the standard pre-God definitions, GoD patch modifications, and Vert modifications, but did NOT contain modifications necessary for your spellbook mod.  Thus, it was now compatible with Vert, God, but not with your custom spellbook.  <br />
<br />
Two ways to fix this.  First, as you did, stop using the custom spellbook.mod.  Second, edit your current EQUI_Animations.xml file, and manually put in the definitions necessary for your spellbook.mod.  To do this, I sugges looking in your old EQUI_Animations.xml file in Notepad, and searching for where A_SolSpellBook01 and A_SolSpellBook03 are defined.  Then, copy and paste those into your current EQUI_Animations.xml file.  <br />
<br />
<br />
BTW.....<br />
<br />
MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR ENTIRE CUSTOM UI BEFORE DOING THIS. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is, I'm using the original Vert spellbook. I even extracted a fresh copy of the EQUI_Spellbook.xml from the original vert zip, same problem/error. <br />
<br />
Looking at the EQUI_Animations.xml file, the a_solspellbook01 etc, are indeed defined. So I'm totally clueless as to what the problem is.</div></div><hr />
