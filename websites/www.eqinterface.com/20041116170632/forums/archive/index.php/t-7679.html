I have stream-lined a UI into 4 well coded windows to try cutting down memory usage, but it did not do much better than default.  I would definetly try it out if you release a text only UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe removing all the unused animations from your _Animations file helps memory usage.  I haven't tried it myself, but remotely remember someone making a mod like that awhile back.<br />
<br />
I also would think that if you edited your EQui.xml file to not load certain windows, and to not still check the default file for them, that would help memory use as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinkfu</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">deleting the unused animations do nothing, if it is not in the modded animations.xml it will find them in the default, the best way to save memory is to reduce the size of the TGAs which I have allready droped most of them by half their original size.<br />

Don't do this.<br />
It will cause your interface to crash with a 629 error....I tried.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd rather this thread stay on topic as to who wants to see the mod, than become a discussion on how EQ reads your Ui files.<br />
<br />
Tinkfu, if you do not upload the Ui to the regular dowload areas, please start up a new thread in the Released or Beta forums when you have a working release for us.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

the background that you find in FU I put their for my necromancer and forgot to take it out before I released FU... here is a screen of what the background looks like.<br />
<br />
Should I keep this in the FU interface or use the default background?<br />
