<br />
It tells me that some of my xml files are not compatible with this version of everquest.<br />
<br />
How i installed was DL first of course then i &quot;extracted&quot; to  the equi file. After that i made the ui_name_server to UI_Markius_Bertox (name of my rogue and server) wich then i copied over the existing ui_markius_bertox file.<br />
<br />
When i loged in game it told me that my xml was not compat. <br />
<br />
I looked at this link http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13048<br />
<br />
but for the life of me could not fine that file i found a similar one and took at look at that but could not find what i was looking for. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vitaee</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is with the EQUI_MapViewWnd.xml file.<br />
<br />
This UI is appearantly using a custom in game map window, and this is the source of the problem you're having.  <br />
<br />
Try this.  Find the abovementioned file in your UIFiles\Rogue directory.  Then rename it to something like xxEQUI_MapViewWnd.xml.  This will force EQ to load the default version of the map window.  Let us know what happens when you try this.</div></div><hr />

Looks to me like there are only 8 spell cast gems and the old 15 buffs .. if so, that is where you're getting the incompatible messages from ..   <br />
as an experiment, see if you can download and insert oow buffs and castspell, and see if that will fix the problem :)<br />
