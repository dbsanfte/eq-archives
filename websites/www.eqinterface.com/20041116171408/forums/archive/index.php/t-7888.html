Its nearly complete with just some cosmetic work here and there. Would like your comments/opinions on the screenshots Im posting. There are many things not shown in the screenshots we have completely redid as far as graphics and layout so bare with us.<br />
<br />
Normal view casting spell underwater.<br />
http://bellsouthpwp.net/y/e/yeak2383/files/normal.jpg <br />
<br />
<br />
View with inventory open.<br />
http://bellsouthpwp.net/y/e/yeak2383/files/inventoryopen.jpg <br />
<br />
View with spellbook open.<br />
http://bellsouthpwp.net/y/e/yeak2383/files/spellbookopen.jpg <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This UI was built with most vital information up and down the center of the screen. Your still able to view information and see whats going on with full inventory open. The gauge globes truely look like globes being filled or losing liquid apposed to circles that just have a flat fill look to them. Pet window and spell casting bar look as if they are connected but they arent they are two seperate window for those who wish to just use Spells and no pets. Just turn off pet window and slide spell bar over to the edge. Pet window has a secondary health gauge you can watch as clicking your pet commands. Main target window has pet health as well to keep eyes focused on the center. If you have any questions or comments please let us know so we can try and make adjustments before release.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
<br />
Well personally I only use one chat window especially in this resolution. Everything non essential is turned off in chat and even hardcore raiding I can keep up with everything in that window. Later versions at higher resolutions will include more than one chat window.<br />
<br />
As far as the target window looking big, the pic doesnt really do it justice. In game it looks wonderful really have to see it in use to appreaciate it. We actually started out with a smaller version and it just didnt look right in game, then we came up with this size which was perfect in game and looks great.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback, keep it coming, good or bad doesnt matter just like to know where we stand. :)<br />

<br />
I will probably add an additional transparent chat window somewhere for myself, but quite cool looking.</div></div><hr />

awesome work guys. <br />
this takes how ui's have been going in a whole new direction...<br />
its fantastic...can't wait to use it.<br />
and yeah 1 chat window is limiting..but believe me..i can cope !<br />
enjoy the colors, not too bright and not dark, very easy on the eyes.<br />
looks very functional..everything presented and can be found pretty easy.</div></div><hr />

I use photoshop for alpha channeling just because its super easy. As far as code, I make updates just using wordpad Im not sure what chronwaas uses maybe he has something more elaborate.<br />

I just like working with the code directly and I can see the whole thing in my head so I don't both with any of the graphical coders that are out there right now.  I my opinion they are not good at optimizing the code and I was working to make this UI as unbreakable as it could be so that Verant is not breaking it everytime they make an update.</div></div><hr />

Off hand i couldn't think what they could be, or if they were for decoration.<br />
thanks :)<br />
looks awesome!<br />
fantastic work by the way.<br />
greatly anticipating its release.</div></div><hr />

Those will be the timers, of course the name of the timer will be in there for whatever you want it to be, a spell duration, an ability timer, whatever.<br />
<br />
As for the size of the target window, I think that once people see it in game they wont think its as big as it looks. As I stated earlier we had a smaller verision but it just didnt look right so we came up with this one. Cant wait to let you all try it out :)<br />

For all those wondering,  Yes, once we get the full product out we will be working on getting each of the pieces put out as individual parts for all those people that want just certain pieces.  It should not take long but the way that the whole was written was so that it would be less likely to break on each patch that comes out from VI/Sony.  So the parts have been centralized and will need to be de-centralized so that each piece can act as it's own entity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure does, The auto equip is the glass that covers the target window, just drop an item there and itll shoot it in place for ya.<br />

<br />
Once we are done with 1024 768 we will be working on porting it for different resolutions, and ill be making different skin packs for those who like the feel of this but want some different graphics. There is alot that can be done here. Alot of people complain about the single chat window, but considering the amount of space to work with you can only have so many per resolution or things just dont look right. Ive been working on the max resolution which and it will most likely have either two big windows or you can break it down into 4 smaller windows however you like. Im glad people are giving us thier feedback its very motivational keep it coming pls.<br />

Thanks for such an elaborate post. Im going to see how it would look in action and will let you know. One thing to consider is the fact that you dont want to have to move your mouse around alot to get to trivial stuff like memming spells. When I origionally created the spellbook it actually wrapped around the spell bar and looked cool but then remembered that transparent windows truely cover up everything so was a lost cause. I do agree that the spellbook does look a tad off from the whole scheme maybe will rework it a bit to make it fit better. Will let you know what I come up with about your idea.<br />

Yes I should be able to fit the F2-F6 in there just fine.  Might make the font a little smaller since it is not a major part of the window, but it will still be readable so it should come out fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the first resolution we are making is for 1024 768 once we get that one perfected others will follow. As far as just using individual pieces like the mp3 player it wont matter what resolution you use really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also an idea for the spell book is make it look liek it is attached to the spell bar, not wraped around just next to it like there 1, then you can close the book.<br />
<br />
But i love the Ui and hope you can release it in differant colors too )<br />
<br />
Good luck;) ;)</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind that it is beta and not a final release, there are many things we are still tweaking to make it perfect and we know about most problems with it. If you find something really out of whack or something you cannot do that you find a must post about it and will try to work it in. Thank you all for your patience It is my hope that this becomes a very popular UI. Its clean easy to see, not too fancy, most items easily within reach. Small files for less texture memory usage and screen lag. If you want to change the overall look of the graphics to suite you better, just use the tint option to make small modifications you can do some really cool stuff with it. Cant wait to hear your feedback.<br />

Hey Kenney,  I may be able to help with that.  I will look at the files and see if I can adjust the tint on the cursor for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronwaas</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here are three versions of the cursor.  Each a little darker than the other.  Just extract these to your SalChron Skin directory and rename the original file to Salcursor1.tga and rename the one from this file that you want to use to salcursor.tga.  That's all there is to it.  If you do not like the first one just go back and rename the file back to what ever it was and rename one of the other ones to salcursor.tga.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps kenney.</div></div><hr />
