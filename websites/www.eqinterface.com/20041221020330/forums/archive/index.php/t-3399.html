Where you can enter the amount, hit start, and it will count down the timer visually, and then sound a bell when the timer is complete.  This also needs an option that displays current game time and local time.  And also an option to make the countdown timer repeat.<br />
<br />
Like this:  Set timer for 15 mins, hit start.  Timer counts down each second from 15 minutes, when 0 is reached, ding.  resatart timer automatically.<br />
<br />
Very useful for timing spawns.<br />
<br />
Also, just a regular old timer.  Start time = 0, add seconds until you hit stop, and keeps the display.  Also needs a clear button, and a continue button.<br />

I'm very busy, but if I get a chance to learn how to make changes to UI stuff, this will be one of my first tasks.</div></div><hr />

Ummmm - that's why this is called the &quot;WISH LIST&quot;.<br />
<br />
as listed on EQGUI forum page the WISH LIST is<br />
A place to post your wish's to Verant about UI XML features in hopes they read this forum.</div></div><hr />

While that may be true, this line in the original post:Originally posted by Ramgar <br />

leads me to believe that the original poster was under the impression that those features are currently possible with UI mods, and was directing the post at player mod makers (rather than SOE). So Haliken's response was most likely to dispel that assumption.<br />
<br />
That being said, this issue does make a good &quot;wish list&quot; item. Player-made timer mods are currently very limited in usability due to the limitations placed on UI mods. It would be nice if SOE would allow more control over animations, or better yet, provide in-game timers in the EQ client itself.</div></div><hr />

This being a watch, it lets you set up countdown timers in game, sorta like the alarm but this one would have 4 or 5 different ones that could run at once. Also, it will let you check game time from anywhere (such as from the moon), i know this doesn't seem that important but somethings are basied on game time such as set an alarm to let me know when it's 10am game time so i know it's at least safe to get though Kith Forest without sitting there pounding time over and over.<br />
<br />
It would be even nicer to include something like this ingame like on the actions window. Please send this in to suggestion so it will have a louder voice! :nana:</div></div><hr />

Follow the wall! and the other things that are based on gametime (day/night spawn cycles) are usually easily predictable by the visible day/night ingame cycle. I've never once found a place where gametime actually mattered but you couldn't tell what time it was.</div></div><hr />

Aye - when Luclin first came and a group of us discovered Norrath time was unavailable, we made as much noise as we could along with suggestions for a tinkered watch including possible recipes.  I just dont see how the poor gnomers in Shadowhaven can stand not knowing what time it is.<br />
<br />
As for the line &quot;The sun does not move here and without that frame of reference you cannot tell what time it is&quot; - what a load of bull crap.  In medivial times there were: water clocks, gear clocks, and candles which burned at specific rates.   Aside from this - what's really annoying is that when I'm outside in Luclin and lookup, OMG - there goes a planet - and its movements can be measured and timed - so the whole thing goes out the window.  It if were true, they they should revamp all the old-world dungeons and planes to not show time - because you can't see the sun.</div></div><hr />

Slightly modified of course, instead of chiming when You are beginning to Appear. Or something like that, would have to read the script for times. Yes it IS possible. Search for EQ Watcher on Google.com</div></div><hr />
