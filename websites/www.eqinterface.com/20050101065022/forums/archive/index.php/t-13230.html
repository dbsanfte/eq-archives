<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xymarra</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The easiest way to figure those out is to download the extra mods you want to install and look at the file names in the zip.  Before mixing a new mod with an old one, try deleting or renaming the overlap files first to make sure the defaults work.  <br />
<br />
For example, I downloaded a map window mod (chosen basically at random).  It has one file in it named EQUI_MapViewWnd.xml.<br />
<br />
If there were already a file named EQUI_MapViewWnd.xml in my UI, I would rename that file to EQUI_MapViewWnd_backup.xml or I would make a subdirectory called &quot;backup&quot; and move the file there.  After moving or renaming the file, I would try to load the UI.  If the UI without the map file works with no errors, it should be safe to mix and match a different map window.<br />
<br />
So, the next step is to unzip the new map mod into the UI directory.  Then reload the UI.  The new map should appear.<br />
<br />
Be wary of any mod that changes EQUI.xml, EQUI_Animations.xml or EQUI_Templates.xml, since those files affect the entire UI.  If you want to mix and match two UIs that change any of those three files, you will probably have to edit the XML.</div></div><hr />
