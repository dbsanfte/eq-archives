You can make it completely transparent but it will still be there.  But if you set the size of it to 0 by 0 it will be impossible to actually click on it.<br />
<br />
This will serve to remove the input part from all chat windows, including the main.  Hitting the enter key or the / key will still allow you to enter a command, but you won't be able to see what you're typing while you're typing it.  Imagine how hard it will be to respond to tells.<br />
<br />
If you want to remove the chat part from extra chat windows (such as hitsmode windows) while still leaving it normal in the main chat, that's not gonna happen.  They all use the same format.  Simply making it transparent, without that dumb grey border, should be sufficient.  But if you really need to, you could position the input window at a specific location instead of anchored to the bottom of the window.  If the chat input were located at 2, 200 but your chat window was only 200 pixels high, the chat part would be effectively off the screen.  You'd want your main chat window to be slightly taller than the others so its chat input shows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Remove the input bar from chat window. If it won't let you, make it 0 pixels tall<br />
2. Create new file with just input bar in it<br />
3. Make the global include thing call your new xml file<br />
<br />
If this works (don't have eq at work, can't try), you can have multiple text windows and one input line detached from it. Would that blow things up?</div></div><hr />
