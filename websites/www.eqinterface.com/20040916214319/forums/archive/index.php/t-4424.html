That way if you're using the mouse to heal for example, you can click on a name, then quickly click the heal</div></div><hr />

I follow your work from the big three (EQUI, Tking/Remelio Supporters, and Trancendence) and am often suprised at the work you come up with!..Bravo to you Sir!<br />
<br />
Now...on another note..(See my thread at Tkings Supporters)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remelio</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I don't see anything over there so I'm going to assume you're still typing it... <br />
<br />
Hurry up I wanna go to bed ;)  Hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kisacki</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These are Great !...but I run into the same problem that I usually do with your player/group/target mods...I run my display at 1280 x 1024 and that makes your great windows unbearably small...the numbers are kinda hard to read...if you could provide a slightly larger version for higher resolutions that would be great...<br />
<br />
On another note...I'm sure you have, but thought I'd mention it anyways...any consideration to you doing the same mod but with the fancier tubes?...don't think I'd need to look anywhere else ever again if that could be done.../ponders...stew over it...I'd be willing to sacrifice the larger area that it would require for the look...maybe a lot of others would also...please consider doing that would ya?....thx.  Keep up the Great Work !!!...always, Kisacki ~ 65 Necro~ The Nameless</div></div><hr />

<br />
Already been requested.. after I'm done with the t.king mp3 player I might go back and do this.. otherwise Cairenn is welcome to do so ;)<br />
<br />
Also, I might do a higher rez version later :)  Depends on how many requests I get for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if Cairenn doesn't do it you can bet I will :) will also work on making your spheres a litle more sphere-y if you don't mind. I love this Remmy! Especially the quick-target window!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amitan</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gets to small on 1280 yes, personally i wouldnet have gauge for exp and altexp just the numbers with XP:number and AA:number would be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvasie</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love this idea - great work!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remelio</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a heads up - I will be redoing the &quot;healer's window&quot; in this mod to be a lot bigger.. its too small right now to provide the intended effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remelio</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the link for the larger version of the &quot;healing window&quot; (http://pub165.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31.showMessage?topicID=54.topic) <br />

Feedback appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KingGeo</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice work.  the red and yellow spheres have woke me up a few times already.<br />
<br />
Ported your group window over to my Drakah UI and me loves the new toy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeluin</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the bigger bubbles but would prefer the names in a smaller font with maybe a transparent background- the first one took up about the right amount of screen space but was unfortunately not visible enough, this one eats my screen :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remelio</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an mp3 window to code but I'll see what I can do about this after I'm done with that ;)<br />
<br />
Glad people are finding it useful.. Keep the feedback coming please <br />
<br />
:nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenwulf</div><div class="date">01-13-2003, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well really Like the group mod, especially the player window as target :). It's great for a pure melee. Only one complaint, no attack number. (melee never get the love! ) Any way you could add current attack number somewhere in that group window?</div></div><hr />
