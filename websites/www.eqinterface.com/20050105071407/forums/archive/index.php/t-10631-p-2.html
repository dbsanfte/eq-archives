I love the UI, but I'm also a fan of transparency. Hope you keep developing this one and introduce new things to it, it rocks :)<br />
<br />
Oh, one final thing, what are the timers for in it? the 2 small blue bars next to the hp and mana bar, and the long blue bar running near the hotbuttons?</div></div><hr />

timers are a &quot;tick&quot; 6 secs, the one below that is 1 min. and the big one is 5 min timer for mod rods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Prior to 7.5 all I changed was the spell Icons.  I find the TKing ones to be too similar between a lot of the buffs I use as a paladin.  My self buff and virtue and brells (I think those are the ones) look VERY similar in the buff bar, so I use the spells I got with vert back in the day.<br />
<br />
With 7.5 I had to get a little nasty with the xml.  I don't like the new map addin you put in.  When in LDONs I like to have the map up all the time.  I LOVE the map you had in the previous version.  The small map with the grey background and minimal border stuff.  I would stick it in the lower right corner of my screen with the menus and buttons actually sticking over the side.  In this position, the map covers my pet area, the hotkeys, and the bag shortcuts but obscures none of my game screen space. <br />
<br />
Running this way I can do a whole LDON with the map up and not ever dismissing it.<br />
<br />
This new map is a pop up, check and dismiss again thing.. much less usefull.  To me at least in any case.  It is also very wastefull of screen space and doesn't work nicely over a lot of things due to it's transparency.<br />
<br />
I'd be super happy if you went back to the previous version of the map!  In the mean time I will have to replace the map file, and import the textures for the map background.<br />
<br />
I LOVE the new bags with 6 clicky spaces in them.  I'm tempted to put 3 above and 3 below the inventory slots if possible... perhaps it isn't though with the 4/6/8/10 slot bag issue.<br />
<br />
One thing I did notice when modifying the new casting bar's clicky slots is that it &quot;seemed&quot; like you made reference to 8 different inventory slots but only 6 show... perhaps I was reading that wrong though.<br />
<br />
Is there an easy way to change the pointer??  I will have to look further into pointers, I don't like that the new one obscures the item you are carrying on it almost completely.<br />

<br />
But a few things i never liked were :<br />
<br />
A) the spell bars...i normally use the old ones and edit the animitions XML file so it reads the buff.tga file. <br />
<br />
B) i used to change the slots where items/bags go from round to the square ones but it stoped working in this upgrade. <br />
<br />
C) the new HP bars, the ones from the prevous update were nice i was trying to edit it so i could use those again but it seems the file they were held in is no longer used. <br />
<br />
D) Mouse pointer, seems you removed the basic pointer from choices =\<br />
<br />
The purpose of my post is to find out if you could post extra files or a way to swap out files so i or other ppl who wanna use diff files can use<br />
<br />
I normally try to edit it my best on my own but seems that you updated so much stuff i can find everything i need to edit =\<br />
<br />
<br />
anywho, i thank you for making this UI, far by the best one ever made and i hope you can help me out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rynoa00</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, I would like to say that the AYA UI is by far the nicest one out there.  I've used many and have completely adapted to this one, and always look forward to a great upgrade when the time comes.<br />
<br />
I do have a question though, is there any way to remove the rainbow health bars and change them back to the ones that were in the last version?  Everything else I can adapt to easily, but I'm finding that the health bars are just too distracting after getting used to the old ones, which I thought were great.<br />
<br />
If there is a fix for this I'd appreciate knowing how to go about changing it back.<br />

Did you put the EQUI AYA in the Pointers folder into your UI. You need that XML to use any of the pointers in the folder.</div></div><hr />

The only thing I can think of is for you to check your EQUI AYA.XML file. Open in note pad and find &quot;cursor&quot; check to see that ayaepic.png is used. The pointer is a .PNG with the new download.</div></div><hr />

Yep, sure did. My problem is same as Weasel96's cept the default cursor shows up fine. Am trying to turn tga file to png...that will work if I can figure out the transparancy.<br />

<br />
Feebb  <br />
<br />
OK I think I found the problem:<br />
<br />
In the AYA EQUI <br />
  &lt;TextureInfo item=&quot;AYAepic.png&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;128&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;128&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
  &lt;/TextureInfo&gt;<br />
<br />
This needs to be changed to:<br />
  &lt;TextureInfo item=&quot;AYAepic.tga&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Size&gt;<br />
<br />
This is the &quot;Cursor line in the file:<br />
 &lt;Ui2DAnimation item=&quot;A_DefaultCursor&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Cycle&gt;true&lt;/Cycle&gt;<br />
    &lt;Frames&gt;<br />
      &lt;Texture&gt;AYAepic.tga&lt;/Texture&gt;<br />
      &lt;Location&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;0&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;0&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Location&gt;<br />
      &lt;Size&gt;<br />
        &lt;CX&gt;37&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
        &lt;CY&gt;45&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
      &lt;Hotspot&gt;<br />
        &lt;X&gt;1&lt;/X&gt;<br />
        &lt;Y&gt;1&lt;/Y&gt;<br />
      &lt;/Hotspot&gt;<br />
      &lt;Duration&gt;200&lt;/Duration&gt;<br />
      &lt;CX&gt;128&lt;/CX&gt;<br />
      &lt;CY&gt;128&lt;/CY&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Size&gt;<br />
  &lt;/TextureInfo&gt;<br />
<br />
As you can see the Line points to AYAepic.tga Yet the &quot;Texture Info&quot; Points to a AYAepic.png.<br />
<br />
If you make the above change your cursor of choice should work.<br />
<br />
I used to change cursor myself to use my own, But I like the one used by Kanon in this update.<br />
<br />
You can use &quot;Notepad&quot; to make the changes.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I use your UI and your Target rings is their a way to make like the MA Ring one color and the SA Ring another color?  Right now our guild's main raid leader has the abilities to desinate 2 MAs.  I am normally the MA and I at times get confused which ring is mine and which is the SA's.<br />
<br />
Also on your newest Target ring set of the package of 4 which set is the 7.5 in the zip?<br />
<br />
Also my Target of Target window for 7.5 set is not showing the % health of the target?  Like it shows it in your screen shot on first page.<br />

Looks like you need to delete the raid window file (EQUI_Raidwindow) in your customer UI folder... that should fix your problem.  This will cause the UI to use the default one, but it should fix your problem.<br />

Your XML files are not compatible with current Everquest files, certain windows may not perform correctly.  Use &quot;loadskin Default 1&quot; to load the Everquest default skin.<br />

This problem has already been covered somewhere and its a newb problem but if i may get some advice on how to fix it i would be grateful.  And a great UI also.  Love the design.  Great work AYA</div></div><hr />

The cause is the NEW Raid Window. You can Delete the Raid Window XML and let it be pulled from the Default. or search the forum for the corrected Raid Window xml Kanon posted. I Think it's some  where around post # 317 or so.</div></div><hr />

I very much like the look of the AYA NewSpellgem.zip  vertical spellbar, it is the nicest looking spellbar I have found thus far, but two problems:<br />
<br />
1st problem:  The files don't work.  I unzip them, and it does not change to the new spellbar when I restart.<br />
<br />
2nd problem:  I put my spellbar on the lefthand side of my screen... is there any way you could switch the labels to the right hand side of the spellbar?<br />
<br />
Thx for your time, I hope to hear from ya soon.<br />

I downloaded this and installed... (not crazy about the slanted health bars btw) but the tribute window is messed up. Can you take a look at it?<br />

<br />
<br />
2 questoins: <br />
<br />
1) Do you have any design for a Melee version with endurance in the main window where mana is, sorta like it was?  I wouldnt care if it was in both places, but as warrior, i really liked it was right in the open.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Will we be able to use custom cursors again? I love the warrior epic one :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I been useing this UI now for months and I simply love it, as of recently I have had issues with the windows for instance the friends window button   pops up a left to right slide bar with bags clickys ext in it.<br />
<br />
Raid window and augmentation window are both missing buttons along with adventure window, I think this last patch really did a number on the UI is there a fix on the way or do I dread going back to the old UI.<br />
<br />
The current UI Im useing is AYA650R3B3 or something real close to that, the last two numbers are scribbled on the paper i wrote on...lol<br />
<br />
Anyways any advice or fix if there is one yet please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thankyou for this awsome UI which Ive enjoyed way too much.<br />

The Stationed world containers eg. Kiln, Pottery Whell, Brewing Barrel and Forge works fine with Trivial search window, but the Sowing kits, Alchemy bag &amp; Tackle Box just opens up as a normal bag with Combine at the top.<br />

But, I am having a problem with my cursor blinking , every other second it blinks.  Even when I move the cursor around it blinks. I've even tried changing the cursor to default one that is provided in the Mouse Cursor folder that comes with AYA.  I really wanted to use the cursor in the 7.50 folder in the Mouse Cursor folder.  So I took that file, AYAEPIC.TGA and took the XML file from Mouse Cursor folder and copied and pasted and overwrited them in the main AYA folder.  The cursor started to blink so I tried using the DEFAULT CURSOR that is in the default cursor folder in the Mouse Cursor folder, same thing happened.  Here is what my error log says but I dont even know if this has anything to do with my problem, because the rest of the UI was fine, only problem I had was the blinking cursor.<br />

<br />
When I try to change the cursor and load the UI, it won't load, and stays at default UI.  <br />
<br />
I also remember that somewhere it was written that the beta version of the UI didn't support different cursors, has this been corrected yet?<br />

AYA can support different cursors. However to change from the AYA Cursor selection you will need to do some XML Changes.  :o</div></div><hr />

Go to your EQUI Hotbutton Window XML. Page thru the file to the - &lt;Button item=&quot;HB_Button1&quot;&gt;. You will find 1 to 10. Change &lt;Font&gt;3&lt;/Font&gt; to a lower Font number. <br />
I think that is what your looking for.... ;)<br />

If Geln even looked at the AYA Posts He/She would know R2 and R3 are no longer supported. How much do you want from an Author that supplies you a with one the BEST UI's out there, and as stated FREE.<br />
If you took the time to really understand what it takes to put together this UI you may have some idea what your asking for, but it is obvious you have no Idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could try the following:<br />
<br />
1. Go into your AYA UI File and delete the following files:<br />
    A. AYAgem.tga<br />
    B. EQUI Castingwindow.xml<br />
    C. EQUI Castspellwnd.xml<br />
This action will pull the Castspell window from Default (Vertical Wnd). I have done this with the Beta AYA 750 and it looks good, I like the Horz. wnd. better, that's why I tried this approach with the beta version. I think the trouble you maybe having is the file your trying to use is an old file and may reference AYA animations no longer supported with the newer version.<br />
<br />
I would suggest making a backup of your current AYA UI File prior to making any of the changes I have suggested.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valcare</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The work around for combining augments is to <br />
<br />
1. Exit Everquest<br />
2. Change the name of your ui file in the main Everquest folder that has to the naming convention charactername_servername to a new name like characternamebak_servername.<br />
3. Start EQ.<br />
<br />
This will force EQ to create a new ui file for your character which will support augment combines. After you do the combines, <br />
<br />
1. Exit Everquest<br />
2. Delete the charactername_servername  and rename (F2) characternamebak_servername to charactername_servername.<br />
3. Start EQ. <br />
<br />
You may think hey I can shortcut the process by just ingame switching UIs but that will not work. Hope this helps until the UI is patched to support augment combines.</div></div><hr />

I am having a problem with the current version missing the Disband button in the Raid Window.  The Decline button doesnt switch to Disband once I join a Raid.  The only way I can leave a Raid is to switch to default and hit disband, get kicked out, or camp.  Any ideas what I did wrong when I installed, or did SOE do something that is interfering with the code.<br />
<br />
The other problem I am having is that there is no mana value showing in my inventory unless I switch to default view.  Is it somewhere else on the UI, or did SOE add it after the UI update?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the great UI</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mokhtar</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, I've been using this UI for 6 month and it's great. I experiment a few problems I could neither solve nor find an answer too in this thread :<br />
<br />
First, there seems to be a problem with the autorun key / directionnal arrows, there seem to be two modes in which this works :<br />
- If I'm zoning somewhere and I'm on autorun just prior to zoning I switch to mode 1 : using directionnal keys while not on autorun won't work (eg : arrow up makes my last command appear in mainchat input line). If I hit the autorun key, the directionnal arrows work just fine (left/right make me turn, page up/down make me look up/down etc). The only way I found to exit this mode was to hit autorun and then one of the up / down directionnal arrow to get out of autorun mode, i then switch to mode 2 !<br />
- Mode 2 is more like I remember my UI to act prior to using AYA except that from the moment I switch to mode 2, I cannot use autorun and the directionnal arrows at the same time (I have to use mouse look to change directions on autorun)...<br />
<br />
My second problem is with the in-game map, I find it too small but that's not important. The really annoying thing is that whenever I want to drag the map to display my destination, the map seems to go nut : everything acts as if I had not released the mouse button after dragging and I have to close the automap and then reopen it to get the mouse pointer to get independant of the map again.<br />
<br />
Overall these are minor problems compared to the many utilities this UI has :cool:</div></div><hr />

Mostly with my warrior and a few breaks to try some other classes out. This is the first UI I have tried, other then the default, and I just started using it monday. I instantly fell in love with it. I like the setup and the viewing area is great. Still getting used to it but I have had hardly any problems with it so far. I can't find the friends window, but my quick fix to that was making a /who all friends hotkey. Seems to work great. Thanks for all your hard work and time put into doing this. I will definately be enjoying your charity. You have a good one and thanks again.  :) <br />

I just saw you uploaded your NA style Target rings and I just wanted to drop you a line that you have style and are great at UI modding.<br />

- AyaNaMA.tga missing in the zipfile (It is defined in the ini so I guess it should be in the zip)<br />
- The 32 PSOxx.tga missing in the zipfile (also defined in the ini)<br />

I REALLY like this interface and my thanks for your hard work!  A few quick questions...<br />
<br />
1)  To the left and right of the horizontal spellbar are six inventory slots (three on each side that is).  I'm assuming those are for items with click-abilities.  How do you change which slots are in those locations?  I've can't seem to move them or change them.<br />
<br />
2)  The lagmeter in the upper left corner interferes with seeing my first buff icon which is also up there.  Any way to reposition the lag meter?  Would switching to the old UI, moving it, then switching back work?  (I'm at work and can't try it right now or I would...   :D )  I don't want to have to turn the lagmeter on and off to see if that buff is still active.<br />

<br />
There are only two instances of EQType that I can find in EQUI_CastSpellwnd.xml - One is set to &quot;9&quot; and one to &quot;10&quot;.  These equate to the wrist slots per your table.  Yet there are six different inventory slots on the spell bar.  Thus I still cannot determine from your answer how to change these six slots by changing the XML file.

You may want to try the Character ini file, if you haven't already done so, change it so it reads UI(Character Name).(Server Name).ini. Copy this to the EQ Directory. I Have used the same UI and had no problems.</div></div><hr />

Only thing that would really need to be altered would be replacing the spellbar with the combat abilitly window.  <br />

Other things to make it more melee friendly would be removing the pet health bar to the left of the target window and replacing the mana info with endurance (and remove the existing endurance part).<br />

Fiddled around with my problem and tried what someone else suggested for the Omens AA fix... I added the missing tradeskill xml from the default into the aya folder but that didn't work. I decided to test the actual containers themselves and downloaded a custom container file and dumped that into aya and that didn't take effect either. I'm assuming there is a master file that controls what xml files are loaded into the UI? <br />
<br />
I'm very new to this so apologize for my ignorance. I'm planning to do some major tradeskill work this weekend and would like to have the convenience of the new tradeskill containers. As it is now, I have to load back to the default UI to work on my tradeskills, and then load back Aya when I'm not. It's a bit of a hassle. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koushirou</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those who want to change their colors back to the original or to something else they'd rather have, You can search through any of the files with gauges in them.  Now, just look for the different gauge sections in the XML (I'd do it here, but I'm away from home and was unable to bring EQ with me. :( *Cry*) and in the code you'll see a section saying FillTint and LinesFillTint, IIRC.  Inside that you'll see the RGB numbers &lt;R&gt;###&lt;/R&gt;, etc.  Change those three to whatever you'd like.  The lines fill tint will change the color of the lower boxes on the bars (the darker grey in the picture).  That's not on all of the gauges, though and I'm pretty sure this doesn't work with the rainbow gauges (group and target).  Fiddling with the colors, unless do something like put a letter or something instead of a number, shouldn't interfere at all with the UI, so feel free to experiment and see which colors you'd like.  You can do this with the casting gauges, as well.  Just have to find 'em.  I usually just open a file, do a find for &quot;gauge&quot; and just look for the Gauge Item sections, then redo the colors.  Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

I just can't get either to work.  I willingly confess I am a hapless loser when it comes to coding XML!  I also wasn't able to do the color restoral by putting back in those old files mentioned above (compass, target, pet) because, yup, when I dl'ed the new omens version, I overwrote everything.  UI stuff is just not my strong point!<br />

Can anyone that has all this figured out put these files up somewhere for download?  I love Kannon's UI far too much to just stop running it, and if he is too busy to post fixed files, maybe someone else isn't?  I hope???   :)</div></div><hr />

Go to this site and down load the updated version. It won't solve you color changes, but it will solve the other problems. :rolleyes: <br />

Is there going to be support for the default arrow mouse pointer again?  Foraging and the new cursor makes it very difficult to see if something is on your pointer.

<br />
Answer: Copy these files from an older version of AYA and overwrite the newer files:<br />
<br />
EQUI_TargetWindow<br />
EQUI_CompassWnd<br />
EQUI_PetInfoWindow<br />
<br />
PS.. Kanon does not have the older version posted here any more and I can't find it on his own website so your gonna have to look on your c drive for an older version before OoW. Look in c:/programfiles/sony/everquest/uifiles<br />

There is a way to change this:<br />
<br />
Use notepad (or Text Editor of choice) and change the Selector Window XML. You will be replacing the Journal Button with the Help Button. The Journal can be called up using Alt J.<br />
Once the change is made the Help Button will show in the Journal Button Location, But it will be a Light Gray Color ( I don't know how to change that).<br />
<br />
Changes you need to make(Within the Selector Window XML File)<br />
<br />
Find.....<br />
 &quot;SLEW_HotButton&quot;<br />
&lt;X&gt;420&lt;/X&gt; change to 375<br />
&lt;Y&gt;16&lt;/Y&gt; change to-13 (That's Minus 13)<br />
<br />
Find.....<br />
&quot;SLEW_JournalButton&quot;<br />
&lt;X&gt;375&lt;/X&gt; change to 420<br />
&lt;Y&gt;-13&lt;/Y&gt; change to 16<br />
 Hope that helps  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

In your AYA UIFILES folder delete the file &quot;FV&quot; (FV.PNG). This will remove the logo. There is a mini map folder that will change the map from the AYA circular map to a square mini map. Just copy those files to the AYA file, if that is what your looking for.<br />

Thanks for the answer on this. Unfortunately, when I downloaded the new version, it overwrote the old version of the .exe file. Also, when I installed the last version, I had to erase all the files from the uifiles folder in order for the latest version to work well. So, the bottom line is that I don't have any copy of the older version of the UI. Is there somewhere I can go to download this? Or can someone post it here? Thanks so much in advance.<br />

This UI uses the /viewport command and you are actually getting the entire &quot;world&quot; view just in a smaller space. If you want to eliminate the viewport settings, type &quot;/viewport reset&quot; into any chat window input line. By reseting the viewport to fullscreen, you WILL lose some of your worldview as it will be covered by the window pieces on the bottom portion of your screen.</div></div><hr />

if you mean that you cant find the window when you are in the game, trying switching to the default UI and dragging the old compass window to the middle of the screen. <br />
<br />
Then while you are online and in the game switch the UI back to AYA.<br />
<br />
Your compass window should be in the middle of the screen.</div></div><hr />

there are no old versions anymore. Unless Kanon decides to revert the colors back to the old type and post a new version. In the meantime, just use the current version. only difference is the experience bars are white and grey rather than yellow and blue</div></div><hr />

Check Your Selector bar and make sure the Pet Info button is selected. This should open the window for you.<br />
<br />
Also on a side note:<br />
<br />
The Gauge colors of Silver and Gray can be changed. You need to edit the &quot;Filltint&quot; in the Target, Compas, and Pet Info windows.</div></div><hr />

Yea but you said:<br />
<br />
1) copy the mouse pointers from the options folder and past them into the aya UI folder<br />
<br />
2) Download the compass window again. Works fine for me.<br />
<br />
3) Timer to the right of the ATK key is your current tribute<br />
<br />
4) Little bar above the hotkeys is a 5 min timer usefull for mod rods<br />
To fix the compass expedition/adventure &quot;line bug&quot;. So download it off where?  :rolleyes: You're confusing me :P</div></div><hr />
