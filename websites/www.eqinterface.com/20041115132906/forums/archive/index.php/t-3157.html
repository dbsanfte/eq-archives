<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This idea has been round my head for a long time and since Verant never fixed the old UI to fill in higher resolutions, I'm going to do it.<br />
<br />
If you were to put my UI and old EQ side by side, the one I'm working on will have a largher viewport. The resolution is higher (1024x768) , the old UI graphics will appear smaller (they are not resized).<br />
<br />
Here is a sshot to compare viewport sizes:<br />
<br />
http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/ui-classic-0.jpg<br />
<br />
This is the viewport :<br />
<br />
/viewport 120 0 784 608<br />
<br />
Personally I couldnt play in original UI viewport, I was in group tonight for a few hours and really comfortable with the viewport above.<br />
<br />
Features :<br />
- clear, uncluttered view<br />
- inventory slots 1-8 always on<br />
- actions window always on<br />
- pet window always on (not shown in pure melee version)<br />
- spell gems placed llike in the original UI<br />
- inventory like the original UI, with player stats on the left column while inventory is on<br />
- selector buttons that works : friends, options, help, inventory (click the class anim)<br />
<br />

<br />
Class Animation Will not animate on the main view unless the inventory is open. This isn't too bad after all, since it may be distracting. On the main view, it shows as inventory icon, and when you click it, then the animation shows:<br />
<br />
Bags Nobody cares probably but due to XML limitation I couldnt get the original 48x48 pixels inventory slots in the containers, so they are smaller (40x40 new UI ones), everywhere else they appear as in original UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairenn</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not in any way to be taken as an attempt to squash your plans ... have you seen this (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2370)?  Very similar in nature.<br />
<br />
Looking at the two of them beside each other ... you guys should team up, you'd compliment each other nicely. :)<br />
<br />
Either way, good work, major flash-backs. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I posted in that thread actually, I like what rayvenn's done, but I find the viewport too small. I also would like to see the old UI inventory which I find better, for example the slots are not in a cycle fashion, but are arranged by rows going from the head to the waist then to the legs.. which is more intuitive I would think.<br />
<br />
You could say, flashback, graphically, but in terms of functionality it should include all the new UI has to offer.<br />
<br />
That's what I m looking for, the classic RPG feel of the old ui, the new ui stuff, and new resolution so a larger viewport..<br />
<br />
I cou;ldn't play in the original UI to be honest.<br />
<br />
And I'm never happy with the new UI , there's always something in the way, my windows can never stay in place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cleaned up thread, pics in 1st post</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also would be nice to have the player hp number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is still in concept phase, actually that's where most of the hard work is done.. every graphic I put in place I think of the underlying window I will change, I spend more time watching the pic, scratching my head, than making it.<br />
<br />
So far so good, I tried the horizontal party window.<br />
<br />
For this interface it sounds like a GREAT idea<br />
<br />
PROS<br />
- you can toggle it off (the vertical party window was filling up the 'siides' thus if it was removed it would have left a hole)<br />
- when you toggle it off, you have a little more viewport visisble :)<br />
- solved the problem of short guages in the side bar, now they are the same length as new ui ones (with old ui look)<br />
- and had more space to put F2 - F6 labels<br />
- freed some valuable space on the sdidebar so now I can put more stats that are always visible :) (unless inventory is on, then it overlaps)<br />
<br />
CONS<br />
- all i can think of is it may be a little slower to read since it is spread in a long line but it shouldnt be an issue really.. plus it's close to the chat window <br />
<br />
I think the party window is really cool<br />
<br />
I am toying with the idea of a bar at the top with a long self HP gauge and target HP gauge... but that would totally enclose the viewport which doesnt sound good .. plus I still have to overlay the buff effects on the main view<br />
<br />
The colored 'circle'  around the spell gems will be a glow effect in the spell gem 'slots' :)<br />
<br />
I'm trying to decided whether make a movable flying Pet Window, or stick it somewhere in the sidebar..<br />
<br />
Now I am pulling my hair out with the inventory, rad a lot of forums to try find what best configuration to use.<br />
<br />
My main concern is range/ammo/primary/secondary close to inv slots for quick weapon switching during fight<br />
<br />
There ya go, please let me know if I overlook some classes or useful features..<br />

<br />
PS: One error in the last sshot, there is no GROUP button.. there is NONE can you believe ti ?? they didnt even put the GROUP window toggle in the selector dammit ! :(   if they had put the Spellbook as well in the selector I would have been able to copy exactly the old spell book icon that opened when you clicked it grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hochorz</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't wait until you get this finished!!!<br />
<br />
Just a couple things to bounce off you, and see what you think.<br />
<br />
First off, I like the initial layout that you had at the top (first 2 screenshots).  Personally, I like the layout a bit better with the vertical group layout as opposed to having it above the chat windows.  Second, instead of the 8 inventory slots always available, having it 4 inv slots and the 4 mele slots, or right clickies.  I constantly change weapons, and this would make it quite convenient.  Either way is great, I just can't wait for the download :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice work. Can't wait until you finish it. I have a couple suggestions though.<br />
<br />
-The actions window looks a little wierd. Are the pages switch around or something? I thought the tab on the far left was the one with who,invite,disband, camp, sit, and walk/run. I rely on the action window a lot, so I'd rather have it like the old style actions window was. :)<br />
<br />
-I love the way the group gauges are set up in your latest picture.<br />
<br />
-Player window. I think it looks a bit too awkward where the percentages are, and how it spaces the bars out. I'd take the percentages and put them at the top of the window, red text for hp, blue text for mana, that way the bars are spaced out right. Doesn't really matter either way, since I can edit it using SidlWidl when ya release it. :)<br />
<br />
-Not sure what you're trying to do below the player window there. Put level, class, diety, hp, ac, and atk there? I'm guessing thats the target bar just below it right?<br />
<br />
-As to the 'What here?' comment, maybe leave that area blank so people could put in some of Arista's timers? Just an idea :)<br />
<br />
-Maybe add a pet hp percentage next to your hp and mana percentage? Would make it pretty easy. As you can see in the picture I've attached I've played around with some things. Not exactly as good as your but hey, just check it out and maybe use some ideas? :) Also, there should be a pet hp bar under the player hp bar right? So you don't really need the pet hp bar in the pet window.<br />
<br />
-Combine the level,class,diety, etc window with the stat window?Take a look at my edits to your picture I attached.<br />
<br />
-I'm not sure what would fill that little spot just above the target bar. Maybe one timer or something?<br />
<br />
Well that's about it for ideas. I cannot wait until you release this. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback hochorz, I am taking notes and I would like to see more people's advice on the group window before makeing the hard decision.. <br />
<br />
Ok I have an idea..<br />
<br />
I think  I 'll make soon a ugly unfinished 'mock up' but one that works with this horizontal party window and yo uwill be able to give it a test<br />
<br />
Good point for the inventory slots,<br />
I know I need to use melee/range/ammo on the main view I am still pulling my haris out on this one :)  Just have to find the BEST config possible for most ppl<br />
<br />
KAENIL<br />
<br />
here is the actions window in my concept, nothing special here, nothing changed, just wrong tab on my concept layout :)<br />
<br />
I dont know how to spice this one.. havent seen any special actions window mods so far.. sadly we can not add any more action buttons than what is available.. but it will be modded for my UI to hold inv slots and such.. this is transparent to user<br />
<br />
http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/classic_beta4.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
Player window. I think it looks a bit too awkward where the percentages are, and how it spaces the bars out. <br />
I have to agree on that, will work on it.<br />
<br />
Not sure what you're trying to do below the player window there. Put level, class, diety, hp, ac, and atk there? I'm guessing thats the target bar just below it right?<br />
<br />
Yes I am thinking of combining those two, maybe the deity and class do not matter so maybe I will remove them as they can show while the inventory is on<br />
Yes below is the Target bar, but it will becompletely hidden when inventory is on, the correct target bar can be seen in my 4th post pic<br />
<br />
As to the 'What here?' comment, maybe leave that area blank so people could put in some of Arista's timers? Just an idea<br />
<br />
Hmm I will probably need all the space I can get, but that is a GOOD suggestion. i Will keep it in mind. If all else fails , people can always put things up on the view such as the compass.<br />
<br />
It's good to leave some space to 'breathe' in there anyway, I dont have to fill up everything with data.. so yes I hope I will have some space left :)<br />
<br />
Maybe add a pet hp percentage next to your hp and mana percentage?<br />
<br />
Well, for the player, I was thinking the pet window contains this info, and thus if the player does not play a pet class, there wont be some space left unused up there. I will try to add a precentage to the pet hp bar though wherever it is.<br />
<br />
there should be a pet hp bar under the player hp bar right? So you don't really need the pet hp bar in the pet window<br />
<br />
I didnt plan to, as explained above,  because it will leave a n unused space in player window to non pet classes, and also because I will have the pet window buttons together in oneplace and the pet hp somewhere else ? Or I would double the pet hp information.. so I prefer to leave the pet hp bar in the pet window.. I am hoping this way the Pet Window will also be a toggle on/off to add flexibility into the interface<br />
<br />
Combine the level,class,diety, etc window with the stat window?<br />
<br />
I planned to display the stats while the inventory is on, I think in order of importance you have hp/ac/atk, then the resists (because you can be debuuffed during fight), then maybe the stats ? So the stats will effectively appear when the inventory is toggled on,<br />
<br />
oh, wait.. I see.. ok yes when inventory is on I can actually merge this and stats take a little less space good idea :P<br />
<br />
in fact I may as well put all in one 'box' when inventory is on, I dont have to really stick to the old UI composition, I'm just using the old UI viewport arrangement and 'theme'<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what would fill that little spot just above the target bar. Maybe one timer or something?<br />
<br />
I can see that my posts were confusing because I posted the main view screenshot without the right side done, and then posted my 'in progress' inventory on screenshot with those done..<br />
<br />
I will try to post soon a actual concept of the main view :)<br />
<br />
Thank you for the feedback!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PS: I really need some help with the chat windows<br />
- do you like the old UI ones ? (parchment thing) I would replace those with a dark stone background.. because I have more custom text colors readable then<br />
<br />
- what configuration ? my plans at the moment are to use the right side for hitsmode as I am using while I play cf pic:<br />
<br />
http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/hitsmode.jpg<br />
<br />
if you have a nice chat window;/ hitsmdoe setup post me a link please<br />
<br />
the POINT is to have it out of the viewport of course, otherwise it would render this UI concept somewhat obsolete.. which is .. a nice clear view :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I have so far for main view, right side :<br />
<br />
http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/classic_beta5.jpg<br />
<br />
Here's the idea with the inv slots, which are ALWAYS visible then :<br />
<br />
[ inv slot 3 ]   [ Range ]<br />
[inv slot 4 ]    [ inv slot 8 ]<br />
[ melee 1 ]   [ melee 2 ]<br />
<br />
so, 3 inv slots, placed the same way is in full inventory, not to be confusing<br />
<br />
howver  top right is a RANGE slot, which allows quick swapping with inv slot 3 or 8, for those who need it<br />
<br />
slots 4, and 8 just above the melee 1 and 2 allow quick sweap of weapons, and shield for warrior bash-swap 'trick'<br />
<br />
for bards, it looks perfect as well for switchin g instruments and weapons :)<br />
<br />
so, what do you think ?<br />
<br />
still got plenty of space left as you can see :)</div></div><hr />

The only thing is the horizontal group window, makes you have to look all over to make sure no one in group is dieing :D   But I can get used to that!<br />
<br />
Keep it coming!<br />
<br />
:nana: :nana:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I think your new group design is better. As for the chat window, I would definitly go for the old style parchment type. It has very good visibility, which is why I don't like the dark tones of the UI's. I have to use bright colors to see clearly, and there are only so many bright colors. :( For me, visibility and ability to move my mouse are the most important things. Fancy stuff comes after that. :)<br />
<br />
btw, concerning the pet gauge under player hp gauge. The whole bar is visible when you don't have a pet up. When you do, it just makes a little line at the bottom of the player window. Imagine the exp window, the orange being the player hp gauge, and the blue being the pet hp gauge. That's what I'm talking about. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kainz</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the group window should be in about the same place as it was in the original ui.  I like the exp bar that is very great!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallux</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not move the groups part to the right hand side like the true original UI and put the inventory slots into a new tab in the actions window. That would keep the location of the inventory slots in exactly the same place as they were with the old UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I will try to use the vertical group window, because the horizontal one is effectively a bit slower to 'read'.<br />
<br />
So, you are not bothered that the gauges are somewhat short in the vertical group layout ?<br />
<br />
As for the inventory slots I want to stress that my goal is not to copy exactly the old UI.<br />
<br />
That said, this IS a good idea, if only because I planned to have maybe 3 inv slots along with melee and range for swaps, but if I use a tab for this as you propose it is possible to have 8 inv slots on view without inventory open at times when that is useful (such as crafting, trading with other player.. )<br />
<br />
Good ideas.<br />
<br />
Will post an update today or tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Thanks for feedback!<br />
<br />
PS: Other things on top of my head : going to MOVE the melee/inv slots for combat to the left, same side as the hotbox.. eyes are always on the hotbox for ability refreshes.<br />
<br />
If there is enough space then on the RIGHT between the action window and the player/target/exp, I should try to fit in there a veritcal table of buffs  with small font for names.. hopefully.. I'd be great to REALLY free the viewport of overlays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaenil Darkwolf</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya think you could make a horizontal group window as well? Maybe include both horizontal and vertical group windows so it could be more customizable. I am always looking at my chat window, so it makes much more sense for the group window to be as close to the chat windows as possible. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, I can not have both in the same interface however, and I prefer to make UI that makes most sense gameplay wise than trying to please everyone.<br />
<br />
So, just because it's a little more interesting and flexible, I'll keep the HORIZONTAL one until I release it in the BETA forum.<br />
<br />
Then, I will look into the feedback from playtesting and decide which to keep.<br />
<br />
Now I just received PoP box I'm not hardcore eq player but I may slowdown a bit.. <br />
<br />
I would say in about 2 weeks I should have a beta for testing, and a bout a month I should finish it.<br />
<br />
What I know for sure is there will bne at least 2 versions, because the CAST BAR  can NOT be opened when playing a pure melee class (rog/mnk/war), I have to change the use of windows in the pure melee version to fill iin the viewport sides..<br />
<br />
So far then the plan is <br />
- PURE MELEE version<br />
- Hybrids/ Casters version<br />
<br />
As I said more because of a limitation than the desire to make specific versions.<br />
<br />
You can arrange your windows and viewport to mock the UI I'm working on to get an idea about how things work<br />
<br />
http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/classic_beta8.jpg<br />
<br />
ok I forgot to place the target window on the side (old sshot), you can slide the inventory so the right of it totally overlaps the target window when it is on, that is what will happen.<br />
<br />
I a comfortable with the viewport, but I have noticed that when merchant opens for example I have to move to left and right sides to open bags buy/sell.. this is not optimal but is 'ok'<br />
<br />
the reason the inventory opens on right side, is taht way I can simulate part of the side bar showing the player stats when inventory shows.. as in the old UI, I can not do that on the left ebcause when the loot / merchant window opens the inventory opens as well, they would both overlap the left side.. <br />
<br />
This will be tested in beta, and if it turns out to be annoying.. then I can always make a full separate inventory pane with the stats on it, that could be moved around as well, like new UI one, with old UI look.<br />
<br />
The one that overlaps on the right you see will overlap less space of the viewport, given that it is opaque and most windows in this UI will be opaque (i.e. more readable), this is a good thing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, just an idea<br />
<br />
you remember the old UI when inventory was on, you had a little window with a 3d view of your character ?<br />
<br />
Well I wanted to keep a space for this, and put a tga there that player could customize, all they would have to do is replace the TGA file with a graphic of their choice, possibly a sshot of their character..<br />
thought it wa a nice feature for 'personalising' the ui<br />
<br />
but I doont think I have the space for it<br />
<br />
but maybe you guys have an idea about this..<br />
so I let you brainstorm on it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what I have so far,<br />
The icons are very small (20x20 px), not many options for placing those out of the view sadly.<br />
<br />
Even if I kick the level info away, I will get larger buff icons, and smaller space for the buff spell names, so not really better.<br />
<br />
http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/classic_beta9.jpg<br />
<br />
Will have a green/red good/bad effect halo somewhere..<br />
<br />
Now the last somewhat tricky part, the CHAT windows.. sounds like I won't have much flexibility therem overlapping will not work, and all chat windows, even if they are different sizes defined in your ini files, they ALL use the same 'graphic' definition from the UI....</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion, you might not even have to have the icons. If there are words there that's good enough for me. I'd rather just see the words anyway.<br />
<br />
Also, did you know that when in game if you put your mouse over the buffs then hold down the ALT key the buff names pop up? ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
also,<br />
<br />
what about adding a small bar at the top with the &quot;player&quot; bars in a row..<br />
<br />
i will mock something up and add it to this post later tonight... but  i will try and show you what i mean... then you would have a little more room on the right bar for stuff..<br />

<br />
I cant really use a smaller font, it is 10 pt on the screenshot, smaller than that will strain the eyes on a 1024 resolution.<br />
<br />
I personally believe the icons convey information quicker, I would myself have the icons rather than the names, especially since they were remade with the new UI there is more variety in the icons. If it wasnt for the fact that using Alt on a 'grid' of buff icons will not show the names in a readable way, I would have them as icons, or I would have had a version with just icons for me :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Kudane Hi, that clicking through would have been a real feature for the inventory window.. the space that shows 'holes' while it is on effectively 'eats' the mouse click thus you can not click a target that you would see in those 'holes'.. hopefully this is limited so it won't be an annoyance.<br />
<br />
As for the group window it covers a lot of the background anyway, and you can click on it effectively to select group members so I am not sure what you mean. So basically whether I use a fancy design or not, the mouse clicks will never pass through the window :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PROGRESS<br />
<br />
Begun programming the UI, putting the bits together<br />
<br />
here is the top left, due to a limitation in XML (hard coding!) I can not have the proper class animation animating in the mainview, unless the inventory is open.<br />
<br />
So the best workaround I have thought is it displays a 'inventory' icon (should be better than that bag.. not worried about gfx now). When you click it and the inventory shows, it is replaced by the class animation, which animates properly. It is not shown here because it has a ugly grey backgrouind from new UI so I ll have to replace the new UI class animations with the old UI ones to fit in this 'theme'.<br />
<br />
Other windows are in place and covering the whole space outside of ther viewport with no seams, but they are ugly as hell :)   screenshot later<br />

<br />
Since I added Player Info &amp; hotbox it's getting much nice, and I seriously like this UI :)<br />
<br />
I thought I'd mention that while the viewport is smaller than full screen, the field of view does not change! Hence you get everything on your screen. <br />
<br />
It has to be said though : this UI is NOT for windowed mode !<br />
<br />
THink of it.. the window on your desktop is a viewport already, if, somehow, your EverQuest is not running fullscreen, you will be looking at a viewport IN a viewport ! Which makes it look quite smaller and cramped.<br />
<br />
But fullscreen, oh my, I'm really really liking it so far..<br />
<br />
PLANS<br />
<br />
I need to at least finish the inventory and the right side, before I can release a Beta version.<br />
<br />
From then on I hope I'll get some good play testing on it, and I will finish up all the windows (merchant, loot, tracking, options, advancement).<br />
<br />
Most windows at the moment look not bad at all since I have replaced the default template with a 'stone' border, but the mix match ofnew UI and old UI pieces on some windows has to be worked on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here you can see the buff window in game, after I asked some fellas in the Nexus to throw me all the crappy buffs they could spare :)<br />
<br />
The colored background are a bit rough, and I find the icons really small, but I'll live.. maybe I 'll have a different version with just bigger icons and no text (as you can use Alt). This will have to be judged at beta phase when I receive enough feedback on it.<br />
<br />
I personally would go for just icons, bigger, icons, as you can use the ALT key to show the names. The problem I was having is to have an arrangement you either need 5 rows of 3 icons, or you get 2 columns of 7 buffs plus one hanging somewhere.. if I use 5 rows of 3 icons, they still need to be smaller than 40x40, but I dont think the names will show properly with ALT when I have 3 buffs per row.. I have not tested this yet. I'm just SO IMPATIENT to do the inventory lol<br />
<br />
See actual resolution here (1024x768)<br />

SCREENSHOT (http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/classic_beta13.jpg)<br />
<br />
Btw, somehow I couldnt  debuf myself (snare, root, tangling weeds, flamelick ..) even after removing some buffs.. it said 'You are protected from blabla..' so you dont see the RED background on the pic.. but trust me.. it's red ! :P<br />
<br />
PS: Brueno Nothing on her back hehe, I just like to play in external view at least 50pct of the time, everytime I run around I use external view (tap F9 3 times) the view which you can steer left/right your character, also during fights I find it more interesting to wath my character fight, and it is more relaxing because the camera shakes a lot in first person during combat..<br />
<br />
So I just remember I tap the F9 key 3 times then 2 times, then 3 times then 2 times etc.. I quickly tap 2 times to get in first person if I need to reposition or taunt something off someone, and this ... just because the 3rd view is Bugged and clicking a target doesnt work well, for example if you want to open a door sometime you have to go in 1st person to click it, even using the 'use' key in 3rd person will not work because that stupid game actually look at the center of the screen and sees your characyter's back instead of the door.. that is a stupid bug I filed already but nobody cares oh well :)</div></div><hr />

I like the inven/mele slots, I think that will prove to be quite useful and convenient.  <br />
<br />
Maybe have the character information in the player window (lvl, class/title, etc) and perhaps percentages on hp/mana..etc.<br />
<br />
I like the buffs the way they are, that's the way they are on my current skin.  I just can't get used to the new icon graphics and I get confused as to which buffs are still up when I can't see the names :)<br />

<br />
do you think you could leave xp in the inventory mode? i don't like to look at it while hunting...<br />
<br />
Difficult choice here. If I follow Verant's design with EverQuest, I would not display experience on the main view. THis is probably what I should do, and I WANT to follow the game's design, actually.<br />
<br />
However I tend to switch the inventory on and off very often after a fight, especially at lower levels (I have tons of sub-40 alts), because sometimes a blue mob experience will be next to nothing,  so you can never 'trust' the game that fighting blue mobs will be a good hunt. You always have to check when you try something new. :/<br />
<br />
I thought I might as well put this up on the main view instead of switching the inventory on and off all the time :p<br />
<br />
All I can say for now is I will be putting more thought into it.<br />
<br />
what happened to the group window?<br />
<br />
There should be a scrrenshot somewhere of the horizontal group window. My last decision was to go with the horizontal design, and see what people think once it is in Beta. The advbantages for the horizontal design is that it's going to be hard to fit the vertical group window in there with the buffs now, and that the horizontal bar can be toggled on and off which is more flexibility, it thens shows at the bottoms or people may even like to put it at the top of the main view.<br />
<br />
hochorz<br />
<br />
Personally, I like seeing my XP while I'm hunting, but it wouldn't bother me if it wasn't there if you need the space. <br />
<br />
Yes, you more or less confirm what I think, I think most people would want it but could live without it on the main view.. I should probably leave it in the inventory... I need to see what use i can make of that space otherwise. If I put other statistics there design-wise it would be just the same as to leave the experience there. Any ideas what you would put there ?<br />
<br />
Maybe have the character information in the player window (lvl, class/title, etc) and perhaps percentages on hp/mana..etc<br />
<br />
I dont have enough space even to display the full HP correctly at the moment :)  Basically I am trying to not display too much information on the main view, it needs to 'breathe' if you will. Ideally what yu want on the main viw is the essential information and nothing else, similar to web design actually :)  PS: the percents will be there for HP and mana<br />
<br />
I like the inven/mele slots, I think that will prove to be quite useful and convenient<br />
<br />
Glad you like it, I think it will be perfect for bard, melee swapping, or even to have a bag always available to drop foraged items and things.<br />
<br />
Thanks for feedback, it';s good to have this discussion while I am working on it, every space on this interface need to be thought a lot, as when it is coded in XML it is very time consuming to change it to something else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ataal</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me start off by saying that this is exactly what I've been looking for since the newui came out.  <br />
<br />
I could never play in fullscreen mode before and since the newui came out, everyone is linking stuff and using the /trader function in bazaar and I've been jealous.  <br />
<br />
I tried that winmode version for a while until it was broken by that one patch and I have never been able to get it to work since then(even by reading the readme).  <br />
<br />
I know you're probably nearing your final decisions on a lot of the stuff here, but I'd like add to the polls on some of the issues, ie...exp bar, group bars, etc...<br />
<br />
Group - Horizontal vs Vertical :<br />
<br />
I play MANY different classes, I have 4 50'ish characters that I play the most, and lots of 30+ characters that I play when I just want to get away from all the /guildsay spam and stuff.   <br />
<br />
That being said, a vertical group bar is essential, nay required for a healer class.  It could be argued that it's probably ideal for a main assist class also.  Sometimes you need to know who is the lowest on health and that is not easily ascertained from a horizontal group bar.   Granted, a necro at 40% isn't needing a heal as bad as a warrior at 50%, but you get the idea.  <br />
<br />
Another very minor point to make about it is when people in lower levels wanting to alpha loot.  YES, you can figure it out with a horizontal bar, but it's much easier to do it in your head with a vertical bar.  <br />
<br />
Experience - Inventory vs Main :<br />
<br />
I honestly could not count how many times I've wanted to 'see' the exp movement off a single kill, and actually go to my inventory screen while I'm trying to finish off the critter.  The problem with this is, I've got half my screen blocked by it and I can't see well enough to watch for any adds or other important things.  <br />
<br />
Aside from that, I guess I can't come up with any other 'real' arguments for it, it's a preference, but I'd be willing to bet that the majority would like to see it in main screen.  <br />
<br />
Inventory slots available on main screen :<br />
<br />
This one is very class specific as even you have stated that these are perfect for a bard.  It may even be nice for a warrior that uses a bow to pull, but then switches it out with his goranga idol.  The only other 'real' use I can see is for right-clickable items.   However, my right-clickable items may be in completely different inventory/worn slots than yours, so I think that makes it very user specific.  <br />
<br />
So, my opinion?  Use this space for something 'everyone' will benefit from.  I'm sure you will get requests from bards, warriors, etc... later on, heck I may even want to make a donation or two for such requests.  <br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, great job.  I just wanted to voice my opinion on some of this stuff since this is my first time to these boards and missed out on the progressive posts.  <br />
<br />
/bow<br />
<br />
Keep up the great work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hi, sorry nothing new yet as I was levelling my warrior last nite :)  but I'vebeen doing some thinking while playing (I'm playing with the UI since a week, althoug its far from finished)<br />
<br />
thanks for the feedback, it is far from finished although the main view and inventory will be the essential work I am doing now.. so the discussion is open and fruitful<br />
<br />
a vertical group bar is essential, nay required for a healer class<br />
<br />
I do agree with that, certainly it is quicker to see, and somehow last days I played with the UI, I felt that party window was eating some spaceo n the view.. <br />
<br />
will be difficult to fitvertical group bar but I will try every idea i come upon<br />
<br />
the levels will go in thje inventory, that will free up some space for a start..<br />
<br />
<br />
but I'd be willing to bet that the majority would like to see it in main screen.<br />
<br />
very likely, but to get the vertial group window (more important I think), I will have to move the experience to the inventory<br />
<br />
that being said, I love the right side inventory :)  I can switch it on and swap my gear and watch my character in external view, and the inventory does not block the view, in the new UI I always have to move it to the side when I check my 'look's <br />
<br />
I think it will be far less an annoyance when this inventory is toggled on as it covers only one side of the view, and not in a rectangular fashion<br />
<br />
but who knows.. once I Manage to put a vertical group window somewhere.. maybe I can move the exp bars to the left side<br />
<br />
Another IDEA I was toying with : put the exp into a new tab of the actions window ? You could leave this tab on, although I like to have the actions window always on now ( i didnt in new UI), because I can see the refresh on abilities without using extra hotbuttons :)<br />
<br />
may even be nice for a warrior that uses a bow to pull, but then switches it out with his goranga idol<br />
<br />
You;re talking about my warrior right ? :)<br />
<br />
imho these will be useful to most classes, at least those who need it, I prefer a general solution than making class specific versions ( time consuming)<br />
<br />
It's great for a Bard, and for a Bard I could even use one or two more slots . For a warrior its great to swap goranga idol as yo umetioned but also to sweap main weapons, I like to swap weapins during combat often, sometimes for the proc, sometimes becuase I notice I dont taunt enough while 'practicing' and so I quickly put in a good delay weapon to raise taunt..<br />
<br />
For all classes in general it's great I think to have at least one bag there, to store foraged items, or to use the extra slots as an 'extension' (yo ucan open and switch weapons in the bag as well, just place the bag conveniently to the left side )<br />
<br />
It does hoewver, take space I initially planned for the Pet Info window. This will be solved later..<br />
<br />
right-clickable items may be in completely different inventory/worn slots than yours<br />
<br />
Yup, this is why I am not too worried about a 'clickies' window, I'm afraid I cant make a good solution unless I would make a window with most slots, then you may as well use the inventory :p  I think using the ionventory for that purpose is convenient enough, especially now it does not cover then center of the view<br />
<br />
Latest thoughts..<br />
<br />
I will remove the experience from the Main view, at least until I find another space for it. I dont think swithcing the inventory is a main gripe I have with the game, I could think of 100 other things more annoying than that :)<br />
<br />
I may even have to remove the AC/ATK values to find space to fit a vertical group window in there.<br />
<br />
I think for people who enjoys the Lore and the social side of the game more, removing the exp from the main screen will be welcomed.<br />
<br />
The main problem I have so far with the vertical group window is the size of the gauges. Hopefully the gauge will be for a 'quick look', and the percentage will do the trade-off for the small gauge size.<br />
<br />
PS: let me know what you think  of the screenshot of the vertical group window, in the 1st post.</div></div><hr />

By the way great work.  I enjoy everything about what you've done so far and plan on using it as soon as its available.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Luminea Thanks, well I really don't know about the chat window yet. On the recent screenshots you see what it looks like with just the default window frame changed. Hopefully the chat windows are an entirely different 'section' of the work, and thus I dont have to worry about them for now. One problem I remember though, is that every chat window has the SAME graphics. Thus, if you want to split 2 windows on the bottom there, they will both have the exact same 'parchment thing' , which may limit the options for arranging them (dependinghow the graphic peices will fit together...). Either way, I'll do my best so it blends with the rest :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Today's ( little ) work<br />
<br />
Ok.. not in mood for graphics but I have put some thought into the vertical group window..<br />
<br />
Here's the latest plan<br />
<br />
http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/classic_beta14.jpg<br />
<br />
You can use the Alt+ P shortcut to toggle the Party window right.. there is no button on the selector window for that I'm afraid :/<br />
<br />
When the Party Window is HIDDEN, you can see some more info that should be nice when you are soloing, HP numbers, and Experiences.<br />
<br />
When you get into a group, switch on the party window (alt+p ) and it will overlap and hide those.<br />
<br />
(ps : for the technically inclined.. as you enter the game by default, it appears the Party Window is always on TOP of the target / player window, thus it will work as expected if you want to leave it always on)<br />
<br />
My thinking is that in a group you dont need to check your HP so closely and also you dont need to check the experience gain so often as it is m,uch smaller in a group situation usually.. (well myself I do check it just after 10 or so fights to get an idea how things are going..)<br />
<br />
Hopefully this solves:<br />
- vertical group window<br />
- experience not on main view if you dont want it (just leave party window open)<br />
- experience &amp; additional info while soloing, if you want it<br />
<br />
I hope this is good and I can go on and code that, let me know if I overlooked something :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Love this UI idea, can't wait for it to be released.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of an extra tab with the xp / hp info, if you can fit it.<br />
Take a look at vertUI (2 or later I think) to see how to get rid of the border around the tab pages.  At least that is where I learned it from.<br />
<br />
I am very eager to get my hands on this because it is *almost* exactly what I want.<br />
Changes I would make:<br />
 - Move the buffs out of the side, and to the large free floating format in the old UI.<br />
 - Find a place for the vertical group window that doesn't overlap other stuff, including the open inventory.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amaprotu I dont plan to put the buffs onthe main view, but this will be something real easy to change for those who want, at the moment you'd have to put the window fade to 0 percent, sizable and just move it, and make the target window taller to fill in the space on the right, so maybe a 'mod' later<br />
<br />
Find a place for the vertical group window that doesn't overlap other stuff, including the open inventory.<br />
<br />
Im not sure what you mean, when the inventory is toggled on, it will be on top of the group window. Unless of course you toggle the Party Window while the inventoryshows but I think those overlap issues are really minor and wont happen unless you try to. The idea is when the inventory is on it exactly overlaps the target  / player/  group windows, clicks do not go through empty spaces either, thus while inventory shows yo ucan still see the player window for example, but can not click it and so the inventory stays on top.</div></div><hr />

I must say, this has got to be the best UI I have seen yet. What about all the new windows i.e. Raid, Bazaar, Trader? Do you plan on making these anything special? Or just leave them alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All the windows that were in the old UI will have special treatment.. as they need to 'fit' in the left side of the viewport, those are Track, Loot, Give, Bank, Shop, .. from the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Some popular new windows like the Bazaar and Trader will most likely get a little treatment.<br />
<br />
Most other new windows do not respect the background texture specified in the XML, and more unnerving.. they continue to fade out ! Those will not be a great sight, but they will blend with the rest hopefully. (PS: the Actions Tabs are an example : the ACtions WIndow itself can be set to opaque, but the tabs inside will continue to fade out, also the texture for the tabs inside can not be controlled).<br />
<br />
Progress<br />
<br />
I have programmed the last concept screenshot<br />
<br />
Sadly, this is what it looks like when Party Window is on and you are not grouped, and you are a pure melee : mana 0 %,  and  lots of 0's in the party window. Yuk. VI really need to add numbers that dont show when the gauge doesnt show.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  for pure melee there is no mana percentage actually, since I 'll have to do a pure melee version anyway for technical reasons.<br />
<br />
http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/classic_beta15.jpg<br />
<br />
I dont want to bother them now.. but I'm hoping when this is finished and working well, that they will havea a look at it and maybe improve the XML a little bit.</div></div><hr />

That is what I meant.<br />
<br />
But really it is a magnificent work you have done. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
INVENTORY WINDOW (http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/classic_beta16.jpg)<br />
<br />
concept. <br />
<br />
I'm halfway done converting it to XML, with the part hanging over the viewport to be finished.<br />
<br />
Somehow I dont like the inventory hanging on the top border of the view, so I put it in the middle of the right side..<br />
<br />
I think the position of the Done, Destroy and Auto Equip areas is crucial... but I don't have any better ideas now, it really need some play testing (for Beta phase).. there will be one revision probably after some good playtesting.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you see something right now that's worth modifying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaprotu</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very impressive. <br />
<br />
My only concern is that the done and destroy buttons are too close to each other.  I would suggest swapping them with the Skills / AA buttons, and maybe even seperating them (done lined up with the left, under the plat, and destroy on the right, under the copper). <br />
<br />
I might also suggest combining the weight box and auto equip box to give a larger auto equip area.  Don't really know about that though without some play testing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amaprotu good point about the done &amp; destroy, and great idea for the auto equip, it is fairly 'logical' to drop items on the weight box, if they come from the bankor a loot window you effectively increase the weight :P<br />
<br />
Working on that today, whatever the result will be done for until Beta phase then but I think you poiinted the major corrections :)<br />
<br />
PS: just working on it, and I realized I also need to make the Done button smaller, as it was in old UI, this makes it quickly differentiable from the other 3 buttons as well.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why I'm not really happy with it yet, maybe it's too low and I need to move it up.<br />
<br />
Maybe yo ucan spot something I didnt ?<br />
<br />
Game play wise it's certainly much better with the Done button at the bottom, it'd be better to move the Done button in the sidebar though.<br />
<br />
I have to update like 70 coordinates in the XML just to move the whole thing up or down.. dont feel like doing that now :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
so, might actually work on chat window next since I was making the main view elements first<br />
<br />
I'll try the old UI chat design first<br />
<br />
There shouldnt be any major problem, although I might have to tweak the graphics a little beat to make it work in a sizable window.<br />
<br />
I'll post a screenshot in the next few days hopefully.<br />
<br />
Current plan is to have 2 chat areas side by side, which you can size so you can have 50% 50 %, or 75% 25 % of the horizontal space... use the left one for main chat and right one for second chat or hitsmode..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallux</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome.<br />
<br />
Just one thing, any chance you could do a test and try doing the buffs like this screenshot:<br />
<br />
http://mywebpages.comcast.net/raxthorne/EQUI/images/small-buffwindow.jpg <br />
<br />
This would emulate the old buff design and give you a lot more space in the right side for inventory slots and exp/aa information.<br />
<br />
If you keep the buff icons small and put small text to the left of them it won't take much away from the viewport.<br />
<br />
Just an idea anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not in my plans right now, because I try to stick with this idea that the viewport is completely free of cluttering, but this will be easy to 'mod' into the UI when it is released anyway :P  I suspect people will want to add maps, recipes , different compass etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a quickie old ui style CHAT WINDOWS (http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/classic_beta18.jpg)<br />
<br />
I didn't bother with the vertical scroll bar, but I will explain.<br />
<br />
There's the chat windows with a dark background, those are UNFINISHED mind you picture (http://www.tearsofdoom.com/files/classic_beta19.jpg)<br />
<br />
I want to show you because I am open to discussion, and this UI seems to interest quite a few people so I am not trying to just please myself.<br />
<br />
Now, squint your eyes and watch each of those. What can you make out of the old UI chat windows? The white text almost entirely disappears, the yellow as well, you're pretty much left with the dark colors: blue , dark red, black.<br />
<br />
The 2nd pic however you can see just about any variety of colour will stand out and be easily readable, imho.<br />
<br />
PROBLEMS with old UI style chat windows<br />
<br />
I find myself sticking my nose to the screen most of the time to be able to read the text on the old UI style chat window.. either that or I had to change all my custom text colours to a much reduced selection of dark blue/ green /red, black , yellow and white. With a dark background I can tell you pretty much EVERY custom text color is different and I can tell each one from a nother.<br />
<br />
I realize everybody was fine at the time with those chat windows, but at the time you didnt have 50+ custom text colors either.<br />
<br />
ANother thing I dont like is that I find the UI at the moment to be very bright and the game seems to be plunged in constant night time, everything is so dark. THus the UI seems to come on top which isn t a good thing. The old style chat windows make it even more brighter and make the UI come forward instead of being somewhat 'transparent' to the player as it should.<br />
<br />
Yet another problem with the old UI design, is it doesnt look too good when you put 3 areas side by side. What if someone wants to have a 60 pct  main chat then 20pct width 'MY HITS' then 20pct width 'OTHER HITS' ? The old UI style chat windows I have implemented in the 1st screenshot above DO resize, but they dont look good when they are very small :/<br />
<br />
Plans<br />
<br />
I will design something of my own for the chat window, and post a screenshot when I ;'m done.<br />
<br />
Until then the discussion is open, and I posted 2 screenshots here hopefully so you 'll understand why I wouldnt use the old UI chat windows.</div></div><hr />

Any chance of a prebeta release? I think the chat area looks awesome. I totally disagree with you about the colours and feel the light background gives a very nice contrast.<br />

<br />
All customiseable parchments. A black one will give the look you see in the new style picture and the original old ui style will give a light coloured one. If you can keep the borders, people can slot in the one they find best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's it for today, I wish it didnt take so long. I spent roughly 9 hours on those last 2 windows :/  Each little piece I cut I have to enter the coordinates both on the game view and in the textures, and for each little piece I have to take a good look at each texture and decide where to fit it so that I am using the fewer textures possible. Not only that but many elements as seen in the game can be put together in many different ways and it all depends how you fit the pieces in the textures, how much graphic intensive you plan the window to be, and the limitations of the XML..<br />
<br />
For the tech inclined so far I am using<br />
<br />
2 extra textures 128x256 <br />
5 extra textures 256x256<br />
<br />
5 'replaced' textures (those are loaded in place of the default UI corresponding textures).<br />
<br />
Given the main view is done as well as the inventory and player info and group, I 'd say it's still 'lightweight' for the moment.</div></div><hr />

here is the cast spell window,<br />
this requires me  now to handle 2 versions, the pure melee characters can not open the cast bar window sadly and I have to fill that space of the background somehow.<br />
<br />
I am thinking of putting up a beta version soon. I am not playing EQ anymore at the moment, I still enjoy working on the UI though, and I want to get this project finished.<br />
<br />
By putting up a beta soon I hope to get useful feedback so I go and make the changes and implement the rest with the ideas from the forum and spend less time &quot;tweaking&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'll have to at least finish the track / merchant, and loot windows before the beta.<br />
<br />
About the Spellbook<br />
<br />
I like the idea of the old spellbook's arrangement of the spells. Instead of the same 'grid' of 2x4 spells on each page it had spells arranged in 'clusters'.<br />
<br />
WE can NOT have 5 spells per page and we can not have a different spell arrangement on each page. <br />
<br />
What I would like to do is just 'break' the boring grid  arrangement to create a pattern thats easier to remember<br />
let's say for example<br />
<br />
O......O<br />
....O....<br />
O......O<br />
...........<br />
O..O..O<br />
<br />
(so like the dots on the 5 of a dice then 3 in a row)<br />
<br />
So you might like to have your cure / heal spells in the last row, a big blast spell in the center slot, etc etc. the idea is that the arrangement helps to remember where you put your spells and arrnage them by groups, visually.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think<br />
<br />
The spellbook you can see on the screenshot here has NOT been modified at all. It just has the default window 'frame' that comes with all windows in this UI.<br />
<br />
PS:the idea with the spell slots is that the 'halo' looks like a little light inside the slot.. it's subtle, I hope that shows..<br />

<br />
On your original post at the top, where you compare the old UI to the one you are doing, it looks like there is space between the hotbuttons and the spell gems for the 8 inventory slots, just a suggestion. That would free up the space on the right side for spell buffs. All in all I think this is coming together very nicely. Congrats on your work and I look forward to trying this UI out soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One problem tho in the last picture...please give your halfling some food, we don't do well without a full stomach, k thx~ :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, ok :)  Seriously it was anoying while working on the UI my characters were starving hehe<br />
<br />
Ok, I thought I'd let anyone interested know about the future of this UI.<br />
<br />
I dont play EQ anymore, I need to concentrate on drawing &amp; painting &amp; my evening studies for now. Since I dont play the game, it does affect my motivation somewhat with the interface.<br />
<br />
That's to explain the slowdown, but I will try my best to finish it.<br />
<br />
I will try to release what I have now in the beta forum soon, I hope this w-e.<br />
<br />
This way, until I work more on it, you have something to put your hands on. I think there's enough graphics done to be immersed in this interface.<br />
<br />
The idea is that I will spend less time tweaking and more time working towards the 'final' concept with the help of your feedback in the beta forum.<br />
<br />
So see you soon in the beta forum.<br />

I realize its not the most time friendly game, heh, and Im sure modding it isnt either. But for the love of god release what you have done, put out a beta PLEASE. Im ready to kill someone to get your UI, thats how good it is to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ahem, sorry, my craving might have gotten the best of me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luminea</div><div class="date">01-19-2003, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK...well i haven't heard back from him in a while after sending him what I did about testing it.<br />
Heres the deal.<br />
I have the original files he sent me.<br />
 pre-jan 9 patch. I would love to see this UI get on the download area so folks can use it.<br />
Im putting in screenshot of one main problem being the player and group pet bars are all over the place and need to be cleaned up. also I know nothing about the coding and fixing these thing...so If someone would like to take the files and clean them up from the last 2 patches so we can release these so Fabbe wont have wasted so much time and folks get to enjoy his work...<br />
please email me at rlinebarger@hotmail.com or pm me on here...im not sure if the files are too big to send through some emails...fabbe had to send them to me through yahoo...<br />
Thanks for anyone willing to help fix it for release<br />

if you can post the group window part of the UI here, im sure myself or someone else can either fix it or look at it and post the correct locations you need ;p</div></div><hr />

Just because I didn't give you news lately didn't mean I wanted you to spread the files. You didn't mail me at all asking me about releasing those files. <br />
<br />
I'm really ANGRY about this and I don't want to see ANY download of this UI until it is released by ME in the beta forum.<br />
<br />
This is COPYRIGHT Fabrice Denis, a.k.a me!<br />
<br />
I am sorry for making some of you wait so long, but nevertheless this is MY WORK and I will decide whether I want to release it or not. Of course I have no reasons NOT to release it, but even if I didnt want to that would be my right.<br />
<br />
To those who think I'm taking this too seriously. Well, I AM OF COURSE! Let's see how you feel after you have spent several week's worth of work to put something together and someone distributes your work WITHOUT your consent. If you think this is stupid you may just as well steal those images on my homepage and sign your name under it, that;'s doing almost the same thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faBBe</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fair enough, I have made you wait long enough, I shall try and publish on the BETA forum what I have so far, pretty much what I send Luminea and another tester.<br />
<br />
I reckon I should probably have published the beta a while ago, as it is very playable as is.<br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
 I am going to post in the beta forum as I write this. I have uploaded the UI, it will be available for download once it is approved by the admin.<br />
<br />
So head over to the beta forum.<br />
<br />
Later,<br />
faB<br />
<br />
PS: by the way, Luminea, I DO realize you were trying to help, nevertheless you should have emailed me about it and received my consent before redistributing my work. I will post it to the beta forum anyway, and there won't be any wrong done, so this will be old news hopefully.</div></div><hr />
