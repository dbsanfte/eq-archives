Also on that theme you can't tab the pet/mp3/inv windows into the player window unfortunately. You could set them up there but they'd have to be creatively stacked, rather than tabbed. You can clone inventory boxes though, and the pet gauge and mp3 playtime gauge, so you could just stick those in there on the tabs and open the windows themselves when you need the buttons.</div></div><hr />
