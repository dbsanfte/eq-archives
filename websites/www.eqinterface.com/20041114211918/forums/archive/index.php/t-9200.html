<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Robb</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello people . I have been a loyal visitor to this site for a long time now, and have seen many many great UI's come forth . I now think it is time for me to make a complete UI myself, but I regret to say, that i do not know where to begin. I have a UI builder ( needs updating ) but what i am pressed on the most, is how to make my own borders for the specific windows . I am going to try and make another complete skull theme, while still keeping the UI  small on the screen . If anyone can give some information or even a link to where i might get started on this project, it would be a great start to many UI's to come from my direction. I have a ton of ideas to use for UI's considering i have played every class in EQ except for Beastlord, and Rogue . Please, if you have any information, PLEASE dont hesitate to put it down, if there are any folks who help and deserve credit, I will point you out on other posts of the UI's as they come forth. I am pretty well XP'd with computers, so it wont take to much to get the hang of this stuff, nothing else in life that i try to do poses problems, so im hoping that  you, the loyal EQ players and designer's can help a newb to this matter out. Thank you for you time .<br />

Also, it doesn't really &quot;make&quot; the interface - only serves as a tool (very buggy one since only an alpha version exists) to edit the components for an existing interface. It can't 'create' something from nothing.<br />
<br />
This has been covered in the proper forum, but the only way you can create a UI currently is graphic design and a lot of XML coding. Pure 'mental labor', you could say.<br />
