1 what UI are you using (please link if not easily found) ?<br />
<br />
2 Has the UI been updated for changes from the patch ? (See Cairenn's post in patch fixes forum)<br />
<br />
3 Has this UI worked for you previously ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yeldar</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was Originally Delta2.2 but has since been modified to my own needs now for, well.. I don't know how long... its been since before LDoN I know at least that much.<br />
<br />
I've made the updates posted from the patch to the best of my knowledge but these errors remain and I can't seem to locate whats causing them.<br />
<br />
This UI has worked yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Double check your patch for today, I would be willing to bet a character (or line) got dropped when you made the updates. ( I so wish there was a way to validate the files without having to log all the way in.) I am forever editing html code because I dropped a [ or ] or /, and I won't go into spelling errors (I seem to think that guote=quote for some reason LOL)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yeldar</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I went through and did all the updates a second time before posting this and received the exact same error from the txt file so I highly doubt I have spelling or coding errors though I will admit its possible.<br />
<br />
Thing is, it would help a ton if I could just figure out which file(s) are causing this problem at which time right now I can't do because of the cryptic messages that EQ generates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greymantle</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran into the same one. what i did id take out the equi animations file from my custom folder . that fixed it. lost my ranger class animation is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yeldar</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, since I never made any changes to the UI_Animations.xml file I went ahead and just copied the default version over from the patch but that still didnt resolve anything and the error file stayed the same.<br />
<br />
I'm out of ideas...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weskat</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try deleting the EQUI_Animations file from the custom folder.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, Zip the UI and post it here. I will give it a shot trying to find the error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mortis42</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cairenn's patch fixes can not always be followed word-for-word when patching a custom UI.<br />
<br />
There are whole sections that are called to be deleted form point a to point b.  In your custom file, there may be code added inbetween those two points that must not be deleted.<br />
<br />
When I patch my UI I use Cairenns post as reference while I compare my old file with the new default and make the changes only after being sure that my code matches hers.<br />
<br />
It is likely that those gauge pieces were deleted in one fo the blocks of delete form a to be and replace with...</div></div><hr />
