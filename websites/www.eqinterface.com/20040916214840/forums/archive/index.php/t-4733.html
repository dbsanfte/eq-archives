She for some reason prefers all her windows at the top of the screen.  The windows are trimmed down to the basics for the most part.  Let me know if anyone wants it and I'll post it.  Its setup for 1280 x 1024 resolution.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rebaidah</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kinda like it.. but chat window is to small.. I'd use that space for some right-clickies and just use a normal chat window on the bottom somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soes</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it, why not move it to the bottom? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Denno</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It could be moved to the bottom with a little adjustment (like the selector window around the lag o' meter) its at the top because thats where my wife wanted it :)  The chat box is small because she turns everything off except her hits the mob hits and guild chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guurn</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play with everything at the top also and I love this UI.  I agree it needs more chat space but I would love to try it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Denno</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, after work today I'll post it to the Mix and Match section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soes</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also it might be cool to add text labels in front of each group members name (F2, F3, F4 etc)... just so it's easier to target them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eindare</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the stuff at the top.  Some of my characters are large races and I don't like to page down over my windows to see the small targets.  Nice work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurrani</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love it. hurry up and post it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Denno</div><div class="date">12-15-2002, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok it has been uploaded to the Mix &amp; Match section.  Just awaiting admin approval.  Sorry for the delay.  Enjoy :)<br />
<br />
Will appear with the name Denno Top UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koul</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Denno- love your UI!!!<br />
<br />
How can i add other windows?  If i 'open new chat window' its always in the same location (bottom/center) and cant be dragged or sized.  I want to add two chat windows and have them invis on the sides to show my hits, misses and other melee stuff that shoot by too quickly in your small chat window at the top. <br />
Also found a real nice horizontal pet window that lays right under your stuff (Sars I think) and looks like it came with your mod (for pet class types we must have).<br />
<br />
Only complaint/helpfull criticism = cast bar is very small- tried to down load 'tkings arcane cast bar' but i think its hidden behind your ui and i cant access it ( any ideas????).<br />
<br />
Great job/Great UI!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Denno</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the long absence but just moved and still don't have internet connection at home.  Ok as for the cast bar, are you referring to the casting time bar or the actual spell gems bar?  If you are just wanting your hits to show up I would use the hits mode command instead of a separate chat window.  I don't know the actual command for it but I know its a command line in-game.  You might want to check out the Everquest official site on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koul</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm talking about the 'cast time bar'.  I tried to download tkings arcane cast bar but it doesnt show up for some reason.  I've used this arcane cast bar on other mods with no problems.<br />
<br />
I am aware of using just numbers for hits but i would still like the ability to add chat windows that could be dragged, sized and made transparent.  If u are able to do this or tell me how to do it, please do.  I and my wife are both using this mod on several of our characters and the limit to one small chat box is our only complaint (well an added arcane cast time bar is one to, i guess).  If u have the time we would really appreciate it.<br />
Again thanks for the great mod and keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Denno</div><div class="date">12-24-2002, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok as for the cast time bar, it is commented out in the EQUI.xml file that resides in the directory where you have this mod.  All you have to do for it is to open the EQUI.xml file up and remove the &lt;!--  --&gt; from around the line that says EQUI_CastingWindow.xml.  That should allow you to see the T. King one.  As for the added chat boxes, I'll have to look at this tonight when I get home but I think if you go into the EQUI_ChatWindow.xml file and change the border line to true instead of false you would be able to move the new ones.  I don't think you can drag the whole window at once but you can stretch it until you get it where you want it.  Again I'll check this tonight but I won't be able to post again until Friday, I get my cable modem installed at the new house then.  Until then please bear with me.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koul</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Denno- they both worked- now have an arcane cast time bar and movable chat windows-  The mod is now perfect-Great Job and many thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koul</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now- can u make one for a lower res. so my wife can use too???<br />
Pretty Please!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Denno</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What resolution does she use?  Right now things are going to be kinda slow in the EQ department, I'm still unpacking and straightening.  Computer was the first to be setup so I could get my EQ fix :)  It may take me a bit but I'll try to make a lower res one.  Just let me know what resolution and I'll go from there.  Glad you and your wife like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koul</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Denno- she uses 1024 x 768.  Get your eq fix in- all work and no play......well you know thats not good.  She cant wait to try it out.<br />
Thanks again and happy holidays!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Denno</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok Koul, I have uploaded the 1024 x 768 version to the mix and match section.  I had to cut the ac, atk, and weight from the player window to get things to fit right.  Hope she still likes it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koul</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Denno- cant find any new upload any where.  All I can find is the original UI for the higher rez.  Can u point me in the right direction or maybe your upload didnt take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Denno</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any time something is uploaded they have to scan it for viruses and make sure everything is ok before they will post it.  Give them a day or two and it will be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Denno</div><div class="date">12-31-2002, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like they got it posted.  Enjoy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monkiekiller</div><div class="date">01-01-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Denno- with your new res mod when using a non caster the buffs go to the spell bar window- however the icon are not centered up and down in this window so they are cut in half.  I dont know if this is where u intended the buffs to go or not.  My thoughts are to leave them below the group bar window as before- this would allow us to put a small chat window or two in the spell bar area but either way is fine by us.   Again-  Many thanks for this mod which we now have on all 10 characters.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monkiekiller</div><div class="date">01-01-2003, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Denno this past message is from KOUL but on someone elses log in by mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Denno</div><div class="date">01-01-2003, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DOH!  I was working on the UI with a character that couldn't cast so forgot to check the buff bar.  You should be able to drag it down.  Its tricky and may be locked but it doable.  I'll check it out and let you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koul</div><div class="date">01-01-2003, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Denno- actually had the problem with our caster classes also- ive tried to drag but have been unable to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Denno</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok Koul, here is a different UI_charactername_XX.xml file.  I was able to drag the buff bar down to just under the UI.  Just use this one in place of the one thats with the UI.  Let me know if this doesn't fix it for you.  Have fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koul</div><div class="date">01-06-2003, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perfect!!!!  Thanks once again for your hard work and great results!</div></div><hr />
