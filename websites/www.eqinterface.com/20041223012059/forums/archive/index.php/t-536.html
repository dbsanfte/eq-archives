EQType 70 is &quot;player current HP / player max HP&quot; and using it currently makes 17 and 18 then not work. But it's still easier than manually making it with 3 labels!<br />
<br />
EQType 69 is player's pet HP percent<br />
<br />
Don't know what 68 is. Player's pets name maybe?<br />

I'm a druid, so I had to charm something after guessing that it was...<br />

Label showed up as &quot;a_cave_basilisk_15&quot;  (14 on the next one charmed)<br />

actually showed the hardcoded name of the pet -=P<br />

I don't understand the difference between  EQ Type 13 for an epic also being inventory 35 listed in the same string.  Can someone explain this for me please?  I've got 8 different items to determine the codes for and I have no idea what I'm doing I'm afraid.<br />

<br />
I don't know what you mean with the 35 you mentioned. You just need InvSlots with proper EQType set based on the inventory eqtypes list and then put them where you want them visibly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winterwind</div><div class="date">09-11-2002, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's an example of the code I pulled out of Kanu's mod:<br />
<br />
&lt;InvSlot item=\&quot;InvSlot30\&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;ScreenID&gt;InvSlot30&lt;/ScreenID&gt;<br />
&lt;RelativePosition&gt;true&lt;/RelativePosition&gt;<br />

&lt;Style_Transparent&gt;false&lt;/Style_Transparent&gt;<br />
&lt;/InvSlot&gt;<br />
<br />
13 is the EQType for the primary slot.  What I don't understand is why InvSlot and ScreenID are listed as  30.  On the next one in line on his mod the InvSlot/ScreenID are different because it's a different slot, but I cant' see a pattern even though I realize there is one there.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astryne</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So this is a very very sloppy job, however those that want to check their EQTypes for labels may find it useful. It takes your Friends Window and turns it into a EQType checker for Labels.  Right now it counts from 0 to 150 and lists the number and then has the label.  Many of them are black text on a dark background, but with a little tweaking and a little squinting you can read them pretty easily.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that its really possible since the width depends on the contents (different letters/numbers take up different space) and the height is dependant on the font size. <br />
<br />
Good rule of thumb is 6+font size width for each char and 10+font size for the height.</div></div><hr />

The inventory slots using EQTypes 2000-2007 (bank) and 3000-3007 (Player trade/give) are only ACTIVE when the slots original parent window is open.<br />
<br />
So I was able to add the bank slots into my hotbutton window and I could see what was in the 8 bank slots and get Tooltip info.  I would not interact with the slots (could not pickup bag or right-click open bag).<br />
<br />
However, as soon as the original parent window was opened - I clicked on a banker - the bank slots in my hotbutton window became ACTIVE.  I was able to do my normal banking in my hotbutton window.<br />
<br />
So, in general, it would seem that the inventory slots greater than 1000 are depenent on their ORIGINAL PARENT window to be ACTIVE.  This is basically good as it prevents possible exploiting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have added a new window to the interface along with new game functionality.  The Songs window is a new buff window that holds up to 6 bard song buffs.  This increases the potential maximum effects that a character can have to 21 (15 standard and the 6 new ones).  The new window only holds certain bard songs (generally the 3-tick songs).  Only beneficial songs will qualify for the new buff box, and not all of those.  Any buff in the new Songs window is considered temporary and will not be saved when you zone.<br />
<br />
Songs that qualify to go into the new window will go into that window first.  Any qualifying songs over six will be rerouted to the main Effects window.  Cancel Magic effects will see these new buff slots as buff slots #16-21.<br />
<br />
Note for User Interface skin creators:  The Label EQTypes 80-85 are the Songs window song names.<br />

Other than that, list is great, thank you again for consolidating it all.<br />

The ones that are shown when you move your cursor over the buffs 1-15....   These would be usefull to have next to the buff itself so you know when your DS is gonna drop without checking it every few seconds..</div></div><hr />
