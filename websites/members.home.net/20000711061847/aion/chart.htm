      Biblion, from an ancient language, means the Great Book, or The Book
        of Books.&nbsp; It is therefore the purpose of the Guild to chronicle
        and record the great history of Norrath for the sake of <a href="nameless.htm">The
        Nameless</a> (please see that page for further expaination on how the
        nameless IS the only true god).
</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
        No real record or annul
        speaks of The Nameless' actions or deeds. We know of the finite existence of our
        many &quot;gods&quot;, and much of their history (yet not all) and try
        to find reasoning behind their actions, but, alas, cannot. All that we
        know is that which The Nameless wants us to know. All that we are is
        what The Nameless wants us to be. Without The Nameless, there would be
        nothing. It was His creations that first planted life upon Norrath, and
        that beget the world, as we know it. The Nameless is the one True God.
        Those that came after Him are merely minions of His greatness, each representing
        one facet of what The Nameless is.

        </p>
        <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
        But why does the Nameless remain a mystery? Why has he not revealed
        more to us? The Nameless has a plan, but only those who seek it may
        learn of it. The Nameless is the great challenge for His Grandchildren.
        The enlightened few who have not been blinded by their supposed
        &quot;deities&quot; must undertake the great quest to <i> name</i> The Nameless.
        Our father deserves a name and deserves the recognition as the Great
        Being, the one who made all. Veeshan, Brell Serelis, Tunare, are all His
        children, as we are theirs. Praise be to The Nameless!
        </font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
        This is not to say that His children are to be ignored, for they
        beget us. But perspective must be placed among this chaotic pantheon. It
        is not as we have been taught: a polytheistic law does not govern us. We
        live in Monotheism with a hierarchy. Each of our &quot;deities&quot; has
        been created by The Nameless to represent one aspect of His many faces.
        It is all part of the greater plan.
        </font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
        As History unfolds in the Age of Turmoil, we set out to chronicle the
        events of the world so that we can better understand the plan of the
        ultimate creator. We must understand our history and analyze it so we
        can be the profits of The Nameless. We must prepare Norrath for Him, and
        enlighten all of the grandchildren of His intent.
