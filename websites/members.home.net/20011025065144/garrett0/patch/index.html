<BR>
CONNECTING TO
THE TEST SERVER<BR>
<BR>
A new executable and some support files have been
downloaded to your computer which enable you to access the new Test Server Patcher.
From now on, if you want to play on Pendragon, you must run "CAMTEST.EXE"
instead of the normal "CAMELOT.EXE". Having a separate patcher for the live servers
and the test servers means that we can test new files when you are playing
on Pendragon.<BR>
<BR>
From now on, Pendragon will be updated with new features
and items on a regular basis. Ater tweaking and testing, those features will
then be exported to the live servers on a regular, scheduled basis.<BR>
<BR>
Please
note that if you switch back and forth between Pendragon and the live
servers, the patcher will automatically update files each time you switch. To avoid
downloading files each time you switch between live and test servers, you
may want to install the game in a separate "test" directory, so you can have a
live version of the game and a "Pendragon" version of the game.<BR>
<BR>
FULL
FILE CHECK<BR>
<BR>
- The test patcher has a checkbox on the CD-Key dialog called
"Do complete file-check". If you have reason to believe that some of your
Camelot files are corrupted, you can check this box before you patch. We are currently
testing this feature and it will be migrated over to the live patcher
soon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
CRASHING WHILE LOGGING INTO CITIES<BR>
<BR>
- Some players
were unable to load their characters that were "camped" in cities - most notably
Camelot City. This problem has been fixed, and all those experiencing that
problem should all be able to log in again.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PAPERDOLL ISSUES<BR>
<BR>
-
If you are having problems with the paperdoll graphic on your inventory
screen (fuzzy colors, garbled picture), and are using a GeForce card, try
changing your video driver to the 12.41 version since some users are experiencing
problems with other driver versions.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ADVICE SYSTEM<BR>
<BR>
-
If you want to help your realm-mates with common questions that they may
have, try becoming an Advisor! The Advisor System is set up so that players with
more than 15 hours of played time can choose to help others in their realm.
Simply type /Advisor, and you will be flagged so that others know you are willing
to help. Then, when players use the /advice command, their questions will be
routed to you, and all other experienced players who have flagged themselves
as Advisors.<BR>
