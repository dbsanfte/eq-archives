        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was inevitable
        that such energies involved in seeding planets with life would attract
        even more of the gods, and it was the Elves who drew the unwanted
        attention of<a href="innoru.htm"> Innoruuk, Prince of Hate</a>. In a decrepit tower overlooking
        the dark decaying alleys of the Plane over which he ruled, Innoruuk
        waited, stoking the fire of his Hate until it was a raging inferno. He
        cursed his fellow gods for not including him in their pact and vowed to
        make them regret such disrespect. From the halls of the Elves' fair
        city, Takish-Hiz, the Prince of Hate snatched away the first Elven King
        and Queen. In his realm of pain and anger he slowly tore them apart,
        physically and mentally, over the course of three hundred years. He then
        gathered the quivering remnants of these beings of light and rebuilt
        them into his own dark sadistic image, a twisted mockery of <a href="tunare.htm"> Tunare's</a>
        noble children. In depositing the Teir'Dal, as Innoruuk's Dark Elven
        creations would come to be called, back into the Underfoot of Norrath,
        the seeds for The Prince of Hate's final revenge were sown.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="brist.htm">Fizzlethorpe
        Bristlebane</a> and <a href="cazic.htm">Cazic-Thule</a> came next to
        Norrath, and <a href="brell.htm"> Brell</a> met them,
        concocting a second pact with these latter gods, wishing another excuse
        to create more peoples into the world. Rallos Zek again watched from
        afar, determined to add to his creation as well, and this time Brell
        convinced the Warlord to join the pact, assuring him that it was indeed
        an appropriate time to fulfill his desires. Deep in the earth did Brell
        return to create the <a href="gnomes.htm">gnomes</a>, resembling <a href="dwarv.htm"> dwarves</a> to some extent, yet more
        wiry and gnarled, consumed with tinkering with devices more so than
        their cousins. On the surface, away </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">from Elves and Giants, Bristlebane
        made the Halflings, short and stubby folk, agile and with a propensity
        to meddle and even pilfer at times. Cazic-Thule, Lord of Fear, was drawn
        to the swamps and jungles of Norrath and there created the green skinned
        Trolls and reptilian Lizard Men. And <a href="rallos.htm"> Rallos Zek</a> returned to the surface,
        pleased with his sanction to create even more peoples for his army. He
        made then the Ogres, massive, unmovable beings of questionable
        intelligence, and the <a href="orcs.htm">Orcs</a>, bred for battle and singled-minded in their
        desire for conquest.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By this time,
        those who are now known as the elder races of Norrath had begun to
        expand and mature. Villages became cities, and cities became kingdoms.
        Several of the races became bent on expansion and warfare became part of
        their developing cultures. And of all the races, it was the Ogres who
        quickly proved the most interested in battle and plunder, </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and their
        empire grew outward from their mountain home until it eventually
        encompassed a large portion of Tunaria, largest of the known continents.
        Their knowledge of magic grew as did their greed, until they became
        weary of only Norrath, and when they learned of other planes and
        dimensions, invaded the Plane of Earth itself. Rallos Zek watched with
        pride as his creations challenged the gods of that realm, and when they
        eventually knew defeat, the Warlord himself led a second invasion. The
        war that ensued shook the heavens and angered the greater gods. Through
        their combined might, Rallos Zek was finally thwarted and forced back to
        his domain, after which a great barrier to the Planes of Power was
        erected, denying entry to both the lesser gods and mortals as well. And
        then, in what some view as spite and others justice, the gods cursed the
        Warlord's creations. Thousands of Ogres were slain and their empire
        collapsed around them. The Giants were spread from one end of the earth
        to the other, forced to flee their homes as the gods brought snow and
        ice to their previously lush lands. And the goblins were also cursed,
        but </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">no writings remain of their punishment as they no longer keep
        records of their history (which is perhaps some indication as to the
        severity of their curse). Thus began the <a href="monument.htm"> Age of Monuments.</a></font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Innoruuk, The Prince of Hate, cursed his fellow gods for not including
him in their pact and vowed they would regret such disrespect. He
took the first Elven King and Queen and slowly tore them apart,
physically and mentally, over the course of three hundred years. He
then rebuilt them into his own dark sadistic image. These Dark Elven
creatures came to be known as the Teir’Dal.

Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane and Cazic-Thule came next to Norrath. Brell
Serilis entered into a second pact with these gods, along with Rallos Zek.
From this pact, Brell added the Gnomes — cousins to Dwarves, yet
more wiry, gnarled and consumed by tinkering with devices. Rallos
Zek made the Ogres — massive, implacable beings of questionable
intelligence — and the Orcs, bred for battle and singled-minded in
their desire for conquest.
On the surface, away from Elves and Giants, Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane
fashioned the Halflings, a short and stubby folk, who were
nonetheless agile and had a distinct propensity to meddle (or even
pilfer) at times.
Cazic-Thule, Lord of Fear, was drawn to the swamps and jungles of
Norrath and there created the green-skinned Trolls and the reptilian
Iksar of Kunark.&nbsp;

</font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">
Only the Ogres of Rallos Zek dared invade the Plane of Earth itself.
Through a combined offensive effort, the other gods finally defeated
and imprisoned Rallos Zek in his own domain, the Planes of Power.
Thousands of Ogres were slain and their empire collapsed around
them. The Giants were forced to flee their homes as the gods brought
snow and ice to their previously lush lands. Rallos Zek’s third race, the
Goblins, were also cursed, although no writings remain of their trials.

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>End of Elven Prosperity</b>
</font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The Elddar Forest, the Elven realm of old, spread across the entire
southeastern quarter of Tunaria. Tree communities as well as cities of
marble and gleaming snow-white spires rose out of the forest, higher
than the tallest trees. This prosperity drew the jealousy of Solusek Ro,
Lord of Flame. The rivers ran dry, and less rain fell. The great Elven
druids fought long and hard with their powerful magic, attempting to
turn back the change, but they could only delay the inevitable. Slowly
the forest gave way to desert, until at last even the fair Elven city
Takish-Hiz crumbled, and the elves were forced to flee Tunaria, leaving
much of their greatness behind.
