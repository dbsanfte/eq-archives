			<FONT FACE="Arial">Okay, the Guide/GM system works a little like D&amp;D monks. First, IF you have worked up two
			characters to 10th level you can become a </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Candidate</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">
			by e-mailing </FONT><A HREF="mailto:eqseniors@989studios.com"><FONT FACE="Arial">eqseniors@989studios.com</FONT></A><FONT
			FACE="Arial"> with your name, account, and character information and filling out the application you get back.
			You then go on the list and if you're lucky will be chosen to be an </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Apprentice Guide</FONT></I><FONT
			FACE="Arial"> and be chaperoned by a Senior Guide. When the Elder Guides on the server and at least one GM-Admin
			decide you are ready, you become a </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Guide</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> and are expected
			to contribute at least 10 hrs/week doing Guide Stuff. If you prove yourself and work extra hours as a Guide, you
			might be asked by the Elder Guides (takes ALL of them and at least one GM-Admin) to become a </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Senior
			Guide</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> for your server and help manage the guide program on the server, do detective
			work for the Elders, and coordinate guide activity. Finally, if you are an extra-good Senior Guide someday you
			might become an </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Elder Guide</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">, the interface between Verant
			and the guide program, and coordinate activities across all servers (and get to boss the Senior Guides around).<BR>
			<BR>
			What do we learn from this? First of all, when you see an Apprentice Guide around you are seeing their character
			as they were before they got Guided, except they are buffed to 20th if below 20th level. They don't have hardly
			any powers except being non-aggro to everything and being able to make Gate potions to unstick the stuck (and presumably
			they should only be doing this while chaperoned). Second, there is supposed to be 1 Guide for every 100 player
			accounts (not characters) active on a server, 1 Senior Guide for every Guide, and it is assumed just a handful
			of Elder Guides (as otherwise getting ALL approvals each time for guide promotion would be a nightmare) across
			all servers. If Guides play as often as players, we should expect to see 15 Guides and 1 Senior Guide online when
			there are 1500 people on a server, as well as at least a couple apprentice guides. <BR>
			<BR>
			</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Guide Powers<BR>
			<BR>
			</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">Apprentice Guides and Above have the following powers:<BR>
			- Get a cool Guide robe <BR>
			- Buffed to 20th level if below 20th<BR>
			- Made non-aggro to all mobs in the game<BR>
			- Harvest Stone (makes food) and Spring Urn (makes water)<BR>
			- Staff of Guidance (creates potion of Gate)<BR>
			- Use of Petition Tool to review and escalate petitions<BR>
			That's it! Additionally, Apprentice Guides are not allowed to go places they shouldn't be able to survive in without
			their non-aggro status, like Lower Guk or the actual castle in Mistmoore. They do not handle calls other than informational
			or &quot;stuck&quot; calls, they will merely upgrade the call in the petition queue and tell you a higher level
			monk (I mean guide) will help you. They will not monitor or discuss exploitation or abuse calls. They aren't supposed
			to be online unless a full Guide is also online and not anonymous. <BR>
			<BR>
			Guides and Above have the following powers:<BR>
			- Get to buy cool Verdant armor or Robes<BR>
			- Buffed to 50th level if below 50th<BR>
			- Air Bead (levitate)<BR>
			- Binding Stone (casts Bind Affinity)<BR>
			- Cloak of Vashaar (resurrect target)<BR>
			- Earring of Z (breath underwater, fatigue/hp regen, +20 STR)<BR>
			- Eyepatch of Lio (See Invisible and Ultravision)<BR>
			- Girdle of Journey (super-SoW)<BR>
			- Glamour Stone (increases faction with target NPC)<BR>
			- Ring of Dispelling (cancel magic, cure poison, cure disease)<BR>
			- Ring of Invulnerability (1 minute divine aura)<BR>
			- Sunset Stone (teleport to Guide Room in Plane of Air (airplane))<BR>
			- Wand of Memory (clears mob of stuff it is mad at)<BR>
			- /find command (locate a player, corpse, or NPC in any zone)<BR>
			- /goto command (teleport to the target or to a named player or NPC)<BR>
			- /hideme command (super-inviso)<BR>
			- /kill command (kills target NPC with no corpse)<BR>
			- /private command (speak on private channel with other Guides&amp;Up)<BR>
			- /servers command (shows what zones are available)<BR>
			- /summon command (teleports player or corpse to you)<BR>
			- /zone command (teleport to 0,0,0 location in any zone)<BR>
			It should be noted all that cool gear is No Rent so it vanishes if dropped and you cannot sell or transfer it,
			and also Radioactive so if anyone but a Guide/GM touches it they are immediately killed. All gear is purchased
			from NPCs in the Guide Room in the Plane of Air (this and the Sunset Stone are why you see folks in zone &quot;airplane&quot;).
			Guides can recover corpses, handle escalated calls or escalate calls further, and answer questions. They can gather
			information about abuse or exploitation or other complicated matters but do not act or reprimand. Guides are also
			not allowed to talk about the guide program or speak for the program in any public forum. <BR>
			<BR>
			Senior Guides and above have the following extra commands:<BR>
			- /becomenpc (changes appearance of target PC or NPC and makes them an NPC)<BR>
			- /broadcast (message to all players on the server)<BR>
			- /height (changes height of target)<BR>
			- /kick (instantly camps player)<BR>
			- /name (changes named player to another name)<BR>
			The becomepc command is interesting because it makes the target full PvP with no restrictions (i.e. anyone can
			attack and they can attack anyone). None of these commands are supposed to be done without the player's permission
			(they are not retribution commands) and most are supposed to be done safely out of sight. Note that Senior Guides
			only have a few extra powers mainly designed to help them set up quests. <BR>
			<BR>
			GM-Admins and above (i.e. non-coders/testers) get these toys:<BR>
			- /buff (change the level of a PC)<BR>
			- /kill (mark II upgrade, can kill players with this one!)<BR>
			- /lastname (grants a surname)<BR>
			- /create (creates any item in the game)<BR>
			- /coord (teleports you to the given x,y,z coordinates)<BR>
			On GMs: A GM-Coder, GM-Art, GM-Tester, or GM-Area does not answer and calls, should not use powers or interact
			with players, and is supposed to be anonymous at all times. GM-Admin is the &quot;real&quot; GM and answers petitions
			and supports Guides. These GMs also handle the chat, phone, and e-mail support. GM-Lead Admin is a manager of GMs,
			and GM-Mgmt is the baddest-ass GM around and the final word on everything. It is also interesting that within the
			internal documentation the GM consistently and the Guide in some instances are referred to as the &quot;CS Rep&quot;,
			or Customer Service Representative. <BR>
			<BR>
			What do we learn from this? Well, don't bother asking an apprentice guide to do anything more than give you some
			food and water so you don't starve to death while waiting for a REAL guide. And even then they'd have to WALK to
			you. And don't expect an experience res from a GM or Guide unless they were originally a cleric and they're feeling
			nice. A Guide can do anything for you except return your lost level and items, but on the flip side even if you
			REALLY piss them off they can't kill you and they aren't even supposed to /kick you. If you legitimately lost items,
			a GM can create any item in the game for you. <BR>
			<BR>
			Also, Apprentice Guides are not supposed to be using their powers to find out where the Froglok Ghoul Sage spawns
			so if you see a 20th level apprentice running around Lower Guk petition your </FONT><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial">ass</FONT><FONT
			FACE="Arial"> off. Guides are not supposed to reprimand players, take sides in an argument (although they can pass
			on a recommendation to the Senior Guides), or take action against abuse or exploitation, so if one starts bossing
			you around you can tell them they better leave that kind of activity to their &quot;betters&quot;. Finally, Guides
			and GMs are only supposed to use their powers to aid players in trouble so if you see anything otherwise let ol'
			John Smedley (</FONT><A HREF="mailto:(jsmedley@verant.com"><FONT FACE="Arial">jsmedley@verant.com</FONT></A><FONT
			FACE="Arial">) know, or alternatively the Gm-Lead Admin(</FONT><A HREF="mailto:jbutler@verant.com"><FONT FACE="Arial">jbutler@verant.com</FONT></A><FONT
			FACE="Arial">). <BR>
			<BR>
			My opinion after reading all this is that your best bet when in need is to state clearly and succinctly on your
			petition what your problem is and what you want the guide to do. If the person that responds says they can do nothing
			or to e-mail someone, you should ask that it be escalated instead.</FONT></TD>
