was hard but Hager was an understanding and wise guildmaster. "Learn to
balance the strength of your sword with the might of your mind", he was
fond of saying. "Reflect on the vast wisdom of Karana the Rainkeeper. Summer
comes and dust blows, but rain washes all things clean. Spring brings the
promise of new life, yet in the Fall it is harvested. The cycle of nature
is complete and the balance of nature remains." Like most Rangers, Hager
was a practical man, yet prone to philosophical moments that were inspired
by many nights spent in the open plains of Karana. It felt good to be in
the company of other Humans. The Elves of Faydwer were family, but there
was a reassuring feeling that being with his own kind brought.The early
training consisted mostly of keeping Surefall and the Qeynos Hills free
of the Blackburrow threat. There was also the occasional poacher who needed
to be brought in for justice, and even the infamous Talym Shoontar eventually
fell in between the sights of Delphis' Ashenwood bow. The occasional trip
to Qeynos always provided an opportunity to ask the local folks about his
parents. Sadly, there was no news to be had there either. Of all places,
he hoped that Qeynos would provide the most clues.&nbsp;
<p>During these years, the days were filled with free ranging, forging
of strong friendships, and honing of fletching and bowyery skills. Hager
was an exclellent mentor and it wasn't too long before Delphis attained
mastery of all Ranger skills. The friends, and the adventures they shared
were many, but one fellow in particular proved to be a faithful friend.
Nisstyre was a brother Ranger but of wood elven descent. When he had made
his way over from Faydwer, Splitpaw was his goal. Having some experience
in that foul dog pit, Delphis offered his services as a guide. It wasn't
long before all of Paw tucked their tails between their legs when these
two (and usually other friends like Jannelle, Dedolito, Zarius, Bemidbar,
and Jingoro) entered the den. Nisstyre was a Ranger of the woods while
Delphis a Ranger of the plains. But in time the friendship grew and neither
plain nor wood nor snow now lava felt the footfalls of one without the
other. Crazy Ranger was the term most people used to describe Nisstyre,
but combined with the even tempered and contemplative Delphis, they made
a formidable team.&nbsp;
<p>Being with Niss reminded Delphis of his little wood elf brother Swyft
(he called him his brother since they were both raised by the Heartwoods).
Besides his wolf pack on Faydwer, perhaps what he missed most was Swyft.
The young Druid showed great promise and always carried his share of the
burden when they used to scout out around Faydark. Maybe it was the longing
to see his family again, or the call of his wild wolven pack, but he knew
he should make a visit to Kelethin after so many years. In Antonica Delphis
had traveled from Halas to Feerrott, Erudin to Freeport, and still found
no sign of his parents. But only recently had he come into full mastery
of his Ranger skills so the time to begin the search in earnest was here.
Fully trained, well equipped with weapons, armor, and much Druidic magic,
Delphis would return to his home at Heartwood's for a quick visit, and
then head out in search of his heritage. Somewhere out there are the clues
that will lead to answering the questions that have haunted him for so
many years. Somewhere out there is where he would go.
