</FONT></FONT>he Ocean of Tears lives up to it's name. Many have wept over
the loss of life when tempests rage and overpower the ships that travel
from Antonica to Faydwer. Delphis stood high upon Foulweather Point looking
West as the sea stretched out before him. Calm and peaceful it was on this
day, gentle waves lapping on the sandy shoreline. But his memories would
not be so easily lulled away. He came up here as often as posible remembering
that fateful voyage of his youth.&nbsp;

<P><I>The waves were crashing over the deck as the ship plunged deep into
each monstrous trough. Wind was howling through the tattered sails shrieking
it's fury. Rain slanted sideways stinging the face limiting any visibility
in the midnight sky. Captain and crew frantically tried to regain control
of the ship. Below decks seeking refuge, young Delphis found an old half
empty steamer trunk and crawled in. It was the only place dry on the boat,
and with the lid shut might stay that way. It was only a matter of time
before this brutal sea claimed another victim.</I>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>How many years ago was it that Heartwood found him on this beach? Scattered
amongst the jetsom and flotsom of the wreckage, the wooden trunk managed
to wash up above the tideline. Delphis was maybe five years old, and seemingly
the only survivor of a terrible catastrophe. Were it not for the Kelethin
Ranger's routine patrols in this area, a tasty snack for the local Orcs
he would've made. Not sure what else to do with the boy (few humans were
on the entire continent of Faydwer much less Kelethin), He decided to bring
him up as an apprentice in the Rangers guild.&nbsp;

<P>It didn’t take long for for Delphis to realize he was very different
from the Elvenkind. By the time he reached 13, it was clear that because
of his Human blood, Delphis would never match the fluid beauty and grace
of his Woodland brothers. From foraging, to hiding, to running, he struggled
to keep up with the other Ranger apprentices. His only sense of equality
came during armed melee combat training where he could hold his own with
the nimble Elves.&nbsp;

<P>Yet he trained vigilantly to be the best Ranger as humanly possible.
For he knew that only as a Ranger could he track down the answers that
he desperately needed. Could his parents still be alive somewhere? Although
that ill-fated voyage was a vague memory, he didn’t think his parents were
actually onboard when the ship went down. If his parents weren’t on that
ship, why was he? Where was he headed? For what purpose? And why at such
a young age? The only memories he had of his parents were when they gave
him the small amulet that he wears around his neck. Of his father there
was the towering presence and black boots. His mother, colorful dresses
and the smell of flowers.&nbsp;

<P>Looking down to the wolf by his side, he thought back on the day they
met.&nbsp;

<P><I>It was his first solo Ranger trek.What fun he was having tracking
the little Fairies of Greater Faydark and watching them flit about! Perhaps
he had wandered a bit too far from Kelethin when he came upon a young wolf
with one leg caught in the jaws of a steel trap. As the Druids had taught
him, he lulled the wolf and pried open the Orc made trap. But just as it
sprung free, a fierce blow landed on the right side of his head. Dazed,
searing pain in his right eye, he was barely able to roll over on the ground.
What he looked up to see, dimly out of his left eye, was a ShadowClan Orc
Centurian towering over him ready to strike the killing blow. As the Orc
bellowed its triumphant rage, the wolf returned from the mist snarling
and gnashing, attacking the Elven foe. This gave Delphis enough time to
recover his senses quickly, pull out his large hunting knife and stick
it deeply into the Orc’s back, killing it instantly. The young wolf suffered
an injured leg from the steel teeth of the trap – that healed fast. But
the blow to Delphis’ head crushed the ridge bones of his right eye and
he lost the use of it.&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<P>He reached up and adjusted the Orchide eypatch that covered the scar.<I>
Loss of an eye, yes...but the gain of enduring friendship. </I>Since that
day, whenever he ventured away from the towns, this wolf, or one from the
pack was nearby. Where he needed help or guidance because of the loss of
his eye, his wolven brothers were always there. It had gone beyond repayment
of a debt. He felt the bond that had developed over time between him and
all wolves, and because of this association and the color of his hair,
the people of Kelethin often called him Goldenwolf. It was a sad feeling
leaving the pack here on Faydwer, but the wolves of Antonica would respond
to the fellowship.&nbsp;

      <P>Tomorrow he would go down to the docks of Kaladim. It was time to journey 
        on to Antonica where Hager Sureshot of Surefall Glade would oversee the 
        remainder of his training. While the prospect of making this voyage made 
        him uneasy, it would bring him to the land of his kin, and closer to the 
        answers he searched for. They certainly weren't on Faydwer, he knew that 
        much by now. This land of Elves, Dwarves, and Gnomes may be his home, 
        but Antonica is where he belonged.&nbsp;
