  <p><font color="#CC9900">Growing up in Kelethin is one of the greatest blessings 
    that Karana can giveh. Each blade of grass, each drop of rain, every precious 
    moment is filled with the magic and mystery that the good gods of Karana bring 
    to Norrath. For me, the early years I spent in Greater Faydark were filled 
    with wonder and adventure. Kelethin, the city of trees, is the home of my 
    wood elven kin. Like mybrother Delphis, I was brought up in the Heartwood 
    family. My parents are Druids of the woods and constantly traveling to far 
    off places. Being a freind of the family, Heartwood agreed to watch after 
    and help raise me while my parents were away, which ended up being most of 
    the time. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#CC9900">Growing up in a family without my parents did not seem 
    trange. Most elvenkind (of the woods) were a close family who worked together 
    in a tightly knit community. What was odd, however, was the way Heartwood 
    was bringing up my brother Delphis (I call him my brother since we grew up 
    in the same family, but who his real parents are is a mystery). There were 
    few Humans on all of Faydwer, not to mention in the wood elf city. The circumstances 
    of this human boy being here were very unusual and some in Kelethin were a 
    bit uncomfortable about it. But to me, Delphis was just another part of the 
    family, and a fun big brother to have. Many adverntures did we have during 
    our years together in Faydwer. The bond with the wolves that Delphis had was 
    something I could understand, if only partially. As a Druid, I had a strong 
    bond with wolves himself. Indeed, one of the most popular spells a Druid has 
    is to impart a wolven blessing on his companions. But Humans grow up faster 
    than wood elves, and it came to pass that Delphis left his home in Kelethin 
    in search of his family.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#CC9900">Back at home it was becoming increasingly more clear 
    what was expected of me. The Crushbone orcs were a constant menace, the brownie 
    scouts made frequent raids, and the undead refused to stay in their earthly 
    graves. The call to battle these evil forces was a loud one that I heard clearly. 
    The way of the Druid seemed a natural one. Following the footsteps of my parents, 
    and growing up in the Heartwood household, this choice was easy. It was a 
    very fun path to follow too. The channeling of natural forces and using them 
    to aid others was one of my favorit things to do, second only to blasting 
    the enemies of Faydark with balls of flame. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#CC9900">But even with the hoardes of orcs, undead, and goblins, 
    it seemed as though Greater Faydark was safe from immediate threat. Clan Crushbone 
    had been conquered long ago and only served as training grounds for young 
    wood elves and high elves anymore. The unholy estate of Unrest was filled 
    with treasure seekers as well. The ghost of Unrest and the hags that guarded 
    it were a very rare sight these days. Butcherblock was in full control of 
    the stout Dwarves, and nobody really knows what happens in and around Ak'anon. 
    So, when Delphis returned to Kelethin one day and spoke of the many adventures 
    he'd had in Antonica, I asked to go back with him to Antonica.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#CC9900">&quot;A large and dangerous place is the continent 
    of Antonica.&quot; Delphis told me.&quot;You will need to use all of your 
    Druidic ways to survive there, and it will be important for you to make good 
    friends there as soon as possible. Once we get there my jouneys take me South 
    to the evil lizard stronghold of Cazic-Thule, and that is a journey you cannot 
    survive. I will leave you in the hands of my friends in Misty Thicket, the 
    Halflings. Don't let their size fool you for they are the stoutest of heart 
    and fierce warriors of the Wall.&quot; With that it was decided. Heartwood 
    knew that I was ready to go forth and discover the deeper ways of Karana on 
    my own. Before we left Faydark though, Delphis did a great deed and quested 
    for the magical brass shield in Crushbone. Equipped with this mighty shield 
    and my spell book I headed off to Antonica with my brother.</font></p>
