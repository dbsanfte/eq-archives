Folks, <BR>
<BR>
Here’s
the latest news from Mythic. As you have already discovered, we’ve had a few things
up our collective sleeves the last few weeks. As I’ve hinted at before, this
was not the first time nor will it be the last time that we do something like
this. We have lots of other surprises coming the road in the next few months
(though by then very few will be surprises) but we hope you like them. So, let’s
get this update started off on the right hoof. <BR>
<BR>
As you have seen,
we have added the first stage of new transportation methods to our game. As we’ve
said before, we value the feedback we get from our players. While we may not
always agree with you (nor you with us) your feedback/comments/suggestions and
occasionally rotten fruit (please make it fresh, even game developers have to
eat) are important to us. Over the last couple of months it had become quite clear
that players wanted horses in the game as quickly as possible. While we had
always planned on having them in by the end of the year, your comments helped
persuade us that we should put them in sooner rather than later. Thus, we have
added horses. For now our implementation will allow them to be used as means of
transportation between set points in the game. This should go a long way to cutting
down some of the travel time issues that people have raised without unbalancing
the game especially the RvR portion of it. Over the next quarter we will
be expanding the system to incorporate it as an item that a player can earn in
the game. In the meantime, we will be able to test and hone the various systems
involved while implementing a simple means of point-to-point transportation.
<BR>
<BR>
The next issue I want to address is the Role-playing server as well
as potential other servers that we will be releasing over the next few months.
We have completed a small set of additional rules that will govern this server
and these rules will be presented to the community later today. We have been
asked what we will do if the one RP server is quickly filled. Well, the answer
is simply that we will add another one. In terms of other server types, we will
be continuing to add them until we run out of ideas for ones that are fun and
commercially practical. I am a long-time believer in customized servers/campaigns
dating back to the first game I ever created and I believe that there is an
even bigger demand for them than ever before. Mythic will continue to talk to and
work with the community to make DAoC the premier MMORG in the industry and this
aspect is only part of the way to accomplish that goal. <BR>
<BR>
My third
and final point today is regarding the release date of DAoC. We have it confirmed
from our partners at Vivendi Universal that our game will indeed ship on October
9th, 2001. We are sorry for the confusion that occurred over the last week
but nothing has changed and we are right on schedule. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We are
now coming down the homestretch, though now it is on horseback. <BR>
