<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

<p><font color="#0080FF">Those inside the Storm's Retreat turned and looked in
bewilderment as the light around the stout doors gradually grew brighter and brighter.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF">Swinging wide the doors and flooding the entire tavern with a
shimmering coalescence of bluish-white light, Delphic serenely entered. Standing just a
few steps past the doorway he looked around from face to face recognizing those he once
called friends. Would they recognize him and remember all the wonderful times shared
adventuring?</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF">The enchantment of light faded as Delphic happily saw the face of
Kaasa and walked over to the bar to greet her. &quot;Kaasa, what you have given to the
community of Norrath is a wonderful thing. No longer are we plagued by the incompetence of
gods who know not what they do and inflict great harm upon their subjects. Truly, it is
through your perseverance and hard work that I am able to reacquaint myself with so many
good people, and to share my tale of sorrow and rebirth.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF">Kaasa filled a crystal goblet with fine Elven Wine and smiled as
she handed it to Delphic. Sipping it slowly, he shared his story with all that would
listen&#133;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF">&quot;Much faith did I have in Karana to guide me in all things,
great and small. My typical day would be to rise up with the sun, swim in the great river
of the Plains, hunt and track all day long, pass the evenings mastering the serene art of
fletching around a cozy campfire, and eventually retiring under the awesome bows of great
Treants. It was during one of these evenings of fletching and bowcrafting that I struck
upon the notion that in order to complete my mastery of the art, I must craft the
Enchanted Bow, Raincaller. Clearly, such a task would be demanding but I had no idea what
was in store for me. </font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF">&quot;The most logical choice for me to start my search was in
Felwithe, at the Enchanter's hall. After braving the perilous boat ride through the Ocean
of Tears yet again, I made my way to Kinool Goldsinger and pleaded my case. 'Master
Kinool, I am a Ranger of Karana and seek the greatest prize, the Enchanted Bow of Rain', I
stated. 'Is it within your powers to call upon great enchantments and transform my
Trueshot Longbow into this greatest of bows?&#146;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF">&quot;Kinool looked at me long and hard with a gaze that made me
wonder if he was reading my mind. Without a word to me, he began reciting the incantations
and mystical ritual movements for the spell of Enchantment. I thought I saw a flicker of
mischief in his eyes as the powerful magic swirled and weaved around the hall filling it
with many shimmering colors. I stood there completely mesmerised as the colors shifted and
fluxed around me. Although I could feel the magic starting to weave itself into my being,
there wasn't anything I could do to stop it, and even if I could stop this, I'm not sure I
wanted to.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF">&quot;You see, in my days of being a Ranger of Karana a certain
emptiness had grown within my soul and was threatening to consume me. I hadn&#146;t
recognized how powerful this feeling had become since it had grown so gradually over the
last 15 of my 35 years. I now believe that Kinool recognized this void in my soul and in
his own way tried to make me complete. </font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF">&quot;With the most powerful of magic surrounding me, enthralling
me, charming me, animating me, soothing me, radiating me, skewing me, adorning me, and
permeating my soul, I was transformed from a Ranger of Karana to a creature of
Enchantment. Kinool smiled serenely as he looked at me and said, &#145;Delphic is your
name. No longer will any such emptiness fill your soul.&#146;&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF">Delphic gazed absently at his now empty goblet for a moment.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0080FF">&quot;There is much more to tell you of my recent adventures. And
I also must warn you about the one&quot; *cough* &quot;small&quot; *cough* &quot;problem
that Kinool did not foresee with my transformation, in all his mastery of magic. But for
now freshen this goblet of wine will you please? The telling of such tales is thirsty
work!&quot;</font></font></p>
