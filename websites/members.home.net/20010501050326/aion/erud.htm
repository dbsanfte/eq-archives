        Erudites, Necromancy, and the rise and fall of Miragul</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        <font size="1">as told by Aradune Mithara, sometimes historian, more
        often Ranger Lord, Outrider of Karana</font></font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over three
        thousand years in the past humanity was in its infancy. Mankind dwelled
        in the center of Antonica, spreading out slowly to inhabit the vast and
        fertile plains of Karana. Villages appeared and prospered, several
        reaching the size of towns, and two even became cities -- Qeynos to the
        west, and Freeport to the east. Humanity, much to the disdain of the
        elder races who watched from afar, was strong -- it rapidly gained a
        solid foothold in the world of Norrath and was there to stay.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is not to
        imply, however, that humanity was at peace. Early on small groups
        formed, some linked by similar appearances, others by common goals.
        Competition was fierce, and when resources grew scarce for one reason or
        another many groups abandoned the promises and alliances of their past
        and fought. A few leaders spoke out against the violence, urging the
        masses to remember why they had fled the cold north. They had broken
        away from the lands of Halas and their barbarian brothers in the name of
        peace, and these leaders insisted that humanity adhere once again to
        those principals to which all had agreed.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Their cry was not
        totally ignored, and the fighting subsided. Villages were encouraged to
        trade with one another and to respond to competition nonviolently. An
        economy based largely on agriculture appeared and the villages and small
        towns were surrounded by large farms. Most of humanity&#146;s leaders were
        pleased with this, wanting nothing more than peace and food on every
        man&#146;s table after a hard day of work. A few, however, wanted more.
        Even though their people had risen well beyond the standard of living
        endured by their barbarian brothers to the north, they were not content.
        Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales of elves,
        dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient
        abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery
        and the mystic arts. And when that discontent minority of leaders heard
        all of this, they became both jealous and determined.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A small, fragile
        man of great intellect called Erud led this group, and he formed them
        into a council. They quickly became irritated, even disgusted, by their
        fellow man. Leaving a small network of spies behind, the remainder of
        Erud&#146;s followers fled the city of Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of
        ships. They sailed to the west and landed upon the barren coast of the
        island of Odus. The land was sparse and uninhabited and quite appealing
        to the council and their people. They quickly built a city of their own,
        dissimilar in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, for it was
        almost entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within it
        the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered and
        analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts
        brought to them by their spies. The first human mages were then born &#150;
        wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters occupied the great halls of Erudin
        and grew immensely in both power and knowledge.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the more
        adept practitioners of the arts was named Miragul. Unlike and more
        extreme than the others, he not only abhorred his human brothers on the
        mainland to the east, but he also grew to hate his fellow Erudites. To
        him they were both short sighted and narrow. They created schools of
        thought, categorizing magic into three groups and assigning themselves
        to three classes: Wizards, Sorcerers, and Enchanters. Miragul found this
        limiting and thoroughly resented the thought of being restricted to one
        school of thought or another.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He soon found
        others who felt similarly. They were a small but growing group of
        outcasts who often studied forbidden texts and other knowledge generally
        kept secret from the majority of students. The council was morally and
        ethically opposed to much of the information gathered afar by their
        spies. Miragul found that these outcasts not only studied the three
        schools of magic, but also a fourth. It was called Necromancy and a few
        lucky spies had returned from a distant underground city (Neriak, it was
        called, home of the dark elves) with both their lives and also ancient
        texts describing this art. Miragul was intrigued, and, by using powerful
        magic, created for himself four identities, four separate countenances
        and names, and joined all four schools without the knowledge of the
        council, nor anyone else for that matter.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It came to pass
        some years later that the council, in its ever growing desire to know
        all there was to know, both in distant lands and also in its own city,
        discovered the group of Necromancers. They were branded heretics and
        great conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred years, the
        Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to
        that which they had loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But
        there was one very significant difference &#150; they did not use swords
        and bows, but rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the
        hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and
        eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup
        in the southern regions of Odus.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Miragul, being a
        member of all four schools, was not blind to the implications when the
        conflict began. He left the heretics before they fled the city,
        abandoning his fourth identity and siding apparently with the council.
        But this was only a ruse in order to buy time. He soon gathered every
        artifact and tome he could discreetly steal and then left Odus entirely,
        taking a ship back to Antonica and to the city of Qeynos. The lands of
        men, however, were not only to his dislike, but also filled with Erudite
        spies. Miragul grew afraid, even paranoid, and soon fled again. He
        headed far to the north and then to the east, wishing to avoid the
        barbarians of Halas. After many weeks he found himself near the great
        lake called Winter&#146;s Deep and he hid there for some time.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Miragul
        waited in secret his mind was not idle. He schemed and planned, and
        looked over every letter of every scroll and tome he had taken from
        Erudin. Time passed and his understanding and power grew. But he was
        unsatisfied and a deep hunger for even more arcane knowledge ate away at
        him. He soon left his hiding place and began to travel long distances in
        search of more ancient texts and artifacts. His power had grown and
        confidence overcame his fear of Erudite spies. Once again he cloaked
        himself in false identity and countenance and traveled the lands of men.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not far to the
        south of where his cache of artifacts lay, Miragul soon found another of
        the new races, the Halflings, and their town Rivervale. The mage feared
        these small people and their propensity to sneak and to steal, and as
        his treasures grew in both size and value, he eventually made the
        decision to move even farther north, and away from all intelligent life.
        He traveled leagues and leagues, far beyond the range of both Erudite
        spy and curious Halfling, and eventually came to a vast tundra. This
        land had no name, and was not until centuries later referred to as
        merely the Frigid Plain. This frosty and remote environment appealed to
        Miragul&#146;s heart, for it had grown cold, obsessed with only knowledge
        and the abstract, and filled with only hatred for others. Creatures with
        intelligence forced him to be discreet and slowed his acquisition of
        knowledge and items. He had as little to do with them as he could, only
        hiding amongst them when absolutely necessary.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the icy
        ground of the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a large network of tunnels
        and rooms in which to hide and study his collection. He used no labor,
        but rather deep magic to remove the earth from his way. Room after room,
        passage after passage, he did create to house his store of artifacts. He
        split his years, spending one score out in the world, exploring and
        amassing knowledge and items, returning them to his cache, and then the
        next dabbling with them, experimenting in one of several laboratories he
        had created.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many years passed,
        even centuries. Miragul grew old, even though he did his best to extend
        his life using magical means. There was a limit to his enlightenment
        when it came to aging, and he soon acknowledged that one day even he
        would die. Only one aspect of death did he fear, and being no longer
        able to learn and collect wrought him with terror. As his skin grew
        wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul&#146;s time was spent less
        exploring the world of Norrath and more studying the existential. He
        soon discovered the various hidden dimensions that neighbored his own,
        the Planes of Power and Discord. He discovered means by which he could
        traverse these planes, making portals that led between them. But his
        strength was leaving him, and his journeys into these realities were
        short and often unprofitable. More and more, his own mortality limited
        his reason for living, and the specter of death haunted him daily.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mage&#146;s
        research into life and death was built upon a foundation he had learned
        from his fellow outcasts centuries before in Erudin. Necromancy, more
        than any other art, became Miragul&#146;s obsession. Eventually he
        discovered a means by which to create portals within his own plane and
        made them to travel great distances in mere seconds. He traveled back to
        Odus, to its southern regions, in search of the other Necromancers.
        Perhaps, he mused, they had unearthed by now a way to cheat death.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mage soon
        found that the heretics of Erudin had built a city into a great hole
        that led to unknown depths beneath the earth. This chasm was apparently
        the result of that huge civil war from which Miragul had fled centuries
        earlier. The city, called Paineel, though somewhat suspicious, allowed
        Miragul to enter and after a time he earned its inhabitant&#146;s trust.
        Many humored the old man and his claims, while a select few respected
        him and were willing to trade knowledge for knowledge, power for power.
        They revealed to him the true power of necromancy, the ability to raise
        the dead, creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every way to their
        master. Many of the heretics planned to assault Erudin with vast armies
        of undead, to wreak revenge upon the council that had exiled and made
        war upon them in centuries past.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One important
        aspect of their necromancy interested Miragul, the fact that the undead
        ceased to age. Their lives appeared endless and the elderly mage knew
        that he must discover a way to be like them. He feigned interest in the
        heretic&#146;s goals, learning spells to raise the dead, helping them raise
        their undead army. All the while, however, he was experimenting himself,
        hiding much of his research in the small home he was given in Paineel.
        After some time he discovered that which he had sought, a way to
        transform a living being, as opposed to a corpse, into the undead.
        Unfortunately, time was scarce, for he was tired and almost dead
        himself, his body deteriorating with age, and the heretics were almost
        ready to make war once again.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Miragul then left
        Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling life energies to make a
        portal back to his cache hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival,
        he withdrew silently to his most secret laboratory and prepared his
        final spell. Dreaming all the while of endless exploration and
        discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate experiment. The enchantment
        laced with necromancy was finally made, and Miragul hid his remaining
        and fragile life within the phylactery, a small device he had pilfered
        from the other necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then
        dispersed, revealing a shell of the man Miragul once was, an undead
        mage, what ancient scripts and legends called a lich.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his haste,
        however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich, while retaining
        all the mystical power of his formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the
        mage&#146;s soul, now locked within the phylactery hidden deep in the
        cache, retained the ambition and desire to amass knowledge and power.
        The spiritless lich possessed none of these human traits, and
        Miragul&#146;s soul screamed in silence as the undead creature began to
        aimlessly wander his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms
        filled with artifacts of power.</font></p>
