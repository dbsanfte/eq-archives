        and time an entity known only as the Nameless exists, and that this
        being created all that there is and was and will be. It is also written
        in ancient texts that from His mind sprang not only the universe and its
        countless suns and worlds, but also a myriad of sentient, powerful, yet
        finite creatures whom one such as a man, or elf, or dwarf, would call a
        god.&quot;</i>

Nameless. The universe and its countless suns and worlds sprang
from the will of the Nameless, as well as many powerful
creatures whom one might call gods. Whereas The Nameless
created the stage, these gods gave birth to us, the many actors
upon that stage.&quot;</i>

        <p align="left">That is all that is known of the Nameless. No other record or annul
        speaks of his actions or deeds. We know of the finite existence of our
        many &quot;gods&quot;, and much of their history (yet not all) and try
        to find reasoning behind their actions, but, alas, cannot. All that we
        know is that which The Nameless wants us to know. All that we are is
        what The Nameless wants us to be. Without The Nameless, there would be
        nothing. It was his creations that first planted life upon Norrath, and
        that beget the world, as we know it. The Nameless is the one True God.
        Those that follow are merely minions of his greatness, each representing
        one facet of what The Nameless is.</p>
        <p align="left">This page will contain a work in progress.&nbsp; It will only be
        finished when The Nameless decides so.&nbsp; It is to be the first <i>Testament
        of The Nameless</i>, and included as a supplement to the now in progress
        <i>Complete History of Norrath</i>, which will be included as part of <i>The
        Biblion, The Book of Books.</i></p>

        <p align="left">The &quot;gods&quot; as we have been taught are a to us a focal
        point: something to allow us mortals to feel in touch with the greater
        powers that flow through the ether.&nbsp; But the origin of this power
