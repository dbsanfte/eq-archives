<CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FFCC99">The vines covering this part of the outer
castle wall had a strange look about them. Not the like the green and lively
type of plants that were normal in Qeynos, these were dull and smelled
foul. As I got closer to look at them, I heard the sound of water that
seemed to come from <I>behind</I> the wall. Curious, I unsheathed my hunting
knife and poked into the vines. But my blade went right through the wall!
I had found what appeared to be a a wall, but was actually a facade of
vines and branches used to cleverly conceal an opening. Stepping through,
I entered into a small stone chamber with what looked to be a well in the
middle. Clearly the work of some secretive order of Qeynos, I decided to
cautiously scout it out.</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FFCC99">The water was cold, but I didn't have to
swim far before I found myself in the heart of the Qeynos Aquaduct system.
I had heard rumors about a vast network of tunnels under Qeynos, and this
must be it. But what a maze! Even with my innate abilities of tracking
I quickly found myself lost in the twisting, turning rough cut passageways
and canals. Sensing danger in every direction, I suddenly came upon a noble
Paladin. Having lost all interest in exploring, and seeking only the fresh
air I hailed, "Kirel! Lost in this foul sewer am I. Do you by chance know
the way out?" But before he could reply, my knees buckled and I was overcome
by the Dread Touch of a skeleton. Turning around, I saw before me the wretched
animated bones of some poor lost soul. Both Kirel and I sprang into action
with our two handed swords, but it was obvious this was more than our match.
Thinking that these sewers were the last place I wanted to die, I bolted.
Down a corridor, through a canal, up a passageway, under a bridge... I
ended up totally lost! I had hoped my rapid retreat had outpaced the undead,
but I was wrong. With a quick prayer to Karana, thanking him for this short
gift of life, I took a few weak swings at the abomination and was killed.</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FFCC99">Karana is wise. He knows that his followers
are few but devout. He rewards them with extended life, even after death.</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FFCC99">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FFCC99">Moments later back at Surefall Glade, I called
out to Kirel for help. True to his nobility, he met me at the gates of
Qeynos, led me back down to the sewer and showed me exactly where my corpse
was. The trip back to my corpse didn't take long, for I was slain only
steps away from same drain I had entered in. But I would never have know
it without Kirel's guidance.</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FFCC99">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FFCC99">Thank you, Kirel. May our paths soon cross.
And when they do, I will gladly join you in smiting those Dread Corpses,
returning their wicked bones to the grave.</FONT></CENTER>
