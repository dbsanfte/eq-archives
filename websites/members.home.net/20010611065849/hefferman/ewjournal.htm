<P><FONT SIZE="5"><B>Everway Journal</B></FONT> - By Lightfoot Dancer (Patti Hemeleski)</P>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="2"><B>&nbsp;</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>13 Angel - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Tomorrow, I shall be away on a new adventure. It began this morning at the Library when I received
a message from a &quot;Lady Silverbell&quot;. She asked that I meet with her in the Library of All Worlds in the
afternoon. I've only been in Everway for a few months, but I know that name. They may not be on the Council, but
they do run most of the Entertainers in Everway proper. Wondering if she’d heard me play, I came right on time.
I was disappointed to learn that she was looking for some sphere-walkers not musicians and learned of me through
my hauntings at the library, not my performances.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Lady Silverbell desires a group of spherewalkers to journey to a place called Stonedeep. This
realm is in a sphere achieved directly from Roundwander via a place called Sweetwater, which I'd never heard of
before today. According to Silverbell, Sweetwater was ravaged by a dragon or dragons and became impassable, so
no living soul has seen Stonedeep for 300 years. Sweetwater is supposedly passable now and she did entreat us to
go see what's become of the place. There are Families here who once had kin there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> I see that I am most certainly not going to find my sister in a place that's been isolated for
300 years, but it seems interesting and it promises to pay well. It will pass the time while I wait for a sign
of her. I left messages for Misty with the Hosts and Watchers in the Outsider Quarter in case she arrives here
while I'm gone. I left another with the Outsider bards, and paid my guild dues ahead for the weeks I'll be away.
As I intend to return, it seems best that I leave on good terms with the fledgling house. They don't charge too
much, since their authority is so limited, but they can help a performer in trouble and trouble is easy to find
in Strangerside. Eight week's tribute takes almost half of the advance Silverbell gave us, but I don't think I'll
be needing much for living expenses for the next couple months.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Lady Silverbell had called five sphere-walkers to her meeting, and
three of us accepted the job. I’ll be traveling with a woman called Wanderlust, and a small man called Mach. Silverbell
will be providing an escort up to the gate to Stonedeep, but only the three of us will be continuing beyond that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>21 Angel - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Sweetwater is a dreadful place. Once it was supposed to be heavenly
as the name suggests but now, it's a wasteland. It’s mostly flat and clear and speaks of a former existence as
expansive farmland. Stands of trees and large patches of grasses and wildflowers have been blasted and burned.
The streams are brackish and foul. The mules are carrying a dozen barrels of fresh water. I hope it will be enough.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Silverbell’s guide is a young woman called Hazard. She’s thin, strong
and extremely competent. Hazard has been an escort for the Silverbells for almost ten years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust is a noblewoman from a mountainous realm on some remote sphere. She’s of an age with
me, or perhaps younger, but human. Her cliffside home was recently invaded by brutish creatures lead by an unknown
evil mage. Her people had prided themselves on pacifism, and living in harmony with all creatures. They had no
defenses against this invasion. The realm has suffered greatly, and she’s ridden out on a quest in hopes of learning
more about the origins of these creatures, and the motive and weaknesses of the enemy mage. Her need and her quest
have turned her from her peoples’ ways and made of her a great fighter. Wanderlust can speak to birds, and she
travels with a raptor called Swiftwing. She also has some small talent at magical healing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The man called Mach is barely taller than my waist and he tells
us he’s a gnome. He seems to be about twice my age, but his people are as long-lived as mine and he’s young yet.
He’d been working for a mage, creating machines of war, until he’d discovered that his machines were being used
to invade and oppress innocent realms. He fled the realm, and continues to live in fear that he’ll be discovered
by the mage by whom he was once employed. Wanderlust has questioned him closely, trying to determine if this mage
was the same one who’d sent the monsters against her land, but Mach doesn’t know. Her land was invaded only by
the beasts, not machines of war, so it might not be the same mage, but we think it may be.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I told them a little about my past, about the battle that destroyed
my home when I was a small child, how we found shelter in the wonderful forest home I’d shared with my sister and
mother in a community of others like ourselves, and how my sister and I had become separated from them and later
from each other. I didn’t mention the green-eye mage that’s been haunting my nightmares for as long as I can remember.
With all the talk of evil mages, I wonder if there could be a connection, but something made me keep that to myself.
Afterall, she or he might be just my imagination.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>22 Angel - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The land continues to be barren and scarred. It is perhaps a bit
more rocky but mostly the same - flat, with only a few clusters of trees and gently rolling hills. The charred
land may be good for green growing things again in time. Days are sunny and the travel has been easy on the body,
if not the spirit. The land is so desolate. It had seemed unwise to carry my lute, but now I am thankful for the
distraction of my music.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>23 Angel - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">This morning we awoke to a cool Angel rain. It was rather steady
but was over before noon. We have only cold food for breakfast to save our water, so we didn’t need to worry about
starting a fire in the wet. I did use my sphere of warmth power to dry out the tarps for easier storage and carrying.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The land is becoming more rocky and dark. It’s not as level as it
was and there are more and larger areas blackened by fire or torn apart, presumably by this legendary dragon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>24 Angel - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The weather was absolutely beautiful today, but the scenery has not improved. The area where
we first arrived was mostly flat and open, with some scattered bits of trees, and what might have once been cultured
orchards. Yesterday, the land began to be more steeply hilly and rocky. The trail is very hard for me to see in
some areas, but Hazard doesn’t seem to have a problem. The trees are more common, perched on rocky crags and separated
by blackened meadows and fields of stone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>25 Angel- Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Another beautiful day. The forest has continued, punctuated by great
gaping holes which have been burned or torn away. Some are as small as a large house, others almost as big as the
city of Everway itself. At mid-day, we entered a forest and haven’t seen the end of it yet. I think we may have
reached the edge of the plains.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>26 Angel - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Traveling without water is becoming quite a burden. I’m used to
bathing everyday. The spot washes our water rationing allows are not very satisfying. At least I don’t have to
worry about catching a chill when my powers can warm the water and the air around me for the duration of my ablutions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>28 Angel - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Tomorrow, we will arrive at the gate to Stonedeep. I'll be so glad to get out of here. I only
hope Stonedeep has fared better than this wretched place. Hazard is going to wait on us for only three weeks before
she returns to Everway. I don't blame her for not wanting to remain longer, but it does not leave us much time
to find out what might be going on there. It’s supposed to be a four day gate, but if our information is wrong,
and the gate is longer than seven days, she’ll be gone before we can return. Hazard has blazed a trail, of course,
so we won’t be lost, but I’d rather travel in her company through this mess.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>1 Judge - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">A fierce thunderstorm rages outside. We’re as secure as we can be, but the wind still comes through,
blowing out our lamps almost as swiftly as they are lit. Only my power to create light is still reliable enough
to write by.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at the gate in early-afternoon, and decided to wait until tomorrow to go through to
Stonedeep. A ring of partially toppled stones mark the edges of a clearing, and the gate stands in the center.
The gate is marked with huge stone columns and a stone lintel. It’s about ten feet wide and ten feet high. The
area is a bit more open, and most of the trees are less than twenty years old. It must have been a large clearing
at one time. All the stones are marked with old soot, as is the ground. I wonder how many may have come through
that gate to meet the blast of a dragon’s fire.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We cleared out a place to camp and have settled in to rest a bit before bracing the unknown beyond.
It started to rain a short while later and soon everything was soaked. Hazard’s had a lot of experience with travel
difficulties, but she was foiled in starting the fire for the evening meal. I offered the assistance of my powers
for the task, and a tight hot sphere of warmth did the job. It’s clear to all why I travel without flint, steel
or tinder box.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Still, this fierce rain is troubling. I hope it’s not an omen of what’s to come.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>6 Judge - Underwood, Stonedeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at Stonedeep a fair bit past sundown. No sooner did we pass through the gate, but
we heard screaming. It was the voice of a young woman and it was coming from quite close by. She was there in a
stone yard with us, a dark-haired woman being menaced by two dark creatures, and we rushed to her aid. It quickly
became apparent that these were skeletons dressed in dark rags. It was a tough fight, but eventually we managed
to crush the monsters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The woman seemed almost as frightened of us as she was of her former attackers. She must have
seen us come through the gate. This sphere's been closed off for so long, I believe they've forgotten how gates
work. After a time, she calmed down and managed to introduce herself as Rarity. She also gave us the unfortunate
news that the skeletons were actually something of a constable force. We're already in trouble with the law. Rarity
told us that she was being taken in to be a bride for the Awakener. Interestingly, she also says her realm is called
&quot;Bonekeep,&quot; not Stonedeep.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust told us then about a vision that she had as we passed through the gates. One of a
dark and powerful being going down a line of beautiful women and destroying each on in turn. It seems like the
Awakener will not be happy with his choice of brides. I do know that no woman should be forced to marry against
her will. We agreed to help Rarity sneak back into town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">That turned out to be easier than we thought. The town was walled, but the walls were largely
crumbling and falling down. We by-passed the gates which were guarded by other dead creatures, and found an easy
place to pass over. Without using lights, we made our way to Rarity's home, a town called Underwood, and were welcomed
by her father, Harvest. He was bothered by what Rarity told him of our appearance at the gate, but he was more
glad to have his only daughter back. He mentioned some local legend about people disappearing from the stone yard,
never to appear again. They must have been un-knowing sphere-walkers stumbling through the gate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Harvest says that the queen, Nightstar, is collecting many beautiful young women from the land
to be married to a dark harbinger of death called the Awakener. Apparently, if he doesn't get a satisfactory bride,
he will destroy the land. If he's given Nightstar this power, he probably can. Still, I wonder why people always
assume that powerful godlings want &quot;beautiful&quot; rather than intelligence, skill, sensitivity or something
else. If he's interested in power, maybe he wants power in a bride. The others don't agree, especially Rarity’s
family. They insist that the stories they know require a bride of &quot;beauty.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>7 Judge - Underwood, Stonedeep/Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">In the morning, we were taken to see Priest Greatheart. He is a priest of Osiris, a god who dies
and is restored by his sister. The sister goddess, Isis, is the official worship here, so those who follow Osiris
are without much influence, but Greatheart is quite popular. He told us that Queen Nightstar has been queen for
many generations and that she is served by the undead. Townfolk who oppose Nightstar are frequently seen later
in the Queen's undead service. The realm has suffered in her reign. Everything seems dead and lifeless. The people
are just managing to survive. They believe that the Queen made a bargain with the Awakener who visits every 50
years, to gain her power and longevity. This time the Awakener demands a bride, and Nightstar is collecting beautiful
women from all over the land. He's due to be arriving in just three days.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Greatheart is the first who has actually recognized the name Stonedeep. He says he read it in
an old story. Later in the day, Greatheart found the book he’d been referring to. We could not read it, as it was
written in a symbolic language different from the Tongue, so Greatheart read it for us. It referenced a scroll
about the beginnings of the Queen Nightstar’s reign and the invasion from the north. It said something like this
<I>...And the Awakener said unto Nightstar, &quot;This shall be my final visit to your realm, for it’s time has
come. It falls to me to awaken Stonedeep to new Life.&quot; She who was to be our queen did not accept the Awakener’s
sentence of death. &quot;My realm has life in it still; it is not ready to die. With your power, I can save Stonedeep
from the invaders, and create a realm that will honor you for all time.&quot; The Awakener thought on her words,
then spoke, &quot;As you wish.&quot; A great scroll appeared in his hand. &quot;Take this scroll. It will unlock
the secrets of power you will need.&quot; Nightstar took the scroll and began to thank him, but he spoke again.
&quot;There shall be a price. Upon my fifth visit hence, I shall claim a bride, the most desirable woman this realm
can offer, one who can fulfill my destiny ... and I shall fulfill hers.&quot; With that, the Awakener vanished
in a blast of flame, leaving only a black rose at Nightstar’s feet.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It sounds like somewhere in the course of events, Nightstar forgot her noble purpose, her love
for the realm, and turned instead to love her power. She isn’t the first, and won’t be the last.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Scepter, where we will find the Queen, is three day's travel by boat heading South, up the Springrise
river, just past the Stone Flat where the Awakener supposedly appears. They don’t have any horses, and walking
will likely take too much time. Unfortunately, the river is highly patrolled by Nightstar's minions, so boating
will be difficult. Mach has come up with a plan to create a flying ship that could get us there more quickly, and
without interference. The townspeople spent much of the day secretly gathering wood and cloth and other materials
which they brought to the barn where we are hiding so Mach can create this miracle. He started his spell-casting
right after the evening meal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Stonedeep was supposed to have only one gate, but it’s clear that this &quot;Stone Flat&quot;
must be another. I wonder where it goes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>8 Judge - Underwood, Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Last night while Mach went into his spell-casting and the rest of us were taking shifts on watch,
we were suddenly attacked by a horde of zombies and other undead creatures. I suppose the townsfolk gathering Mach’s
materials weren't as sneaky and secretive as they thought. It was a horrible fight, and we barely survived. I tried
attacking with fire by igniting oil-soaked rags with my powers and shooting them at the ghouls, but it didn't slow
them down. I always thought they were especially vulnerable to fire, but I suppose the tales are wrong. The creatures
were lead by a woman who we later learned was Priestess Wonder of the church of Isis. Thankfully, she departed
when her creatures were dispatched, for we had little strength left to continue the fight. Wanderlust’s magic healed
my injuries and Mach continued his spell-casting into the night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">This morning we were met by a young woman named Valor. She had been given great fighting skill
by a goddess called Baast. Her father has been taken by Nightstar and she believes he is one of her undead ghouls.
We could certainly use a good fighter. I had considered myself quite skilled, and Wanderlust had said the same
of herself, but we were no match for the minions of Queen Nightstar. The townspeople here are most supportive,
but they don't want to endanger themselves on this quest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The ship was ready to take off before noon, and we made it halfway down the river by nightfall.
There's a lot of anxiety about this, but I'm not worried. If anything goes wrong, I'll just get off. It sure is
convenient to be able to levitate. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to carry any of the others in that case.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The rest of the crew, Wanderlust in particular, have decided that I might be right in that the
Awakener might be looking for something other than &quot;beauty&quot; in a bride. She says the rejected women in
her vision were certainly beautiful. Maybe someone with power, like Queen Nightstar herself, would be a better
choice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>9 Judge - Scepter, Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I can't believe we actually pulled this thing off. It worked! And all in less than four days.
We'll have plenty of time to make it back to the gate and greet our guiding party. Presumably, everything is going
to be fine, now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at StoneFlat near sunset and found the place guarded. The Queen's ghouls couldn't
do much against our flying ship, and we beat them handily. Mach hid the ship behind some trees and we stood in
for the guards at the Stone Flat. It didn't look like a gate, and didn't act like a gate, but the Awakener arrived
as if it were some exceptionally strange gate. We convinced him that we were his honor guard and we traveled with
him to Scepter. It was clear that he wanted to marry Nightstar, but from everything we'd heard, we were certain
that she wasn't going to be willing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I by-passed the guards and went ahead and talk to Queen Nightstar before the Awakener actually
arrived. She wasn't an undead creature herself, just old, worn and weary. She saw the logic in my suggestion, but
she was afraid to accept the Awakener's proposal, afraid of death. The Lady breathed fire on my tongue then, and
I told the Queen, &quot;You already know death. You've known death for three hundred years. Why not take a chance
on Life?&quot; She wasn't convinced right away, but when the Awakener appeared, she did agree to become his bride.
As soon as she did, they both were transformed: he into a great bronze dragon, and she into a beautiful maiden.
There was no death or fear there. The Queen was no longer Nightstar, so Wanderlust gave her a new name, &quot;Joy.&quot;
The former-Awakener said he needed no name. He thanked us and gave us each a small crystalline skull about the
size of my fist, and said that it would &quot;bestow [his] gift on any mortal.&quot; We assume his &quot;gift&quot;
means death, but we don't know how it works. They left then, flying off to the unknown together.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We were able to look through the Queen's treasures and took enough gold and gems to sustain us
for some time. It may be worth as much as eight or nine hundred gold helfs for each of us. I also came across a
small crystal touchstone. If I place it on a magical item, the stone will glow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>10 Judge - Scepter, Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Oh, how I dispise politics! A score of nobles and military officers
are all trying to take charge of the clean-up and position themselves for control of the realm. None of them, especially
those who held any position of power under Nightstar, seem to have any support from the populace. The common people
seem to be the only ones getting anything accomplished. It might be interesting to see how the realm is ruled a
year from now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The merchants organized a festival of sorts in the courtyard outside
the palace. Although it wasn’t a lavish affair, there was enough to share and plenty of festive activities, music
and dance. Earlier in the day, the foot-soldiers organized the youths of the city to remove and bury the bodies
of Nightstar’s undead minions who are now once again properly dead. It had rained during the night and the soil
was heavy and wet. Wanderlust, Valor and I helped with that chore for a while, but then I went on to clearing out
the field where the party was later held.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>11 Judge - near Scepter, Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We stayed in Scepter until noon before heading North towards Underwood and our gate back home.
We had intended to leave just after the morning meal, but were delayed by many festive citizens who wanted to hear
our story again and again. The delay was probably a blessing. Mach’s spelled flying ship unraveled at mid-morning.
I’d have been okay if it had happened while we were aboard, but the others might have had a problem. Since we’re
no longer in a hurry, we decided to travel by ordinary boat, rather than wait for him to recast his spell.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Nobody has seen the dragon or Joy in the area. People seem to accept the story of Nightstar’s
redemption, but I can see in their eyes that they’re still not that anxious to see Joy. I hope that she and the
dragon find a good future together. Fulfilling each other’s destiny.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>12 Judge - Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Our travel has been uneventful. The boat moves downstream slowly
in the lazy current. Wanderlust and I have been talking about the Crystal Skulls we’ve received, but nobody has
any idea how they work. Since we presume they cause death and can only be used once, we’re hesitant to test them.
We don’t want to waste them, or worse, use them wrongly and get someone killed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>13 Judge - Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Did I really say it was a good idea to travel by boat rather than
wait for Mach to recast his spell? The trip is slow, and I’m bored. It rained all day today, a steady drenching
fall. I didn’t dare take my lute out of its case for fear that the wood would become warped. The captain says we
should arrive at Underwood by tomorrow afternoon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>14</B> <B>Judge - Underwood, Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We have finally arrived back at Underwood, and it is still raining. Tomorrow we’ll take the gate
to Sweetwater. We invited Valor to come with us, but she says her place is here, with her people. I'm inclined
to think that she's right. I wonder what it would be like to know where and who your people really are. To know
where you come from and how you got to where you are. One day I'll know the answers to such things myself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I took advantage of the wait to take one more luxurious bath, and
bought three more barrels of water to carry across to Hazard. I’m sure she’s in no danger of running out, but it
will be nice to ease the rationing a bit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>19 Judge - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The escort was still there when we got through the gate. Wanderlust had been suggesting that
she’d probably tire of waiting and leave early, but I don’t think Hazard would consider going back on her word
like that. She’s cleared the area around the gate, removing a number of the smallest trees and saplings, and setting
up a pleasant camp for her wait.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">She was pretty well settled in as she was expecting to be here for a few more days. There’s no
hurry now, so we’ll be leaving tomorrow. Tonight she’s busy preparing to break camp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>21 Judge - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Heavy rain overnight. Clear by morning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>6 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">As soon as we got back to Roundwander, we met with Silverbell and told her what happened. She
seemed very interested in the unusual markings on the weapons that Nightstar's minions had been using. I hadn't
really taken much note of it at the time, but Mach had noticed that they were of an uncommon metal and had rather
strange markings on them. He tried to reproduce the designs, but we couldn't find anything in the Library that
resembled them. While we were there, I looked for something like the Awakener's gifts but wasn't surprised to come
up empty there, too.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust has agreed to let me share her room at the Shadetree Inn near Mercy in Strangerside.
It’s nicer than my room near Fool’s Bridge and less expensive, since we’ll be sharing the costs. On my way back
to the Inn, I stopped in to see Sunshine Bard. The bounty I picked up at Stonedeep is enough to pay my dues for
six months time. I wasn't surprised when Sunny told me that another had taken my corner while I was gone. It has
been nearly two months. She did give me the names of two new musicians who might like to work with me. I’ll talk
to them tomorrow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>7 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I spent the morning at the Lesser Arena, practicing my swordwork
and archery. In the afternoon, I found a performing partner. Reed has a corner just a block from Temple Square.
She plays the drums and pipes. For some pieces, I dance to her rhythms or sing. Other times, I play my lute and
sing while she drums. We seemed to be fairly well received today. I plan to buy some brightly colored dancing gear
to draw more attention. Reed is impressed also by some of the unusual music I've found in my travels and visits
to the library. She's working on some new drumming techniques to master them</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>8 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I stopped by the Weavers and purchased three sets of dancing gear
and new soft shoes. One in all shades of blue, tightly fitting with a removable flared skirt and shoulder wrap.
One in bright reds, oranges and yellows with several layers of translucent fabric and many scarves. The last ,
in greens and black, is long sleeved and skirted, suitable for slower, more formal dance styles. I don’t have a
great need for the last, just now, but it was too nice to leave behind. I may have greater need in the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>9 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Things are settling back into a routine. In the mornings I go to the practice grounds near the
lesser arena, where I practice with whatever students are available. In the afternoons, near the temple square
with Reed. Today a tall fellow, Mother Moonlight, came by with about nine young children. He was bringing them
to do some kite-flying, but they stayed for almost an hour watching and listening to Reed and me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>10 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The Crow family had a fantastic show at the Lesser Arena this morning.
They were all youths, but some of their work was amazing. Fearless Crow has agreed to practice with me, but she
wants three and a half hefts a session. I suppose I could pay that with the reward from Bonekeep, but it still
seems expensive. After spending so much on the dancing clothes, I don’t want to be spending too much on other items
just yet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>11 Serpent- Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">One of Moonlight's little charges lost her kitten today in the square, and it made me miss Misty
all the more. If my sister had been here, she'd have been able to find it in a flash, but I don't have her scrying
skill. Reed and I spent a half a candlemark looking for the small one, scrounging in alleys, and rooftops. Reed
and I know of many good hiding places and eventually we found the little creature in a barrel behind the fishstore.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>13 Serpent- Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I'm certainly sore today. I met a weaponsmaster from Fortune’s Joy at the practice grounds who’s
agreed to work with me for only two heft. I’ll be meeting with him twice a week. His name is Honor and he really
pushed me to my limits of swordskill. Muscles aching, I didn't dance as much today, but stuck to singing more often
than not, and accompanying Reed on my lute. Mother Moonlight came again today, as usual and stopped to listen,
but today he didn't have any of the children with him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>14 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Having spent the week in temple square, today, I spoke with Dignity
Moondance and attended the rituals in her temple. Her demanding &quot;Goddess&quot; is not much like my loving
Lady. She suggested that I speak to her cousin, Zephyr Moondance. Somewhere in this land of a thousand gods there
may be a house of worship that suits my beliefs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>15 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Mother Moonlight was here again today. That’s three days in a row.
He and the children seem to really like the show. While we took a short break, Mother told the children about the
beginnings of the Mother Family. It’s not the first story I’ve heard that claims to know the &quot;truth&quot;
of the Walker’s pyramid, but it is the first that doesn’t view its completion as a city-wide disaster, merely a
Family event. It might be fun to learn some more of these legends and any songs that might be associated with them.
It would be a useful thing to know if I ever get invited to perform for a Family, although that seems pretty unlikely
just now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>16 Serpent- Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Light rain overnight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I didn’t get a chance to talk to Moonlight about his Family’s stories and songs, afterall. Lady
Aria Silverbell called me to her estate again for a meeting. By the time I got back to Temple Square, Moonlight
had come and gone already.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust was at the meeting, but Mach was not. Silverbell introduced us to new traveler, Strongrip.
He's a spherewalker who claims to have traveled through worlds not frequently visited by residents of Roundwander.
She asks us to accompany him to seek information regarding the strange beast that attacked him two gates hence,
and to set up some sort of trade situation with the forest-dwellers there. She's given us a unique device, a crystal
that we can use to communicate across the spheres with her. It only works once a month, and can only convey eight
or ten words at a time, but it could come in handy. I quickly volunteered to carry it for the group.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Reed took the news of my absence well. She says she will do fine alone with the new songs we've
been working on. Even in Everway, maybe especially in Everway, people love to hear new things. After seeing Reed,
I went to inform Sunny of my impending voyage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>24 Serpent - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">As we’d been warned, bloody corpses litter the place, singly, in
clusters, or sometimes in piles taller than a woman. Everywhere, there's gruesome horror. These poor souls were
killed centuries ago, but kept in this state by some strange magic, as a memorial or tribute of some sort to this
great battle. At least the freshness of their apparent demises spares us the horrible smell I'd otherwise expect.
When I close my eyes and play, it’s easy to imagine I’m somewhere-else.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> I’m really looking forward to seeing this &quot;Living Forest.&quot; The very name speaks to
me of great possibilities! I had a few minutes with Strongrip after dinner and asked him if he knew anything about
some of the places I’ve been. He’d heard of most of the places Misty and I had been to since we’d been separated
from Willow, and had been to a few of them, but he knew nothing of the places I’d described from earlier. Our wonderful
forest-home, or the realm we’d escaped from. I don’t even know if they’re in the same sphere or not.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We talked about the beasts, too. Strongrip calls them &quot;Ogres.&quot; They’re shaped like
a man, but about a head taller. They have long limbs, almost no necks, and are covered with hair. While they’re
exceptionally strong, they seem to move relatively slowly. That may be our best advantage. If we can stay out of
range, maybe we can take one down with distance weapons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>25 Serpent - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">According to the map, we have about a week’s walk north and west
around a large inland sea to the gate to Living Forest. The land here is flat, and we can see local forests in
the distance. This morning, I thought they were within a half a day’s walk, but now they look no closer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The bodies littering this place are quite distracting. Unfortunately,
there seems to be a great many of them along our trail. Apparently any attempt to move them is futile. They’re
magically returned to their former position and posture within a day. Strongrip says we must learn to look without
seeing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>26 Serpent - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The forest looks a bit closer at last, ‘though I’m not sure I can
trust that appearance. Strongrip says we should be there before nightfall tomorrow. We have clearly reached the
north shore of the sea and will be bearing westnorthwest in the morning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>27 Serpent - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">It rained heavily during the night. A great noisy thunderstorm.
Strongarm assured us we were safe on the small rise, surrounded as we were by larger hills. A flash-flood cleared
out much of the small brush in the passageway below us. I half expected the water to be running red with blood
washed from the corpses, but the magic in this place keeps even the blood in place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We’ve entered the forest on the north side of the sea. The trees
hide the evidence of the battle a bit better here. This make it all a bit more pleasant for the most part, but
it can be quite un-nerving to top a hill, or round a cluster of trees and suddenly encounter more of this mess.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>28 Serpent - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The afternoon brought a very light rain. The clouds, the winds and
the continuing shade of the forest kept it quite chilly and fresh for the rest of the day. I warmed everyone up
enough to dry us and keep us all comfortable. On a day like today, there can be no doubt that winter is coming.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>1 Mare - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Today was cold, clear and dry. We made good progress toward the
gate and should reach it before nightfall tomorrow. Having finally become grounded today, the timing is good.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I’m truly looking forward to leaving this realm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>9 Mare - BlondOak’s tribe, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We reached the gate just after noon on the second, and arrived in Living Forest in mid-morning.
Immediately, we met the lad, Quietstep, fishing. He was bare to the waist, wearing soft shoes of hide and an unusual
sort of short breeches. It is rather warm and pleasant in the forest, so heavier garments are not required. The
rest of his community dresses much the same, with the women in short shifts and breeches, or dresses of soft hide.
You’d never believe that this was Mare. It seems much more like spring, maybe Youth or Goddess.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The youth was startled by our sudden appearance, but not too surprised. He says the forest told
him to wait for us. He took us to see his father, BlondOak, who is the chief of his tribe. During the short journey,
we were attacked by three of the ogres. Quietstep knew they were there before we saw them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust and I fought back with magic. I levitated to stay out of reach and attacked from the
air. We defeated one, and the other two escaped. As I tried to return to land, I sprained my ankle. Wanderlust
injured herself while trying to heal Quietstep. She saved his life, but the lad is suddenly terrified of us. They're
not much fond of magic here. We captured one of the ogres, which should please Silverbell if we can get it home.
They sure do smell bad! Wanderlust says it seems to be the same manner of beasts that attacked her home realm.
She’s most anxious to learn more about them and from whence they come.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">In spite of our use of magic, the Chief accepts us, probably because
we saved his son and Quietstep did speak to our support. BlondOak says the beasts are a new phenomenon and the
Forest doesn't like them. They don't work with the forest, but attack it needlessly. The chief wants to destroy
our prisoner immediately, but we've convinced him to wait at least one day. He wants his people to examine the
creature first, so we will have to wait until morning to question it. The others are trying to figure out how to
carryout Silverbell's second objective, to establish trade, but these people get everything they want or need from
the forest. I don't think we'll have any success there. We've debated using the crystal to communicate with Silverbell
as to our progress so far, but have decided to wait until we have some real news.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I'm quite pleasantly impressed by the tribe here. They live in wonderful homes crafted in the
bases of living trees all around the edge of the clearing. In many ways it reminds me of the place Morning Mist
and I lived with Willow, although they centered their lives and homes much higher in the trees. If the woodspeople
here weren't so opposed to magic, I might really like staying here for a while, but they don’t seem to be very
open to us yet. Joining this community would seem to involve more than just a gesture of good-will.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I took a brief walk alone after dinner to experiment with my powers.
Unlike cast magic, they appear to work the same as before, without any ill effects. Still, I will be cautious about
using them. It will look the same as magic to the people and I don’t want to spook them. For this reason, I’m using
Wanderlust’s lantern to write tonight, rather than my own light.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>10 Mare - Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Last night, the settlement was attacked by a band of ogres. Somehow, we managed to scare them
off, but our prisoner was killed. We were at a loss as to what to do next. The different groups in the forest have
no real contact with one another. BlondOak knows where to locate other tribes, but there's no assurance that they
will find help or support there. And we still don't know enough about the ogres to form a strategy for defeating
them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Afterwards, Quietstep came to us to say that he's certain the trouble is caused by Snowcat, a
woman of the tribe who disappeared after her brother was killed. She had claimed he drowned, but the tribe is convinced
that she killed him in order to gain mastery of magic. They say that here the only way to get magic is to kill
a blood relative. It's no wonder now that they were so suspicious of us. We were working on a plan for some of
us to accompany him on his quest while others stay to protect the people, but the chief caught wind of it and insisted
that our entire party go with his son.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It’s been a quiet trek so far. It would be easier if I could use my magic to ease the demands
on my sore ankle, but we’ve had no problems. The forest really does speak to Quietstep and his people, warning
him of dangers ahead. I wish I could hear it, too.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>11 Mare - Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We had heavy rain all day, but at least it was warm. I risked using
my powers to keep myself dry, without extending the sphere to the others. I didn’t want to frighten Quietstep,
and it seems that nobody noticed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Quietstep doesn’t seem to know anything about Snowcat’s magic. He
doesn’t even want to talk about magic, so we don’t have any idea what she’s practicing. We’ll have to discern that
ourselves, but first we’ll have to decide whether she is really foe or friend. The ogres themselves should be easy
to defeat unless there are great in number, but it may be harder to overcome a mage when hers is the only magic
that is working. It only it were as easy as it seems in the songs and cradle-tales.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>12 Mare - Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">My ankle seems to be completely healed now. We haven’t reached the mountain Snowcat is said to
occupy yet, but it is in sight of our campsite tonight. The forest doesn't extend up the mountain so it can't tell
the tribe anything about the beasts. There actually seems to be a stone cat on the mountain top. Its head is as
tall as a woman. I wonder if Snowcat put it there, or if it was just some natural fluke.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Quietstep has become quite agitated. He seems to be both frightened
and angry, and unsure of which emotion should hold sway. I hope he doesn’t do something stupid. We don’t know that
she’s behind this. She’s been judged guilty just because she’s a mage. As a mage, myself, I find that a rather
tenuous proof. I suppose we’ll find out soon enough.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>13 Mare - Cat Mountain, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Well, it seems that Snowcat is not the enemy after all. She could be a most proficient liar,
but I believe that she is innocent. She seems genuinely interested in our assistance in thwarting the Ogres. She
has offered Wanderlust and me a chance to improve our efforts here, a chance that we could use our magic. Even
Quietstep seems to accept her now, but Strongrip has suggested this quest of hers could be a trick to entice us
to lower our guard and then defeat us. Her magic is of divination and scrying, not one useful for fighting, so
I suppose it’s possible, but I find it unlikely.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We traveled all day long and eventually got to the top of Snowcat's mountain. It was a tough
climb. It started snowing and was quite windy. I had just started using my sphere of warmth to make myself less
cold, when we found the mage. Several of the ogres attacked from somewhere. Snowcat helped us defeat them and then
took us to her fortress. She explained to us that her brother's death was completely an accident, and I believe
her. She explained that in order to manipulate magic in this sphere without penalty, mages must undergo a visionquest.
They can only be attempted once a month. Sometimes people die on these quests, or are horribly wounded, but if
they succeeded, then the magic will work for them. I'd love to try it, but I'm afraid of failure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>14 Mare - Cat Mountain, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I have decided to undertake the visionquest Snowcat has offered.
I spent the day fasting and meditating in preparation for the trial to come, but I have no idea what to expect
and don’t know what to be ready for. Lady knows what tomorrow will bring. I pray I will be equal to the task.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>15 Mare - Cat Mountain, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today we’ve seen great failure and success. Failure in the visionquests, and success in the fight
against the Ogres. We still don’t have any answers on where they came from or why, and we do have a great many
more questions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> The visionquests were a great disappointment and mine was most disturbing to me. When Wanderlust
attempted hers, she came away with a bad burn on her hand. Since her healing magic still doesn’t function reliably,
it may take a week before it’s whole again. I am unharmed, physically, but I don't wonder if I didn't fare worse.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The vision. I can't get it out of my head. I was passing between spheres with Morning Mist but
I could <I><U>see</U></I> it for the first time. It was like a path with a steep drop-off on each side. Mist accidentally
stepped off the path and started falling. She was falling so slowly, like she was sinking in water. I didn't know
what to do. I was afraid to use my magic to levitate her because we were between spheres. I was going to look for
a rope, when these small winged beings came and told me they could help. I asked them to do that, but when they
got down to where she was, she turned up and glared at me, hissing! Her eyes were glowing red and evil, and then
everything disappeared and I was back with Snowcat. I believe my failure was one of not acting on my own. I'm still
not sure I should have used magic there, but it was a magic test. I just know I didn't react quickly enough and
should have acted on my own instead of relying on others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I've decided that I am going to start using my magic and abilities more. I've got to develop
them if I'm going to be able to grow, and I may need them to help Misty. I'm going to seek out every opportunity
to increase my abilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">After the quests, we went out and looked for the beasts. We found the entrance to their tunnel
network, and carefully made our way inside. It was unbelievably HUGE down there. All these ogres digging an intricate
network of tunnels everywhere. Strangely, the armor and weapons they were wearing seemed quite similar to that
which Nightstar's minions had been using. Our timing was good, 'though. We were there when one of them came running
out of a tunnel with a pouch, yelling &quot;I've got it!&quot; We leapt out then and got it from her/him. It turned
out to be a gigantic scale, like a dragonscale, only bigger than my hand. It's a group find, but I have been careful
to keep it on my person. I don't want to see it get lost.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> During the fight, the big red-skinned supervisor-type, called Jackal, disappeared through an
arch in a solid wall that seemed to act like a gate, but somehow <U>wasn't</U> a gate. We tried to activate it
by tugging on stones in the archway but couldn't. That's the second one we found like that, counting the StoneFlat.
And both times, there was that armor with the strange markings. Clearly there are other ways to travel across spheres
that we don't know about.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Jackel wasn’t an ogre. They seem to be just the brute labor here. Jackel was some sort of creature
like a cross between a person and a small dragon. Like the gargoyles that decorate some of the buildings in Everway.
He had a frightening aura of power and strength, but he didn’t fight so I don’t know if that’s so.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>16 Mare - below Cat Mountain, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Rain in afternoon</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Snowcat has decided to come with us back to visit the tribe. She
wants to clear her name, but isn’t expecting to rejoin the community. She wants to return with us to Everway. I
can see that this makes Quietstep happy. He seems to have been able to accept her as an ally for the past few days,
but I suppose it will take time to overcome a lifetime’s prejudices against magic and mages.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>17 Mare - Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> The village chief met us less than a day inside the tree-line, as he'd been warned by the forest
that we were returning. He seemed to believe us when we vouched for Snowcat and told him that she <U>wasn't</U>
responsible for her brother's death. I think it was Quietstep who truly convinced him. But he and his tribe were
still more than happy to hear that she wasn't planning on staying there. I sent a message to Silverbell with the
crystal to let her know to expect us in about three weeks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>25</B> <B>Mare - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at the gate in the early afternoon of the 18th and departed for Battlefield, arriving
here in the late morning. It wasn’t until we were at the gate that I thought to wonder about whether Snowcat would
be able to come through. None of us are able to gate for a non-spherewalker. Fortunately, it turned out that she
could walk under her own power.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Battlefield is unchanged, and our day’s travel rather unremarkable. Accustomed to dealing with
the colder weather atop the mountain, Snowcat was well prepared for the cold of Battlefield. In the last three
weeks, its gotten much colder. A hint of snow is on the air, and nobody can doubt that winter is begun.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>3 Hero - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Foggy morning</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>11 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Lady Silverbell was most interested in the scale when we arrived this evening. I’ve never seen
a dragon, but I understand that their scales are generally no bigger than a large coin. A creature with scales
this size would be immense, if it were proportional. Silverbell has decided to have the artifact tested by her
local experts tomorrow. We’ve been invited to attend. I am quite curious.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>12 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The testing of the scale was a disaster! We went to watch this morning and witnessed a thing
that is barely to be believed. Silverbell's sorcerers prepared a spell-casting circle with a great silver vessel
in the middle. They put the scale in a large vessel and were just getting started casting their divination when
a HUGE hand, a hand about five feet long with claws, came crashing up through the floor, grabbed the thing, and
disappeared back in the ground. It was an amazing and frightening sight. I'd hate to think how big the creature
was that was attached to that hand. Maybe it was just a hand, and no being at all. I can only hope.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Afterwards, I went looking for Snowcat. It's been almost a month now since Wanderlust and I failed
the visionquests, and I'd like to try again. But Snowcat said that she could only conduct a visionquest back in
the Living Forest, so we'll have to wait.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>13 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I tracked down Reed. She has found a position in the Bright Peacock, one of the Strangerside
Inns, performing for the dinnertime crowds. She extended her commission to me, so I have a nice steady income now.
Since it's indoors and late in the day, I've been able to add some light effects to the dancing which seem to work
quite well. Soft shades of blue and green for the quiet songs, with fiery red and orange for the active and passionate
passages. It was wonderful.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>14 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> I am working on my resolve to improve my magical abilities. I have been practicing the exercises
I was taught by Quickfox, and trying to improve my control. And doing my best to remember those forbidden pages
of notes that I had read while his student. Of course, Snowcat can't teach me in the Summer Wind magic. I suppose
I should ask at Crookstaff, but I've heard about the fees they charge, especially for an Outsider.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>16 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today I skipped my usual weapons practice to meet with Snowcat. I had been planning to do swordwork
anyway, which isn't as much fun as archery. Archery practice is also magic practice. I always use my spells on
the last set to send my arrows places they would never go otherwise. Snowcat and I went to the library and found
some most intriguing references, but so far, no direct information. Snowcat has suggested that I return with her
to the Living Forest when she departs, to attempt my visionquest again. She can’t conduct it here, but must be
on the sphere of her power. I had forgotten that I could attempt the same visionquest twice. It’s a promising idea,
but frightening, too. I’d like to try, I think, but Snowcat intends a long stay, maybe as much as six months. I
don’t want to wait until then before taking some sort of action. Maybe something will come up here between now
and then.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>19 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Well, today was certainly interesting. I've got a lot to think about. That ... woman. Could it
really have been Misty? After all this time. But so changed. And I still can't get over the way that one-eyed man
died. What sort of creature was he to do that? Will it ever make sense? Why am I sure that he knew things we should
have asked, if we'd only known what they were?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It started last night when Wanderlust and I were out in Strangerside, looking about for something
to do. We stopped at an inn called the &quot;Beaked Lizard&quot; for something to eat. There was a really strange
person in the corner. At first, there wasn't any real way to know if it was female or male since there was a large
hood over the person's face, but he was big, and I thought it was a man. I wondered if he was watching us, but
Wanderlust didn't seem to think anything of him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">A couple invited us to play cards, but I wasn't in the mood for gambling. Wanderlust played.
She sent Swiftwing up to sit behind her opponents, and I figured she was cheating a bit. I was playing with the
idea of using my magic to cause the stranger's hood to fall from his face when one of the players starting yelling
about the bird. Apparently, he could speak to birds, too, and had overheard the creature's assistance. There was
a bit of a rout then, and we departed in a hurry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Out in the streets, we later came across another disturbance. We followed the yelling and found
the hooded stranger being accosted by four bandits. Wanderlust and I attempted to help. One of the four took something
from the stranger and ran off, yelling, &quot;I got it!&quot; I left Wanderlust to deal with the others. She and
the stranger were doing much better at fighting them, anyway. I used a speed spell to catch up with him, since
he was really quite a bit ahead of me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Just as I did finally catch up, he’d reached an alley where someone was waiting for him. The
bandit threw the pouch to her and he was then struck dead by a bolt of fire. It was a strange, tall, bizarre looking
woman. She laughed, and then flew straight up into the air! My motion spell was still active and I gave my best
jump, but it wasn't enough.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When I got back, Wanderlust and the stranger, Portent, had things well in hand. He had just one
eye. Not like he lost one in an accident, but just one eye in the middle of his forehead. It looked quite strange,
but he seemed to be friendly, and grateful to us for our attempted assistance. He said that the &quot;Deceiver&quot;
was most powerful and had powerful beings in his employ. I don't know what evil being he was thinking of and he
wouldn't explain. When he described the object that was stolen from him, we knew it was another dragon's scale,
like the one we found in Snowcat's realm. After what happened to that one, I'm not sure I want to deal with the
force that's trying to gather them, but I certainly would like to know what's going on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We followed in the direction that the woman had taken and eventually found a cabin on the edge
of a precipice. It was getting dark by then, but a quick scouting by Swiftwing told us that we were at the right
place. Wanderlust bragged about her talent for stealth and climbing. I believe I’ve actually had more practice
at both than she, but I let her scout out a path to take us up close to the cabin without being seen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">As we waited outside the window, I could see the woman up close. She wore a scant leather outfit,
and a long red glove. Her eyes were sunken and evil-looking. Her hair, long and scraggly and red. I'd never seen
anyone like her before, but something made me think of Misty. Maybe it was the shape of her face, but other than
that, it didn't look anything like her. She and her companions were waiting for someone to arrive and take possession
of the scale. Like I said, we didn't want to meet them, so we had to act immediately. We wanted the scale back
right away, and that was easy. The window was open, so I just whistled up a spell and levitated the bag right out
and into my hand. I hid in the shadows by the window and disappeared.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Naturally, they came flying out after us. I did my best to stay motionless, standing unseen so
they wouldn't see me. But when the she-demon came around she, well, she looked right where I was and cried, &quot;YOU!&quot;
Like she knew me, recognized me, even though I was invisible. She cast bolts of fire at me so I leapt into the
air and hovered above. I did my best to fight from there, shooting arrows and throwing blades. The woman did not
seem to be easily harmed. Wanderlust and Portent did a wonderful job defeating the bandits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">In the end, something very strange happened. The deamon went after Portent and he just put up
his sword and let her slice him down. It seemed to be positively deliberate. Why would he WANT to be killed by
her? It makes no sense to me. Did he do it to prevent being questioned? The woman disappeared, and Portent was
able to talk to Wanderlust and me briefly, but we didn't really know what questions to ask. I fear we have lost
valuable information. Something that could spell the end of this. We did decide to follow through with what he
had intended, what we would have done anyway, and take the scale to Silverbell. I hope she has some notion what
to do about it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Meanwhile, I'm still puzzled by this woman. I hadn't mentioned to Wanderlust about how she seemed
to remind me of Misty, even 'though she looked nothing like my sister. It seemed impossible that she could be the
same person. Morning Mist had no ability to fly, or throw fire. Those are <U>my</U> talents. This she-deamon never
called forth clouds or lightning which would be in Misty’s power... however, Misty was learning the magic of seeming
and illusion. If those skills were realized, she would have been able to cast an illusion about herself, make herself
seem like whatever she wanted. Taller, darker hair, and all. The fireballs could have been illusions, too. They
sure <I><U>felt</U></I> real. I'd hate to think we were cowed by something that wasn't really there. Misty wouldn't
have been able to make them real enough to actually kill someone, I don't think, even at her full potential. Unless
some miracle occurred in those two years and that potential was increased, not merely realized. If so, she could
be able to see through the eyes of someone she knows well, if she's nearby. Someone like me. And she'd be able
to track objects she knows, like the scale. ...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I hate to think it was really her. She didn't use any abilities that I know of her, but if it's
<I><U>possible</U></I>, I guess I should tell the others. This could be really dangerous. The visionquest I underwent
at Snowcat's certainly did hint that something terrible had happened to Misty, but I'd have never have thought
anything could do this to her. Maybe it's this &quot;Deceiver&quot; the stranger spoke of. If she's done this to
Misty, I want her. I want my sister back and I want payment for what was done to her. No matter how scary it seems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>20 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I thought I had a lot to think about yesterday. Now there's even more. Willow's here on Roundwander!
She's given me a lot of answers, but there are so many more questions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It started when I took Portent to the Tenders to see if they could attend to his body. The proprietor,
Greyteir, had never seen his kind before and knew nothing of their customs. I was waiting as he prepared to cremate
the body, when Jackal suddenly appeared. He hissed something about how magic would work for him in this realm and
attacked with a glowing blade. I defended myself and somehow managed to kill him in a few strokes. I never became
aware of any magic being used, or used any of my own. His blood did destroy my shortsword, so I've been using his
scimitar. I checked it with my touchstone and found that it is not magic of itself. The glow must have been a glamour
of some kind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Afterwards, when I checked on Portent, I found a tall, thin man with long white hair waiting
for me. He wouldn't give his name, but expressed sorrow over Portent's demise, and claimed to be responsible for
his race, and Portent's &quot;choice.&quot; He mentioned Willow, and a &quot;little white lie,&quot; he asked that
I forgive. Then he conjured a paper, tore it, and gave me half, saying it would answer my questions. As he disappeared
down the street, and replaced his hood, his eyes glowed green, just like the figure in my nightmares. But when
I talked to him, I felt that I was talking to a friend, and wasn't at all afraid. Could he be the same creature?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">In spite of the stranger's assurances, the paper didn't answer any questions. It was written
in a language I couldn't recognize.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When I got back to the inn, I had two messages waiting. I was told to meet Lady Silverbell in
Strangerside, and that Wanderlust had gotten into a major fight with a bunch of skeletons that morning and had
been aided by two strangers. Sounds like the deamon-woman (Misty?) was there, too. I was planning to go to the
library and see if anyone could translate the stranger's parchment for me, but thought it best to meet with the
others in Strangerside first.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">At the Strangerside estate, I was shocked to find Willow! She'd actually come into Roundwander
with Portent, Southpaw (a spherewalker) and Wind (a knight of the order of the seeker--whoever they are.) When
I asked her about how she'd arrived and what had happened, she started a long story about the first dragon and
a rebellion against the Gods ages ago. Portent's people were the Accursed, made by the goddess to fight the dragons,
and tricked by the dragons into helping them in exchange for the gift of foresight which cost them each an eye.
The foresight proved to be a curse and several turned away, but many stayed to help the dragons in order to have
this curse removed. This removal turned them into Ogres. According to her story, the dragon rebellion was defeated
and destroyed, and loyal dragons moved to earth in diminished capacity or stayed in heaven in other forms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Most interesting, but it didn't seem to really answer the questions about <U>her</U>. Finally
Willow told me that she is in truth sister to my mother, who died upon my birth. She is true mother to Amber/Misty
who is my half-sister/half-cousin as we share the same father, Lord Brightstone of Ember. He is presumably now
dead. Apparently my &quot;beloved father&quot; was dabbling in dark magic and possibly attempting to recreate the
first dragon, the Deceiver. Willow was certain he was planning to sacrifice both Amber and me, so she informed
Brightstone's enemies of his plans. They banded together for the attack which destroyed the castle, and provided
us with escape. A talented spherewalker conveyed the three of us to Elfhome where they hoped we would be safe.
Our family had originally come from Elfhome before re-settling in Ember. Willow feels that the gate we fell through
in Elfhome wasn't natural. That it was placed there deliberately to entrap us. She can't spherewalk and couldn't
follow, even if she'd known where we were.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It had taken her all this time to find a spherewalker who could and would take her to Roundwander,
and that was a very long trip. The direct path to &quot;home&quot; using conventional gates is as follows: Roundwander
to Fortune's Joy to Suncurst, through a 3 day gate to Labyrinth to Peaceful Lotus, through an eight week gate to
ElfHome and then to Ember. Assuming average gates except where otherwise stated, and all gates were close together,
this would take a minimum of 24 weeks. Six months.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I told Willow about where Misty and I had been, and what I'd done since we separated. She knows
nothing about this white-haired stranger with the glowing eyes who once haunted my dreams and now calls himself
my friend. I'd really been hoping she could explain that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When the others returned, they had a new companion with them. Loki had apparently been one of
the strangers who had helped Wanderlust against the skeletons. I am pleased that he aided my friend, but I do not
think him honest. I then learned that Wanderlust and Silverbell had hidden the scale in the fortifications of the
estate, since they've determined that any magic invoked on it would cause the Deceiver to appear to claim it. When
all nine scales were thus gathered, he would be recreated, to renew his fight against the Goddess. (Thank the Lady
that when I was retrieving it from Portent’s opponents, that I’d used my magic to levitate the <I>bag</I>, rather
than the <I>scale</I> itself!) When Wanderlust had been at the library today, she discovered a partial parchment
at the library dealing with the subject, and written in the same script, which Willow identified as Draconic script.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When we returned to the library, we found that my partial parchment matched the tear in the one
they had, although mine was new and theirs was ancient. Together, they made the most interesting claim.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>&quot;There will come one with a sister yet no sister, with three homes</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>yet no home, promised unto us twice. And through this one will</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>the nine be united and the glory and presence of our lord be</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>returned to the spheres. Then shall he sunder the heavens.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>Then shall he drive out the pretenders. Then shall he rule the spheres</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>for all eternity.&quot;</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Clearly this is an evil prophesy and we must do what we can to prevent these nine from being
re-united. The &quot;one&quot; could be a reference to me or Misty. More likely Misty, since she seems to be working
on gathering scales for the Deceiver. Assuming that deamonic woman <I>was</I> Misty, which seems to be more likely
as all these other pieces start fitting together. &quot;<I>Promised to us twice</I>,&quot; it said. Once might
have been when Brightstone was going to sacrifice us. When twice? When we were tricked into the false gate and
separated from Willow? When those strangers came for us at &quot;Uncle's?&quot; <I>&quot;Three homes</I>&quot;
could be Ember, Elfhome, and Uncle's place in Grassland. I've recently had a home here in Roundwander, which would
be four if it counts, but Misty hasn't. Maybe she hasn't known any other home.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">There was a magical note written on the parchment in the Common tongue when then were mated that
said, <I>P.S., Go to Remnant anyway - Lightfoot's &quot;friend&quot;</I> Apparently that had been where the library
had obtained the other part of the parchment and the group had been planning to go there to investigate its origins.
It was given to the library by a man from that sphere named Wornpath. Interesting that the white-haired man would
call himself my friend, assuming it was him who wrote it. Who is he? When he spoke of Portent's people, I thought
he was a mage who made them, but now I know they were made by the goddesses and gods for this ancient battle. Could
he be one of the dragons that now serve Heaven? Seems impossible that one so powerful would speak with me. But
who could he be? And why has he, or his people, been in my nightmares? Is he, perhaps, one of the fallen dragons,
a servant of evil? It seems not, if he is trying to warn us of the Deceiver’s plans, but how can I know? Either
way, going to Remnant seems to be the thing to do. I don't know how I'll be able to keep my resolve to further
my magic training if I can't stand still long enough to find a teacher. I guess I could look on Remnant, 'though
I don't know if we'll be there long enough to receive any training.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">After the evening meal, we were introduced to Peregrine, a warrior-guide who is to accompany
us to Remnant. She is from the family of Blade, small, Asian, and gray-haired. We leave tomorrow at dawn, but Wanderlust
is to stay here on Roundwander. Before I retired, I asked Willow about Misty and told her of my vision quest, and
my fears about Misty using her gifts against me. She told me that her only talent is a small one, that of divination.
She said her divination on me during our separation revealed to her only &quot;The Priestess/(Understanding Mysteries).&quot;
When attempting to divine on Misty, she got &quot;The Phoenix/(Rebirth)&quot; until recently when she gets only
&quot;The Dragon-Reversed/(Blind Fury).&quot; This does not bode well, but I guess we'll just have to do our best.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>1 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It took eight days to transverse the gate to Remnant, as we expected. We arrived early in the
morning. Peregrine seems to be extremely suspicious, and I have taken a liking to her. Strongrip is bowing to me
on this trip, naming me the leader of the expedition. It was easy to find Wornpath's shop. He told us the parchment
piece had been sold to him by a woman named Panther who had gotten it on this sphere while on a sea voyage. I asked
if he'd ever seen anything like the little skull that we each got from the Awakener, but he's baffled by the piece.
I do think it's important that we figure this out. We just might be needing something as powerful as this, and
I'd really like to know how to use it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We gave Wornpath ten beads to have Panther call on us when she gets into Bizarre, the capital
here. Strongrip was going to give him a gold heft! Fortunately, we talked him into a more suitably sized incentive
for the task. After that, Wornpath decided to tell us that Panther just left within the week on another voyage
and was not expected back for 12 weeks. With nothing else to do for the moment, we then found ourselves rooms at
the only inn.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I really like this place. Everyone is so different and nobody seems to be a native. They are
from some other sphere, usually refugees from some cataclysm, and yet they don't seem defeated. They're happy and
friendly, delighting in their diversity. I wonder if we might run into former citizens of Mach's home, or even
Ember. That would be something, wouldn't it?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">It snowing now, but we were already in our rooms by the time it
began, so it has been no inconvenience. I find it rather soothing to watch from the warmth of the Inn.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>2 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today was quite a day. Since it was too soon to gate back to Everway, I wandered around the place,
asking after any mages. There doesn't seem to be any here. There's lots of weird stuff at the little shops, but
nothing I particularly want. I did find out that none of the residents come through from Everway, so none would
be from Ember or Mach's sphere. They come to Remnant in groups with strong sphere-walkers. Those who can walk the
spheres on their own, continue to Everway, and those who can't stay here, happy to be out of the fighting in the
spheres &quot;downstream.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">There didn't seem to be anyone-else who would have a clue about the skull, the strange weapons,
or the parchment, so I just explored casually. I stopped at a local food vendor and as I ate my fishcake, I noticed
a boy sitting by the edge of the square, playing on a set of pipes. I wanted to join right in, but I waited. Finally,
when he took a short break, I went and introduced myself. His name was Merry and he'd been playing all his short
life. (He's human and about 15 years old.) He's orphaned with no family and made his living on what he could encourage
others to give for his talents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We knew before we came that this sphere is mostly water, and there’s a great abundance of coastline,
so it’s not too surprising that Merry’s most popular tunes are sailing songs or great adventure ballads involving
sea monsters. He taught me a few new ones which were quite nice. He had never heard of a Silkie, and seemed to
enjoy the songs I taught him about them. He eventually told me that his family wasn’t all gone. His parents and
siblings were, and he’d escaped to Remnant by tagging along with another family who’d paid a spherewalker to get
them out, but he left behind some aunts, uncles and cousins who he misses and worries greatly over. He’d been trying
to earn enough to get them out, too, but wasn’t getting too far ahead. I’m going to help him while we’re stuck
here, if I can.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>3 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Merry and I are working up a great little show. The crowds seem to like it so far. I told Merry
that I wouldn’t take any of his income, so he’s paying me with flute lessons. The woodwinds have never been my
favorite instrument, as you can’t sing along while you play one, but I do enjoy the bright, cheerful tones. Merry’s
been living on the street, so I’ve convinced the party to let him stay with us in the Inn as long as we’re here.
It’s been wonderful for him. He enjoys being cleaner, and he’s getting much better rest, which should pay off directly
in a better performance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>4 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We had light snow in the afternoon, but it we played through most of it. When we did finally
stop for a bit, Merry’s told me more about his family. His mother had been a priestess and his father, a silversmith.
Her sect has quite elaborate ceremonies involving a lot of song and his mother was, in Merry’s opinion, one of
the very best. He learned his love of music there. His father made the silver flute he uses. His elder sister was
training for their mother’s profession, although Merry liked less practical performances. When he’d last seen his
uncle, two aunts and four cousins, they’d been hiking through a mountainous wilderness and were separated in a
storm. I know he’s really distressed by the separation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today, Merry found a spherewalker who’s heading back to his former sphere. He even knows Merry’s
family and is willing to make the effort to seek them out and bring them over. Unfortunately, he’s leaving in less
than a week, and his services are quite dear. Merry thinks this might be his only chance, or at least, his best
chance, at retrieving his family. I suspect that he’s right. We’re just going to have work up an act so incredible,
we’ll be able to raise the money we need.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>6 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We had a light snow overnight. It left the place looking pretty
and clean for a while.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Merry and I have been working all week. I’ve hardly seen Peregrine and the others at all, except
when they’ve stopped by and seen our show. I’ve been having a wonderful time and the crowds are loving it. We’ve
been making fantastic money, for busking. Unfortunately, Merry’s spherewalker’s raised his prices and so we now
have barely more than half of what he needs. There’s no way we’ll make the rest by the time he leaves in two days.
Merry’s even talking about selling his precious flute, but even that won’t be enough to cover the fee. I’m trying
to convince him to wait for another walker, another time, if we can’t find the money, but he says he’s been waiting
too long already.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>7 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">As nothing has come up to change our plans, I did this day send a message to Silverbell so that
she'd know to expect us in eight days time. We will be leaving through the gate to Roundwander right after our
noon-time meal. Peregrine found a different sphere-walker for Merry’s journey. She seems quite reliable and I think
we can trust her. I still can’t believe that Loki helped out Merry like that. He just came and <B>gave</B> Merry
all of the balance he needed to hire his spherewalker. Merry even had enough extra to allow him to support himself
for at least a month. I couldn’t refuse him when he insisted on giving me a portion of today’s take. Adding my
own funds, I bought a silver flute for myself. It is small, a bit more durable than many instruments, and I’ve
become rather fond of it the sound this week.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Maybe my suspicions about Loki were wrong, but I’m still not ready to really trust him. Where
did he get that money anyway? I hadn’t thought he had that much when we’d first arrived.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>15 Emeralds - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It's great to be back at Roundwander with Willow. It's been so long since I've been with family
and so much longer since I've been with her. She was a little confused when I first talked to her again. Apparently
while we'd been gone, Wanderlust had mentioned the talisman I've been wearing on my necklace. She laughed when
I told her how I'd picked that up after Elfhome but before Grassland and pretended it was some link to my past.
Sometimes, I'd almost convinced myself to believe in it, but it was never anything but fantasy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It seems so amazing to actually know where I'm from now. I went to the Library to see if they
had any additional information on Ember's history. It took a bit of searching, since it's so far off, gate-wise.
One of the senior Librarians, Snowfall Scratch, had to personally help me find what they had. The information is
five years old, but that's much more recent than my memories of the place. Ember, they say, is a mountainous sphere
with relatively little fertile ground. Fortunately, they do have great mineral wealth - gold, silver, emeralds,
and other precious metals and gems. It's also rather volcanic near the gates, giving it its name. The records show
that three score of families once controlled separate realms there, and it was then a place of prosperity, wealth
and peace. A century ago, they fell to massive civil war as each House wanted a greater share of that wealth. As
of five years ago, there were only twelve Houses remaining. They even mentioned my father's fall twenty-three years
ago, remarking how unusual it was for all of the houses to band together against any common foe. The chroniclers
didn't know why. They also didn't know of our escape, as they stated that the entire family was obliterated in
that battle. Could Brightstone also have escaped, I wonder? And what would it mean for Misty and me if he did?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>16 Emeralds - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It was foggy all day today, but a bit warmer.<B> </B>I had weapons practice with Wanderlust in
the morning. She found herself a teacher while we were at Remnant and she’s much better than she was. She really
surprised me. I’m going to practice with her more often.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I sought out Snowcat and discovered that she left four days ago to return to the Living Forest.
Considering how she was enjoying Everway and the Library, I thought she'd stay longer, but I suppose a month was
sufficient for her. We have ten weeks before we have to get back to Remnant. That would be just enough time to
get to Living Forest for a visonquest and back, or it could be a great opportunity to track down some real magic
training. Either way, it's a long time for the servants of the Deceiver to be collecting over-sized dragon-scales,
while we're just waiting around. I wish there was a more direct action to take. If that really is Misty, we might
be better able to help her if we get to her in time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">While asking about magic in Strangerside and the Outsider quarter, I came across a man by the
name Oaktall Keeper who has agreed to help me. He is hoping to marry into the Crookstaff family, having great talent
in magic and little interest in guarding. He hasn't found any good prospects for that proposal as of yet. He seems
to be rather talented and has some familiarity with what I want, although his magic is different.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>18 Emeralds - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I’ve been spending some time with Wanderlust and her weaponsmaster. It helps keeps my mind off
of troubles I can do nothing about and I do need some practice in using this schmitar. The technique is a bit different
from that of my short sword. I’ve considered buying a new short sword, but Jackal’s weapon, with its unusual markings,
seems to be tied into these things that have been happening to us, so I’d like to keep it handy. And, if I’m going
to carry it, I might as well be able to use it properly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We had heavy snow in the afternoon, so I didn’t do any busking.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>19 Emeralds - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I’m becoming a familiar face at the Library and I guess it’s a good thing. Today when she saw
me, Snowfall called me over. She’d found a book with some references to magical travel and movement. The descriptions
do sound like Quickfox’s spells, and they seem to make sense of some of my memories of his confused rambles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>21 Emeralds - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Since we haven't been able to find any other leads on this deamon-woman, or her scale-hunting
companions, I've decided to go on to Living Forest to find Snowcat and attempt another visionquest. When I announced
it over the evening meal, Wanderlust decided that she would join me and make her own attempt, also. We'll leave
tomorrow after breakfast. I only hope that we won't be needed here while we're gone. It should be worth the time
if one of us is successful.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>1 City - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">There’s a steady wind blowing across the plains from the lake, making
Battlefield seem much colder than Everway had been. The landscape is the same as always.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>3 City -Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We had a heavy snow overnight. My powers kept Wanderlust and I warm,
and got a fire going. I had hoped the blanket of snow would improve the scenery a bit, but it seems that the magic
of this place prevents the snow from settling on the bodies of the warriors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>15 City - Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at the Living Forest shortly after midday. It seems no cooler than it was when we
were here in Mare. We decided that traveling at night would be too risky as our lights could attract any ogres
that may remain. We made as much distance as we could until nightfall and then settled into a cold camp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>16 City - Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It was a bit chilly in the morning, but warmed up quickly, even in the forest’s shade. Wanderlust
and I hiked all day and have camped near the edge of the forest below the mountain. We saw one of Quietstep's tribesmen
in the morning. He asked why we had returned. When we explained that we were going to see Snowcat, he was quiet
and thoughtful. He told us that Snowcat seemed to have caused his village no harm since her return, but they are
glad that she has chosen to remain in her mountain home. He also said that the ogres which had once plagued the
area are now greatly reduced in number, and his tribe has been able to recover much which had been lost to them.
It’s wonderful to hear of the changes in their fortunes since our departure two months ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>17 City - Cat Mountain, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We’ve arrived at Snowcat's mountain home. The climb was easier than I remembered it, probably
because it was now better known to us. Wanderlust and I are also the best climbers of the group. Alone, we travel
more quickly and with fewer rests. Still, it took most of the day before we crested the peak, and Snowcat was ready
for us as we arrived. She hadn’t been too surprised to see us climbing her mountain, and she had had half a day
to prepare warm food and accommodations for us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Over the evening fire, Wanderlust told Snowcat a little about our encounters with the one-eyed
creature, Portent, and the deamon-woman. I wasn't planning to disclose nearly that much. I'm thankful that I was
able to prevent Wanderlust from mentioning our fears that she might be my sister. Actually, I think most of the
group is pretty much convinced of that, but I <B><I>must</I></B> hold out hope that it's all some sort of mistake.
It's so hard for me to imagine that Morning Mist, my sister Amber, could ever become the creature who fought us
at the cliffs on Roundwander.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Snowcat has conceded our need to push our limits if we're going to dare this undertaking. Before
the close of the day, I try to talk to Snowcat about my last visionquest. Not the specifics of it, but I want to
know if my suspicions on the reasons for my failure then are valid, but she won't even hear my speculations. She
says that everyone's experience is different and what is right for some, may not be so for another. A proper mentor
from a story would tell me either &quot;trust your heart,&quot; or &quot;don't let your heart rule your head,&quot;
or some other such clue, but Snowcat has none. She has never claimed to be a teacher, only a warrior, a protector
of her land.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>18 City - Cat Mountain, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today was the day of fasting, to prepare for the visionquest. I don't know if it will be the
same as before. I hope so, but I suppose it won't be. Last time, I was afraid to use magic while on the visionquest,
partly because of what we learned about using magic on this sphere, but also because I was in the void between
the spheres in the vision. I don't know how magic would work there. And in my hesitation, I let the little winged
ones make my choice for me, and failed. I believe I should have acted on my own. Tried my magic, 'though it wouldn't
have been strong enough, or thrown a rope down. I won't let others make my choices for me a second time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>19 City - Cat Mountain, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The vision was different. I'm going to write down the whole thing so I remember it. This time,
I found myself in a dark round room. There were no windows. The only light came from a burning brazier in the middle
of a magic circle containing glowing runes. In the circle, there was a man in long robes, and two babies laid on
the floor. He chanted and moved in some manner of ceremony, waving his arms over the children, and to the infinite
reaches. Thanks to Willow's information, I now recognized that this was my father, Brightstone, engaging in some
sort of demonic transaction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I didn't know what to do. From last time, I felt that to succeed here, I had to <I>act</I>. But
what action to take? Should I take Willow's role and rescue the babies? They were so much younger than we were
when she saved us. But, even as I thought of this, I realized that there was nothing I <I>could</I> do. I wasn't
really there, just watching.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Then, the flames grew large and a great dragon's head became visible. &quot;I have received the
first promise. Now stand forth and receive your reward,&quot; it said. Lord Brightstone stepped forward and a beam
of light stabbed forth from the dragon's face and pierced Brightstone. He fell to his knees, receiving it, and
then he and the babies disappeared.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I was in the circle then, truly there - not merely observing-, and the dragon was addressing
me. &quot;I have received the second promise. Now stand forth and receive your reward.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; I
told it. I knew this dragon to be evil, or thought I did, and wanted nothing of it. I noticed then, in the distance,
'though the room was small and without doors or windows, the shining figure of a mage. The figure was one of magic
and appeared to be neither female nor male. My vision told me that this was the guardian spirit who had cursed
the sphere, causing all magic to become twisted here, unless the mage passed through this test.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">&quot;You will receive your reward.&quot; The dragon said again. I wondered briefly if the reward
was the increase in ability that I was seeking here, if this would be how I would pass my visionquest. But, no.
If refusing it meant failing, still, I would refuse. &quot;No! I want nothing of you!&quot; I told it. I can't
remember exactly what it said then. Something to the effect that I would receive my reward and be its willing servant,
or I would receive its judgment and become its slave.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">There was nothing to do. I fled from the circle, breaking it with my body and my sword. The blazing
runes disappeared, but the dragonhead did not. It cursed me then, and promised to destroy me. It sent forth a blaze
of heat, hotter than a hundred suns. I froze in fear. I had nothing to protect me. My magic could deflect material
things, but not heat. My powers could protect me from cold, but not this burning. I threw up my hands in a useless
gesture of warding, and, somehow, I didn't burn. The distant mage had drawn near and it stood between me and the
dragon, shielding me. The dragon, brazier, room and all disappeared then, leaving me alone with my rescuer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I thanked her for helping me but she made no comment on that matter. She explained, or maybe
I just knew, that she had been aware of the article we called a dragon scale coming to her world centuries ago.
She'd set up the curse to hinder the demonic foes who would seek it and use its power if they found it. The scale
is gone now and the demons departing. Soon, she will be stepping down from her post.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">She asked me, &quot;Do you understand what happened here?&quot; I told her that I believed that
I had witnessed my father's arcane pledge to the Deceiver, on the lives of my sister and myself. She asked if I
knew the meaning of the second promise. I didn't. I'd read of it on the parchment, but didn't understand it. She
took me then to the site of my first visionquest, again as an observer only. I saw my sister fall, and myself failing,
as I agreed to let the little winged creatures save her. The mage asked me if I understood why I had failed. I
told her that I believed I did. &quot;Was it something you did, or something you didn't do?&quot; &quot;Both,&quot;
I said. I was wrong.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">She told me that once one steps off the path, they are dead and past saving. I think that means
that even if I had used a rope, it wouldn't have saved her, and I probably would have still failed the visionquest.
By letting the winged creatures save her, I'd opened the pathway for the Deceiver and <B>I</B>,<B> I!</B>, had
made the second promise and delivered Misty into the Deceiver's hands. I suppose I should have done nothing and
let her fall, but how could I? And what would my failure now cost all who live among the spheres?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I asked the mage if she could tell me how to stop the Deceiver's plans, to stop she who was once
my sister. She said she didn't know, she only knew that I had to try. I will try. I didn't have to promise that.
It is already my goal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Then I found myself back at Snowcat's practice grounds. An increased sense of power and strength,
and the shining look in Snowcat's eyes told me that I had succeeded. But somehow, I couldn't be glad. We sent a
message to Silverbell that night to tell her the results of the questing and let her know we were on our way back.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>20 City - Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust is pretty downhearted about failing her visionquest. She doesn't talk about what she
faced, and I don't suppose she should. I don't suppose she understands why I am not happier in my success. I am
pleased to have succeeded, but I feel bent under a weight of guilt. I am responsible for this, as much as my father
was. It is not his fault, but <B><I>mine!</I></B> If Morning Mist was dead, and now given new life, that might
explain why her abilities are so different, as well as her manner. But what am I to do about it? How am I, a half-trained
youth, to combat the very foe of Heaven? No, if we can stop my former sister, then we won't have to face the Deceiver.
... Just unknowable numbers of his agents. Oh Lady help me!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I should have asked Snowcat what she knows of the mage I saw in my vision, but I leave under
the weight of new burdens, without questions. We made the bottom of the mountain by nightfall. We should be at
the gate to Battlefield in two more days.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>22 City - Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust and I spent two days traveling through the forest and arrived at the gate just before
sunset. We stopped to eat and will be heading through as soon as we’ve cleaned up again.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>1 Youth - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">It was raining as we stepped through the gate in the morning. Compared
to Living Forest, this rain was much colder, as usual, but at least it was not snow and it stopped after just a
few hours.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>3 Youth - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">At the noon-meal yesterday, two days into Battlefield, Wanderlust asked me why I haven't been
using my magic. I'd been timid about that, for fear that I would seem to be showing off my success where she failed.
She smiled and said that our time and effort would be useless if I didn't use what I'd won. I don't know that she'd
have been as pragmatic a few days ago, but I have started practicing. I've tried using spells to juggle several
cooking utensils and my scimitar in different directions at once, and also levitating our packs. I can carry them
both for almost half a candlemark before the spell wears off, and I can lift Wanderlust for almost as long. I can
levitate myself and actually fly for much longer, when I’m rested.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>4 Youth - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The weather’s been good, and I’ve been able to use my magic to our
benefit. At first, I tried using one flying spell for myself and levitation on Wanderlust several times during
the day, with an hour or two of rest between each. It’s a lot more tiring than I thought it would be, but I’m sure
it will become easier with practice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>5 Youth- Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I tried a different approach for aiding our travels today. Instead
of wearing myself out with great spells, I’ve used the smaller ones. Simple speed and strength spells are much
easier to cast than they had been before the visionquest. Even a great many of them take only a small effort, and
the results are much better than flying had been yesterday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>6 Youth- Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We’ve managed to shorten our travel time by at least half a day.
We will reach the gate well before noon tomorrow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>15 Youth - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Willow, Mach and Loki were waiting for us at the estate when we arrived back at Roundwander mid-morning.
I was relieved to find that they hadn't seen any sign of the red-eyed woman nor heard of any other &quot;scales&quot;
since we were gone. Nor had anyone seemed to come searching for the one hidden here. Thank the Lady!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It was hard to talk to Willow about the visionquest, but she had to know that Misty is really
dead. Or at least that she<I><U> was</U></I>. Now something most evil is happening to her, and it’s all my fault
and I’m as bad as Brightstone was. Willow says I’m not. That our father made his promise to the Deceiver for evil,
for his own gain. My part was an error made in love and ignorance. I didn’t know what I was dealing with, but Brightstone
did. And even all that I did would have been different if Father hadn’t opened the path so long before. I recognize
that differences, but I don’t know that it matters. The result is the same. I robbed her of her rightful death
and sent her into something horrible. I wish I knew if Misty is actually &quot;alive&quot; right now, or not. If
she is, can we rescue her or is she already lost?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I know Willow does believe in me and forgives me, even if I can’t. She gave me some true tokens
of Ember and of Elfhome in recognition of the anniversary of my birthday which passed while I was in the gate here
to Roundwander last week. I don’t remember her ever making any ritual of the anniversary before, but I think she’s
making up for time lost. She wasn’t there for my Turning Day seven years ago. The presents are beautiful. A magnificent
pendant and a ring to replace the imaginary heirloom I’d been carrying these last several years. They each depict
a shining dewdrop resting on a leaf in a circular flourish.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When I went down to the Peacock, I found that Reed was gone and the proprietor was quite angry.
Apparently she and Moonlight had run off together a week ago. They had gotten quite fond of each other, but the
Mothers would not approve of Moonlight socializing with a Stranger with no family. I hadn't thought that the two
of them were actually in love. Either a lot had happened in two months, or they'd just decided to get away so they
could discover if there was love there. Whatever the case, she is gone and Robin is furious. I guess I can manage
well enough with what I can draw on the square. Or not. I don’t need to pay room and board any more. I don't know
how much time I'll have anyway, as I'll be busy trying to develop my new magic skills.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>17 Youth - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I had a revelation in my magic practice today. I was thinking about the blast of heat that the
dragonhead cast at me in my vision, how the guardian-mage had blocked it, and wondering if there was any way I
could have done anything. I remembered a discussion Oaktall and I had found in the library that said that heat
can't exist by itself. Some <I>thing</I> has to be hot or cold, even if it's just air. Air is like water, and is
broken into pieces much smaller than water drops. Solid things like wood and metal are also made of tiny drops.
Quickfox's books had a reference to moving tiny parts of things to make them hot or cold. I think that it would
actually be possible to keep a blast of heat away by using magic on those parts the right way, but it would take
a lot more control and power than I have, or Quickfox had, even.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Still, it's a tremendous concept. Tiny drops of air! And they can be moved! I don't understand
how to make them hot or cold, but I can move things. I tried it with my flute. I used a spell to move air through
it and was actually able to get it to play! With practice, I could levitate it, move the keys, and move the air
at the same time to make it play by itself! It spent most of my magic energy in a candlemark, but so much fun!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It's also interesting to think that my powers so closely match what my magic could be at incredibly
high levels. The magic that can create heat, can produce glowing light, and I can already do both without magic!
Could it be that all magic duplicates powers, or could powers be a form of magic transcended by the Lady straight
into the body?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>18 Youth - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I think I understand the amulet spell now. The one that will allow me to create a talisman to
transmit a lower level spell at a later time. I’d like to make one for Wanderlust, but I don’t have a week’s time
right now. I’m going to gather the materials in case an opportunity comes up later.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I've come up with the mage-name I'd like to use when I've come into my full ability and age.
It came to me when contemplating my visionquest and practicing my magic. It would be wrong to commit it to paper,
but I will hold it in my heart until the time is right.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>19 Youth - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I stopped by to show Sunshine my new &quot;Magic Flute&quot; spell. She loved it! The good news
is that she thinks it’s too good a show for street-busking. The bad news is that my fluting isn’t good enough for
her better posts. But, since I’m leaving again in just a few days, there’s not much time to do anything about it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>21 Youth - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Everyone is anxious to see us off to meet Panther tomorrow. She's supposed to be back by the
first of Goddess and we don't want to miss her. Loki and Mach wanted to leave three days ago to be certain, but
that would have been too soon for Wanderlust and me to be grounded, and we do want to make the journey together.
I stopped by Sunshine’s for a bit. Then went to the blacksmith’s and bought six new throwing knives to bring along,
and built new hiding places in my boots and clothing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Since we're heading off to Remnant tomorrow, I told Wanderlust about my visionquest. Not most
of it, just that Misty is apparently dead, so perhaps we won't be so limited as to how to handle the deamon-Misty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>22 Youth - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Well, we're still in Everway. Loki never turned up in the morning and we spent the day tracking
him down. He's gotten involved in some major scheme and gotten a few people rather upset. Fortunately, none are
of the major Families here, but they're influential enough. This may take a bit of time to untangle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>23 Youth - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">What a mess! We finally got things straightened out without having to involve Silverbell. I'm
sure she would not be pleased if she knew all the details. It was well past sunset when we all got back. Loki wanted
to leave for Remnant right away, and I don't blame him, but we've decided to wait until morning so we're better
rested for the crossing. Now that I’ve <I>seen</I> it, I’m especially wary about entering unprepared.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>3 Goddess - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at Remnant about mid-morning. Panther was supposed to have been back a few days ago,
and fortunately she was a few days late and is still here. Wandering down to docks we spotted her ship almost immediately.
It's not the biggest vessel, by far, but it's a nice sturdy ship. Panther is a young woman who looks elegantly
dramatic in long skirts. She has a tiger on the ship with her. I'm sure she has little trouble with mice in the
cargo hold!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">She tells us that she acquired the parchment at the southernmost trading post some two weeks
sailing away. It came from a fellow named BrownReed who claimed to have found it in a volcanic region on the other
side of the cape. A recent volcanic eruption there had opened up some ancient ruins. BrownReed had gone back in
that direction some time ago and hadn't been heard from since.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Of course, the only thing to do is go there ourselves and investigate. When Panther indicated
that she's always been curious, too, and suggested that she could take us, Wanderlust and Mach immediately began
negotiations for payment. I had to cast my eyes heavenward and sigh. They seem so eager to spend money where none
had been asked for. I had thought that if Panther was going that way anyway because she <U>wanted</U> to, then
maybe she'd just let us come along, but once people start talking of paying it seemed unlikely that she was going
to let us ride for free, after all. But, I was wrong again. Once Wanderlust and Mach took a pause for breath and
let Panther speak her piece, she did say that we could ride without payment, if only we assist with the duties
of the ship. That seems fair enough. She needs a day to supply her ship, so we'll meet her here tomorrow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Since we had most of the day free, I went and looked up my friend Merry. He took me to visit
with his family at the noontime meal. They were quite friendly people and it was great to meet with them. Merry
was most impressed by the magic flute trick. We went down to perform in the square together, using the magic flute
as part of our finale. It went wonderfully, and we pulled more than twice Merry's usual take. I let him keep it
all. It was a great day.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">That evening, I used the crystal to send a message to Silverbell. &quot;Going on two month voyage
seeking source of parchment.&quot; By the time we reach the ruins we should be able to send another message.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>4 Goddess - Southern Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived early in the morning to embark on our journey. It was very foggy, but Panther seemed
to be in high spirits as she showed us to our quarters. Three crewmembers, Robin, Babblebrook, and Firstborn, have
decided to stay in Bizzarre while we're on this journey, so we'll be taking their bunks. Wanderlust and I are sharing
a small cabin with two of her crew, Winterwhite and Peregrine. Mach and Loki are in a much smaller one with Silence.
Silence is not much like his name, he's friendly and jovial, 'though not excessively loud. The remaining crew are
Brightstorm, Meander, Swiftwater, and Ironson and Breeze. Silence says her fullname is SweetBreeze, but only he
is allowed to use it, since they're mates. She won't allow anyone-else.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We weren't even out of sight of the port when Mach started talking about equipping this ship
with a floating device like the one on the airship he devised in Stonedeep. Apparently, he'd purchased a great
deal of silk and lumber in Bizarre for such a purpose. We have heard the tales of pirates, so it seems a reasonable
precaution. He spent the rest of the day making sketches and started into his spellcasting that right after the
evening meal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>11 Goddess - Southern Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We had a light rain all afternoon. It cleared just before sunset.
By that time, we were already far enough out that I could barely see the coastline.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>12 Goddess - Southern Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Travel has been pretty easy, except for Loki. He can't swim and is most nervous to have only
water about him everywhere. He was especially upset during the light storm we hit yesterday. I swear he thought
we were going to sink! Poor fellow. What time Mach hasn't spent working, he's been designing &quot;improvements&quot;
for the ship. Some, Panther has let him implement. Wanderlust and I have just been pitching in where we're asked.
Sailing a ship is hard physical work, but it's not that hard to figure out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>15 Goddess - Southern Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Light rain in evening</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>16 Goddess - Southern Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Short rain shower in the afternoon</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>17 Goddess - Southern Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">This afternoon, we were just one day away from the trading post when Winter spotted pirates coming
from the North. They, in a light ship, were traveling much faster than we could manage. Mach seemed almost pleased
to be able to use his contraption again. It took almost half a candle mark to tie up all the lines and then I began
to help fill the bladder with hot air. I created a very hot sphere of heat about a foot in diameter in front of
me, and moved air through it and up into the container. Mach also lit a fire in a drum to create another supply
of rising hot air. It seemed to take a exceptionally long time to fill. The crew was rather unnerved by the process,
but land was a day away and the pirates would overtake us in less than an hour. Loki especially asked many uneasy
questions. He wasn't with us when Mach did this trick in Stonedeep. This ship is a bit bigger and probably a lot
heavier, not being designed to fly, but I was confident it would work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">In time, the ship did indeed begin to rise. The pirates came up close, seeming quite baffled.
Loki was almost cocky then, watching them puzzle us out. We couldn't fight directly from up here, so he wanted
to bombard them. He chose Mach's drum of burning fuel. It seemed like an excellent choice. I promised to use my
magic to guide the missile into the ship's sails. That should have really stopped them cold. Unfortunately, I found
myself unable to complete this plan. I could push the burning missile only as far as the pirates' deck. Filling
the balloon had taken more out of my magic reserves than I had thought. Still, it did the trick. The pirates backed
off, leaving us to float off on our own.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">This turned out to be a different sort of problem. The wind was starting to really pick up and
Mach had neglected to construct any sort of steering mechanism. The sails could give us motion, but without the
water to act against the keel, we can only move directly along with the wind. Quickly, we deflated the air bladder.
We came down gently enough, but landed directly on a reef. We heard a very solid crack, but there wasn't a lot
of water coming in. Panther and her crew did some minor repairs. Fortunately, we crashed at low tide, and in a
few hours we will be free and made our way to the southernmost trading post by nightfall.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>18 Goddess - Southernmost Trading Post, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at the trading post in the early afternoon. Panther was able to evaluate the damage
done to the ship and determined that we should be able to leave in a day's time. We went to arrange for the provisions
for the next leg of our trip. We also asked about Brownreed and collected some tales. Everyone seemed to be aware
of his disappearance and nobody wanted to sail off after him. There was a lot of talk in the marketplace about
seamonsters, but there wasn't anything of supporting evidence. It seems to me more likely that he was trapped by
some volcanic activity while exploring the ruins.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>19 Goddess - Southernmost Trading Post, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Since Panther and her crew were doing the structural work, Wanderlust, Loki and I went to gather
the provisions for the next leg of our trip. Mach stayed with the ship and worked on creating fins and a propeller
for the ship so that we'd be better able to steer if flying became needed again.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>20 Goddess - Western Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We are off again. Today, we have rounded the cape at the Southernmost Trading Post and are heading
north through the Western sea toward the firemountains. It drizzled in the late morning, but otherwise the day
was clear and warm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>24 Goddess- Emerald Reef, Bright Oceans, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I'm writing today’s journal entry in a very queer manner in a very strange place. We are underwater!
Late last night when most of us were asleep, we were awakened by a great thump as the ship lurched violently. Everyone
was up in moments. We raced down into the hold where we found four or five incredibly ugly creatures coming up
through a hole in the hull. They were built like a boar adapted to water, only bigger, faster, black, slippery
and wet. We later find out they are called &quot;dark ones.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When they started coming in a second breach, it was clear we would sink soon if we didn't do
something. Mach and I worked on inflating the air bladder as quickly as we could. We hoped to raise the ship simultaneous
taking us out of the creatures grip, and draining the water from the vessel. Soon it became clear that the balloon
was filling far too slowing to combat the increasing number of holes. Not to mention how much heavier the ship
was becoming with all the water we were taking on board. We decided to abandon ship. Mach went about untying the
lines from the ship, and creating loops for the crew to hang on to as the balloon took off. Loki and Wanderlust
were completely cut off from the edges of the ship where the only available rescue was. I figured I could get them
each a rope when the time came, but at the moment I was still quite busy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Unfortunately, the ship was sinking faster than we could implement this plan, either. Then the
sea began churning, and it seemed to blossom with black blood. A great number of Merfolk appeared and joined in
the attack on the creatures. The tide of battle was turning, but the ship was going under. We abandoned ship, leaping
for the lifeboats. Loki missed, and sank below the water, along with Breeze and Meander.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">A few moments later when the fighting was mostly under control, one of the merfolk came to our
lifeboat and <I>apologized</I>! He said his people had been trying to keep these black creatures out of the shipping
lanes but this swarm had managed to slip through. We asked after Loki and the crew and he told us that they'd all
been given amulets that allowed them to breathe underwater, and they were safe. He supplied us all in this manner,
promising that his people would repair Panther's ship for her. We swamped the lifeboats, and the merfolk towed
us below water to his city, &quot;Emerald Reef,&quot; which is capital of their queendom, &quot;Bright Ocean.&quot;
Even The Lady and Swiftwing are accommodated this way, although the tiger seems to have an especially hard time
adapting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Queen White Pearl told us that these creatures have been becoming increasingly aggressive recently.
The merfolk feel that they are not native to the sphere but only appeared after the Great Cataclysm. At that time,
a few hundred years ago, a mage came to their sphere who knew that this great thing would fall from the sky and
swamp the world. He threw several hundred surface dwellers into the ocean, turning them into merfolk as he did
so. Almost everyone on the surface died, but the merfolk survived. The merfolk don't heed surface activities much,
but it seems that the Dark One increases have coincided with the increased volcanic activity above that revealed
the ruins that BrownReed found. Interesting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">As we toured the city, we came across a great underwater ship made of metal. We couldn't come
aboard, but it looked quite impressive. The city here is built a bit upside down, compared to what we know. All
the living quarters, and entertaining is done on the upper stories where there's better access for swimmers. The
levels closer to the ocean floor are the private sleeping areas. The food here is interesting. I expected it all
to be raw, but they cook their clams and other items on hot volcanic beds that are everywhere.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It’s now been a month since we left Everway so I could send a quick message to Silverbell about
our progress and still have time to send another after we get to the ruins. If we get to the ruins. I think I’ll
wait to see what happens here below.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>25 Goddess - Emerald Reef, Bright Oceans, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The Queen told us a bit more about the Cataclysm and how the Oceans were changed and the merfolk
came to be. Something about her description today made me ask for more detail. Her great mage seems to look surprisingly
like the white-haired &quot;friend&quot; who visited me at Greyteir's in Everway, and in my dreams. Could he have
been around hundreds of years ago? If he was one of my race, that would be conceivable, or if he'd used magic to
extend his life, or both. Maybe he is a dragon. Maybe he really was the mage who made the One-Eyed Ones, the Accursed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I asked about the music and visited with a few musicians. They use mostly percussion, but the
effects are quite unique. They get different tones from different sizes and types of shells and the water conduct
it magnificently.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>26 Goddess -Emerald Reef, Bright Oceans, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Mach asked for permission to see the strange underwater ship and we all were able to get on board.
It's a heavy enclosed 20-person vessel that moves a few yards above the ocean floor, making it easy to go deeper,
but rather harder to rise. White Pearl told us that it was created by an ancient craftswoman/mage and they are
unable to make another one. They are however planning to take it on an excursion to the south to investigate the
source of the dark ones. Mach was able to create drawings of the ship with great detail, including instructions
from which a new ship might be created.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>27 Goddess - Emerald Reef, Bright Oceans, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The merfolk are planning to launch their expedition tomorrow, but it seems that we are going
to miss it. They have gotten Panther's ship repaired and floated to the surface. We've been reprovisioned with
seaweed, clams, fish, and other such merfolk food and we're ready to proceed to BrownReed's ruins. I hope the rest
of the trip is less eventful. The volcanoes will be more than enough of a challenge, I’m sure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>3 Stallion - Western Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We had a weird storm today. It was bright and sunny and most pleasant when suddenly Panther announced
that a storm was coming. She had the crew running to prepare and sent us, Wanderlust, Loki, Mach and I, down below
to keep out of the way. It was a wild storm, and it disappeared as quickly as it came. Panther thinks it was weird,
too. She says she’s never seen one come up and move off so quickly. Loki just keeps repeating that it would be
too much against the odds for the same ship to sink twice in one voyage. I guess that’s so.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Since our diversion with the Merfolk, we haven’t reached the ruins yet. I should message Silverbell
so she doesn’t wonder about us, but I’ve decided to wait until we see what might be ahead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>6 Stallion - Western Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We had thunderstorms and heavy rain all day. Loki’s miserable with
the rocking of the boat. He seems terrified that we’ll sink and we don’t have the Merfolk to protect us here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>8 Stallion - Western Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today we had a the third sudden storm this week! Loki suggested that it might have something
to do with the volcanoes, and Panther seems to agree. It does make some sense. All those warm updrafts have to
play havoc with any regular weather patterns. We’re getting close to that land, too. Today, after sunset, we could
see red glow over the horizon. It must be the volcanoes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>9 Stallion - Western Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Late in the afternoon, we sighted land, and sailed past miles of active volcanoes. One was even
sending forth a slow stream of glowing lava as we watched. Everywhere there was steam coming up from cracks and
red lava in streams or slowly cooling beds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>10 Stallion - EarthScar, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I borrowed a light from Wanderlust to write with tonight. I get the idea that using magic isn’t
such a good idea right now. We’re being detained in a cave quite near to the ruins. I’m most excited about tomorrow.
I’m finally going to be able to use my magic in a way that will really make a difference! I can’t wait to see how
Caldera and his people respond.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Panther spotted the ruins late in the morning with her spy-glass and the ship arrived at about
noon. Breeze and Meander took a dingy out to scout the harbor and determined that it was filled with lava formations
and unfit for the ship. So Loki, Wanderlust, Panther and I took the dingy in. On the beach, there was a small monolith
with a skull inside. Loki examined it and determined it was exceedingly old. We followed some footprints for a
while, but chose to head straight for the ruins instead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">On the way we were stopped by Redstone and Ash, two of the locals who insisted on bringing us
to see their chief, Caldera, and his Shaman, Bonespeaker. The tribe is all pretty convinced that we’re &quot;evil
spirits,&quot; since we’re not from here, and &quot;here&quot; is the only place with people, or so they believe.
So naturally, they’ve had us thrown in this cave until morning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Fortunately, we’re not alone. Wildfire came by to visit with us. She insisted that we tell her
where we were really from. We tried again, leaving out mention of the gates and talking only about our trip around
the cape. We tried to explain to her about boats, but she’s mystified by the concept. They don’t even know &quot;wood!&quot;
She carries Brownreed’s sword, ‘though she doesn’t know how to use it. She had captured him and kept the instrument
after he and his crew were consumed in the &quot;test.&quot; Apparently, to prove you’re a person, you have to
walk across a special bed of lava. Loki’s really freaked by this, but I’m certain we can pass this with some clever
levitation. Wildfire was impressed by my confidence and says we should insist on taking this test tomorrow. Maybe
when we pass, they’ll be more co-operative. I don’t expect help up at the ruins, since that’s a sacred place guarded
by some great beast, but hopefully, we can get some information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">This will take my strongest spells, spells which I couldn’t even
cast a year ago. But now, having passed Snowcat’s visionquest, and trained with Oaktall and Whitefeather, I’m confident
in what I can do. I’m so looking forward to it. I’d best stop here and get to my rest. Tomorrow’s feat will require
all my resources to assure success.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>11 Stallion - EarthScar, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We’re camping in a cave on top of a mountain tonight. Wildfire says it should stay stable until
morning. I hope she’s right.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It took all morning to get there, but the test was actually rather fun. Wildfire demonstrated
it first, and I saw that it was all a trick. The Shaman, Bonespeaker, performed a little invocation and casts his
gems in the dirt for divination. Then at the chief’s signal, a bridge came up from the lava providing a path to
the other side. Of course, he didn’t give that signal for us, but I was able to effect a safe passage easily with
my magic. The chief was amazed at first, and then angry, but he had to admit that I passed the test. We all did,
after I levitated Wanderlust, Panther, and Loki across, each in turn.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wildfire has become our fast companion. She was impressed at our passage of the test, having
noticed that the lava didn’t &quot;welcome&quot; us, as it did her people. Loki told her that the bridge was a
trick and that her chief was the one who decided who passed. I feared she might be distressed by that, but she
said she’d suspected something of the sort.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We decided that staying in the village again could be unhealthy for us, now that the chief’s
authority has been threatened. When the &quot;guardian,&quot; actually a great red dragon, flew by overhead, we
ran off in a different direction, toward the ruins, rather than towards the village. Wildfire came with us, and
I’m so pleased.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We found a great metal flying ship crashed in the mountains. Wildfire said that there had been
stories of great metal birds, but she had no idea that they could be ships, or that people could be in them. We
did find the body of a pilot. He wore a medallion that looked like a sun. The metal of the ship could be a great
boon to her people, but Wildfire says they won’t know how to use it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>12 Stallion - Western Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We’re safe back on Panther’s ship now, thank the Lady! The going was really rough to the ruins,
and it took almost until noon to get there. The dragon was out sunning itself on a rock in front of the cave entrance.
Loki decided that he was the sneakiest and he could get past the dragon best. He managed all right, but I didn’t
really think we could trust this to him. I came around the side and levitated up the cliff-face and into the cave
that way. We found a fantastic library or office area. I sent a message down to Wanderlust and levitated her up,
too. Together, we took out six books, written in Draconic. I hope some of them are helpful. There was also some
sort of store-room filled with large art objects that we really couldn’t take. I did check everything with my touchstone.
It seemed to glow slightly when near the books, but none of the assorted items appeared to be magical.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki woke the dragon up as he left the cave. Wanderlust and I were already safe on the ground.
He hid, and we all escaped the dragon’s searching. He spoke the Common Tongue, fretting fearfully that he was going
to &quot;get it&quot; for losing the books we took. It made me wish that we could have talked to him. But, I’m
sure he would not be interested in helping us defeat the re-incarnation of the Deceiver. He buried the entrance
to the cave and sealed it with fire.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We made it to the ship with only a few close calls from the dragon search pattern. Wildfire is
full of questions. She’s figured out that I used flying to get across the lava. At first, she thought we all could
fly, but we’ve sorted that one out. She asks about everything. Our magic, powers, the boat, the people. It’s great
fun to watch her learning. She does find it hard to believe most of what we told her about other peoples, and other
spheres, but the merfolk interest her greatly, and Loki is trying to teach her to use Brownreed’s sword.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It is most certainly time to send Silverbell an update on our journey. I used the crystal to
send, &quot;Found Draconic books and two new realms. Returning five weeks.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>13 Stallion – Western Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Breeze and Meander have taken a particular interest in our new companion.
They are trying to teach her to sail. She’s quite unconfortable with the sea, and so far is unable to see the winds
on the waves. But she’s strong, and she delights in proving her muscle when trimming the sails.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>19 Stallion - Western Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I knew our good weather fortune couldn’t last. We had a great storm
this evening and had to pull down all the sails to prevent the winds from capsizing the ship. Three of the sails
were torn, one of them quite badly. Panther says the whole sails that remain will be sufficient for the short term.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Wildfire is doing well under the tutelage of Breeze and Meander.
She’s still having difficulty with the concept of boyancy, but takes direction well and has become an assest to
the crew. Her training with Loki hasn’t gone quite so well. It’s difficult to learn to use a sword while on shifting
shipdeck. She’s nearly injured herself quite badly on a few occassions. I’m sure she would do better if training
on dry land.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>20 Stalllion – Western Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We spent most of the day repairing the three damaged sails. Wildfire
scorned this activity at first, as a task for children. Still, she had some experience with it and after she saw
Silence and Ironson take to the chore, she tried it, too. The sails were heavy with seawater, and hard to work
with, but we were finished by nightfall.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>25 Stallion - Emerald Reef, Bright Oceans, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We were just two days from the trading post when we were hailed by the Merfolk again. Queen WhitePearl
wanted to speak with us again. Mach decided to stay with Panther and her crew above water, but Wildfire, apparently
fearless dispite all the world-shattering changes she’s just undergone, decided to come along with Loki, Wanderlust
and me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When we got to Emerald Reef, we found out that WhitePearl wants us to go on an expedition for
her. When the warship came back, it was badly damaged from encounters with terrible numbers of these Dark Ones.
The crew also had a strange tale to tell. They had located a gate that came up in a riverbed in a place called
the Kingdom of 10,000 Islands inhabited by an oriental culture. The merfolk who went through was confined to the
river, but they did have some conversation with a person who seemed to be a chieftain. It’s three days away and
marked with a circle of stones. A merfolk by the name of Swiftbrook is guarding it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Of course, Loki didn’t want to go, but I was more than interested. The merfolk are going to give
us talismans that will work for one month, and a guard will wait at the gate for us for that long. It’s a three
day gate, plus the three days to get there or back, leaves us sixteen days to investigate the area. We sent word
to Panther and asked that she send one of the books from the dragon’s cave in case these people are able to help
in that regard, too.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>26 Stallion - Bright Oceans, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The messengers came back with the book and we’re on our way to the gate now. Wildfire’s adjusting
exceedingly well. It’s so much fun to be with her. Everything is so new to her, it’s like being with a child. I’m
pretty impressed by the city still myself, but it’s so much more amazing through her eyes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>28 Stallion - Bright Oceans, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at the gate at just past noon. No point in waiting, since we do have a time limit.
We’ll be heading across right after the noon-time meal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><BR>
<B>3 Tortoise - Ten Thousand Islands</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">This is quite a wondrous sphere. There’s something different about the quality of the light that’s
like Elfhome, but without the slightly magical tingle. The people are interesting, too, much as Blackfin described.
They’re so much more open and friendly than Wildfire’s tribe, dispite the fact that they seem to be under siege.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Let’s start from the beginning. We made it through the gate in mid-morning, arriving in a mile
wide river about knee-deep. This arrival must have been terrifying for the merfolk when they first discovered it.
Using Blackshark’s name, we were able to convince the locals that we were allies with the merfolk. (Maybe one of
them should have come with us. Too late for that thought now.) We were taken to the home of chief Starchaser. They
live in low houses built in trees a body-length or two above the water, on stilts. We must be in a floodplain.
Wildfire is in love with the place. So much wood! And cool water and plants. She and the others seem to feel that
we are quite high up indeed in the tree-homes, but compared to Elfhome, these are quite low. Wildfire experienced
another shock when she saw the gems we are carrying as currency, and all the gems here. Apparently only her Shaman
could handle them in her home, calling them &quot;God’s bones.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We explained to Starchaser that the other side of the gate is in fact a water-world, three leagues
below the surface and under too much pressure for them to chance to go through themselves dispite our arrival.
Loki told him that we survived there only because we were protected by a sympathetic magic produced by a group
of merfolk in concert, making it clear that a hostile force would be unprotected and crushed instantly. A useful
lie, should these folks prove unfriendly. We’ve hidden our talismans in our clothing. Loki explained that we needed
to return within a week. We’ll see if they attempt to hold us past that time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Starchaser showed us a map of his sphere, which seems to be almost completely islands. Only three
land masses even approach the size of continents. Those, he says, were overtaken by creatures that seem to be the
same ogres which attacked Wanderlust’s people, and harried the tribes in the living forest. They’ve been there
for a thousand years or more, having pushed Starchaser’s tribes to the islands. The tribes are isolated and alone,
and Starchaser is thrilled to be on the island with the gate. I can see him counting up the influence he might
be able to get from it. Right now however, his big problem is the ogres. They seem to be launching a new offensive,
invading the islands. They’ve attacked five small islands called the five turtles. These are close enough to be
seen from our tree-house.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">A young fellow from Starchaser’s household, but not of this sphere, guided us to our quarters
for the night. We are being guarded, but I think we did well. The fellow’s name is Peregrine Firebird, a child
of only 16 years who arrived a few weeks ago, but not through a gate. This seems most interesting, but there’s
no time to talk of it yet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>3 Tortoise</B> - appendium</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">My watch is nearly over now, I’ve got to write this down before it’s time to rouse Wildfire.
I was here, just watching and waiting and suddenly, I noticed that there was someone on the balcony. I didn’t hear
him arrive, but somehow he’d gotten past the guards below.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I didn’t feel threatened, only curious. I went out to join him and it was the wizard. The tall,
white-haired, glow-eyed, black-cloaked wizard who’d haunted my dreams and given me the parchment. It made the hairs
stand up on the back of my neck just to see him. I asked his name and he told me that I could call him Umbra. The
Shadow. It seems to fit, but somehow I guess that he wore a brighter name at some point. When I asked, he told
me that he was, indeed, the one who had created the Merfolk, as he could see the Cataclysm approaching. He mourned
the many he could not save. He told me his kind had all but forgotten this sphere until my arrival here. How is
it that he’s tracking me, I wondered, but I didn’t ask. He wants me to help these people. I really want to, but
I don’t know how. I hope I will be able to figure it out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">During our conversation, Loki woke up and came stumbling out. Umbra waved at him and Loki fell
instantly into a deep sleep and we were alone again. He’s such an amazing creature. I still don’t know what to
think about him. Could he be a dragon in human form? Or, something older than that? What do I do with this knowledge
about the merfolk and his power? Would Wanderlust even believe me? And how can we help these people in their battle
against the ogres? Somehow, I don’t think I’ll be getting much sleep tonight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>4 Tortoise - Ten Thousand Islands</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I feel that we’ve made very little progress here. We’ve seen that the people here have fantastic
wood-working skills, and metal-work. They’re ancestor worshipers who live almost entirely on fish and the occasional
crocodile. They have barges that go out to clear out excess populations. The merfolk would probably be willing
to trade for the woodwork, metals or even new and different fishes. Starchaser’s people could use BrightPearl’s
warship technology and deep-water cuisine. Obviously, the Merfolk themselves are too busy with their Dark Ones
to help fight the ogres here, and these people are obviously too occupied to offer WhitePearl any fighting forces.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We did learn a bit more about our guide. He’s an orphan, skilled in herbs. He’d encountered a
strange metal beast with seven heads which somehow sent him here without a gate. Strange how much travel we’ve
been learning about lately that doesn’t use conventional gates, when everyone says that the <U>only</U> possible
travel between spheres is through gates. There’s the non-gate that stole me and Misty from Elfhome, the Stoneflat,
and now this machine-beast. Most curious.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>5 Tortoise - Ten Thousand Islands</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I’m quite disappointed. I’ve tried to convince the group to stay and do something to help these
people. Even if Umbra hadn’t suggested it, I’d have wanted to. I feel so useless. I want to <B>do</B> something.
Anything. Endless negotiating just isn’t my style. Loki feels that we have helped them as much as we should be
expected to, just by arranging for them to have access to the Merfolk’s magic, but I’m not happy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>6 Tortoise - Ten Thousand Islands</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I’m feeling quite downhearted now and I don’t feel like talking to anyone, so I’ve stopped to
write a minute before we head back to BrightOceans. I really am disappointed in this visit. Not only have we neglected
to actively help these fine people against the ogres, but Wildfire has decided to stay here when we go. I’ve only
known her a few weeks, and her background and outlook are so different, still, I feel like I’m losing someone who
could have been a sister. I hope we will have reason to return here someday. If Silverbell doesn’t ask for more
information from this place, then I will be sure to come by myself onetime, so see how Wildfire and her new people
are faring. I understand her fascination here. All the trees, wood, gems and attitudes like she’s never known.
I was hoping to see her reaction to Everway, but maybe this is a better place for her. It is quite different, but
she’s proven to be quite adaptable so far, so I think she’ll do well.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Young Firebird has elected to come with us, and since Wildfire is staying, we can accommodate
him with the talisman she was using. Firebird and Loki have not been getting along. Of course, I’ve never been
fond of Loki myself, so I’m rooting for the kid.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The one good thing that came from this trip would have to be my short conversation with Umbra.
It’s left me with many more questions than before, but it gives me with hopes that I’ll see him again sometime
and maybe find a few more answers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>9 Tortoise - Bright Oceans, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We’re back in Bright Oceans and on our way to Emerald Reef. Now,
it’s Firebird, not Wildfire, who’s amazed at our companions and method of travel. He was pretty unnerved at first,
kept trying to hold his breath, but he’s taken to it well enough now. I</FONT><FONT SIZE="2"> wish Wildfire were
still here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>11 Tortoise - Bright Oceans, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The further we move away, the more I regret leaving Ten Thousand Islands. I think we should have
stayed, and not just because Umbra said we should help. I’m surprised that Wanderlust didn’t want to stay, too.
Afterall, these ogres, or the power behind them, are responsible for the fall of her home realm. I wish I had stayed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>12 Tortoise - Emerald Reef, Bright Oceans, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived back at the palace in the early morning. Queen WhitePearl was most happy with our
news. If she’s happy and Starchaser’s happy, I guess we did help them, but I still feel that we didn’t do enough.
The Merfolk have sent word to Panther and Mach that we’ve arrived early and invited everyone to a victory party
tomorrow night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I haven’t told her about Umbra yet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>13 Tortoise - Emerald Reef, Bright Oceans, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today was a blur of party preparations and then the party. I tried to talk to Queen WhitePearl
about the truth of the legends of the origins of her people. I wasn’t sure how it would be received, so I approached
it tangentially. I guess that was a mistake. WhitePearl was interested, but too busy to listen to vague information.
I wasn’t able to catch her alone again to tell her more straight out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I did send a new message to Silverbell. &quot;Located gate to lost sphere. Ogres. Will return

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>14 Tortoise - Western Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We’re back on the ship. It was the first time Firebird had ever traveled by over-sea boat and
he got a bit sea-sick. Poor kid. He did manage to give Loki a bit of a come-upance. Loki had been lording over
the child, waving his cigar around, and Firebird made it burst into flames in his hands. Apparently the kid has
some unusual skills. I wonder if he’ll stick around.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>15 Tortoise - Southernmost Trading Post, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We had some light ran overnight, but clear sailing in the morning. By noon, we arrived back at
the Southernmost trading post and have stopped for a brief rest before continuing east. I’ve been composing two
songs for Merry when I see him. Both about the Merfolk. The first is about the battle we’d had with the black slug
creatures and how the Merfolk came to help. The second is about the city, Emerald Reef. We weren’t told that we
could tell the other inhabitants of Remnant about them, so I’ve cast the tales as fiction, exaggerating several
parts to further that impression. I hope Merry likes them. I’m thinking about writing one about the creation of
the Merfolk, but I’m not sure what to say. I’ll try to stick to the action and make it a fast-paced dance piece.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Heavy rain overnight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>7 Wyrm - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We had great winds and arrived back in Bizzarre a bit early, but then, I thought we’d be staying
a night at the trading post so my expectations were off by a bit. We paid Panther a hefty sum beyond what we’d
originally commissioned her for and parted ways. I know she’d been hoping for a share of our bounty, but there
wasn’t any treasure and we couldn’t give her any of the books.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It’s late in the evening and nobody wants to pay for a night at the Inn. They want to leave immediately
so there’s no time to spend tracking down Merry. I left the songs in a package for him at the Inn. I wish I could
see his reaction to them. Oh well. Looks like we’ll be arriving a bit earlier than I’d guessed, but it’s too soon
to send word to Silverbell. I guess she’ll know when we get there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Firebird wants to stay and explore this area, too, but he’s even
more intrigued by what we’ve told him of Everway and the Library of all Worlds. Maybe he’ll be able to find a path
to hi</FONT><FONT SIZE="2">s home there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>14 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It was almost midnight when we arrived, so we just got ourselves back to the keep and are about
to collapse. Most of us, anyway. Loki and Firebird somehow didn’t arrive with the rest of us. Willow said she’d
send a message to Lady Silverbell to inform her of our arrival. I’m heading straight to bed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>15 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Silverbell arrived just after breakfast. Loki had been out drinking all night and nearly missed
the conference. He also announced that he’s broke again already. Wanderlust actually gave him a gem with which
to buy new clothes. He looks better, but I wouldn’t have done it. I wouldn’t give him enough to buy a mug of ale.
Peregrine Firebird has also disappeared. Probably out exploring. He does seem to be a wanderer, as his given name
suggests. I hope he can handle a city this big.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We told Silverbell all about what had happened and she gave us obvious instructions to take the
books to the Library of All Worlds to get a translation. When we got to the Library, Snowfall wasn’t there but
we found Whitequill Scratch. He was most excited about the books, telling us that they were written in Draconic,
which of course, we knew. He couldn’t translate, but he took us to his expert in Draconic who is here temporarily.
The expert is a quite small (a bit less than twice my height) dragon named &quot;Bookwyrm.&quot; Bookwyrm is extremely
excited about the journals. All the books are thousands of years old and have an enchantment to keep them from
deteriorating.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki told the dragon that after translating all six books, she could keep the five that look
like ordinary Ledgers. It seems like a fair deal to me, but then, these books belong to Lady Silverbell and are
not really ours to deal away. We decide to take three shifts a day, sitting with Bookwyrm while he translates.
This way we can keep an eye on the books, and we won’t miss out on any important information. I’m taking the morning
watches, switching my weapons practice to afternoon. Bookwyrm is satisfied with this arrangement, too, as she’s
aware of the Red-Haired deamoness who came in and tore the other Draconic parchment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">So far, Bookwyrm has translated a fair portion of the first journal. It’s written by a dragon
in Lightbringer’s forces during the rebellion against the Gods. This was the first I’d learned of the First Dragon’s
name. The journal tells of how the rebel dragon forces first came to Remnant after a major defeat on some other
Sphere. A Sphere they destroyed entirely, so that it no longer even exists. That means there must be a gap in the
line of gates in that direction. An entire branch of spheres entirely cut off from the rest more than five thousand
years ago. Lady knows what could be there. I wonder if any of these &quot;non-gates&quot; could be bridging that
gap.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The legends say that the dragons were created to assist in the creation of the Heavens and the
spheres, but Lightbringer had the ability to &quot;reverse the symphony of Creation.&quot; Bookwyrm thinks this
means that Lightbringer could destroy not only spheres, but moons, and stars and the heavenly wanderers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">In town, we’ve also learned that the red-haired deamon who may have once been Amber, has been
terrorizing the place, although she hasn’t been around in recent weeks. I talked to Willow about this deamon, but
she still has no information. She hasn’t seen the creature, who seems to be avoiding the Outsider Quarter. I asked
her again about the mage, Umbra, and she tried to do a Tarot reading on him. When she reached for a card, the whole
deck scattered. She says this is a sign that we are asking something that shouldn’t be asked, but I really need
to know more of this person. He’s been watching me all my life, can follow me to spheres he’s never visited. I
need to know. I used to think he might be a dragon in human form, but now I’m not so sure. He was there, a human
mage, at the time of the Cataclysm on Remnant 5463 years ago. Would a dragon have a reason to appear to be a human
before the Cataclysm?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>16 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I’d meant to track down a magic teacher by now, but we’ve been quite occupied with the translations
of the books. I spend the mornings with Bookwyrm, trying quite hard not to pester him too much for him to do his
work. His stories are so interesting! I have managed to occupy myself with some of the Library’s other offerings.
Tales of magic, or music, or Elfhome. There are very few of the last, but then I have Willow to supply those. I
think I’ll start to record her stories for the Library. I wonder how much they would pay for them. Willow says
I should see if Silverbell’s House would pay anything for my songs, but I don’t think I want to ask yet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I’ve restarted weapons practice in the afternoon. Wanderlust is in the Library at that hour,
so I don’t have her to spar with, but I’ve found a few other willing partners. Still my practice sessions are never
more than a two candlemarks long, often less. And much of that is with the bow or throwing knives. I haven’t developed
the stamina for prolonged sword-fighting, but I am mastering some of the finer points of working with the scimitar
I got from Jackal. The distance weapons are more fun. I may not be the best in the land, but I do fancy myself
quite a fair markswoman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I went to find Sunshine Bard after practice today, but she’s out of town. Her assistant, Song,
believes she’ll be back tomorrow. I’ll ask for her again then. Song recognized me as Reed’s former partner and
warned me not to ask after the drummer when I see Sunny. Apparently, Reed and Moonlight haven’t been seen in months.
Both Sunshine and the Mothers are still furious. I thanked him for the warning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">In the late afternoon and evening, Loki’s with Bookwyrm. I don’t know why I still don’t trust
him. Occasionally, there are times when I find myself liking his stories and such, but his overall demeanor is
still bothersome. I’ve taken to staying near the library when he’s there, and being on-hand to watch when he’s
leaving to make sure he’s not carrying anything off. I stopped in today in the middle of his shift to see what
he was doing, and found him staring out the windows, practically napping. Some guard! Still, I wish I could keep
a better watch on him. If Misty were here (and she were still Misty) she’d be able to find a spell to keep his
actions under observation. At least, I think she could. But then, she’s not here, and that’s the problem, isn’t
it?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>17 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Sunny was in today and she was really glad to see me. Apparently, she’d been waiting for my return
as she has big plans for my &quot;magic flute&quot; act. When I told her that I’d probably be heading back to Remnant
soon, she was disappointed. Still, she’s set me teach beginning lute to some of the Outlander and Stranger children
in exchange for advanced flute lessons from Fortune. It was so nice to spend time in a house of music. Fortune
loves the sound of my silver flute, and I love the challenge of playing with her. She’s a lot more practiced than
I am, but I think I’m already picking up on some new techniques.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>18 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I had a great day today. Nothing much new happened. A morning with Bookwyrm and the library,
a little weapons practice, and music. I’m still checking on Loki during the evening, and still nothing seems amiss
there. We had a light rain all afternoon, that everyone seems to be complaining about, but it’s making me feel
so energetic and happy. All is the same, but it was just a great day.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>19 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We were talking about names today and Fortune told me that her full name is &quot;Bitter Fortune.&quot;
Her parents had wanted a girl very much and had suffered many miscarriages and four boys before she was born. But,
her mother died giving birth to her, so her family named her Bitter Fortune. I think Fortune suits her much better.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>20 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I can’t believe this hadn’t occurred to me before. The Merfolk legends about the creation of
their race specify only a &quot;mage.&quot; That doesn’t mean it has to have been human. I guess it could have
been a dragon-mage. Could dragon folk have been so common in Remnant that there was no need to mention that the
mage in the story was a dragon, and then, since it wasn’t mentioned, people forgot? Umbra still could be a dragon.
Or not. Will I ever be able to know?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>21 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><U><I>Valor</I> </U>is here. From Bonekeep! The Lady knows how she managed it. She’s horribly
wounded, nearly dead, but still living. She’s been unaware since collapsing on her arrival in Everway, calling
the names of Wanderlust, Lightfoot and Mach as she stumbled through the gate from Sweetwater. I pray the Lady helps
her recover so we can learn what brought her to this sad state.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We received word of her arrival while we were in the Library, going over the last of Bookwyrm’s
translation of the two Journals. We were told that there was a crisis at Silverbell’s manorhouse. My fear had been
that we’d find the place a shambles, the scale gone. The building was sound, but Valor’s arrival has left us all
in confusion. Lightfoot, and I have been taking turns sitting by her bedside, waiting for her recovery. I wanted
Wanderlust to use her magic to help Valor recover, but Wanderlust says that the injuries are too serious for her
magic to affect. She has been able to aid in easing some of more minor bruises on the warrior’s face, and to lessen
her pain to a small degree, but that’s all she can do. Silverbell has hired skilled healers to help Valor recover.
I hope it will be enough.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I suppose I should record something of what we found in the Draconic books. Silverbell is going
to keep the full translations at her manor, so I’ll summarize them here for my reference. Maybe it can take my
mind off of Valor and things I can do nothing about. Until our arrival here, I was excited and eager about recording
all of this. Now, all I want to think about is Valor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">According to the journals and to Bookwyrm, who has added his own knowledge of his kind’s history
to help fill in the blanks, there were originally twenty-five dragons. The first, Lightbringer, was created by
the eight goddesses, (Bookwyrm calls them &quot;gods,&quot; but that’s just another name for the male aspect of
the Goddess) and then each of the eight created three of their own. Their purpose was to aid in the Creation. At
the end of Creation, they remained, but eventually Lightbringer grew tired of his position, wanting to be worshipped
himself. He lead the revolt that culminated in a great defeat in the year 547.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The dragon who wrote the journals tells of a &quot;traitor&quot; who came to the sphere they
had occupied before Remnant. This traitor saved the people before the total distruction of that sphere. In that
great battle, Lightbringer himself had taken the field and wounded Justicar, a dragon loyal to the forces of Heaven.
The journal doesn’t mention it, but Bookwyrm told us that Justicar had been blinded in the attack. A &quot;traitor&quot;
in the eyes of the dragon journals’ author, would be someone who aided Heaven, the side of light. Probably a dragon,
‘though not necessarily so. I’m tempted to think it was Umbra, but the people he saved were on Remnant, not this
un-named previous sphere. Unless, he did it twice? Saved two different races of people from the distruction the
dragon war was bringing?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">According to the journal, after the distruction, Lightbringer brought his forces to Remnant where
they fought the humans and the heavens. Eventually, they became aware that the end was coming soon, and there was
a good chance that they’d lose. So, two rebel dragons, Talesinger and Herophant, created a city &quot;shrouded
from the eyes of Heaven&quot; where they would hide those loyal to the dragon rebellion. Lightbringer used the
last of creation powers to cause the humans and the Forsaken to worship them, and these worshipers were also hidden
in the shrouded city.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Then, the dragons came up with their daring plan to rip open the veil of Heaven and attack directly.
The journal ends just before Lightbringer and his eleven rebel dragons launched their assault. Dragon legend says
that they were soundly defeated. Only Lightbringer himself was killed. All the other dragons were reduced in their
power. Of the loyal dragons, 5 were retrained for further work in the Heavens, and seven entered the mortal worlds
in reduced power. This still leaves one dragon unaccounted for. I wonder if she was a loyal or rebel dragon. Perhaps
she, or he, is the &quot;traitor&quot; who turned to help Heaven.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The reference to a city &quot;shrouded from the eyes of Heaven&quot; is most interesting. Since
the Cataclysm, the books and the creation of the Merfolk all occurred in Remnant, I wonder if this city isn’t there,
too. A city apparently inhabited by the Forsaken, the ogres who have caused so much trouble in so many spheres
lately. Bright Oceans is certainly hidden from the sky, since they’re underwater, but that was created by the Merfolk,
who were created by Umbra, not Herophant and Talesinger, and there are no ogres there. Starchaser’s realm, beyond
it, does have ogres, and it is hidden, so some degree, but I don’t think that’s it. I think it’s underground, maybe
hidden in a volcano there. I was really hoping for a chance to go back there and look, until Valor’s appearance
changed all our priorities. I wonder if the strange flying machines are connected to the hidden city of Forsaken.
Even if they’re not, I’d still love to know where they came from.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>22 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Valor continues to live, but she does not awaken. I pray continually for her recovery. I wish
there was more I could do for her. We’ve spent the whole day here, never wandering far in case some need should
arise. I feel so helpless. It was after dinner before I remembered that I’d missed lessons at Sunshine’s yesterday
and today. I sent off a messenger. Hopefully they’ll understand.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>23 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Valor has awakened and all is buzzing with activity in response to what we’ve learned. Stonedeep,
renamed Sunrise, was doing quite well since we’d left. Priest Greatheart had become the ruler and Valor had begun
a religious fighting group called &quot;Children of Baast.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Recently, however, they’d been invaded by a mixed force of humans, ogres and undead lead by a
red-haired, clawed woman who seems to be the one Wanderlust and I met, and by a white-hued creature similar to
Jackal. They had arrived at the Stoneflat and immediately took over Scepter. They then pushed northwards toward
the gate. Joy and the dragon, who has taken the name Morningstar, had returned to help. Joy had acquired the ability
to separate life and death when mixed in an unhealthy fashion. So, she’d been able to single-handedly destroy all
of this woman’s undead forces. But six weeks ago, the enemy had been able to capture Morningstar, and he’s been
held in chains of fire. This was when Valor decided that they needed more help. The enemy forces had taken the
gate since then, but Valor and her Children of Baast tried to get through. Only Valor survived the battles on both
sides of the gate. Many of them discovered that they were not even able to pass through the gate. Dispite her injuries,
she managed to make it to Everway. She didn’t even know where she was going, but somehow, the Lady lead her to
our gate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wind is going to gather a force of Seekers to help reclaim Sunrise. He’ll be back in about a
month. Silverbell used her family ties to Crow to get a force of 15 mercenaries for Loki to lead back immediately
to infiltrate the enemy to gather intelligence and weaken them upon our arrival. I hope he doesn’t change sides
while he’s there. I’ve never trusted him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust and I must wait until Wind returns. We suspect we’ll be recognized, and there is some
preparation I’d like to do, too. I really need to find a magic teacher to make sure I’m as good as I can be before
I face this foe. I mentioned this to Lady Silverbell, and she says she might be able to help.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I hope we can find Joy when we arrive. Hopefully she can tell us how these skulls Morningstar
gave us work. Also, I think her new power might be just what we need to help the deamon who is probably my sister
Misty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>24 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today, Valor was able to tell us a bit more about the situation in Sunrise. Dispite Priest Greatheart’s
assurances, Joy was not widely accepted, once people knew that she was once their hated Queen Nightstar. After
a while, she and Morningstar retreated to less accessible parts of the realm. Then the invasion came. The enemy
force was composed of humans, ogres (Forsaken) and undead. When word reached Joy and Morningstar, they came out
of their exile to fight for the realm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The red-haired woman leading the invasion is known there as &quot;Corona.&quot; No-one knows
the name of her companion. Apparently this pale version of the dragonman, Jackal. Valor describes this companion
as part dragon and part human, has been devastating to the people and the land. He can overcome ten people at a
time with some manner of mental attack or spell of confusion. They started by seizing the Capital and the treasury
and the mines. Lady only knows what further damage they’ve done since Valor’s departure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">This is so much worse than I feared. If Corona is/was really Misty, then all this is my fault.
All those people dead! I don’t know how I’ll ever atone for this.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wind departed at dawn to gather his force of Seekers to help us recover Sunrise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The only good thing today was that Lady Silverbell has found me a teacher from Crookstaff. His
name is WhiteFeather and he’s an airmage. I had my first four hours of instruction today, and they were much harder
than I expected. Starting tomorrow, we’ll be meeting six hours a day, starting at dawn. I’m looking forward to
more. If only the circumstances were better.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>25 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Magic lessons started in earnest today. Up before daylight to start at dawn and work until noon.
I guess I should be glad it’s summer. During the short winter months, six hours of training would take almost every
moment of daylight. Although, I could at least sleep later. No matter. I’m just glad to be training. It’s tiring,
and not just in body. Concentration like that for such long durations is also draining in mind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> In the after noon I visited with Valor for a few hours, but she slept through most of it. After
an hour at the arena, I went to Sunshine’s to teach, and play. No evening entertainment tonight, ‘though. Or for
quite a while, I suppose. Dawn comes mighty early and WhiteFeather will be waiting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We asked Valor about the weapons that Nightstar’s people had been using, the ones with the same
strange markings on the weapons used by the Forsaken and Jackal. She doesn’t really know, but she has a vague memory
about stories of an ogre invasion from Goldplain in the north. Nightstar acquired the Scroll of Black Death in
order to raise the dead and repel the invasion. The scroll, and her powers might have been part of some sort of
deal with an outside force. In the end, the gate was closed when a dragon named Ravenous Plague invaded the intervening
sphere of Sweetwater shortly after.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>26 Wrym - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I skipped weapons practice again today. Six hours of magic practice can be tiring. WhiteFeather
says that it’s just as tiring when it’s airmagic, but I have my doubts. Valor’s doing a bit better, but she tires
quite easily and can’t talk for very long. She is pleased to know that we’re taking action and will soon be helping
her people. I hope it will be soon enough.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I did spend some time looking through Bookwyrm’s translations of the dragon journals for some
reference of the apparently missing dragon. I could find references to only eighteen dragons by name, and most
of them were fighting on the side of the dragons rebelling against heaven.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>28 Wyrm - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki has left for Sunrise with his force of mercenaries. I’m glad that he’s not around, but I
do worry about what he’s up to when I can’t be watching him. After days away from the arena, I got in a little
archery again today. There was a notice about a competition at the end of Angel, but I think I’ll be gone by then.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>1 Angel - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I went to the Library after magic lessons today, and was pleased to find that Bookwyrm was still
there. I talked to him about the first dragons, and how by my count, there was one missing. He confirmed that I
had not made a mistake, and that there is one of the first twenty-five dragons un-accounted for. There are several
legends among his people about this dragon. Some say that she or he was killed in the battle, for either rebels
or loyalists. Others say that she refused to take sides and didn’t participate in the battle at all, and that she’s
still out there, an original and unchanged dragon 400 foot long, and unique in power. Another legend says that
because of her refusal to aid either side in the battle, she was cursed to become thunder, doomed to forever chase
the lightning without ever catching it. It is &quot;known&quot; that she was one of the dragons created by the

<P><FONT SIZE="2">With Bookwyrm’s help, I’ve put together this list of the dragons originally created by the deities,
and underlined the names of all those known to have aided Lightbringer in his rebellion. The dragon names written
in black are those loyalist dragons who chose to return to the mortal world, reduced in power, and are the forebears
of the seven tribes of dragons acknowledged by Bookwyrm’s people. (Bookwyrm’s own tribe believes themselves to
be descended from Wyrmtoungue.) The dragons who rebelled, were also reduced in power and remained in the mortal
spheres to create dragon tribes of their own, but they suffered much greater reductions in power and size, losing
almost all their powers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Whitequill the librarian came by during our conversation and offered his objections to the dragon-myths.
He believes that the battles with Heaven took place before the worlds were created. The dragons were the first
creation and they <B>all</B> rebelled against Heaven, except for one, and she was killed early in the war. Alurax,
one of the other dragons, was cowed into joining the rebellion by his companions although he didn’t really want
to fight. Early on, he lost a battle deliberately and was wounded. He was deemed a coward and in the end, he was
cursed by Heaven, restricted to human form except for one day a year when he resumes his dragon-self. According
to Whitequill, Alurax is still living, a fierce and frightening creature who is consumed with hatred for all humanity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I’m not sure that either one of these legends are <U>completely</U> accurate, however the scrolls
we found, the &quot;Cataclysm&quot; on Remnant and the legend of the creation of the Merfolk do lend some credence
to the Dragon’s version of the tale. Perhaps Alurax is the missing un-named dragon of Bookwrym’s legends.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I’m happy to see that my magic &quot;muscles&quot; are becoming better trained. It’s still tiring,
but I no longer feel ready to go take a nap after my training sessions with Whitefeather. That must be a good sign.
I do think I’m gaining some control, too. Lady Bless Silverwing for bringing him here. I’m looking forward to seeing
what the rest of this tutoring will bring me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>11 Angel - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Whitefeather seems pleased with my progress. So am I, actually. I’ve had the power since I passed
the visionquest, but now I can wield it so much more easily. I was practicing my &quot;magic flute&quot; spell,
and I can now play the flute by magic while I play the lute by hand, and sing for the duration of one complete
song! What a performance that could be! My playing is certainly much better after Fortune’s lessons. If I could
get them instruments to play by magic so I could dance, that would be even more amazing, but I think that’s <I>well</I>
beyond what my abilities will allow. I wonder what Silverbell would think if she could see this. On second thought,
no. I don’t think this is really the kind of entertainment that her House would hire.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Sunshine is pretty impressed, ‘though. She says she may have a place for me at the Silver Sky.
It’ll be short-term, since I’m leaving soon. I’ll be missing music lessons for the next week because tomorrow,
I’ll begin work on a spell talisman. That will take almost a whole day’s work, everyday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I finished my talisman last night. A week of steady spell-casting has left me tired, but strangely
invigorated. I feel great! The talisman is a ring that, when invoked, will greatly increase the user’s fighting
ability for about 10 or 15 minutes. It can only be used once, but now that I’ve made one, I’m hoping to be able
to create others, although that will have to wait until our return to Everway. I gave this one to Wanderlust.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>21 Angel - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wind has returned. He has a force of 100 Knights of the Seekers. Meanwhile, Lady Silverbell has
gathered 20 warriors from the Blade family, and 50 mercenaries from the Crow family. They will all be grounded
and ready to gate on the 28<SUP>th</SUP> day of Angel. In the interim, they are staying in tents in the north yard
of the compound. Fortunately, they are all traveling with their own provisions so Silverbells’ cooks and other
domestics are not overburdened.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Lady Aria Silverbell was called before the City Council and they asked her about her plans for
all the warriors. I don’t know what happened at the meeting, but all seems to still be on course as we’d planned
it last month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>22 Angel - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Light rain in the afternoon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">During magic practice today, WhiteFeather mentioned a tradition started by his clan grandmothers.
When someone bring the Crookstaffs news of new places and methods for visionquests, or other methods of increasing
one’s power, it earns the bearer information concerning three other known methods. Having told WhiteFeather Crookstaff
about the visionquests of the Living Forest, he should be able to supply us with other sites for further attempts.
He did make it clear that you can’t pass a visionquest twice in the same way, so I won’t be able to advance again
in the Living Forest with SnowCat. These additional locations could be most useful in deed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Afterwards, Wanderlust and I went to the library to see Bookwyrm. She wanted to talk to the dragon
about her magic and asked how to pass a visonquest. I wasn’t surprised when Bookwyrm said that he couldn’t tell
her. I know I passed one such quest, but I don’t know how to tell someone-else to do it, either. Every visionquest
has it’s own unique answer. Nonetheless, Wanderlust described her two visionquests for us, so we could help her
guess why it was that she failed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">In the first visionquest, Wanderlust found herself back at her homeland, just as the ogre invasion
began. She was caught unprepared and without weapons. Someone whom she couldn’t see, offered her a sword. It was
a magic sword and when she took it and used its magic to fight the ogres, she was horribly burned.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">In the second quest, she found herself on a road, trying to reach a distant goal. Her travels
were interrupted several times by persons needing help. Each time, she turned from her path to help them only to
find herself further from her goal. She couldn’t see these people and not help, so she chose to by-pass the towns
where she was encountering them. At that point, she failed the second vision-quest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Bookwyrm offered no advice at first, asking only what <U>Wanderlust</U> thought the quests and
her failures meant. After discussion, Bookwyrm, Wanderlust and I think her failure has to do with having accepted
aid without asking the price. Wanderlust used the sword without asking for instructions or training.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">On the second quest, it’s clear that choosing not to help was a problem, but helping them wasn’t
advancing Wanderlust’s goals. Personally, I see two possible answers here. It could be that her goal is wrong.
That she needs to look in a different direction to get what she wants. Maybe the vision is telling her that her
answers aren’t where she thinks they are and she needed to have looked in the towns for her goal. On the other
hand, I think the problem could be that she’s doing all the giving and helping, there. Maybe she needed to ask
the villages whom she aided, to help her in turn, with reaching her goal. In her first visionquest, Wanderlust
failed when she accepted aid, so maybe it doesn’t make sense for her to be asking for it the second time, but maybe
<U>asking</U> for it makes it different. Maybe she’s to learn to be less completely self reliant, and to learn
to lean on her friends.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>23 Angel - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today was a big start and an ending. White Feather says that my training is over. He indicated
that I’d actually passed his requirements when I was successful in creating the talisman this week. Now, all I
need is additional practice and polish. He’s going to continue to work with me on that until our departure for
Sunrise in a few days.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The big start was my first public performance at the Silver Sky, tonight. It went quite well.
I’ve never been paid such a commission for one night’s work! I’m really looking forward to the rest of the week.
Willow came to see my big debut. It was wonderful to see her. I’m going to try to spend more time with her in the
next few days.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>24 Angel - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Heavy rain all day. Willow and I spent the time together weaving
tales of places we have been, separately and together. We tried to bake a <I>ruchant</I> using walnut instead of
greennut, but it came out a bit too dry. We didn’t mention Misty or the coming trip to Sunrise at all.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>26 Angel - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Something Wanderlust said today made me think more about her visionquests. A few days later,
I’m beginning to think that the two quests may have more in common than it first appeared. Maybe both of them are
asking her to look beyond the surface. In the first, to look beyond what she was getting to ask how and why. In
the second, to look beyond her goal to see other possibilities, or to see the people she helps as more than just
victims, but also people who have something to offer as well. Or maybe, I’m interpreting both visionquests wrong.
A visionquest is an intrinsically personal thing. Perhaps only Wanderlust can really see the proper questions and
answers, or figure out how to find them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>27 Angel - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Tomorrow at sunrise we’ll be off to help Priest Greatheart in Sunrise. This afternoon, I went
in one last time to talk to Valor. She has nothing to add to what’s she’s told us so far, but wishes us success.
She looks at me so earnestly, and I wonder what she thinks of us. A year ago, we came and saved her realm in just
a few days. She risked death for herself and all her company to bring us the news of its current trouble. I don’t
know that we’re really the great heroes she seems to take us for. At least, I’m not. She’s a much greater fighter
than I, and my magic is far from limitless. I’d been thinking of this quest in terms of my own search, my sister,
and the truth of what’s become of her, but it’s more than that. Valor <I>needs</I> for us to succeed. I’ll do my
best, and with luck, we will both see the resolution that we need.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">After my shift at Silver Sky, I visited with Willow. She was awake, and waiting for me, which
was nice. I declined her suggestion to take a tarot reading on our upcoming trip. I always seem to get more questions
than answers there, and if this trip is going to fail, I’d rather not know about it ahead of time. Still, it’s
nice to spend the evening in her company.</FONT></P>

I will bring my silver flute.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>7 Judge - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We left at dawn on 28 Angel. I hadn’t slept well and I was a bit concerned about going through
the gate, tired as I was, but we arrived safely in the early morning. It took until noon to get everyone together
again and ready for marching on, but we made fairly good progress for all that. Our company now numbers 200 members
of the Crow family of mercenaries, 50 Knights of Wind’s order of Seekers, and 20 members of Wind’s own family,
the Blades. <I>They’re</I> quite a crew. They argue and joke amongst themselves in a way that makes it clear that
there’s a lot of history between them all. Some good, some bad. It makes me think of Misty, all we had and all
we might have had with others of Ember if it weren’t for our father, Brightstone. I do wish I had taken advantage
of their short stay in Everway to become aquainted with a few of the travelers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Two of Wind’s relations are &quot;Shadow-walkers.&quot; The Peace-keepers of Everway would just
call them thieves. As we were leaving, Wind began to argue with Dawn’s Victory, a tall red-headed family member
about one of the &quot;shadow-walkers,&quot; a frail, un-impressive fellow. Wind obviously didn’t want him to come
along, but Dawn swore that he would behave since he owes her a favor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Silverbell was most apologetic about not being able to come, but I really hadn’t been expecting
her. I guess Wind had, since he viewed her as the Commander of the mission. The Families of Everway also seemed
to feel that she was somehow key to this rescue operation, suspecting an ulterior motive that would gain her power
in the Council. I don’t really understand that, but the Council had forbidden her to accompany us. This leaves
Wind in charge.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>8 Judge - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Sweetwater is much improved over what it was a year ago. The burnt trees remain, but they stand
in fields of wildflowers as the Lady works to restore this world. A light rain in the afternoon freshened the smells
of green growing things.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The Crow and the Seekers seem content to travel with themselves.
Wanderlust and I have stayed near to Wind and have become aquatinted with a few of the Blades. Three-Strikes Windraven
is a mountain of a man who earned his name by killing a dragon with three strikes. Afterwards, he drank the dragon’s
blood and became an even more powerful warrior. Dawn’s Victory is another impressive warrior, although the same
could be said for most of this family. The frail &quot;shadow-walker&quot; about whom Wind was arguing with Dawn
is called Spider’s Fang. He’s so universally disliked among the Family, he doesn’t even use their name. He makes
Loki look trustworthy. I’ve taken to keeping my valuables well hidden.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Not until late in the day, did I realize that I have much in common
with Songbird Blade. She’s an older woman, bald, and one of the Blade’s most powerful mages. I’m told she uses
a combat magic that makes her an equal to any three of the best warriors anywhere, and can take on a score of lesser
warriors on her own.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Late in the day, after making sure that Spider’s Fang was well ahead,
I removed my flute and began to play for a bit. That’s when I found out that Songbird is so named because she,
too, is a music lover. Wind then forbade the use of the flute, fearing it would warn enemies of our approach. He’s
probably right, but I miss it. Still, it was pleasant to talk music with Songbird for a while.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>9 Judge - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We’ve started the rockier assent towards the gate. Although the
scars are still evident on the land, everything is so much greener than it was last time we were here. Still the
going is difficult and it will be harder still in a few days. I don’t know how Valor managed it. Truly, the Lady
was guiding her footsteps.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I noticed an older man as he was assisted up the rocks by a blond
youth and got to know them over the noon-time meal. The older man is Kestrel Blade, an archer. He walks with a
limp, but he’s full of energy and has a sharp eye for detail. The younger one, Cornsilk Blade, says Kestrel is
the best archer in the family and that’s why he’s come on this journey despite his difficulty. Cornsilk is not
Kestrel’s son, or grandson, as I as first supposed. He’s another archer who was once apprenticed to Kestrel. Cornsilk
is no longer beholden to the olderman, but still looks to him and helps him with the difficult terrain. Codrnsilk
is also Wind’s cousin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>10 Judge - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">It’s strange how much you can miss by not asking the right questions.
They say &quot;curiosity killed the cat,&quot; but maybe lack of curiosity is just as dangerous. I was talking
to one of the young Blades today, I think her name was Tiger-eye, and she made mention of Wind’s Order. I know
he’s a Seeker, and he’s gathered a great number of his order to help, and I’ve wondered what the Order was about
but never bothered to ask. Apparently what they’re &quot;seeking&quot; is the Nine Scales of the Deceiver in order
to stop him. That would explain why it was on Willow’s mind when she first showed up in Everway in Wind’s company.
I thought it was just because of Lord Brightstone of Ember. It would also explain why Wind has remained in Everway
after his return there. I thought it was his home, but apparently his order is based in Athenia, and that’s what
he calls home. He must have been staying there, in the vicinity of Silverbell’s Strangerside estate because of
the Scale she has hidden there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>11 Judge - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I spent some time with Wind today, to learn more about his Order.
Athenia is a sphere adjacent to Roundwander, but the gate is a few days outside of the city. At one time, the Seekers
had managed to locate one of the Scales and took it back there. In an attempt to keep it from the followers of
the Deceiver, they tried to hurl it into to sun. When they did so, it was snatched by whatever force it was that
took the one we found. They must have used magic to try and send it away.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I guess this explains why so many of the Seekers are here to help
free Sunrise. I thought that they were coming because it was a good and just cause, but they have bigger motives.
They’re interested in stopping Corona, who we know is trying to gather scales for the followers of the Deceiver.
Saving the people of Sunrise is just a positive side-effect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I’ve decided that I can’t fault them for that. Corona seems to be
an active representation of their enemy. I hope we can stop her without killing her. Maybe she can still be helped.
Then again, maybe a true death is the help she really needs. Her best rescue from the Deceiver</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>12 Judge - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I saw Umbra again today. &quot;He&quot; is an enigmatic as ever. I was surprised to realize how
much I’ve come to trust him, dispite the creepy feeling he gives me whenever I see him. He’d been a fearful creature
in my nightmares for so long, and now, while I still don’t understand him, I believe him to be honorable in his
own way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">About half a day short of the gate, Wind called the company to a halt. He called Wanderlust and
me to him at the front of the procession, and then sent the two of us ahead to scout the territory. We found that
the area around the gate has been completely cleared of trees. There were about 50 men in the encampment there,
and two guards on the gate. They were using a well that had been dug since our last visit here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We waited until we’d moved back from the clearing to talk about our options. Wanderlust wanted
to poison the food, (not the water, as we might need that) but didn’t know how to smuggle the poison it. I could
levitate it over when people weren’t looking. I’m rather more worried about the gate. If one man gets through,
our chances at crossing into Sunrise will be ruined. If Mach were here, I’d have him make up a metal grate the
I could levitate into the yard and slam in front of the opening so no-one could pass. Wanderlust seems to feel
there’s no way we could block the gate during the fight, but there must be something we could use. Even a simple
net would at least slow them down and give us time to stop them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">While we walking, we suddenly passed into a gray fog and were separated. That’s when Umbra appeared.
He said he’d been drawn here by curiosity due to all the increased activity. I had thought that he was likely tracking
me or Corona, or both. If he’d been watching at Everway, he’d have known we were coming here and could have come
ahead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Umbra once again warned me that I had to stop Corona, as if I didn’t already know that. But he
still won’t give me a clue as to HOW. He also says that there’s only two sphere-walkers among the guards at the
gate. I should have thought about that! I’m so used to passing between the spheres now, that I forget how uncommon
the ability really is. When I asked which two they were, he said only that it should be obvious.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">He turned and walked into the fog and disappeared. The fog vanished just as quickly and Wanderlust
was there again, looking confused and asking where I’d been. I told her about the two spherewalkers. She wasn’t
credulous of the source of my information, but immediately concluded that if true, they would have to be the two
guards at the gate. I suppose it could be so, but I don’t think I’d post my only two spherewalkers at the gate
at the same time. They’d have to be there constantly, and if they took it in their heads to leave, the party would
be stranded. Better to rotate them, partnered with another warrior so that they’d be able to rest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When we discussed the situation with Wind, he questioned me closely about Umbra, but I had precious
little to tell him. He relaxed only a little when I reminded him how Umbra had supplied me with a copy of the lost
half of the Draconic scroll about Lightbringer’s return. Finally, Wind accepted that if Umbra also sought the end
of the ogres, then perhaps he <U>is</U> on our side. Wind also believes that the two spherewalkers, if that information
is correct, would be the two guarding the gate. He’s the military leader, not me, so I guess he would know. We’ve
made our plan and will be putting it in action early in the morning, so I’m off to get some rest now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>13 Judge - at the gate to Sunrise, Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Well, we’re here! ‘though it wasn’t easy. I woke up in the middle of the night last night during
an unexpected commotion. Wanderlust had intercepted a would-be deserter. It was Spider’s Fang. Wanderlust had heard
a commotion and found his bed empty. She chased him through the woods and was able to ambush him. Spider had come
close to tagging her with one of his poisoned darts. She was very lucky. I guess we all were.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">He claimed that he wasn’t working for Corona’s men yet, but he had been planning to try to sell
our plan to them, to warn them of our approach. Several members of Wind’s family, (Dawn’s Victory, ThreeStrikes,
Kestrel, Songbird and Wind himself) gathered to decide what to do. Dawn was apologetic, but wanted mercy. Threestrikes
and Songbird were of a mind to put him to death immediately. I was that angry, but wouldn’t really have wanted
to do it. In the end, Wind feigned a killing blow and then sent the deserter back to the gate under guard. They
are not sphere-walkers, so they’ll have to wait on our return there. I hope we can spare those guards. We may find
that every woman counts in the conflict in Sunrise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">A few hours later and Wanderlust, Kestrel and I headed out to the edge of the clearing. It took
longer than I’d expected because Kestrel doesn’t walk fast. We arrived at dawn. I took to the trees. We sent Swiftwing
back to Wind when we were ready. The bird came back an hour later when his crew was in place. Kestrel began the
attack. Before I was aware that he’d nocked an arrow, both men at the gate were dead. Wanderlust broke for the
gate, and I took to the air to cover her. I had a levitation spell ready to lift any warrior that threatened her
into the sky where he could be shot, but I didn’t get to use it. She was about halfway there when one of the fighters,
a big guy, attacked her with an axe. He got her sword, I hit him with an arrow, then she finished him with a branch.
I think he might have been the second sphere-walker, but nobody else does. Wanderlust got to the gate and fought
from there. Kestrel killed quite a few with his fine archery and in a short time, we had won, without any dead
on our side. Of the enemy, 23 of were dead, 27 wounded, and surrendered to us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We spent the day here, securing the area, tending our wounds or bruises, and gathering information.
There are fifty warriors, mostly archers, posted on the other side of the gate. Messengers from this post are supposed
to arrive with a flag. We plan to leave first thing in the morning. I’d like to have gone today. We seemed ready
by about noon, but Wind won’t hurry it. The waiting seems endless</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>17 Judge - near Underwood, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The big fight on the Sunrise side of the gate turned out to be a disappointment. We went through,
ready for trouble, knowing there was no retreating back through the gate. But when we got through, there was no
threat. Small fires and piles of bodies were scattered about, with a band of brigands wandering about some distance
from the gate. Loki approached us then, and told us that he’d attacked the day before, to clear the area for us.
They did really well, and I am honestly surprised to find the sneak is still helping us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki told us how he’d encountered the force outside the gate in Sweetwater and talked his way
into a letter of introduction for the Sunrise side guards. The guards told him that Corona’s boss was upset because
the Awakener didn’t return with the tribute after his visit last year when we’d aided in his transformation. They
took him to see Corona and Feralpride on the afternoon of the fifteenth of Angel. They saw Morningstar, enchained
with magic fire, and being tortured by Corona. His crew was sent to Underwood to quell the rebellion there. He
made contact with the rebellion and worked with them to disable the forces there. Then came down here to capture
the Sunrise side of the gate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I’m horrified to realize that Morningstar is still being held after all this time. Nearly three
months, bound by fire and tortured by the horrific creature. I can barely stand to write about it. We’ve just got
to get there and find some way to help him, ‘though I can’t imagine how to free him just now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki fears that some of the guard at the gate may have escaped their attack and have run ahead
to warn Corona at the Stone Flat about him. Fortunately, they don’t know that he’s working with us and that our
force of 266 have joined the fight. Still, they’ll be traveling faster so we can’t afford to wait. We left as soon
as we compiled our forces and started the long march to Stone-flat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki has done nothing on this walk but complain about getting paid. Three-strikes, bless his
heart, told him that his payment should be the satisfaction of fighting for just cause. Loki was not amused, but
I thought the look on his face was priceless. We encountered several bands of peasant rebels, who joined with us
when they saw their companions with Loki. They may not be well-trained fighters, but they know the land and are
most enthusiastic about freeing their land. I’m happy to have them. We now number over 300 souls.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>18 Judge - the forest, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We’ve been joined by another 19 peasant-rebels including Joy. Loki told her about what he’d seen
of Morningstar at Stoneflat. She already knew about most of it, but is devastated to hear his first-hand account
of the dragon’s suffering.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Joy was able to tell us a bit more about this Feralpride, Corona’s companion, and the capture
of Morningstar. The dragonman simply looked at the dragon and Morningstar grabbed his head and passed out. Then
he somehow caused all of Joy’s companions to begin fighting each other. It seems obvious that he has some kind
of mind-controlling power. He seems a lot more formidable than Jackal was.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Joy’s confirmed to us that the skulls that we were given by the Awakener do indeed confer death.
The can work when thrown at someone but may not work on someone who is exceptionally strong, like a dragon, or
a great mage. Sounds like they may not work on Feralpride at all. Would they hinder him at all, or just be a complete
waste? Joy doesn’t know.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>19 Judge - the forest, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It looks like we’ve done it again. Almost a year to the day (a year and ten days, actually) that
we stopped Nightstar and the Awakener, we’ve now defeated Corona’s army and freed Sunrise again. Unfortunately,
it was not without cost. Joy is dead, and Corona escaped without harm. I’m completely exhausted, but I can’t sleep.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">This afternoon as we were marching to Stoneflat, Wanderlust sent Swiftwing ahead, as usual. When
she came back, she attacked Wanderlust, thinking her a rabbit. The bird was obviously mesmerized, probably by Feralpride.
We were all convinced that Feralpride must have seen the bird’s mind and known we were approaching. Wanderlust
insists that Feralpride may have done it without knowing the bird’s purpose, or intent. I find that incredible.
It would be possible, sure, but there would be no reason to warp the bird’s perceptions and intentions if he wasn’t
recognized as a scout for our group. We did have reason to believe that Corona’s troops may have been warned of
Loki’s attack.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Late in the day, we noticed a cloud of dust on the road, rising on the horizon. These roads are
incredibly straight, so these travelers were quite a long way off. We took to the trees on the side of the road
to ambush Corona’s forces as they passed, but it soon became obvious that they were stopping for the night and
would not be passing our way soon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wind set up a hidden camp, sending young Cornsilk and Songbird ahead to scout. Loki, Joy and
I joined them, while Wanderlust chose to stay in the camp in case trouble arose there. When we got to the enemy
encampment, we found that they had about 300 soldiers, mostly human and mostly male. That would match our forces
in number, but the ogres are much stronger, the warriors probably much better trained, and they have Feralpride
with them. Loki tells us that this is about half the forces that he’d seen earlier at Stone Flat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki came up with a quick plan. I flew through the trees, skirting the enemy encampment. When
I was sufficiently far from Loki and the others, and had a good shot, I hurled my crystal skull at Feralpride,
using a magic spell to guide it. After all we’ve heard, and what Joy’s told us, I was no longer sure it will have
any effect on him at all, but it worked better than I could have hoped. It hit him, leaving him bleeding and burning
on the ground, but not dead. I hid in the trees. Noticing that the warriors hadn’t seen me, I used my bow to shoot
them, and Feralpride whenever I had a clear shot. With two arrows, I actually managed to kill Feralpride, something
I wasn’t sure was going to be possible. By then, the soldiers realized where I was and raced into the forest after
me. I tried to shoot them, while keeping to the trees. It was difficult and I wasn’t very effective, but I was
able to get away and find my way back to Loki. The remaining soldiers were disorganized and without direction so
we decided that we’d leave them for Wind’s forces as we continued to Stoneflat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It was quite dark when we got there. Half the encampment was vacant, obviously the crew with
Feralpride that we had encountered. Morningstar’s prison was obvious, the glow of the magiked chains of fire lit
the area. Loki, Songbird and I approached first, leaving Joy with Cornsilk. Songbird’s combat magic was remarkable.
He took out four of the six guards, leaving Loki and I to deal with just one each. The camp is mostly dormant,
and nobody seems to have noticed us. Poor Morningstar was barely aware. He begged us to leave him. The chains were
actually <I>alive</I>, drawing their strength from him, so anything we tried to break them would hurt <I>him</I>.
Corona was resting. Morningstar wanted us to leave before she saw us. However, we couldn’t do as the dragon asked.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When we returned to Joy and Cornsilk, she insisted on seeing Morningstar, and we lead them both
back. While she conversed with the dragon, Loki and I searched the downed guards. He got into one of the uniforms,
intending to take me as a false captive, in order to be taken to see Corona. Actually the plan came about like
this - Loki asked, &quot;Has Corona ever seen you?&quot; Yes. &quot;And she’d recognize you as an enemy?&quot;
Yes. &quot;Congratulations. You’ve just been captured.&quot; I really did want to see her up close. To find out
what she really is. Unfortunately that plan never came to fruition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Joy had been running her hands along the path of the chains, I turned to see her look in Morningstar’s
eyes. The dragon shook his head, no, but Joy plunged her hands into the chains. She screamed as the fire engulfed
her body, killing her, but the flame-chains were also dead. She’d done as she said, separating life and death where
they are joined unnaturally.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The dragon rose. The soldiers who had begun to close in on us at Joy’s scream, retreated rapidly.
Morningstar and Songbird quickly begin killing those who venture too near. Songbird was especially effective. Corona
appeared then. She paled at the sight of the freed dragon and then noticed me. &quot;You’ve ruined everything!&quot;
she shouted. Then she threw a column of flame that consumed all bolts and arrows fired at her. Morningstar killed
dozens trying to get to her, but she somehow opened a gate just around her, and disappeared before anyone could
approach. The warriors lost heart after that, and many deserted immediately. Those who fought on were easily defeated
by Morningstar for the most part, but the rest of us did what we could as well. The battle was soon over.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Umbra appeared before us then. He said he sensed Corona’s unnatural gate, and promised that I’d
see her again. He told us that we must find the other scales. Yes, that’s clear, but How? He said we would find
some answers back on Everway. Then he disappeared in a flash of light. That was the showiest bit of magic I’d seen
him do, and that in front of everyone. I asked Morningstar about Umbra, as I’ve begun to think he might be a dragon,
but I forgot that Morningstar had been a dragon for not much more than a year. He said that he recognized Umbra
as &quot;power.&quot; Someone he knew in his other life, but he can’t remember any details now. Pity. He’s as much
a mystery as Corona is. Maybe more.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We returned to Wind’s encampment at about dawn, flying on Morningstar’s back. Even incredibly
weakened, he’s remarkably powerful. Wanderlust and the others had seen no sign of Feralpride’s forces during the
night. The group must have disbanded and scattered at the death of their leader. Wanderlust was disappointed to
discover all that she missed and was furious at us for costing Joy her life. It was her choice, but Wanderlust
doesn’t see it that way. We all mourn for Joy, especially Morningstar. He’s remained with us thus far. We think
that Wanderlust’s crystal skull could have destroyed the chains without costing Joy her life, but we’ll never know
for sure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>20 Judge - Stoneflat</B>, <B>Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I spent most of the day resting as Wind took care of his prisoners and the wounded. He’s sent
out patrols to find fugitives from Corona’s army. So far, they’ve collected about forty women and men.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Songbird has tried to help Morningstar. She can’t do much to speed the healing, but is able to
block a good portion of the pain, so he can rest and move about more easily. He doesn’t speak much, but his mere
presence gives us power and confidence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The Seekers seem to have found little to celebrate with Corona’s escape. She was their real objective,
not the freedom of this realm. I think I understand that a bit better now that I’ve seen her again. If I had heard
that Corona was in a different sphere, where I knew nobody, I would want to go and confront her. Even if I hear
that she’s there doing Good for those people, as unlikely as that seems. I’d want to go there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> In the afternoon, we returned to Stoneflat, where Greatheart took charge. With our help, he
should be able to have his realm back in short order.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>21 Judge - StoneFlat, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Things are pretty much the same today as yesterday. The Crows captured
another seventeen fugitives from Corona’s army. They seem to be merely hiding. From what Dawn’s Victory tells me,
there seems to be no evidence of any attempt by the invaders to re-organize and attack us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I’ve been worried about Corona since that display at Stone Flat.
It just doesn’t make sense, what happened, and I’ve been thinking things about who she may truly be that make even
less sense.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">When I first saw her in Everway, I thought she was using my magic,
not her own. The gate that she opened to escape would be in keeping with the highest level of my magic, not hers.
This gating is definitely not in her former repertoire. She <I>must</I> have changed magic since her &quot;death,&quot;
but I’m terrified of the power that must be at her command to cast spells like that. And yet, it doesn’t make sense.
If she were really that powerful, why would she run?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I again find myself doubting that this Corona is in fact Misty.
I’ve never seen her use any of the abilities I’ve known her to have from before our separation. Unless it was all
a great illusion. But no, when Umbra arrived he said he’d sensed the &quot;gate&quot; that Corona used to escape.
It wasn’t just an illusion of a gate and invisibility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">If I had only heard story of Lord Brightstone of Ember and his two
daughters, and wasn’t part of it, I think I’d assume that Corona was Lightfoot, not Morning Mist. It looks like
my magic, enhanced greatly, but my magic. And yet, I know that I am myself, so Corona can’t be me, can she? Would
it have been possible for the Deceiver to make a magical dopelganger of myself to serve him? For one such as he,
<I>anything</I> could be possible. And yet, I’ve never seen her use any of my powers, except possibly when she
threw fire at me, but that could have been my magic, too, at an extremely high level, or another magic, or an enchanted
object.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">But if she were me, why haven’t I seen her use the smaller spells
I know, or other greater ones that would be within her reach if she were able to gate? She could have levitated
the weapon of every woman to fight against its bearer, set fire to the grasses or the warriors clothing, or set
up a shield proof against all our attacks. She didn’t. Does that mean she can’t? Maybe all this magic that seems
to be mine is instead powers granted by the Deceiver, or magic borne in an enchanted object, not herself. She did
see me as I stood invisibly above her in Everway. Could that have been a demonstration of the magic Misty once
used?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I fear that by the time I know the answers to these questions, it
will be too late for me to make use of them, if I ever discover them at all. I’ve seen the hate in her eyes. I
know she’ll kill me if she gets a chance, and she won’t be stopping to explain things before the end.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>22 Judge - Stone Flat, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Today the warriors were able to locate only three additional defectors
from Corona’s forces. Wind feels that they’ve re-captured all which they can at this time. It seems that most of
them have fled to Scepter, where they’ve maintained a stronghold. What ever other stragglers there may be, have
probably found bolt-holes through which we won’t be able to track them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We will need to retake the capital in order to fully restore this
sphere. Greatheart has been locked in council with Wind, the leader of the Crows, and spies from his own people
for the better part of three days. We are now mostly recovered from the battle at Stoneflat. So I’m sure we will
be moving soon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>23 Judge - Stone Flat, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Tomorrow, we plan to attack Scepter. Greatheart has been working
desperately to arrange codes, signals and symbols by which we will not mistake the loyal citizens of Sunrise for
the mercenaries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>24 Judge - Scepter, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The capital has been retaken. This fight was not simple, but it was considerably easier than
we had anticipated. Greatheart’s sources tell us that more than half of the army posted there had fled at news
of Feralpride’s death and Corona’s departure. What was left was the brave, the fool-hearty and the desperate -
warriors with no way back to whence they’d come. I suspect many of them may have fled to Goldplain, if they got
that far.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Greatheart has taken charge of the realm again, although it will be some time before things are
as they were. Loki has been grousing continually about not getting proper reward. Greatheart has heard him and
gave him a gift from Nightstar’s former treasury. It’s a magic pearl, quite large actually - almost the size of
a walnut, that turns black and glows in the presence of a lie. I’d love to see him forced to wear it visibly at
all times. It would be useful to have such information available.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>25 Judge - Scepter, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Morningstar left today. He flew off into the mountains somewhere, or perhaps beyond. He wishes
to be informed if Corona ever returns and has promised that he would return if the realm needs him. I don’t know
how the people are expected to be able to carry a message to him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>26 Judge - Scepter, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Rain overnight</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>7 Serpent - Scepter, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Priest Greatheart has earned his name today. He’s heard, as we all have, the city’s grumbling
about Joy. Even after all she’d done, they still don’t want to accept her as a hero, or even a friend. They remember
too well the years they’d suffered under Queen Nightstar’s rule. Greatheart made an impassioned speech about her.
He talked about the all changes that he himself had witnessed, insisting that Joy was not the same woman that Nightstar
was. He’s commissioned a statue of her, to be installed in the gardens at the capitol, and declared two days of
celebration for the victory she’d help to win.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>10 Serpent - Springrise river near Scepter, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We’re on our way back to the gate now, traveling by boat. I do miss Mach’s lovely flying machines,
or the luxury of flying on the back of Morningstar. But, at least we need no longer walk in great fear of Corona’s
army and spies. Wind’s patrols have recovered all but about two or three dozen of them. Greatheart and the others
believe they’ve all fled to Goldplain. So far, the weather’s better than our last trip down-river. We had a heavy
fog in the afternoon, but no rain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>11 Serpent - Springrise river, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Our luck with the weather is holding. It’s chilly but clear.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>13 Serpent - Underwood, Sunrise</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at the gate in the middle of the afternoon and, as usual, Wind has decided to wait
until tomorrow to make passage. Sometimes his caution is truly maddening. With all the waiting we do with this
assembly, it’s a wonder we ever get anything done. I’m anxious to make it back to Everway and search out possible
locations for the scales of the Lightbringer. Wind agrees that Ten Thousand Islands is a likely place, but there
may be others we can discover while waiting for a chance to travel. I only hope Corona hasn’t found any since the
one we got from her in Everway, or the one we found in the Living Forest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki’s mercenaries at the gate have been replaced by Greatheart’s followers, but they greet us
warmly and welcome us in their encampment. We had a rowdy and festive evening before retiring for the night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>17 Serpent - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The Sweetwater side of the gate was also clear. There is no remnant of the post that had been
here. We came through about mid-morning and have managed to make a good day’s progress.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>18 Serpent - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Not much progress today. We were plagued by thunderstorms and heavy rain all day. I suppose we’re
lucky it is still too warm to be snow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>19 Serpent - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I was talking to Wanderlust about how we would go about seeking
other worlds that may hold one of the remaining six scales, when Wind overheard us. I was planning to go to the
Library of All Worlds and seek out worlds that have seen a recent increase in the number of Ogres, and Ogre invasions.
Wind says that’s not the only thing that we know about worlds that have hidden scales. The scale that his order
found was in a place called &quot;Magebane&quot; where magic is outlawed because the use of magic slowly corrupts
all who use it. That does sound suspiciously like the Living Forest. We could be looking for spheres where magic
is distorted or corrupted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">First on my list of possibilities was Ten Thousand Islands where
we know that the Ogre presence is increasing. I can’t recall using any magic there, so I don’t know if it works
or not. Umbra used magic, apparently without difficulty, but then he seems to be a very special class of mage.
Another thought had been Wanderlust’s home, but she reports there has never been any problem with the use of magic
there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Loki was worried about what effect the scale we’ve hidden in Everway
would have on Roundwander. I hadn’t thought of that. Wind doesn’t know, but he believes the effects of magic had
been slowly corrupted over the thousands of years that the scales have laid hidden. He doesn’t believe there will
be any short-term effect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>23 Serpent - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Light rain in the evening.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>3 Mare - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived in Everway late in the evening. Most of the household staff is asleep, but Willow
is up and offers us all some hot cider before retiring. Loki has wandered off into Strangerside. Probably going
to drink or gamble his money away. It’s none of my concern. Willow tells us that Valor has been recovering well
in the few months since our departure. I’m looking forward to visiting with her in the morning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>4 Mare - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It rained heavily over night, but Silverbell was here to greet us at sunrise and spent most of
the morning questioning us about the details of our trip.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">After the noon-meal, Wanderlust and I were able to visit with Valor. She’s now able to walk well,
and is expecting to return to her own realm soon. She’s thrilled to learn that Sunrise is no longer under siege.
She’s sympathetic about our failure to stop Corona, but it is of only secondary concern for her. She says she still
doesn’t remember any of her journey through Sweetwater. The healer says the pain of her wounds is blocking the
memories. That could be so, but I do fervently wonder if there wasn’t a divine hand guiding her through to the
gate. Surely the Lady is as aware as we of the schemes of the followers of the Deceiver.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">After our visit, Wanderlust, and I went down to the Great Library in Everway proper. Wind and
Loki came along as well. I don’t understand why Wind is not planning to continue to accompany us on this quest
for additional scales as it is also the mission of the Seekers, but he is planning to return to his temple in Athenia
as soon as he’s grounded. That gate is four days away from Everway and so he’ll be leaving on the seventh.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">At the Library, Whitequill was unable to provide us with the identities of any known spheres
where magic is warped as it was in The Living Forest and Magebane. He will continue to search for us, but I don’t
expect much. We shall see. Meanwhile, I will plan on going to Ten Thousand Islands as soon as possible, if Silverbell
gives me leave.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki is opposed to this plan. He says that if we gather the scales, we’d be doing the Deceiver’s
work for him - his followers would need only attack us successfully to gather what we’d found and then they’d succeed.
I think he’s right, but I’d like to have more than one scale under our control. We should probably hide it on another
sphere, or at least another part of Roundwander, if we find one. Next time I see Umbra, I’m going to ask him if
there’s any way to <I><U>destroy</U></I> a scale. If so, we would need only to destroy one, then the nine would
never be gathered and we’d be safe. But Umbra appears at his own choosing, not mine, so I don’t know when I’ll
see him next. It may not be possible at all.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>7 Mare - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wind has left to join his fellows in Athenia. I never really knew him well, but I think I’ll
miss him. In four more days I’ll be ready to go to Remnant and then to Ten Thousand Islands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>9 Mare - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Thunderstorm in the afternoon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>11 Mare - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We were finally grounded today and I was ready to start off toward Remnant and eventually Ten
Thousand Islands, a trip Silverbell never did sanction or forbid, when we’ve been diverted to another task. Silverbell
called us all to the Strangerside estate in the early afternoon where we found her waiting in the Library with
a crusty and irritated older man. It was Pious Digger, a trader who was profoundly annoyed at being kept waiting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Pious told a tale of a sphere called Rainbow Forest. It’s a direct gate from Roundwander, although
the gate is four days travel to the northwest of Everway. While there, he heard stories about a strange dragon
that came to life out of a painting and has been destroying elephants and other animals in the surrounding Jungle.
Pious says he saw no evidence of this, and personally believes it all to be nothing but tales. He’s extremely angry
at being delayed to repeat what he considers nonsense.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Silverbell apparently believes it. She wants us to go and investigate. We’re to go and seek out
the king of that sphere; a man known as &quot;Rules Silently&quot; for he never speaks. We’ve dealt with dragons
more often on friendly terms than as enemies, but I’m sure we could do something about this menace if it proves
true.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">On departing, Digger threatened Aria saying, &quot;I’ll tell my family about you.&quot; The Diggers
have loaned large amounts of money to most of the Houses of Everway, and I’m sure Silverbell is no exception. Especially
considering the expense of our recent expedition to Sunrise. I wonder what retaliation he imagines they will inflict
on her? Surely the terms of her repayment can’t be changed. Perhaps they will refuse to increase her debt, or simply
wage a campaign against her admission to the council. Would they? Who knows how these little nobles think? Certainly
not I. I’m sure Silverbell can handle herself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>12 Mare - Outside of Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We’re on our way to the gate to Rainbow Jungle. Silverbell has given us each horses to make the
traveling easier. We’ve also been supplied with oilcloth jackets with hoods, as the jungle is sometimes quite wet.
It’s not a sphere that sees many visitors as there are no known other gates connecting it to other spheres beyond.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It has been a pleasant trek so far. The land here is only lightly wooded, but heavily farmed.
We pass miles of brown squares where crops have recently been harvested, and a few fields of winter wheat still
waiting for the blade. Despite the emptiness of upcoming winter, the abundance of sunshine has kept us pleasantly
warm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki has tried to convince me that a new dragon could be a clue towards locating more of the
nine scales. I’m not so sure. The scales have been hidden for five thousand years. I don’t think our pointer will
be something new. Still, we will have to test our magic-working there. I’ve threatened to test it by levitating
Loki, suggesting that if the magic didn’t work, he’d be destroyed. More likely, he’d just fall, but I enjoyed baiting
him. Actually, since the magic seems to have a tendency to backfire on the wielder, he’d probably fall on top of<U>
me</U>. I’m sure we can find a safer method of testing the sphere once we get there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>14 Mare - Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Our luck with the weather has run out. Today we were drenched in thunderstorms that raged all
day. It penetrated our oilcloth jackets in less than a candlemark. I was able to use my sphere of warmth to keep
my clothes warm and dry underneath for a while, but the icy water pouring down my neck would not be dispelled,
and too soon, the power faded. Swiftwing came and rode on my shoulder, most of the day. Her feathers kept the water
off her skin, but there she could take advantage of the warmth as well, while it lasted. I think she’s the only
one of the party still in good spirits this evening. Our packs and belongings are soaked. I’ve done my best to
dry everyone out once we found shelter, but everyone’s tired and uncomfortable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>15 Mare - Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It rained again all morning. The sun returned this afternoon, but the wind remained and we were
all thoroughly chilled. At first, everyone rode close together so I could project a sphere of warmth about us all,
but the wind stole the heat as fast I could make it. Fortunately, the weather hasn’t slowed us too much. We should
be at the gate by noon tomorrow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>23 Mare - Rainbow Jungle</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Rainbow Jungle isn’t quite what I was expecting it to be. There’s only one small village of about
two or three hundred people here. When we’d first come across the encampment, I’d assumed it was but a neighboring
settlement outside of the main city where we’d find Rules Silently. When I’d asked to speak to the woman in charge,
I was surprised to find that this was Rules Silently’s city, and the only human habitation in the sphere.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It’s a village composed of wooden huts with thatch roofs lying at the base of a huge and ancient
pyramid. As Pious told us, the people here are dark-skinned, almost black as ebony. We spoke to Rules Silently
through his aid, Speaks Royally. Rules Silently is not naturally mute; this is their traditional method of ruling.
When a pretender becomes the monarch, they cease their speaking. Other trades are administered by one who’s earned
the title of &quot;Great.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The story of the dragon appears to be true. We’ve seen the three remaining walls of the new stone
worship center they were building and the beautiful dragon Great Painter placed on the far side. It is a twin to
the dragon he painted on the destroyed wall. Great Painter made them both without eyes, so they couldn’t see the
world and wish to be part of it. His apprentice, a youth whose name is not even spoken, painted the eye in on one
dragon and it came to life, destroying the wall which fell upon the youngster, killing him. From the matching painting,
it is a serpentine dragon as long as four women are tall, with small, useless wings, and great rending claws. The
dragon has not yet attacked the village, although Great Hunter was killed when he led a party to find and destroy
the beast. This all occurred within the last month. The dragon is destroying the herds of elephants that the tribe
uses for survival; for meat, clothing and tools carved from its ivory. The dragon has also prevented them from
getting to the quarry to get the stone they need to repair and complete the building they had begun.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We visited Great Dreamer, the spiritual leader who had had the building commissioned. She’s greatly
distressed over the behavior of the dragon. She had requested them on the temple as all their legends portray dragons
as great and sacred creatures, the first creations of the deity. This dragon does not meet her expectations. We
talked to her about the different dragons we’ve met and worked with, as well as those who have not been allies.
She’s impressed by our knowledge and believes that we can find a solution. She uses a kind of Chalice magic and
does not report any special problems with using magic here. Would she know it, if it were a problem they’d always
lived with?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Great Painter, we were told, would not talk to strangers or even members of his own people, but
he did see us when he heard about our acquaintance with dragonkind. His paintings were beautiful, but none matched
the quality of the remaining dragon on the temple wall. He told us that he rarely used the great skill that had
given him his name, as he’d seen his paintings come alive before. He told us to remember that the dragon is still
a painting, not a real dragon. We talked to our guide, Runs Swiftly, and others of the village who confirmed that
while the dragon hunts and kills, it does not consume its prey. It does not eat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">With this in mind, I’d like to find some way to destroy it as one would a painting. The paints
are based in oil, so they will not be damaged by water, but they can still be burned, or wiped clean with oil,
although I don’t know how to go about erasing a living dragon. Loki wishes to treat it simply as a creature. It
does not appear to fly, so his plan is to create a pit to trap it in and then kill it with spears, arrows, and
flaming oil. I don’t have a better plan just yet, but I’m working on it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The evening ended with a great feast where we regaled the village with stories of our encounters
with dragon-kind, the good and the bad. Great Teller, the historian, told us many stories of his people. He told
us ancient tales of when the dragons fought with heaven against a great danger. Their tales don’t mention who the
enemy was. Having seen what the painted dragon has done, he’s willing to accept that the enemy may have been an
opposing group of dragons. A month ago the thought of a dragon opposing heaven would have been unthinkable, but
now they’ve seen that not all dragons are helpful. Great Tower doesn’t know anything about the people who built
the great stone pyramids. There are no stories about them. The pyramids were old when the tribe was young. Some
say they were built during the Great War with Heaven. A great mystery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I used the feast as an opportunity to test my magic by levitating some grapes in my direction.
It worked perfectly well, so I delighted the children by magically sending fruits to each of them. It’s gratifying
to know that my magic will work when we try to handle this dragon, although it does mean that it is likely that
we will not be finding any of the nine scales of the Deceiver here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki has been boldly propositioning the women here, but so far they’ve all shown the good sense
to refuse him. We’ve learned that Rules Silently came to the thrown recently when the former monarch died suddenly.
I think the unattached women here would be much more interested in him, than an uncouth white-skinned stranger.
But I don’t see them pursuing him openly, either, paying him only simple homage and respect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">This evening, we’re staying with Speaks Royally and his wife, Smiles Brightly. Tomorrow, we’ll
have to take some action. The village has given us gifts of carved ivory and jewelry in appreciation for deeds
not yet done. Lady willing, we’ll be able to earn this fine tribute.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>24 Mare - Rainbow Jungle</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We’ve found the dragon and have changed our approach entirely. The next Great Hunter is keeping
the poor creature trapped in a pond and tomorrow we’re going to a distant mountaintop to talk to a spirit. Here’s
what happened.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We started off with the woman who will be the next Great Hunter when the period of mourning for
the last one is over. Her party led us toward the Northwest, the area in which evidence of the dragon was most
frequently sighted. None of the people here have seen the dragon in action, only the great clawed tracks where
it walked and its many dead victims.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki had set the villagers to making spears out of the ivory tusks they have, and containers
of oil to light and through upon the dragon when it’s trapped in the pit. The children were instructed to make
a great net by which the mouth of the pit could be hidden. We stopped less than two candlemarks away by horse,
and began to dig Loki’s pit. A short while later while we continued to dig, Loki left to return to the village
and determine the progress of the other tasks. Then the dragon came.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust and I fought with it, using arrows and fire to no avail. Even Wanderlust’s poisons
did not deter it. Finally I threw my scimitar, propelled further with magic, into the beast’s side. Then the dragon
turned and ran off. Wanderlust and I gave chase, recovering my scimitar where it had been scrapped from its body.
We chased it into a lagoon, where it stayed underwater for an impossibly long time. I asked Wanderlust to go back
and fetch Great Dreamer and the hunters while I waited. And waited. Just when I had decided that the dragon must
be able to breathe underwater, it raised its head to get a breath of air. I fired at it, trying to keep it away.
It looked at me then as if it recognized me and had been hoping I’d not be there. At that moment, it no longer
looked like an unthinking beast.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When Wanderlust finally returned with the others, we waited some more, watching for the dragon.
It finally raised its head for the second time and quickly began to retreat when it saw us. I tried to speak to
it, and it seemed to hear and understand, but did not respond. Quickly, it disappeared under the lagoon again.
Great Dreamer said that we needed to conduct a spirit-seeking to converse directly with the dragon’s spirit. She
would be the anchor but needed another to carry over the spiritual distances. I volunteered.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">After creating a circle and burning incense, Great Dreamer went into a trance and began her invocation.
I saw smoke and sparkles that reached out to grab me and I became disembodied. It felt much like the vision quests
I’d been on. After the smoke cleared, I could see everyone on the shore of the lagoon, including myself. They each
had a visible aura. Wanderlust’s felt like music, a happy tune written in a minor key. Loki’s was just dark. In
a moment, I was drawn down into the water of the lagoon. The dragon was there and I could see its aura, too. It
was colorful, but incomplete. I tried to speak to it, but it didn’t seem to see me. Then my spirit was pulled up
and away, flying away from the lagoon and over land at great speed. Soon, I arrived at a mountaintop that was covered
with the bones of a great dragon. The skull was huge enough to make me wonder if it was one of the first dragons.
But then, I was back at the lagoon and in my own body again.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Great Dreamer was amazed when I told them all what I’d seen. She was especially puzzled and interested
in my description of the dragon’s incomplete aura. The villagers knew nothing of a mountain with a dragon skeleton
on top, but I know I’d be able to find it easily. We’ve decided to leave the hunters at the lake, keeping the beast
at bay. Tomorrow, Great Dreamer will go with us to this mountain to discover what we can. Tonight, we are back
in the village.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>25 Mare - Rainbow Jungle</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We traveled all day today, walking north towards the mountain I saw in my vision. Great Dreamer
rode on my mare. I knew which way to go, although I didn’t have a clear idea of how far it would be. Finally, at
nightfall, we’ve arrived at the base of the mountain which I believe holds the great skeleton. Tomorrow, we will
begin our climb. I hope the hunters are doing well in keeping the poor animal contained.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>26 Mare - Dragon Mountain, Rainbow Jungle</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Well, I have no further need to be jealous of Wanderlust for still having her crystal skull while
I do not. She doesn’t have hers any longer, either. Instead, we have something even more amazing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">It took almost the whole day to get up the mountain. We left the
horses below, but it was still fairly passable, even for Great Dreamer. At the top, however, it was far too steep
for her. Even Loki had some trouble. Wanderlust climbed like a mountaingoat. I don’t think she ever takes a miss-step.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Great Dreamer was willing to wait, but I felt I needed her at the
top. I used a spell to carry her and Runs swiftly to the top after the rest of us climbed up. Once there, I thought
we would rest a while, but the sight of the tremendous dragon skeleton invigorated everyone. It was ancient, and
covered with dust. Great Dreamer warned us all not to touch it, and immediately started her spell circle. She didn’t
need me to act as a traveler this time, since the dragon was before us. Her spell produced the same sparkling smoke
as before. This time, it became a bright column containing the image of a dragon’s head. It looked to Wanderlust
and her crystal skull flew from her pack. Held in the air, it changed into a crystal sphere about the size of a
walnut with the image of a dragon within. The dragon disappeared then and Great Dreamer could not call it up again.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">It was disappointing to not be able to speak to this spirit, but
our mission seems clear. We must bring the orb to the dragon in the lake. The spirit within will be united with
the incomplete spirit of the creature. Then, we will see what becomes if it. This sphere’s traditions are only
of good dragons, and I hope they are not wrong.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We found a cave to spend the night in. Loki complained bitterly
about the lack of Draconic treasure there, but it suits us well as a shelter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>27 Mare - Dragon Mountain, Rainbow Jungle</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It took all day to descend the mountain. My magic was useful in levitating Great Dreamer over
the rough and steep parts. We are camping at the base of the mountain again. I don’t know about the others, but
I am most eager to see what will happen when we get back to the lagoon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>28 Mare - The Village, Rainbow Jungle</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We reached the village again after another all day trek. I would have expected this effort to
leave Great Dreamer tired, but she remains invigorated. She’s as excited about this as any of us. We didn’t see
Great Painter. He’s still in isolation in his hut outside the village, and it seemed rude to seek him out at this
hour. I hope we’ll be able to speak to him in the morning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The villagers have told us that the hunters continue to keep the dragon trapped in its lagoon.
The creature hasn’t taken any action against them, but seems content to wait for them to leave. Tomorrow, we will
see what will happen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>1</B> <B>Hero - The Village, Rainbow Jungle</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Success! I want to dance through the skies, but I’ve already done as much of that as my magic
can sustain for today. We have restored the dragon and made a friend. The village held another great feast for
us, and named us all &quot;Great Hero.&quot; I had thought there could be only one &quot;Great&quot; at a time,
but apparently heroes are different.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">When we arrived at the lagoon late this morning, we were told that
the dragon would soon be surfacing again. Having watched her for days, the hunters were well aquatinted with her
cycle. When it rose, I used a levitation spell to send the crystal orb towards the dragon. It flashed like lightning
and the dragon reared. The light surrounded the dragon, turned green and disappeared. When it did, the dragon looked
at us and calmly asked, &quot;Who are you?&quot; The dragon was larger than it had been, but not as large as the
skeleton on the mountain. Its wings had become fully functioning and its eyes were bright and intelligent. Despite
that, it was like a newborn. She didn’t know what or who she was.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We explained that it was a dragon and we were her friends. Great
Dreamer gifted her with the name &quot;Flies High.&quot; A regal name for a regal dragon. She accepted that she
would be a protector of the village, ‘though they had little need of protection. Strong as the dragon was now,
it was able to carry almost everyone as it flew. I flew under my own power to ease her burden and guide the way
to the village.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We created quite a stir when we landed, but the people have willingly
accepted her as an ally, pleased to see their beliefs in the nobility of dragonkind proven true. Rules Silently
and Speaks Royally welcomed Flies High to the village, and they pledged to be friends forever. Before Great Painter
could be summoned to see the restored dragon, she flew off to explore the sphere. I believe she will find happiness
here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Great Painter was urged from his isolation at the news, looking
as restored as Flies High itself. That was worth more than all the feasting. But now, &quot;Great Hero Lightfoot&quot;
is ready for sleep.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>2 Hero - The Village, Rainbow Jungle.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">More feasting today! You would never guess that just recently these
fine people had feared for the loss of the elephants that provide their food. They love to celebrate. They’re planning
two more days of this. One of the young ones, an apprentice to Great Dreamer, has been teaching me some of their
traditional dances.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I got away for a while and spent some time looking over the great
stone buildings, but had to return to the village when a thunderstorm broke in the afternoon. I wish I knew more
about the pyramid. I pressed Great Teller for more stories, but he has little to tell. They were then when the
tribe arrived. Legend says only that they were built by the Gods.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I remembered today to send a message to Lady Silverbell about the
end of the dragon danger here. We’ll stay till the end of the feasting and then be on our way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>3 Hero - The Village, Rainbow Jungle</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I didn’t get a chance to venture near the stone buildings today.
I sat with &quot;Great Hero Wanderlust&quot; and &quot;Great Hero Loki&quot; for a portrait by Great Painter. He
used only ordinary skill, having vowed to never again use the talent that made it possible to see paintings come
to life. I think Great Dreamer should have had a place in the portrait, too, as she was a great part of what accomplishing
our task, but Great Painter insists the painting is to be of us alone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I spent part of the afternoon with Great Dreamer. She seems a wise
woman and I would like to seek her council concerning Corona, but I don’t believe I should burden her with that.
The rest of the day was spent in additional feasting by the village and Rules Silently.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>4 Hero - The Village, Rainbow Jungle</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We were grounded enough to leave two days ago, but still we remain.
I grow bored with the continued feasting and partying. Rules Silently wishes us to remain, pleased to have his
heroes among his people. Smiles Brightly is more than gracious. Loki and Wanderlust wish to stay another day or
two, also, but I desire to return to Roundwander, so I may from there go on to Ten Thousand Islands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I spent some time in the morning moving the rocks from the rubble
of the wall, under the direction of Great Builder. He wants to re-fashion the wall himself, so I merely used my
magic to levitate the few remaining good stones to a neat pile on one side and clearing the broken ones away.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">After relaxing for while with Smiles Brightly, I spent most of the
early afternoon with Runs Swiftly surveying the great pyramid near the village. I flew over and around it, trying
to see every side. There was no sign of a door. On the lower third of the pyramid there are a few small plants
growing in some of the creases where soil has collected. Higher up, the stone is clean and bare.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>5 Hero - The Village, Rainbow Jungle</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Wanderlust and Loki are ready to return to Everway tomorrow. I guess
Loki’s finally grown frustrated with his lack of success with the women here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Great Builder led his first return to the quarry today. Accompanying
them, I found the quarry to be a bare hillside with a small stream running through the lower side. The stone is
cut back in places where it is carved into the desired shapes and then lifted onto sleds and pulled to the village.
I would have been pleased to help with that task, but none of the stone was ready to be moved just then. I don’t
know anything about rock carving, so I left that to them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Exploring, I found a small opening in the pyramid, about two-thirds
of the way up. It is square, less than a span across. I dug it out as much as I could and found a small tunnel
leading down into the heart of the building, but there was no way to know how deep it was, or where it would lead.
Yesterday, I was more than ready to go, but today, I’d almost rather stay and learn more about this mystery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Still, Ten Thousand Islands awaits. The possibility of finding another
Scale, or learning more of the connection between the ogres and Corona, is a much more important mystery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>13 Hero - Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We’ve arrived back in the cold of Roundwander. No rain today, thankfully, but chilly and windy.
Three more days to get to Everway.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>14 Hero - Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Loki was complaining today that I still don’t seem to trust him,
and we’ve known each other for almost a year now. It has been nearly a year since we met but a lot of that was
spent apart, or between gates. Still, I’ve counted it up, and we’ve been together traveling, or living at the Strangerside
Estate for almost six months now. Most of that was during our three-month trip to Remnant. In all that time, he
hasn’t ever stolen from me, nor betrayed us. He was true to his mission of subterfuge in Sunrise, and I haven’t
seen any evidence of him or anyone spreading our secrets to any enemies of Silverbell or ourselves. In fact, he
was even helpful to Merry in Remnant. Maybe I have been miss-judging him. Something about him just doesn’t seem
honest, but I will<U> <I>try</I></U> to be less unfriendly to him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Sadly, I’ve spent even less time with Willow. Less than three months.
But I’m not a child, and we’re both worried about Misty/Corona. She knows I’m doing my best to resolve those questions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>17 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I’d been hoping to get back to Ten Thousand Islands and at last we’re going! It seems that there
is something twisting the magic there. It <I>must</I> be another dragon scale. And Wildfire is getting married,
and we are all rich!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When we arrived back at the Strangerside Estate, we found Silverbell in the midst of a great
commotion. There were people everywhere and several small chests of gold and jewelry. Silverbell gave us each a
chest containing about 25,000 hefts! I could buy five normal houses in Strangerside with this. Or half of an estate
like this one. This was our share of the &quot;Finder’s fee&quot; for the dragon’s treasure we discovered on Remnant.
Silverbell had sent back an expedition while we were in Sunrise, and they recovered the treasure and books.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Most of Lady Aria’s huge share of the bounty went to paying off the Crow family for their help
in Sunrise, and also to paying off all her outstanding debts with the Diggers. She’s exuberant about this, but
the Diggers are not. They no longer have any leverage against her. I would not be surprised if she makes her bid
for the Council now. Most of the Families on the Council are also heavily in debt to the Diggers, but all her assets
are freed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I could live for years without working now, if I chose to. If I knew how to invest it in the
money-house, I may be able to live out my years on this reward.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">After the Diggers, and messengers left, Silverbell brought out a
sealed message for us from Wildfire at Ten Thousand Islands. I was going to ask if Silverbells’ messengers had
managed to contact the merfolk on Remnant, expecting to find the answer to be no. The people of Remnant hadn’t
even known of the Merfolks’ existence among them, so infrequent was their contact. Obviously, things have changed.
Silverbell’s confirmed that the Merfolk seem to be allowing much greater contact with the surface-dwellers since
our visit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The message announced Wildfire’s upcoming marriage to a man named
Speaking Lion. She seems very happy. She’s become a great warrior among their people. The Ogres continue to attack,
but she says they’re not a great problem. The battleships from Bright Oceans haven’t help as they’d hoped.. The
magic used to create them doesn’t work there. All of the magic is twisted and turns back on its wielder. Still,
trade continues between the two peoples and they’ve helped in each other’s battles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Loki wasn’t excited about the idea, but Wanderlust and I are definitely
going to pay Wildfire a visit. Wanderlust is still interested in finding and stopping the ogres wherever they are.
I found two small, but nearly identical sapphires and brought them to the Golds to be made into earrings before
our departure. I think Wildfire will like a gift of &quot;God’s bones.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>18 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Loki’s bought the<I><U> Beaked Lizard</U></I> in the Outsider Quarter and hired the staff to
stay on for him. He’s hired a manager, too, as he seems to never be able to hold onto his own money. The purchase
required almost three-quarters of his reward, and he’s already committed the rest of it to improvements and new
hires. Luckily, he’s hired a manager for that so Loki won’t be the one making decisions on the help.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust hasn’t decided what she plans to do. She’s mentioned leaving her reward in Silverbell’s
stronghold, saving it against a time when she can use it to help her people. I don’t know how much it can do for
them. A fortune for one, won’t go as far for a whole realm, but I suppose it’s a start.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I haven’t decided how I will use my bounty at all. I’d like to do something more productive than
leaving it with Lady Silverbell, but that is probably the best choice for the short term. At least until we’ve
returned from Ten Thousand Islands. I’ll have to find a good investment if it’s to last the rest of my long life.
But, those are worries for another day.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Since it looks like we’ll be here for a few more days, I went to
visit Sunshine. I wasn’t going to ask for her help in finding an opening for performing when I’m leaving so soon,
but I do want something to do to pass the time. I spent the day running errands, and helping with the outsider
children’s lessons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>20 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We’re grounded but not yet ready to depart. Silverbell’s household
is gathering new supplies for the trip. Loki has suggested that in the metal-poor sphere of Ten Thousand Islands,
a gift of metal spear-heads would be appreciated. The Smiths are working on his request. Silverbell’s bakers are
busy preparing journey food and the Weavers are making new clothing for the trip.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I have gathered some material for making another spell amulet. I
would like to give it to Wildfire as a wedding gift, although I don’t know if I’ll be able to find the time to
create it. It obviously won’t be possible before our departure, but perhaps an opportunity will occur while we

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We had snow flurries all day long. After helping with some music
lessons, I spent much of the afternoon in the Library of All Worlds. Most of the information they have about Magebane
is written by the Seekers, but there’s precious little about how and why the magic became twisted as it is.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Wind believed that the Scale is what caused the slow corruption
there and in Living Forest, but in my visionquest, there was a mage, a guardian spirit, who claimed to have set
up the curse on magic there, to hinder those who would seek the Scale. Could Magebane have had a Guardian Spirit,
too? But Whitefeather did not mention that there was any similar there that allowed magic to function correctly
again. And the magic there does more than just fail. According to the tales, it corrupts any who try to practice
the art. I think the Guardian Spirit saw the potential for corruption occurring and setup the barriers to using
magic to prevent it. Passing the vision quest allows the use of magic and protects the mage from the corrupting
influence of the scale. Ten Thousand Islands may, or may not, have a similar means for avoiding the consequences
of the scale. We’ll know in time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>22 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Preparations are finally done and we’ll be leaving for Remnant in
the morning. Surprisingly, Loki is still planning to come along. I rather suspected that since he now has an independent
source of income and is no longer beholden to Lady Silverbell, that he’d leave our group. He’s not in favor of
seeking out the Scales, ogres, or other trouble, and this isn’t even a task that Silverbell’s asked us to take
up. It will probably be better for his business if he’s away, but I still wonder why he would chose to accompany
us. I’m also a bit surprised that this doesn’t bother me. I wouldn’t say that I like him, or that I trust him,
but I no longer feel that he’s actively looking for a way to cheat or betray us. I wonder why.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I spent most of the day with Willow. I haven’t had much time with
her since her arrival on Roundwander, and now, I’m likely to be gone until the end of Goddess. We walked for hours
on the shore of Shimmermoon bay, talking. She hasn’t tried to dissuade me. She knows how important this is to me.
Still, I do understand her sorrow. Morning Mist was her daughter. If there’s anyway to turn her, and restore her,
I will find it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>3 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We arrived in the early afternoon to find Bizzarre much as we had
left it. Panther’s ship was waiting, as we’d been told. Silverbell’s hirelings had paid the sailor to be available
for any parties the Lady might send through. I was glad to see her and she seemed pleased to see us all again.
Her reputation has been enhanced greatly since her encounters with the MerFolk.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Panther will need a day or two to prepare for the journey, so we
spent the day collecting the local gossip. I asked if anyone had heard any stories of dragons or flying machines
from the north where the mountains bleed fire. I was surprised to hear that &quot;huge birds&quot; had been sighted
from the north in just the past few weeks. Of dragons we’ve heard nothing. People are much more interested in telling
tales of the amazing merfolk.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Loki was distressed to hear me asking about the sky-ships and dragons,
fearful that we will be diverting to find them. We’ve assured him that we’re going directly to Ten Thousand Islands,
but he’s convinced that if we show an interested we’ll be heading that way, also. I know I want to. If we could
find those ships and use them, we could travel much more quickly overland, and possibly discover something about
the references in the dragon journals to a city &quot;hidden from the eyes of Heaven.&quot; I <I>would</I> like
to spend some time investigating on our return trip, but I didn’t mention that to Loki.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>4 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Today we heard a tale about a dragon that’s said to be guarding
a great treasure in the north, ‘though youth who repeated it was roundly criticized for her gullibility. I think
that one must be a reference to the dragon whom we’d encountered outside the cave where we found the books, the
one Wildfire called &quot;The Guardian.&quot; I assured her that I myself had seen a dragon and told her the story
of our encounter with the Guardian, leaving out mention of the treasure itself. She was greatly pleased to be supported
in her belief.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Stories of the great birds, however, are clearly believed, ‘though
the people attach little importance to them. Several persons have seen them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>5 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We were able to ship off at dawn today, heading west to the Southernmost
Trading Post. Loki’s looking especially glum. He’s more than uncomfortable on shipboard. I can’t help but empathize,
‘though I’ve said nothing to him. In fact, I’ve been teasing him about it, telling him how easily we could dangle
him over the edge if he gave us cause. But, he hasn’t, and the threats aren’t nearly so much fun when he’s been
behaving. I did promise myself that I would try to be nice to him. Thinking on it, I see that I have been most
unkind to him, ‘though he has given me no visible reason. I have been suspicious of all he’s done, but have seen
no sign of untrustworthiness. In this way, I have been the one who was unlikable and given him no reason to be
my ally and friend.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>7 Emeralds - Southern Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We had a heavy thunderstorm in the afternoon. If we were inland,
I’m sure it would have been a blizzard. As it was, we were soaking wet in minutes. Panther and her crew worked
furiously to keep the ship on course in the wild winds. The same wind whipped away my sphere of warmth, so I couldn’t
help them, but I tried to keep it warm below so they’d be able to dry out when they were done.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Here at last. In a week’s time, we may see Bright Oceans again.
We’re staying in port tonight, and spent some time asking around about great birds and dragons. They’ve seen the
great birds here, too, ‘though apparently not as frequently as the people of Bizzarre.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The southerners did have a disquieting tale about a dragon. It’s
said that the charred body of a dragon was found on a mountain near a cave containing a great treasure. I don’t
understand why Silverbell’s hirelings hadn’t mentioned that to her, or if they had, why she didn’t mention it to
us. It’s hard to imagine something powerful enough to incinerate a dragon. The dragon we found here had spoken
about getting in trouble for allowing its treasure to be disturbed. But if this was its punishment, why wasn’t
the treasure moved, or a new guardian put in its place? And if it wasn’t dragonkind that killed the guardian, would
not some other raider have also taken the treasure? It doesn’t make sense, so perhaps the tale isn’t true.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">There are also unbelieved tales of sea serpents in the area. Those
probably refer to the Dark Ones, but it could be dragons sighted in the waters. In any case, we believe them and
Panther will be sure her crew is doubly watchful.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">With great uncertainty, given the recent weather, I have begun work
on the talisman for Wildfire and her husband. If weather holds, it will be done when we reach the emissaries of
the Merfolk.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">It was nearly sunset when we arrived at the place where we’d first
encountered the Merfolk, and we’ve slowed nearly to a stop. There’s been no sign of them yet. The amulet is done.
I hope we’ll soon be going below and on to The Thousand Islands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>26 Emeralds - Western Sea, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">A great thunderstorm began late this afternoon and continues still.
All are secure below as we continue our wait.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We’ve still seen no sign of the Merfold, and I am beginning to become
worried. Last time, I was most impressed at how much they seemed to know of the surface ships. I hope they are
not too badly besieged by the Dark Ones to manage a messenger or guide.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>27 Emeralds - Emerald Reef, Bright Oceans, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I’d forgotten what a beautiful place this is. Its unfortunate that
we won’t be able to stay longer. Maybe we’ll be able to spend a few days on our return. I’d still like to talk
to White Pearl or one of her historians about the legends of the origins of her people, and Umbra’s possible involvement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">A patrol of Merfolk arrived late in the day and bade us wait while
they returned for the amulets that would allow us to breathe underwater. Thus it was nearly evening when we arrived
at Emerald Reef. Queen White Pearl had received news of our arrival and greeted us warmly. She remembered Wildfire
fondly and was pleased to hear of her good fortune. The queen readily agreed to take us out to the gate to Ten
Thousand Islands, and told us a warship would be heading in that direction in the morning that could accommodate
us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We talked to her about the problems with the trade in magically
powered warship technology. She confirmed that manufacturing the ships in Ten Thousand Islands would not work.
Magical items like the amulets that are made here and transported there still function, but the magic doesn’t work
there. Also, now that the two peoples have established an alliance, they’ve dispensed with Loki’s fiction about
the amulets limitations and the Merfolk’s magic. They now know the truth of it and several of the people of the
Ten Thousand Islands have visited Bright Oceans for short periods of time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Wildfire’s husband seems like a nice fellow. Speaking Lion is a
teacher and a scholar. The warriors here don’t think much of that pursuit, but Wildfire is happy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We arrived shortly after noon in the enlarged mouth of the river.
A guard party greeted us and summoned Wildfire and Starchaser. Chief Starchaser arrived first. Contrary to Wildfire’s
optimistic assessment, Starfire says that the Ogres have been a great problem, coming from the east to attack the
southernmost of the five turtles. Starchaser’s people have managed to sink a few of their ships with the help of
the merfolk. They believe that the ogres do not know of the merfolk’s involvement in the conflict, as all who have
seen them have died. Loki suggested that he have those ships searched for signs of some other creature, since the
ogres themselves have not acted on their own direction in our experience.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Later, we met with Wildfire and her husband. They are well, and
were happy with our gifts. We mentioned the stories about the death of &quot;the Guardian.&quot; She suspects her
old shaman, Caldera, might have been capable of such a feat, but I doubt that. Wildfire’s continued as a warrior,
here with her new people. She held a nice feast for us - alligator meat and eggs. It was quite nice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Speaking Lion does not have any new information about the Ogres,
but he told us again the legends of his people. The people had all lived on a continent to the East. The ogres
appeared on a different continent destroying it on their arrival. The ogres arrived with a company of humans and
monsters and soon invaded the people’s continent, driving them into the islands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We awoke this morning to a message from Chief Starchaser. The merfolk
found two of the dragonmen in the wreckage of the ships, one on each vessel. They also found a survivor, SharkCatcher,
who had been lost at sea. The poor man had managed to hide on one of the ogre’s ships when his own had been sunk.
He saw what they were doing on the southern turtle. Dozens of creatures were digging, and one in five of them were
a dragonman. They also had human slaves. One hole a hundred paces across had been abandoned, and now they were
working on a larger site three hundred paces away. They are dumping the dirt from the pit into the water between
two docks near a stone house. Strangely, he reports that the dirt causes the water to boil and the fish to die.
Poisoned earth, I would understand. But how could it cause boiling? If it was hot like lava, how could the Ogres
move it?</FONT></P>
