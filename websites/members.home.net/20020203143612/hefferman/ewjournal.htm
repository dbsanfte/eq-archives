<P><FONT SIZE="5"><B>Everway Journal</B></FONT> - By Lightfoot Dancer (Patti Hemeleski)</P>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE="2"><B>&nbsp;</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>13 Angel - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Tomorrow, I shall be away on a new adventure. It began this morning at the Library when I received
a message from a &quot;Lady Silverbell&quot;. She asked that I meet with her in the Library of All Worlds in the
afternoon. I've only been in Everway for a few months, but I know that name. They may not be on the Council, but
they do run most of the Entertainers in Everway proper. Wondering if she’d heard me play, I came right on time.
I was disappointed to learn that she was looking for some sphere-walkers not musicians and learned of me through
my hauntings at the library, not my performances.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Lady Silverbell desires a group of spherewalkers to journey to a place called Stonedeep. This
realm is in a sphere achieved directly from Roundwander via a place called Sweetwater, which I'd never heard of
before today. According to Silverbell, Sweetwater was ravaged by a dragon or dragons and became impassable, so
no living soul has seen Stonedeep for 300 years. Sweetwater is supposedly passable now and she did entreat us to
go see what's become of the place. There are Families here who once had kin there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> I see that I am most certainly not going to find my sister in a place that's been isolated for
300 years, but it seems interesting and it promises to pay well. It will pass the time while I wait for a sign
of her. I left messages for Misty with the Hosts and Watchers in the Outsider Quarter in case she arrives here
while I'm gone. I left another with the Outsider bards, and paid my guild dues ahead for the weeks I'll be away.
As I intend to return, it seems best that I leave on good terms with the fledgling house. They don't charge too
much, since their authority is so limited, but they can help a performer in trouble and trouble is easy to find
in Strangerside. Eight week's tribute takes almost half of the advance Silverbell gave us, but I don't think I'll
be needing much for living expenses for the next couple months.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Lady Silverbell had called five sphere-walkers to her meeting, and
three of us accepted the job. I’ll be traveling with a woman called Wanderlust, and a small man called Mach. Silverbell
will be providing an escort up to the gate to Stonedeep, but only the three of us will be continuing beyond that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>21 Angel - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Sweetwater is a dreadful place. Once it was supposed to be heavenly
as the name suggests but now, it's a wasteland. It’s mostly flat and clear and speaks of a former existence as
expansive farmland. Stands of trees and large patches of grasses and wildflowers have been blasted and burned.
The streams are brackish and foul. The mules are carrying a dozen barrels of fresh water. I hope it will be enough.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Silverbell’s guide is a young woman called Hazard. She’s thin, strong
and extremely competent. Hazard has been an escort for the Silverbells for almost ten years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust is a noblewoman from a mountainous realm on some remote sphere. She’s of an age with
me, or perhaps younger, but human. Her cliffside home was recently invaded by brutish creatures lead by an unknown
evil mage. Her people had prided themselves on pacifism, and living in harmony with all creatures. They had no
defenses against this invasion. The realm has suffered greatly, and she’s ridden out on a quest in hopes of learning
more about the origins of these creatures, and the motive and weaknesses of the enemy mage. Her need and her quest
have turned her from her peoples’ ways and made of her a great fighter. Wanderlust can speak to birds, and she
travels with a raptor called Swiftwing. She also has some small talent at magical healing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The man called Mach is barely taller than my waist and he tells
us he’s a gnome. He seems to be about twice my age, but his people are as long-lived as mine and he’s young yet.
He’d been working for a mage, creating machines of war, until he’d discovered that his machines were being used
to invade and oppress innocent realms. He fled the realm, and continues to live in fear that he’ll be discovered
by the mage by whom he was once employed. Wanderlust has questioned him closely, trying to determine if this mage
was the same one who’d sent the monsters against her land, but Mach doesn’t know. Her land was invaded only by
the beasts, not machines of war, so it might not be the same mage, but we think it may be.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I told them a little about my past, about the battle that destroyed
my home when I was a small child, how we found shelter in the wonderful forest home I’d shared with my sister and
mother in a community of others like ourselves, and how my sister and I had become separated from them and later
from each other. I didn’t mention the green-eye mage that’s been haunting my nightmares for as long as I can remember.
With all the talk of evil mages, I wonder if there could be a connection, but something made me keep that to myself.
Afterall, she or he might be just my imagination.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>22 Angel - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The land continues to be barren and scarred. It is perhaps a bit
more rocky but mostly the same - flat, with only a few clusters of trees and gently rolling hills. The charred
land may be good for green growing things again in time. Days are sunny and the travel has been easy on the body,
if not the spirit. The land is so desolate. It had seemed unwise to carry my lute, but now I am thankful for the
distraction of my music.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>23 Angel - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">This morning we awoke to a cool Angel rain. It was rather steady
but was over before noon. We have only cold food for breakfast to save our water, so we didn’t need to worry about
starting a fire in the wet. I did use my sphere of warmth power to dry out the tarps for easier storage and carrying.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The land is becoming more rocky and dark. It’s not as level as it
was and there are more and larger areas blackened by fire or torn apart, presumably by this legendary dragon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>24 Angel - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The weather was absolutely beautiful today, but the scenery has not improved. The area where
we first arrived was mostly flat and open, with some scattered bits of trees, and what might have once been cultured
orchards. Yesterday, the land began to be more steeply hilly and rocky. The trail is very hard for me to see in
some areas, but Hazard doesn’t seem to have a problem. The trees are more common, perched on rocky crags and separated
by blackened meadows and fields of stone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>25 Angel- Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Another beautiful day. The forest has continued, punctuated by great
gaping holes which have been burned or torn away. Some are as small as a large house, others almost as big as the
city of Everway itself. At mid-day, we entered a forest and haven’t seen the end of it yet. I think we may have
reached the edge of the plains.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>26 Angel - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Traveling without water is becoming quite a burden. I’m used to
bathing everyday. The spot washes our water rationing allows are not very satisfying. At least I don’t have to
worry about catching a chill when my powers can warm the water and the air around me for the duration of my ablutions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>28 Angel - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Tomorrow, we will arrive at the gate to Stonedeep. I'll be so glad to get out of here. I only
hope Stonedeep has fared better than this wretched place. Hazard is going to wait on us for only three weeks before
she returns to Everway. I don't blame her for not wanting to remain longer, but it does not leave us much time
to find out what might be going on there. It’s supposed to be a four day gate, but if our information is wrong,
and the gate is longer than seven days, she’ll be gone before we can return. Hazard has blazed a trail, of course,
so we won’t be lost, but I’d rather travel in her company through this mess.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>1 Judge - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">A fierce thunderstorm rages outside. We’re as secure as we can be, but the wind still comes through,
blowing out our lamps almost as swiftly as they are lit. Only my power to create light is still reliable enough
to write by.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at the gate in early-afternoon, and decided to wait until tomorrow to go through to
Stonedeep. A ring of partially toppled stones mark the edges of a clearing, and the gate stands in the center.
The gate is marked with huge stone columns and a stone lintel. It’s about ten feet wide and ten feet high. The
area is a bit more open, and most of the trees are less than twenty years old. It must have been a large clearing
at one time. All the stones are marked with old soot, as is the ground. I wonder how many may have come through
that gate to meet the blast of a dragon’s fire.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We cleared out a place to camp and have settled in to rest a bit before bracing the unknown beyond.
It started to rain a short while later and soon everything was soaked. Hazard’s had a lot of experience with travel
difficulties, but she was foiled in starting the fire for the evening meal. I offered the assistance of my powers
for the task, and a tight hot sphere of warmth did the job. It’s clear to all why I travel without flint, steel
or tinder box.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Still, this fierce rain is troubling. I hope it’s not an omen of what’s to come.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>6 Judge - Underwood, Stonedeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at Stonedeep a fair bit past sundown. No sooner did we pass through the gate, but
we heard screaming. It was the voice of a young woman and it was coming from quite close by. She was there in a
stone yard with us, a dark-haired woman being menaced by two dark creatures, and we rushed to her aid. It quickly
became apparent that these were skeletons dressed in dark rags. It was a tough fight, but eventually we managed
to crush the monsters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The woman seemed almost as frightened of us as she was of her former attackers. She must have
seen us come through the gate. This sphere's been closed off for so long, I believe they've forgotten how gates
work. After a time, she calmed down and managed to introduce herself as Rarity. She also gave us the unfortunate
news that the skeletons were actually something of a constable force. We're already in trouble with the law. Rarity
told us that she was being taken in to be a bride for the Awakener. Interestingly, she also says her realm is called
&quot;Bonekeep,&quot; not Stonedeep.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust told us then about a vision that she had as we passed through the gates. One of a
dark and powerful being going down a line of beautiful women and destroying each on in turn. It seems like the
Awakener will not be happy with his choice of brides. I do know that no woman should be forced to marry against
her will. We agreed to help Rarity sneak back into town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">That turned out to be easier than we thought. The town was walled, but the walls were largely
crumbling and falling down. We by-passed the gates which were guarded by other dead creatures, and found an easy
place to pass over. Without using lights, we made our way to Rarity's home, a town called Underwood, and were welcomed
by her father, Harvest. He was bothered by what Rarity told him of our appearance at the gate, but he was more
glad to have his only daughter back. He mentioned some local legend about people disappearing from the stone yard,
never to appear again. They must have been un-knowing sphere-walkers stumbling through the gate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Harvest says that the queen, Nightstar, is collecting many beautiful young women from the land
to be married to a dark harbinger of death called the Awakener. Apparently, if he doesn't get a satisfactory bride,
he will destroy the land. If he's given Nightstar this power, he probably can. Still, I wonder why people always
assume that powerful godlings want &quot;beautiful&quot; rather than intelligence, skill, sensitivity or something
else. If he's interested in power, maybe he wants power in a bride. The others don't agree, especially Rarity’s
family. They insist that the stories they know require a bride of &quot;beauty.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>7 Judge - Underwood, Stonedeep/Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">In the morning, we were taken to see Priest Greatheart. He is a priest of Osiris, a god who dies
and is restored by his sister. The sister goddess, Isis, is the official worship here, so those who follow Osiris
are without much influence, but Greatheart is quite popular. He told us that Queen Nightstar has been queen for
many generations and that she is served by the undead. Townfolk who oppose Nightstar are frequently seen later
in the Queen's undead service. The realm has suffered in her reign. Everything seems dead and lifeless. The people
are just managing to survive. They believe that the Queen made a bargain with the Awakener who visits every 50
years, to gain her power and longevity. This time the Awakener demands a bride, and Nightstar is collecting beautiful
women from all over the land. He's due to be arriving in just three days.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Greatheart is the first who has actually recognized the name Stonedeep. He says he read it in
an old story. Later in the day, Greatheart found the book he’d been referring to. We could not read it, as it was
written in a symbolic language different from the Tongue, so Greatheart read it for us. It referenced a scroll
about the beginnings of the Queen Nightstar’s reign and the invasion from the north. It said something like this
<I>...And the Awakener said unto Nightstar, &quot;This shall be my final visit to your realm, for it’s time has
come. It falls to me to awaken Stonedeep to new Life.&quot; She who was to be our queen did not accept the Awakener’s
sentence of death. &quot;My realm has life in it still; it is not ready to die. With your power, I can save Stonedeep
from the invaders, and create a realm that will honor you for all time.&quot; The Awakener thought on her words,
then spoke, &quot;As you wish.&quot; A great scroll appeared in his hand. &quot;Take this scroll. It will unlock
the secrets of power you will need.&quot; Nightstar took the scroll and began to thank him, but he spoke again.
&quot;There shall be a price. Upon my fifth visit hence, I shall claim a bride, the most desirable woman this realm
can offer, one who can fulfill my destiny ... and I shall fulfill hers.&quot; With that, the Awakener vanished
in a blast of flame, leaving only a black rose at Nightstar’s feet.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It sounds like somewhere in the course of events, Nightstar forgot her noble purpose, her love
for the realm, and turned instead to love her power. She isn’t the first, and won’t be the last.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Scepter, where we will find the Queen, is three day's travel by boat heading South, up the Springrise
river, just past the Stone Flat where the Awakener supposedly appears. They don’t have any horses, and walking
will likely take too much time. Unfortunately, the river is highly patrolled by Nightstar's minions, so boating
will be difficult. Mach has come up with a plan to create a flying ship that could get us there more quickly, and
without interference. The townspeople spent much of the day secretly gathering wood and cloth and other materials
which they brought to the barn where we are hiding so Mach can create this miracle. He started his spell-casting
right after the evening meal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Stonedeep was supposed to have only one gate, but it’s clear that this &quot;Stone Flat&quot;
must be another. I wonder where it goes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>8 Judge - Underwood, Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Last night while Mach went into his spell-casting and the rest of us were taking shifts on watch,
we were suddenly attacked by a horde of zombies and other undead creatures. I suppose the townsfolk gathering Mach’s
materials weren't as sneaky and secretive as they thought. It was a horrible fight, and we barely survived. I tried
attacking with fire by igniting oil-soaked rags with my powers and shooting them at the ghouls, but it didn't slow
them down. I always thought they were especially vulnerable to fire, but I suppose the tales are wrong. The creatures
were lead by a woman who we later learned was Priestess Wonder of the church of Isis. Thankfully, she departed
when her creatures were dispatched, for we had little strength left to continue the fight. Wanderlust’s magic healed
my injuries and Mach continued his spell-casting into the night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">This morning we were met by a young woman named Valor. She had been given great fighting skill
by a goddess called Baast. Her father has been taken by Nightstar and she believes he is one of her undead ghouls.
We could certainly use a good fighter. I had considered myself quite skilled, and Wanderlust had said the same
of herself, but we were no match for the minions of Queen Nightstar. The townspeople here are most supportive,
but they don't want to endanger themselves on this quest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The ship was ready to take off before noon, and we made it halfway down the river by nightfall.
There's a lot of anxiety about this, but I'm not worried. If anything goes wrong, I'll just get off. It sure is
convenient to be able to levitate. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to carry any of the others in that case.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The rest of the crew, Wanderlust in particular, have decided that I might be right in that the
Awakener might be looking for something other than &quot;beauty&quot; in a bride. She says the rejected women in
her vision were certainly beautiful. Maybe someone with power, like Queen Nightstar herself, would be a better
choice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>9 Judge - Scepter, Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I can't believe we actually pulled this thing off. It worked! And all in less than four days.
We'll have plenty of time to make it back to the gate and greet our guiding party. Presumably, everything is going
to be fine, now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at StoneFlat near sunset and found the place guarded. The Queen's ghouls couldn't
do much against our flying ship, and we beat them handily. Mach hid the ship behind some trees and we stood in
for the guards at the Stone Flat. It didn't look like a gate, and didn't act like a gate, but the Awakener arrived
as if it were some exceptionally strange gate. We convinced him that we were his honor guard and we traveled with
him to Scepter. It was clear that he wanted to marry Nightstar, but from everything we'd heard, we were certain
that she wasn't going to be willing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I by-passed the guards and went ahead and talk to Queen Nightstar before the Awakener actually
arrived. She wasn't an undead creature herself, just old, worn and weary. She saw the logic in my suggestion, but
she was afraid to accept the Awakener's proposal, afraid of death. The Lady breathed fire on my tongue then, and
I told the Queen, &quot;You already know death. You've known death for three hundred years. Why not take a chance
on Life?&quot; She wasn't convinced right away, but when the Awakener appeared, she did agree to become his bride.
As soon as she did, they both were transformed: he into a great bronze dragon, and she into a beautiful maiden.
There was no death or fear there. The Queen was no longer Nightstar, so Wanderlust gave her a new name, &quot;Joy.&quot;
The former-Awakener said he needed no name. He thanked us and gave us each a small crystalline skull about the
size of my fist, and said that it would &quot;bestow [his] gift on any mortal.&quot; We assume his &quot;gift&quot;
means death, but we don't know how it works. They left then, flying off to the unknown together.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We were able to look through the Queen's treasures and took enough gold and gems to sustain us
for some time. It may be worth as much as eight or nine hundred gold helfs for each of us. I also came across a
small crystal touchstone. If I place it on a magical item, the stone will glow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>10 Judge - Scepter, Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Oh, how I dispise politics! A score of nobles and military officers
are all trying to take charge of the clean-up and position themselves for control of the realm. None of them, especially
those who held any position of power under Nightstar, seem to have any support from the populace. The common people
seem to be the only ones getting anything accomplished. It might be interesting to see how the realm is ruled a
year from now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The merchants organized a festival of sorts in the courtyard outside
the palace. Although it wasn’t a lavish affair, there was enough to share and plenty of festive activities, music
and dance. Earlier in the day, the foot-soldiers organized the youths of the city to remove and bury the bodies
of Nightstar’s undead minions who are now once again properly dead. It had rained during the night and the soil
was heavy and wet. Wanderlust, Valor and I helped with that chore for a while, but then I went on to clearing out
the field where the party was later held.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>11 Judge - near Scepter, Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We stayed in Scepter until noon before heading North towards Underwood and our gate back home.
We had intended to leave just after the morning meal, but were delayed by many festive citizens who wanted to hear
our story again and again. The delay was probably a blessing. Mach’s spelled flying ship unraveled at mid-morning.
I’d have been okay if it had happened while we were aboard, but the others might have had a problem. Since we’re
no longer in a hurry, we decided to travel by ordinary boat, rather than wait for him to recast his spell.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Nobody has seen the dragon or Joy in the area. People seem to accept the story of Nightstar’s
redemption, but I can see in their eyes that they’re still not that anxious to see Joy. I hope that she and the
dragon find a good future together. Fulfilling each other’s destiny.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>12 Judge - Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Our travel has been uneventful. The boat moves downstream slowly
in the lazy current. Wanderlust and I have been talking about the Crystal Skulls we’ve received, but nobody has
any idea how they work. Since we presume they cause death and can only be used once, we’re hesitant to test them.
We don’t want to waste them, or worse, use them wrongly and get someone killed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>13 Judge - Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Did I really say it was a good idea to travel by boat rather than
wait for Mach to recast his spell? The trip is slow, and I’m bored. It rained all day today, a steady drenching
fall. I didn’t dare take my lute out of its case for fear that the wood would become warped. The captain says we
should arrive at Underwood by tomorrow afternoon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>14</B> <B>Judge - Underwood, Bonekeep</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We have finally arrived back at Underwood, and it is still raining. Tomorrow we’ll take the gate
to Sweetwater. We invited Valor to come with us, but she says her place is here, with her people. I'm inclined
to think that she's right. I wonder what it would be like to know where and who your people really are. To know
where you come from and how you got to where you are. One day I'll know the answers to such things myself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I took advantage of the wait to take one more luxurious bath, and
bought three more barrels of water to carry across to Hazard. I’m sure she’s in no danger of running out, but it
will be nice to ease the rationing a bit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>19 Judge - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The escort was still there when we got through the gate. Wanderlust had been suggesting that
she’d probably tire of waiting and leave early, but I don’t think Hazard would consider going back on her word
like that. She’s cleared the area around the gate, removing a number of the smallest trees and saplings, and setting
up a pleasant camp for her wait.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">She was pretty well settled in as she was expecting to be here for a few more days. There’s no
hurry now, so we’ll be leaving tomorrow. Tonight she’s busy preparing to break camp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>21 Judge - Sweetwater</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Heavy rain overnight. Clear by morning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>6 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">As soon as we got back to Roundwander, we met with Silverbell and told her what happened. She
seemed very interested in the unusual markings on the weapons that Nightstar's minions had been using. I hadn't
really taken much note of it at the time, but Mach had noticed that they were of an uncommon metal and had rather
strange markings on them. He tried to reproduce the designs, but we couldn't find anything in the Library that
resembled them. While we were there, I looked for something like the Awakener's gifts but wasn't surprised to come
up empty there, too.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust has agreed to let me share her room at the Shadetree Inn near Mercy in Strangerside.
It’s nicer than my room near Fool’s Bridge and less expensive, since we’ll be sharing the costs. On my way back
to the Inn, I stopped in to see Sunshine Bard. The bounty I picked up at Stonedeep is enough to pay my dues for
six months time. I wasn't surprised when Sunny told me that another had taken my corner while I was gone. It has
been nearly two months. She did give me the names of two new musicians who might like to work with me. I’ll talk
to them tomorrow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>7 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I spent the morning at the Lesser Arena, practicing my swordwork
and archery. In the afternoon, I found a performing partner. Reed has a corner just a block from Temple Square.
She plays the drums and pipes. For some pieces, I dance to her rhythms or sing. Other times, I play my lute and
sing while she drums. We seemed to be fairly well received today. I plan to buy some brightly colored dancing gear
to draw more attention. Reed is impressed also by some of the unusual music I've found in my travels and visits
to the library. She's working on some new drumming techniques to master them</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>8 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I stopped by the Weavers and purchased three sets of dancing gear
and new soft shoes. One in all shades of blue, tightly fitting with a removable flared skirt and shoulder wrap.
One in bright reds, oranges and yellows with several layers of translucent fabric and many scarves. The last ,
in greens and black, is long sleeved and skirted, suitable for slower, more formal dance styles. I don’t have a
great need for the last, just now, but it was too nice to leave behind. I may have greater need in the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>9 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Things are settling back into a routine. In the mornings I go to the practice grounds near the
lesser arena, where I practice with whatever students are available. In the afternoons, near the temple square
with Reed. Today a tall fellow, Mother Moonlight, came by with about nine young children. He was bringing them
to do some kite-flying, but they stayed for almost an hour watching and listening to Reed and me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>10 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The Crow family had a fantastic show at the Lesser Arena this morning.
They were all youths, but some of their work was amazing. Fearless Crow has agreed to practice with me, but she
wants three and a half hefts a session. I suppose I could pay that with the reward from Bonekeep, but it still
seems expensive. After spending so much on the dancing clothes, I don’t want to be spending too much on other items
just yet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>11 Serpent- Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">One of Moonlight's little charges lost her kitten today in the square, and it made me miss Misty
all the more. If my sister had been here, she'd have been able to find it in a flash, but I don't have her scrying
skill. Reed and I spent a half a candlemark looking for the small one, scrounging in alleys, and rooftops. Reed
and I know of many good hiding places and eventually we found the little creature in a barrel behind the fishstore.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>13 Serpent- Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I'm certainly sore today. I met a weaponsmaster from Fortune’s Joy at the practice grounds who’s
agreed to work with me for only two heft. I’ll be meeting with him twice a week. His name is Honor and he really
pushed me to my limits of swordskill. Muscles aching, I didn't dance as much today, but stuck to singing more often
than not, and accompanying Reed on my lute. Mother Moonlight came again today, as usual and stopped to listen,
but today he didn't have any of the children with him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>14 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Having spent the week in temple square, today, I spoke with Dignity
Moondance and attended the rituals in her temple. Her demanding &quot;Goddess&quot; is not much like my loving
Lady. She suggested that I speak to her cousin, Zephyr Moondance. Somewhere in this land of a thousand gods there
may be a house of worship that suits my beliefs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>15 Serpent - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Mother Moonlight was here again today. That’s three days in a row.
He and the children seem to really like the show. While we took a short break, Mother told the children about the
beginnings of the Mother Family. It’s not the first story I’ve heard that claims to know the &quot;truth&quot;
of the Walker’s pyramid, but it is the first that doesn’t view its completion as a city-wide disaster, merely a
Family event. It might be fun to learn some more of these legends and any songs that might be associated with them.
It would be a useful thing to know if I ever get invited to perform for a Family, although that seems pretty unlikely
just now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>16 Serpent- Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Light rain overnight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I didn’t get a chance to talk to Moonlight about his Family’s stories and songs, afterall. Lady
Aria Silverbell called me to her estate again for a meeting. By the time I got back to Temple Square, Moonlight
had come and gone already.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust was at the meeting, but Mach was not. Silverbell introduced us to new traveler, Strongrip.
He's a spherewalker who claims to have traveled through worlds not frequently visited by residents of Roundwander.
She asks us to accompany him to seek information regarding the strange beast that attacked him two gates hence,
and to set up some sort of trade situation with the forest-dwellers there. She's given us a unique device, a crystal
that we can use to communicate across the spheres with her. It only works once a month, and can only convey eight
or ten words at a time, but it could come in handy. I quickly volunteered to carry it for the group.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Reed took the news of my absence well. She says she will do fine alone with the new songs we've
been working on. Even in Everway, maybe especially in Everway, people love to hear new things. After seeing Reed,
I went to inform Sunny of my impending voyage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>24 Serpent - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">As we’d been warned, bloody corpses litter the place, singly, in
clusters, or sometimes in piles taller than a woman. Everywhere, there's gruesome horror. These poor souls were
killed centuries ago, but kept in this state by some strange magic, as a memorial or tribute of some sort to this
great battle. At least the freshness of their apparent demises spares us the horrible smell I'd otherwise expect.
When I close my eyes and play, it’s easy to imagine I’m somewhere-else.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> I’m really looking forward to seeing this &quot;Living Forest.&quot; The very name speaks to
me of great possibilities! I had a few minutes with Strongrip after dinner and asked him if he knew anything about
some of the places I’ve been. He’d heard of most of the places Misty and I had been to since we’d been separated
from Willow, and had been to a few of them, but he knew nothing of the places I’d described from earlier. Our wonderful
forest-home, or the realm we’d escaped from. I don’t even know if they’re in the same sphere or not.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We talked about the beasts, too. Strongrip calls them &quot;Ogres.&quot; They’re shaped like
a man, but about a head taller. They have long limbs, almost no necks, and are covered with hair. While they’re
exceptionally strong, they seem to move relatively slowly. That may be our best advantage. If we can stay out of
range, maybe we can take one down with distance weapons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>25 Serpent - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">According to the map, we have about a week’s walk north and west
around a large inland sea to the gate to Living Forest. The land here is flat, and we can see local forests in
the distance. This morning, I thought they were within a half a day’s walk, but now they look no closer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The bodies littering this place are quite distracting. Unfortunately,
there seems to be a great many of them along our trail. Apparently any attempt to move them is futile. They’re
magically returned to their former position and posture within a day. Strongrip says we must learn to look without
seeing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>26 Serpent - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The forest looks a bit closer at last, ‘though I’m not sure I can
trust that appearance. Strongrip says we should be there before nightfall tomorrow. We have clearly reached the
north shore of the sea and will be bearing westnorthwest in the morning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>27 Serpent - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">It rained heavily during the night. A great noisy thunderstorm.
Strongarm assured us we were safe on the small rise, surrounded as we were by larger hills. A flash-flood cleared
out much of the small brush in the passageway below us. I half expected the water to be running red with blood
washed from the corpses, but the magic in this place keeps even the blood in place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We’ve entered the forest on the north side of the sea. The trees
hide the evidence of the battle a bit better here. This make it all a bit more pleasant for the most part, but
it can be quite un-nerving to top a hill, or round a cluster of trees and suddenly encounter more of this mess.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>28 Serpent - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The afternoon brought a very light rain. The clouds, the winds and
the continuing shade of the forest kept it quite chilly and fresh for the rest of the day. I warmed everyone up
enough to dry us and keep us all comfortable. On a day like today, there can be no doubt that winter is coming.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>1 Mare - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Today was cold, clear and dry. We made good progress toward the
gate and should reach it before nightfall tomorrow. Having finally become grounded today, the timing is good.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I’m truly looking forward to leaving this realm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>9 Mare - BlondOak’s tribe, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We reached the gate just after noon on the second, and arrived in Living Forest in mid-morning.
Immediately, we met the lad, Quietstep, fishing. He was bare to the waist, wearing soft shoes of hide and an unusual
sort of short breeches. It is rather warm and pleasant in the forest, so heavier garments are not required. The
rest of his community dresses much the same, with the women in short shifts and breeches, or dresses of soft hide.
You’d never believe that this was Mare. It seems much more like spring, maybe Youth or Goddess.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The youth was startled by our sudden appearance, but not too surprised. He says the forest told
him to wait for us. He took us to see his father, BlondOak, who is the chief of his tribe. During the short journey,
we were attacked by three of the ogres. Quietstep knew they were there before we saw them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wanderlust and I fought back with magic. I levitated to stay out of reach and attacked from the
air. We defeated one, and the other two escaped. As I tried to return to land, I sprained my ankle. Wanderlust
injured herself while trying to heal Quietstep. She saved his life, but the lad is suddenly terrified of us. They're
not much fond of magic here. We captured one of the ogres, which should please Silverbell if we can get it home.
They sure do smell bad! Wanderlust says it seems to be the same manner of beasts that attacked her home realm.
She’s most anxious to learn more about them and from whence they come.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">In spite of our use of magic, the Chief accepts us, probably because
we saved his son and Quietstep did speak to our support. BlondOak says the beasts are a new phenomenon and the
Forest doesn't like them. They don't work with the forest, but attack it needlessly. The chief wants to destroy
our prisoner immediately, but we've convinced him to wait at least one day. He wants his people to examine the
creature first, so we will have to wait until morning to question it. The others are trying to figure out how to
carryout Silverbell's second objective, to establish trade, but these people get everything they want or need from
the forest. I don't think we'll have any success there. We've debated using the crystal to communicate with Silverbell
as to our progress so far, but have decided to wait until we have some real news.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I'm quite pleasantly impressed by the tribe here. They live in wonderful homes crafted in the
bases of living trees all around the edge of the clearing. In many ways it reminds me of the place Morning Mist
and I lived with Willow, although they centered their lives and homes much higher in the trees. If the woodspeople
here weren't so opposed to magic, I might really like staying here for a while, but they don’t seem to be very
open to us yet. Joining this community would seem to involve more than just a gesture of good-will.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I took a brief walk alone after dinner to experiment with my powers.
Unlike cast magic, they appear to work the same as before, without any ill effects. Still, I will be cautious about
using them. It will look the same as magic to the people and I don’t want to spook them. For this reason, I’m using
Wanderlust’s lantern to write tonight, rather than my own light.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>10 Mare - Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Last night, the settlement was attacked by a band of ogres. Somehow, we managed to scare them
off, but our prisoner was killed. We were at a loss as to what to do next. The different groups in the forest have
no real contact with one another. BlondOak knows where to locate other tribes, but there's no assurance that they
will find help or support there. And we still don't know enough about the ogres to form a strategy for defeating
them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Afterwards, Quietstep came to us to say that he's certain the trouble is caused by Snowcat, a
woman of the tribe who disappeared after her brother was killed. She had claimed he drowned, but the tribe is convinced
that she killed him in order to gain mastery of magic. They say that here the only way to get magic is to kill
a blood relative. It's no wonder now that they were so suspicious of us. We were working on a plan for some of
us to accompany him on his quest while others stay to protect the people, but the chief caught wind of it and insisted
that our entire party go with his son.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It’s been a quiet trek so far. It would be easier if I could use my magic to ease the demands
on my sore ankle, but we’ve had no problems. The forest really does speak to Quietstep and his people, warning
him of dangers ahead. I wish I could hear it, too.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>11 Mare - Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We had heavy rain all day, but at least it was warm. I risked using
my powers to keep myself dry, without extending the sphere to the others. I didn’t want to frighten Quietstep,
and it seems that nobody noticed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Quietstep doesn’t seem to know anything about Snowcat’s magic. He
doesn’t even want to talk about magic, so we don’t have any idea what she’s practicing. We’ll have to discern that
ourselves, but first we’ll have to decide whether she is really foe or friend. The ogres themselves should be easy
to defeat unless there are great in number, but it may be harder to overcome a mage when hers is the only magic
that is working. It only it were as easy as it seems in the songs and cradle-tales.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>12 Mare - Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">My ankle seems to be completely healed now. We haven’t reached the mountain Snowcat is said to
occupy yet, but it is in sight of our campsite tonight. The forest doesn't extend up the mountain so it can't tell
the tribe anything about the beasts. There actually seems to be a stone cat on the mountain top. Its head is as
tall as a woman. I wonder if Snowcat put it there, or if it was just some natural fluke.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Quietstep has become quite agitated. He seems to be both frightened
and angry, and unsure of which emotion should hold sway. I hope he doesn’t do something stupid. We don’t know that
she’s behind this. She’s been judged guilty just because she’s a mage. As a mage, myself, I find that a rather
tenuous proof. I suppose we’ll find out soon enough.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>13 Mare - Cat Mountain, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Well, it seems that Snowcat is not the enemy after all. She could be a most proficient liar,
but I believe that she is innocent. She seems genuinely interested in our assistance in thwarting the Ogres. She
has offered Wanderlust and me a chance to improve our efforts here, a chance that we could use our magic. Even
Quietstep seems to accept her now, but Strongrip has suggested this quest of hers could be a trick to entice us
to lower our guard and then defeat us. Her magic is of divination and scrying, not one useful for fighting, so
I suppose it’s possible, but I find it unlikely.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We traveled all day long and eventually got to the top of Snowcat's mountain. It was a tough
climb. It started snowing and was quite windy. I had just started using my sphere of warmth to make myself less
cold, when we found the mage. Several of the ogres attacked from somewhere. Snowcat helped us defeat them and then
took us to her fortress. She explained to us that her brother's death was completely an accident, and I believe
her. She explained that in order to manipulate magic in this sphere without penalty, mages must undergo a visionquest.
They can only be attempted once a month. Sometimes people die on these quests, or are horribly wounded, but if
they succeeded, then the magic will work for them. I'd love to try it, but I'm afraid of failure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>14 Mare - Cat Mountain, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">I have decided to undertake the visionquest Snowcat has offered.
I spent the day fasting and meditating in preparation for the trial to come, but I have no idea what to expect
and don’t know what to be ready for. Lady knows what tomorrow will bring. I pray I will be equal to the task.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>15 Mare - Cat Mountain, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today we’ve seen great failure and success. Failure in the visionquests, and success in the fight
against the Ogres. We still don’t have any answers on where they came from or why, and we do have a great many
more questions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> The visionquests were a great disappointment and mine was most disturbing to me. When Wanderlust
attempted hers, she came away with a bad burn on her hand. Since her healing magic still doesn’t function reliably,
it may take a week before it’s whole again. I am unharmed, physically, but I don't wonder if I didn't fare worse.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The vision. I can't get it out of my head. I was passing between spheres with Morning Mist but
I could <I><U>see</U></I> it for the first time. It was like a path with a steep drop-off on each side. Mist accidentally
stepped off the path and started falling. She was falling so slowly, like she was sinking in water. I didn't know
what to do. I was afraid to use my magic to levitate her because we were between spheres. I was going to look for
a rope, when these small winged beings came and told me they could help. I asked them to do that, but when they
got down to where she was, she turned up and glared at me, hissing! Her eyes were glowing red and evil, and then
everything disappeared and I was back with Snowcat. I believe my failure was one of not acting on my own. I'm still
not sure I should have used magic there, but it was a magic test. I just know I didn't react quickly enough and
should have acted on my own instead of relying on others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I've decided that I am going to start using my magic and abilities more. I've got to develop
them if I'm going to be able to grow, and I may need them to help Misty. I'm going to seek out every opportunity
to increase my abilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">After the quests, we went out and looked for the beasts. We found the entrance to their tunnel
network, and carefully made our way inside. It was unbelievably HUGE down there. All these ogres digging an intricate
network of tunnels everywhere. Strangely, the armor and weapons they were wearing seemed quite similar to that
which Nightstar's minions had been using. Our timing was good, 'though. We were there when one of them came running
out of a tunnel with a pouch, yelling &quot;I've got it!&quot; We leapt out then and got it from her/him. It turned
out to be a gigantic scale, like a dragonscale, only bigger than my hand. It's a group find, but I have been careful
to keep it on my person. I don't want to see it get lost.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> During the fight, the big red-skinned supervisor-type, called Jackal, disappeared through an
arch in a solid wall that seemed to act like a gate, but somehow <U>wasn't</U> a gate. We tried to activate it
by tugging on stones in the archway but couldn't. That's the second one we found like that, counting the StoneFlat.
And both times, there was that armor with the strange markings. Clearly there are other ways to travel across spheres
that we don't know about.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Jackel wasn’t an ogre. They seem to be just the brute labor here. Jackel was some sort of creature
like a cross between a person and a small dragon. Like the gargoyles that decorate some of the buildings in Everway.
He had a frightening aura of power and strength, but he didn’t fight so I don’t know if that’s so.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>16 Mare - below Cat Mountain, Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Rain in afternoon</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Snowcat has decided to come with us back to visit the tribe. She
wants to clear her name, but isn’t expecting to rejoin the community. She wants to return with us to Everway. I
can see that this makes Quietstep happy. He seems to have been able to accept her as an ally for the past few days,
but I suppose it will take time to overcome a lifetime’s prejudices against magic and mages.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>17 Mare - Living Forest</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> The village chief met us less than a day inside the tree-line, as he'd been warned by the forest
that we were returning. He seemed to believe us when we vouched for Snowcat and told him that she <U>wasn't</U>
responsible for her brother's death. I think it was Quietstep who truly convinced him. But he and his tribe were
still more than happy to hear that she wasn't planning on staying there. I sent a message to Silverbell with the
crystal to let her know to expect us in about three weeks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>25</B> <B>Mare - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We arrived at the gate in the early afternoon of the 18th and departed for Battlefield, arriving
here in the late morning. It wasn’t until we were at the gate that I thought to wonder about whether Snowcat would
be able to come through. None of us are able to gate for a non-spherewalker. Fortunately, it turned out that she
could walk under her own power.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Battlefield is unchanged, and our day’s travel rather unremarkable. Accustomed to dealing with
the colder weather atop the mountain, Snowcat was well prepared for the cold of Battlefield. In the last three
weeks, its gotten much colder. A hint of snow is on the air, and nobody can doubt that winter is begun.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>3 Hero - Battlefield</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Foggy morning</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>11 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Lady Silverbell was most interested in the scale when we arrived this evening. I’ve never seen
a dragon, but I understand that their scales are generally no bigger than a large coin. A creature with scales
this size would be immense, if it were proportional. Silverbell has decided to have the artifact tested by her
local experts tomorrow. We’ve been invited to attend. I am quite curious.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>12 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">The testing of the scale was a disaster! We went to watch this morning and witnessed a thing
that is barely to be believed. Silverbell's sorcerers prepared a spell-casting circle with a great silver vessel
in the middle. They put the scale in a large vessel and were just getting started casting their divination when
a HUGE hand, a hand about five feet long with claws, came crashing up through the floor, grabbed the thing, and
disappeared back in the ground. It was an amazing and frightening sight. I'd hate to think how big the creature
was that was attached to that hand. Maybe it was just a hand, and no being at all. I can only hope.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Afterwards, I went looking for Snowcat. It's been almost a month now since Wanderlust and I failed
the visionquests, and I'd like to try again. But Snowcat said that she could only conduct a visionquest back in
the Living Forest, so we'll have to wait.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>13 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I tracked down Reed. She has found a position in the Bright Peacock, one of the Strangerside
Inns, performing for the dinnertime crowds. She extended her commission to me, so I have a nice steady income now.
Since it's indoors and late in the day, I've been able to add some light effects to the dancing which seem to work
quite well. Soft shades of blue and green for the quiet songs, with fiery red and orange for the active and passionate
passages. It was wonderful.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>14 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"> I am working on my resolve to improve my magical abilities. I have been practicing the exercises
I was taught by Quickfox, and trying to improve my control. And doing my best to remember those forbidden pages
of notes that I had read while his student. Of course, Snowcat can't teach me in the Summer Wind magic. I suppose
I should ask at Crookstaff, but I've heard about the fees they charge, especially for an Outsider.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>16 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today I skipped my usual weapons practice to meet with Snowcat. I had been planning to do swordwork
anyway, which isn't as much fun as archery. Archery practice is also magic practice. I always use my spells on
the last set to send my arrows places they would never go otherwise. Snowcat and I went to the library and found
some most intriguing references, but so far, no direct information. Snowcat has suggested that I return with her
to the Living Forest when she departs, to attempt my visionquest again. She can’t conduct it here, but must be
on the sphere of her power. I had forgotten that I could attempt the same visionquest twice. It’s a promising idea,
but frightening, too. I’d like to try, I think, but Snowcat intends a long stay, maybe as much as six months. I
don’t want to wait until then before taking some sort of action. Maybe something will come up here between now
and then.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>19 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Well, today was certainly interesting. I've got a lot to think about. That ... woman. Could it
really have been Misty? After all this time. But so changed. And I still can't get over the way that one-eyed man
died. What sort of creature was he to do that? Will it ever make sense? Why am I sure that he knew things we should
have asked, if we'd only known what they were?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It started last night when Wanderlust and I were out in Strangerside, looking about for something
to do. We stopped at an inn called the &quot;Beaked Lizard&quot; for something to eat. There was a really strange
person in the corner. At first, there wasn't any real way to know if it was female or male since there was a large
hood over the person's face, but he was big, and I thought it was a man. I wondered if he was watching us, but
Wanderlust didn't seem to think anything of him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">A couple invited us to play cards, but I wasn't in the mood for gambling. Wanderlust played.
She sent Swiftwing up to sit behind her opponents, and I figured she was cheating a bit. I was playing with the
idea of using my magic to cause the stranger's hood to fall from his face when one of the players starting yelling
about the bird. Apparently, he could speak to birds, too, and had overheard the creature's assistance. There was
a bit of a rout then, and we departed in a hurry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Out in the streets, we later came across another disturbance. We followed the yelling and found
the hooded stranger being accosted by four bandits. Wanderlust and I attempted to help. One of the four took something
from the stranger and ran off, yelling, &quot;I got it!&quot; I left Wanderlust to deal with the others. She and
the stranger were doing much better at fighting them, anyway. I used a speed spell to catch up with him, since
he was really quite a bit ahead of me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Just as I did finally catch up, he’d reached an alley where someone was waiting for him. The
bandit threw the pouch to her and he was then struck dead by a bolt of fire. It was a strange, tall, bizarre looking
woman. She laughed, and then flew straight up into the air! My motion spell was still active and I gave my best
jump, but it wasn't enough.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When I got back, Wanderlust and the stranger, Portent, had things well in hand. He had just one
eye. Not like he lost one in an accident, but just one eye in the middle of his forehead. It looked quite strange,
but he seemed to be friendly, and grateful to us for our attempted assistance. He said that the &quot;Deceiver&quot;
was most powerful and had powerful beings in his employ. I don't know what evil being he was thinking of and he
wouldn't explain. When he described the object that was stolen from him, we knew it was another dragon's scale,
like the one we found in Snowcat's realm. After what happened to that one, I'm not sure I want to deal with the
force that's trying to gather them, but I certainly would like to know what's going on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We followed in the direction that the woman had taken and eventually found a cabin on the edge
of a precipice. It was getting dark by then, but a quick scouting by Swiftwing told us that we were at the right
place. Wanderlust bragged about her talent for stealth and climbing. I believe I’ve actually had more practice
at both than she, but I let her scout out a path to take us up close to the cabin without being seen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">As we waited outside the window, I could see the woman up close. She wore a scant leather outfit,
and a long red glove. Her eyes were sunken and evil-looking. Her hair, long and scraggly and red. I'd never seen
anyone like her before, but something made me think of Misty. Maybe it was the shape of her face, but other than
that, it didn't look anything like her. She and her companions were waiting for someone to arrive and take possession
of the scale. Like I said, we didn't want to meet them, so we had to act immediately. We wanted the scale back
right away, and that was easy. The window was open, so I just whistled up a spell and levitated the bag right out
and into my hand. I hid in the shadows by the window and disappeared.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Naturally, they came flying out after us. I did my best to stay motionless, standing unseen so
they wouldn't see me. But when the she-demon came around she, well, she looked right where I was and cried, &quot;YOU!&quot;
Like she knew me, recognized me, even though I was invisible. She cast bolts of fire at me so I leapt into the
air and hovered above. I did my best to fight from there, shooting arrows and throwing blades. The woman did not
seem to be easily harmed. Wanderlust and Portent did a wonderful job defeating the bandits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">In the end, something very strange happened. The deamon went after Portent and he just put up
his sword and let her slice him down. It seemed to be positively deliberate. Why would he WANT to be killed by
her? It makes no sense to me. Did he do it to prevent being questioned? The woman disappeared, and Portent was
able to talk to Wanderlust and me briefly, but we didn't really know what questions to ask. I fear we have lost
valuable information. Something that could spell the end of this. We did decide to follow through with what he
had intended, what we would have done anyway, and take the scale to Silverbell. I hope she has some notion what
to do about it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Meanwhile, I'm still puzzled by this woman. I hadn't mentioned to Wanderlust about how she seemed
to remind me of Misty, even 'though she looked nothing like my sister. It seemed impossible that she could be the
same person. Morning Mist had no ability to fly, or throw fire. Those are <U>my</U> talents. This she-deamon never
called forth clouds or lightning which would be in Misty’s power... however, Misty was learning the magic of seeming
and illusion. If those skills were realized, she would have been able to cast an illusion about herself, make herself
seem like whatever she wanted. Taller, darker hair, and all. The fireballs could have been illusions, too. They
sure <I><U>felt</U></I> real. I'd hate to think we were cowed by something that wasn't really there. Misty wouldn't
have been able to make them real enough to actually kill someone, I don't think, even at her full potential. Unless
some miracle occurred in those two years and that potential was increased, not merely realized. If so, she could
be able to see through the eyes of someone she knows well, if she's nearby. Someone like me. And she'd be able
to track objects she knows, like the scale. ...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I hate to think it was really her. She didn't use any abilities that I know of her, but if it's
<I><U>possible</U></I>, I guess I should tell the others. This could be really dangerous. The visionquest I underwent
at Snowcat's certainly did hint that something terrible had happened to Misty, but I'd have never have thought
anything could do this to her. Maybe it's this &quot;Deceiver&quot; the stranger spoke of. If she's done this to
Misty, I want her. I want my sister back and I want payment for what was done to her. No matter how scary it seems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>20 Hero - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I thought I had a lot to think about yesterday. Now there's even more. Willow's here on Roundwander!
She's given me a lot of answers, but there are so many more questions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It started when I took Portent to the Tenders to see if they could attend to his body. The proprietor,
Greyteir, had never seen his kind before and knew nothing of their customs. I was waiting as he prepared to cremate
the body, when Jackal suddenly appeared. He hissed something about how magic would work for him in this realm and
attacked with a glowing blade. I defended myself and somehow managed to kill him in a few strokes. I never became
aware of any magic being used, or used any of my own. His blood did destroy my shortsword, so I've been using his
scimitar. I checked it with my touchstone and found that it is not magic of itself. The glow must have been a glamour
of some kind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Afterwards, when I checked on Portent, I found a tall, thin man with long white hair waiting
for me. He wouldn't give his name, but expressed sorrow over Portent's demise, and claimed to be responsible for
his race, and Portent's &quot;choice.&quot; He mentioned Willow, and a &quot;little white lie,&quot; he asked that
I forgive. Then he conjured a paper, tore it, and gave me half, saying it would answer my questions. As he disappeared
down the street, and replaced his hood, his eyes glowed green, just like the figure in my nightmares. But when
I talked to him, I felt that I was talking to a friend, and wasn't at all afraid. Could he be the same creature?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">In spite of the stranger's assurances, the paper didn't answer any questions. It was written
in a language I couldn't recognize.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When I got back to the inn, I had two messages waiting. I was told to meet Lady Silverbell in
Strangerside, and that Wanderlust had gotten into a major fight with a bunch of skeletons that morning and had
been aided by two strangers. Sounds like the deamon-woman (Misty?) was there, too. I was planning to go to the
library and see if anyone could translate the stranger's parchment for me, but thought it best to meet with the
others in Strangerside first.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">At the Strangerside estate, I was shocked to find Willow! She'd actually come into Roundwander
with Portent, Southpaw (a spherewalker) and Wind (a knight of the order of the seeker--whoever they are.) When
I asked her about how she'd arrived and what had happened, she started a long story about the first dragon and
a rebellion against the Gods ages ago. Portent's people were the Accursed, made by the goddess to fight the dragons,
and tricked by the dragons into helping them in exchange for the gift of foresight which cost them each an eye.
The foresight proved to be a curse and several turned away, but many stayed to help the dragons in order to have
this curse removed. This removal turned them into Ogres. According to her story, the dragon rebellion was defeated
and destroyed, and loyal dragons moved to earth in diminished capacity or stayed in heaven in other forms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Most interesting, but it didn't seem to really answer the questions about <U>her</U>. Finally
Willow told me that she is in truth sister to my mother, who died upon my birth. She is true mother to Amber/Misty
who is my half-sister/half-cousin as we share the same father, Lord Brightstone of Ember. He is presumably now
dead. Apparently my &quot;beloved father&quot; was dabbling in dark magic and possibly attempting to recreate the
first dragon, the Deceiver. Willow was certain he was planning to sacrifice both Amber and me, so she informed
Brightstone's enemies of his plans. They banded together for the attack which destroyed the castle, and provided
us with escape. A talented spherewalker conveyed the three of us to Elfhome where they hoped we would be safe.
Our family had originally come from Elfhome before re-settling in Ember. Willow feels that the gate we fell through
in Elfhome wasn't natural. That it was placed there deliberately to entrap us. She can't spherewalk and couldn't
follow, even if she'd known where we were.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It had taken her all this time to find a spherewalker who could and would take her to Roundwander,
and that was a very long trip. The direct path to &quot;home&quot; using conventional gates is as follows: Roundwander
to Fortune's Joy to Suncurst, through a 3 day gate to Labyrinth to Peaceful Lotus, through an eight week gate to
ElfHome and then to Ember. Assuming average gates except where otherwise stated, and all gates were close together,
this would take a minimum of 24 weeks. Six months.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I told Willow about where Misty and I had been, and what I'd done since we separated. She knows
nothing about this white-haired stranger with the glowing eyes who once haunted my dreams and now calls himself
my friend. I'd really been hoping she could explain that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When the others returned, they had a new companion with them. Loki had apparently been one of
the strangers who had helped Wanderlust against the skeletons. I am pleased that he aided my friend, but I do not
think him honest. I then learned that Wanderlust and Silverbell had hidden the scale in the fortifications of the
estate, since they've determined that any magic invoked on it would cause the Deceiver to appear to claim it. When
all nine scales were thus gathered, he would be recreated, to renew his fight against the Goddess. (Thank the Lady
that when I was retrieving it from Portent’s opponents, that I’d used my magic to levitate the <I>bag</I>, rather
than the <I>scale</I> itself!) When Wanderlust had been at the library today, she discovered a partial parchment
at the library dealing with the subject, and written in the same script, which Willow identified as Draconic script.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">When we returned to the library, we found that my partial parchment matched the tear in the one
they had, although mine was new and theirs was ancient. Together, they made the most interesting claim.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>&quot;There will come one with a sister yet no sister, with three homes</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>yet no home, promised unto us twice. And through this one will</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>the nine be united and the glory and presence of our lord be</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>returned to the spheres. Then shall he sunder the heavens.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>Then shall he drive out the pretenders. Then shall he rule the spheres</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><I>for all eternity.&quot;</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Clearly this is an evil prophesy and we must do what we can to prevent these nine from being
re-united. The &quot;one&quot; could be a reference to me or Misty. More likely Misty, since she seems to be working
on gathering scales for the Deceiver. Assuming that deamonic woman <I>was</I> Misty, which seems to be more likely
as all these other pieces start fitting together. &quot;<I>Promised to us twice</I>,&quot; it said. Once might
have been when Brightstone was going to sacrifice us. When twice? When we were tricked into the false gate and
separated from Willow? When those strangers came for us at &quot;Uncle's?&quot; <I>&quot;Three homes</I>&quot;
could be Ember, Elfhome, and Uncle's place in Grassland. I've recently had a home here in Roundwander, which would
be four if it counts, but Misty hasn't. Maybe she hasn't known any other home.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">There was a magical note written on the parchment in the Common tongue when then were mated that
said, <I>P.S., Go to Remnant anyway - Lightfoot's &quot;friend&quot;</I> Apparently that had been where the library
had obtained the other part of the parchment and the group had been planning to go there to investigate its origins.
It was given to the library by a man from that sphere named Wornpath. Interesting that the white-haired man would
call himself my friend, assuming it was him who wrote it. Who is he? When he spoke of Portent's people, I thought
he was a mage who made them, but now I know they were made by the goddesses and gods for this ancient battle. Could
he be one of the dragons that now serve Heaven? Seems impossible that one so powerful would speak with me. But
who could he be? And why has he, or his people, been in my nightmares? Is he, perhaps, one of the fallen dragons,
a servant of evil? It seems not, if he is trying to warn us of the Deceiver’s plans, but how can I know? Either
way, going to Remnant seems to be the thing to do. I don't know how I'll be able to keep my resolve to further
my magic training if I can't stand still long enough to find a teacher. I guess I could look on Remnant, 'though
I don't know if we'll be there long enough to receive any training.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">After the evening meal, we were introduced to Peregrine, a warrior-guide who is to accompany
us to Remnant. She is from the family of Blade, small, Asian, and gray-haired. We leave tomorrow at dawn, but Wanderlust
is to stay here on Roundwander. Before I retired, I asked Willow about Misty and told her of my vision quest, and
my fears about Misty using her gifts against me. She told me that her only talent is a small one, that of divination.
She said her divination on me during our separation revealed to her only &quot;The Priestess/(Understanding Mysteries).&quot;
When attempting to divine on Misty, she got &quot;The Phoenix/(Rebirth)&quot; until recently when she gets only
&quot;The Dragon-Reversed/(Blind Fury).&quot; This does not bode well, but I guess we'll just have to do our best.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>1 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It took eight days to transverse the gate to Remnant, as we expected. We arrived early in the
morning. Peregrine seems to be extremely suspicious, and I have taken a liking to her. Strongrip is bowing to me
on this trip, naming me the leader of the expedition. It was easy to find Wornpath's shop. He told us the parchment
piece had been sold to him by a woman named Panther who had gotten it on this sphere while on a sea voyage. I asked
if he'd ever seen anything like the little skull that we each got from the Awakener, but he's baffled by the piece.
I do think it's important that we figure this out. We just might be needing something as powerful as this, and
I'd really like to know how to use it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We gave Wornpath ten beads to have Panther call on us when she gets into Bizarre, the capital
here. Strongrip was going to give him a gold heft! Fortunately, we talked him into a more suitably sized incentive
for the task. After that, Wornpath decided to tell us that Panther just left within the week on another voyage
and was not expected back for 12 weeks. With nothing else to do for the moment, we then found ourselves rooms at
the only inn.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I really like this place. Everyone is so different and nobody seems to be a native. They are
from some other sphere, usually refugees from some cataclysm, and yet they don't seem defeated. They're happy and
friendly, delighting in their diversity. I wonder if we might run into former citizens of Mach's home, or even
Ember. That would be something, wouldn't it?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">It snowing now, but we were already in our rooms by the time it
began, so it has been no inconvenience. I find it rather soothing to watch from the warmth of the Inn.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>2 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today was quite a day. Since it was too soon to gate back to Everway, I wandered around the place,
asking after any mages. There doesn't seem to be any here. There's lots of weird stuff at the little shops, but
nothing I particularly want. I did find out that none of the residents come through from Everway, so none would
be from Ember or Mach's sphere. They come to Remnant in groups with strong sphere-walkers. Those who can walk the
spheres on their own, continue to Everway, and those who can't stay here, happy to be out of the fighting in the
spheres &quot;downstream.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">There didn't seem to be anyone-else who would have a clue about the skull, the strange weapons,
or the parchment, so I just explored casually. I stopped at a local food vendor and as I ate my fishcake, I noticed
a boy sitting by the edge of the square, playing on a set of pipes. I wanted to join right in, but I waited. Finally,
when he took a short break, I went and introduced myself. His name was Merry and he'd been playing all his short
life. (He's human and about 15 years old.) He's orphaned with no family and made his living on what he could encourage
others to give for his talents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We knew before we came that this sphere is mostly water, and there’s a great abundance of coastline,
so it’s not too surprising that Merry’s most popular tunes are sailing songs or great adventure ballads involving
sea monsters. He taught me a few new ones which were quite nice. He had never heard of a Silkie, and seemed to
enjoy the songs I taught him about them. He eventually told me that his family wasn’t all gone. His parents and
siblings were, and he’d escaped to Remnant by tagging along with another family who’d paid a spherewalker to get
them out, but he left behind some aunts, uncles and cousins who he misses and worries greatly over. He’d been trying
to earn enough to get them out, too, but wasn’t getting too far ahead. I’m going to help him while we’re stuck
here, if I can.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>3 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Merry and I are working up a great little show. The crowds seem to like it so far. I told Merry
that I wouldn’t take any of his income, so he’s paying me with flute lessons. The woodwinds have never been my
favorite instrument, as you can’t sing along while you play one, but I do enjoy the bright, cheerful tones. Merry’s
been living on the street, so I’ve convinced the party to let him stay with us in the Inn as long as we’re here.
It’s been wonderful for him. He enjoys being cleaner, and he’s getting much better rest, which should pay off directly
in a better performance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>4 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">We had light snow in the afternoon, but it we played through most of it. When we did finally
stop for a bit, Merry’s told me more about his family. His mother had been a priestess and his father, a silversmith.
Her sect has quite elaborate ceremonies involving a lot of song and his mother was, in Merry’s opinion, one of
the very best. He learned his love of music there. His father made the silver flute he uses. His elder sister was
training for their mother’s profession, although Merry liked less practical performances. When he’d last seen his
uncle, two aunts and four cousins, they’d been hiking through a mountainous wilderness and were separated in a
storm. I know he’s really distressed by the separation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Today, Merry found a spherewalker who’s heading back to his former sphere. He even knows Merry’s
family and is willing to make the effort to seek them out and bring them over. Unfortunately, he’s leaving in less
than a week, and his services are quite dear. Merry thinks this might be his only chance, or at least, his best
chance, at retrieving his family. I suspect that he’s right. We’re just going to have work up an act so incredible,
we’ll be able to raise the money we need.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman"><B>6 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times,Times New Roman">We had a light snow overnight. It left the place looking pretty
and clean for a while.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Merry and I have been working all week. I’ve hardly seen Peregrine and the others at all, except
when they’ve stopped by and seen our show. I’ve been having a wonderful time and the crowds are loving it. We’ve
been making fantastic money, for busking. Unfortunately, Merry’s spherewalker’s raised his prices and so we now
have barely more than half of what he needs. There’s no way we’ll make the rest by the time he leaves in two days.
Merry’s even talking about selling his precious flute, but even that won’t be enough to cover the fee. I’m trying
to convince him to wait for another walker, another time, if we can’t find the money, but he says he’s been waiting
too long already.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>7 Emeralds - Bizzarre, Remnant</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">As nothing has come up to change our plans, I did this day send a message to Silverbell so that
she'd know to expect us in eight days time. We will be leaving through the gate to Roundwander right after our
noon-time meal. Peregrine found a different sphere-walker for Merry’s journey. She seems quite reliable and I think
we can trust her. I still can’t believe that Loki helped out Merry like that. He just came and <B>gave</B> Merry
all of the balance he needed to hire his spherewalker. Merry even had enough extra to allow him to support himself
for at least a month. I couldn’t refuse him when he insisted on giving me a portion of today’s take. Adding my
own funds, I bought a silver flute for myself. It is small, a bit more durable than many instruments, and I’ve
become rather fond of it the sound this week.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Maybe my suspicions about Loki were wrong, but I’m still not ready to really trust him. Where
did he get that money anyway? I hadn’t thought he had that much when we’d first arrived.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>15 Emeralds - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It's great to be back at Roundwander with Willow. It's been so long since I've been with family
and so much longer since I've been with her. She was a little confused when I first talked to her again. Apparently
while we'd been gone, Wanderlust had mentioned the talisman I've been wearing on my necklace. She laughed when
I told her how I'd picked that up after Elfhome but before Grassland and pretended it was some link to my past.
Sometimes, I'd almost convinced myself to believe in it, but it was never anything but fantasy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It seems so amazing to actually know where I'm from now. I went to the Library to see if they
had any additional information on Ember's history. It took a bit of searching, since it's so far off, gate-wise.
One of the senior Librarians, Snowfall Scratch, had to personally help me find what they had. The information is
five years old, but that's much more recent than my memories of the place. Ember, they say, is a mountainous sphere
with relatively little fertile ground. Fortunately, they do have great mineral wealth - gold, silver, emeralds,
and other precious metals and gems. It's also rather volcanic near the gates, giving it its name. The records show
that three score of families once controlled separate realms there, and it was then a place of prosperity, wealth
and peace. A century ago, they fell to massive civil war as each House wanted a greater share of that wealth. As
of five years ago, there were only twelve Houses remaining. They even mentioned my father's fall twenty-three years
ago, remarking how unusual it was for all of the houses to band together against any common foe. The chroniclers
didn't know why. They also didn't know of our escape, as they stated that the entire family was obliterated in
that battle. Could Brightstone also have escaped, I wonder? And what would it mean for Misty and me if he did?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>16 Emeralds - Everway, Roundwander</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">It was foggy all day today, but a bit warmer.<B> </B>I had weapons practice with Wanderlust in
the morning. She found herself a teacher while we were at Remnant and she’s much better than she was. She really
surprised me. I’m going to practice with her more often.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">I sought out Snowcat and discovered that she left four days ago to return t
