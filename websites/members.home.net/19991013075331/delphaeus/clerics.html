<CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">Deep in the bowels of Paw, I battled gnoll
after swarming gnoll. "This was a bad idea", I thought to myself in between
swings of my Minotaur axe. Rangers like me were meant to be outside in
the open where the air was fresh and the sky could be seen. But I had foolheartedly
plunged into this Tunare forsaken dog pen in search of the fabled magic
snakeskin armor that would help me resist poison. I was fortunate enough
to venture into the pit with a cleric named Tearin Purespirit. Judging
from his formidable appearance and calm demeanor, it was easy to entrust
my health into his hands. "Surely any danger I get myself into, this holy
man will be able to deal with", I told myself.</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">Again and again I felt the stinging blows
of the gnoll's claws upon my body. The shabby armor I had come in with
provided little protection from their gnashing teeth, I was no where near
obtaining any magic armor. It was so easy to get this deep into Paw, but
now exit seemed impossible. Like a trap, they lulled me in to their most
obscure passageways and then pounced in a huge pack. As I quickly realized
that this was a deteriorating situation, I panicked and ran haphazardly
looking for a way out. In my panic I did the worst thing possible - I didn't
allow my cleric partner to heal me. I had become so lost in the maze of
tunnels that there was no way for Tearin to find me. As my life slowly
faded, and I crawled desperately away, I ceased feeling the gnashing and
tearing upon my body. The deeper pain of humiliation descended upon me
obscuring all else.</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">As Karana has favored me for my devotion
, I awoke from death in the town of RiverVale. Like a voice from the mist,
Tearin called, "I will help you, don't despair." How could he help? I was
alone, defenseless, and blind, a long, long ways away from Paw. "I have
helped people in far worse conditions, trust me, I will aid you." I had
quested with Tearin for a little while before this misadventure, but only
now did I realize how seriously dedicated he was to his calling. Indeed,
with his strength and wisdom, he was easily able to recover my belongings,
fight his way out of Paw single-handedly, and make his way (heavily encumbered)
to East Karana where we could meet. For my part, I was able to enlist the
aid of Karl the Barbarian as my guide out of RiverVale and through High
Hold Pass.</FONT>e</CENTER>

the call and followed it.</FONT></CENTER>
