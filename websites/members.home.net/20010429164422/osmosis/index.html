                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In all 
                    things, there must be closure. Sadly, it is time for the closure 
                    of our fair clan. We has all walked down this path together 
                    for well over a year, and in that time we has built very strong 
                    friendships and great memories. Me still remembers the joyously 
                    fun (and peril ridden) mistmoore trip, some drunken stupors 
                    in Lower Guk, adventuring in Permafrost, and giant falling 
                    in the Rathe Mountains... and these is only a few of the memories 
                    we built. But, alas, it is time to move on. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For those 
                    who still frequent Norrath, it is a difficult thing to let 
                    go of a family held for so long. For those who have strayed 
                    from that land and exist only in that reality thingee, your 
                    memories of our family should not be waned by a dwindled clan. 
                    We must hold onto the wonderful things that we all has done, 
                    but not let them hold us back in the wonderful things that 
                    we has yet to do. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shortly, 
                    this page will cease to exist, but will be replaced with a 
                    memorial to our fine organization. No one thing has brought 
                    us to this point, but all things, as me said, must come to 
                    an end... and me thinks it is better to bid a proud retreat 
                    than to wake up suddenly without a family around us. The lord 
                    Verant has planned a Guild Sweep in November, and me would 
                    not want to see MHC gone in the blink of an eye.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Me asks 
                    that on November 4th, thems that wishes to officially be removed 
                    from the guild would meet me at the place of our conception... 
                    outside of Kaladim. There, I shall wait throughout the day. 
                    At the end of this day, me will be closing the guild. If you 
                    has other plans on this day or dont wishes to come, dont worry 
                    about taking off your own tag, just puts it in a momento box 
                    and know that you will always be in my mind.</font></p>

say... first off me is sorry for not doin an update for ... goodness, almost
2 months!!!&nbsp; Oh, how the time flies!&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Well, me isnt sure what to
update about really, an as you is probably aware me isnt spendin what you
could call a 'lot' of time adventuring.&nbsp; Well, retirement in Steamfront
is a full time job really, an it seems me is working harder keepin the
young gnomes alive is more work than levellin ever was!&nbsp; Fortunately,
it seems as though the PK count has declined since me has taken up residence
there, so me guesses the work is not in vain.&nbsp; Um... me is wonderin
if anyone is actually readin this anymore, since updates is so few an far
between.&nbsp; <a href="mailto:osmosis@home.com">Let me know</a> if you
is... me might be doin a reorganization of this webspace thingee which
would move this website to another folder (which would require a little
manipulation to makes all the pages work right).&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Me is gettin a little blind
in my old age... me couldnt BELIEVE how dark Steamfront was tonight!&nbsp;
Why, me actually got LOST on my way back to Akanon from the minotaur caves!&nbsp;
My ultrasuperduper vision spell didnt even seem to help.&nbsp; *shrug*.&nbsp;
Gettin old is no fun, perhaps me will ask King Akanon to form a committee
to make some lights on the path over there.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Me has heard from Laffat
recently, an you should expect to sees him scarin the wildlife in the near
future, an also me heard that Katyn will be doin hims kicks an punches
for all the ladies to OOOOoo and AAaaaah at.&nbsp; Me also ran into a good
friend of Vanessalynnes, who says she is taken up near permanent residence
in one of those plane things that me cant get into yet... so me is sure
she is makin a good impression on those gods that live up there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Ahh, summertimes is here,
times for giant falling and ales on a sunny mountaintop!&nbsp; Me would
like to welcomes some of the new members (well, ALL of them actually),
an bit a sad farewell to Achazael who, likes Kinthaf, has leaved MHC to
joins up with them Dynasty of Blood peoples.&nbsp; Me hopes they treat
him well, him will be missed.&nbsp; Me also noticed that Pers is now in
(I thinks) Magus Imperialis Magicus, so me hopes all is well for him there
also, and will be missed as well.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Hum, peoples leaving, peoples
coming.&nbsp; Peoples not playing.&nbsp; From tha outside, some has asked
me if MHC is falling apart.&nbsp; Me responds to them that MHC will always
be here, an that peoples will always come and go.&nbsp; We is a family,
an sometimes family members must pursue interests outside of the family...
never will that makes them any less a part of us.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>On to business.&nbsp; Me
requires one or more of you to helps update this page with current events.&nbsp;
You is all aware of how busy me has become in tha 'other' world, sadly
our clan site has suffered due to that fact.&nbsp; If you wants to help
out, me will do whatever me can to makes it a simple task to edit this
page (it is pretty straightforward), just <a href="mailto:osmosis@home.com">emails</a>
me.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>*addendum*</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Pertaining to the loss of
Hannibal that me spoke of last update... it was a hoax perpitrated by tha
player of Hannibal.&nbsp; This only solidifies my belief that Darkenbane
has no honor, to have such a character in their midst.&nbsp;</font></font>

<font face="Tahoma">Yoo Hoo everyone!</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In a strange twist of irony,
Hannibal Castermaster &lt;Darkenbane> was killed on the 25th by a drunk
driver, so a moment of silence for the PK'd PKer. Wow, May13th was a super
long time ago, wasnt it?! The PvP thing we did was extremely fun an I thinks
we should do it again sometime soon, anyone has an idea when would be good?
Personally, me got whipped, but me has a whole bunch of excuses as to why
me did an I can tells them to you if you want so you can ask :).&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Lately me has been doing
a lot of soul searchin in Norrath, trying to finds my purpose in the world...
in every gnomes life we must takes some time out as we gets older an explore
our inner feelins an stuff. Bein an enchanter as well, I explores the paths
of pacifism and seeks the answers to the truths that confronts me. With
that sayd, me is also taking time from this to gains in experience, an
although Crolypher hasnt quite passed me him is getting closer... but I'll
be out of 45 quick an soon the planes are open to me! Vanessalynne (<font color="#FF00FF">level
50</font>!!)has been scouting them out lately, an told me she noticed a
LD loves (scratched out letters) on one of the trees in hate I thinks it
is. Laffat, care to fills us in?</font></font>

<font face="Tahoma">Halloo guild!</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Me is sorry for the lack
of updates lately... stuff is happens that has been keepin me away from
tha great big web.&nbsp; Most important in tha news is <font color="#FF0000">the
thingee we is doin tomorrow</font> (Sunday).&nbsp; If you doesnt know what
me is talkin about, either checks the '<a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/bmithrilhammerclan">happenings</a>'
section of them discussion boards, or asks someone in the guild when you
is awake.&nbsp; As a bit of a change, me is not scheduling a specific time
for this thing but keepin it loose an open for tha whole day.&nbsp; If
you wants to knows... me expects to be showing up around 11am PST if me
can.&nbsp; This is a test event, if it goes well it could become a regularily
scheduled thing.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>With tha entrance of Kunark,
we has a few connections now already within tha city of Calibis.&nbsp;
Please remember, though, that since Iksars is an evil race, they will not
be displaying their guild tags openly... they should be considered spies
in our service.&nbsp; This brings to light another issues that has comed
up, an that is of guild members inviting into the guild other characters
that they controls.&nbsp; After some discussion about this, we has decided
that <font color="#66FF99">each member may invites ONE secondary character
into the guild, an this secondary character must has reached level 15 before
being invited</font>.&nbsp; Now, me knows that there is peoples who dont
fit into this rule right away... this rule begins now an pertains to the
future.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I has some great screenshots
from Laffat, so they will be in tha screenshots page pretty dang soon.&nbsp;
Laffat is tryin to form a new roster, so please heads over to the discussion
board an identify youself.&nbsp; If you has no screenshot or listing in
the 'members' section... well this is you fault, so send me a screenshot
an me will add you!</font></font>

<font face="Tahoma">Hiya all!</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Well, Kunark is here, for
me at least, an I has to say that the new lands is very exciting and whatnot.
I am tryin to finds some neat things to brings back with me to shows you
all, already me found a funny hat with 10 armours an a wee bit of stamina
, but that me has gifted already away. There is some neat lookin weapons
but beyond looks they is just like swords an stuff... me hasnt seen but
one magic axe someone me was with wanted, so I dunno whats that was.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Me also wanted to be sure
you all knowed that the guild <a href="http://www.odrf-eq.de/usa.html">Orden
D' Regen Badus</a> or somethin like that have ( I believes theys name means
'order of engulfing darkness') teamed up with them <a href="www.darkenbane.com">D</a>arkenbane
bullies... an me knows thats bad news cause <a href="www.darkenbane.com">D</a>arkenbane
does bad things. Also, this means that Orden will be killin not just they're
enemies but now I guess everyone is they're enemy. Hmm.. so more PK stuff
to talk about ok?</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Oh yeah, an before me forgets,
there is some member petitions in the <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/bmithrilhammerclan">message
boards</a> general place. With tha amount of guild that has been playin

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Happy Egg Day!&nbsp; Me has
been lookin everywhere for an easter bunny in the commonlands, but I hasnt
found one yet.&nbsp; No eggs either.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I hopes that
you all have a good and chocolate filled weekend!</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Due to some lack of pure
clerical power, not much happened in Kedge Keep.&nbsp; Laffat an I swam
around for a while, killed some mermaids, an even had a bit of a run in
with Cauldronbubble... but nothin too major.&nbsp; Me guesses we're gonna
put that place on tha back burner for a little while, especially with a
whole new land having been discovered.&nbsp; Me has tried to reserve a
ticket on tha first Kunark boat, but the travel agents seem to have overlooked
my application (no short jokes!).&nbsp; Well, me hopes to see you there
as soon as me becomes able.&nbsp; Apparently, from what me heard, the boat
'may' be leaving from tha oasis docks.&nbsp; Expect a crowd.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Speakin of events, I'm gonna
try to organize a 'whole guild' event.&nbsp; To keep the info about this
event from fallin into the wrong hands, me suggests you head over to tha
<a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/bmithrilhammerclan">message
board</a>, and look in the passworded 'happenings' forum.&nbsp; nuff said
about that...</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In other news, Laffat an
Vanessalynne is slowly deckin themselves out in armours an stuff from the
PLANES, an me is enormously proud of them!&nbsp; Also, me wants to thanks
to Vanessa (and Gemm too) for tha super corpse retrieval job she done in
Guk tha other night... thanks a zillion!&nbsp; Slowly me is edging up to
them plane levels, an I is hopin that soon me will be there along side
you both to helps you get all them things (an mabye a item or 2 for myself!).&nbsp;
A few new members also we has gotten, an me would likes you all to direct
them, an help them, an make sure that they feel like part of tha family.&nbsp;
While generally speaking we is not recruiting new members, close friends
and tha like will be considered for membership.&nbsp; Once again, Mithril
Hammer Clan begins to grow!&nbsp; Me was even approached by one or 2 Darkenbane
members who wished to join, but obviously we cannot allow that.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Hmmm.... what else?&nbsp;
If you wants to update your members page info with a new picture or description,
<a href="mailto:osmosis@home.com">email
</a>me
with tha stuff.&nbsp; If you has any suggestions, you can either email
that too, or post in the message board (which me looks at almost daily).&nbsp;
If you happens to find a Robe of the Ishva, TELL ME!!</font></font>
