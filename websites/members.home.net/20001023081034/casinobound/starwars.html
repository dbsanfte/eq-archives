			Jeffery, president of LucasArts. &quot;The immensity and richness of the Star Wars universe lends itself ideally
			to a game of this nature.&quot;<BR>

			John Smedley, president and CEO of Verant. &quot;Star Wars offers such an incredible amount of depth and detail
			that we'll be able to create a place for fans to feel right at home. This game is going to be incredible!&quot;<BR>
