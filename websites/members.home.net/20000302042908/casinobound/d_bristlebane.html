<BR>
Followers of Bristlebane believe in having fun, at the expense of nearly all else. Bards, rogues, jesters, gamblers and gypsies are all typical followers. They are almost always very charming, clever, and witty, traits which all Bristlebane followers should strive to have. Mischief in all its forms is encouraged. Practical jokes are performed as if they are the highest of rituals. Very few of Bristlebane's followers are outright wicked in their desires but it is best to keep at least one eye on your purse if they are about. And never let one deal you a hand of King's Court.
