The Followers of Mithaniel Marr belive that valor is what separates civilized beings from beasts. His followers live by a strict moral code that prizes truth, honor, and charity. They are champions of the downtrodden and the most noble of warriors. His followers strive to rid Norrath of all things dark and evil, often sacrificing themselves in this never ending quest. They will not rest until the day when all of Norrath is cleansed in Mithaniel's light. They take themselves and their duty very seriously, and have little patience for mischief or mayhem. Many paladins are devout servants of Mithaniel Marr.
