<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Great Mother Tunare,
Prexus, The Oceanlord</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">,</font><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">
and Rallos Zek, The Warlord came to Norrath</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
after<font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">
Brell Serilis</font>, who<font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">
approached each of them, and after some time convinced them to meet as one to
discuss the fate of the world.&nbsp; Brell, proposed that they accept an
alliance of sorts, to which all save Rallos Zek agreed, ignorant of the fact
that Brell </font></font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">had already released some of his creations into the Underfoot of this
new world. </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">The planet that would be called Norrath was divvied up between these
beings of power for the purpose of keeping the </font>Veeshan <font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">in
check. Each would create a race of beings to watch over Norrath and keep a
vigilant eye on the schemes of Dragonkind. Brell claimed the bowels of the
planet and created the Dwarves, stout and strong, deep beneath the mountains of
Norrath. In the abysmal depths of the oceans Prexus left his children, the
Kedge, hearty aquatic beings of great mental power and stamina. And on the
surface of Norrath did Tunare create the Elves, creatures of limitless grace and
beauty</font>; The Koada'Dal, or High-Elves in the Common tounge, and the
Feir'Dal, or Wood-Elves.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Elves drew the
unwanted attention of Innoruuk, Prince of Hate. In a decrepit tower overlooking
the dark decaying alleys of the Plane over which he ruled, Innoruuk waited,
stoking the fire of his Hate until it was a raging inferno. He cursed his fellow
gods for not including him in their pact and vowed to make them regret such
disrespect. From the halls of the Elves' fair city, Takish-Hiz, the Prince of
Hate snatched away the first Elven King and Queen. In his realm of pain and
anger he slowly tore them apart, physically and mentally, over the course of
three hundred years. He then gathered the quivering remnants of these beings of
light and rebuilt them into his own dark sadistic image, a twisted mockery of
Tunare's noble children. In depositing the Teir'Dal, as Innoruuk's Dark Elven
creations would come to be called, back into the Underfoot of Norrath, the seeds
for The Prince of Hate's final revenge were sown.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#FFFFFF">Followers of Tunare
believe that we are all Tunare's children. The children of Tunare seek to help
Norrath, which they believe to be a living and breathing Being, to blossom and
grow. Followers believe that the world of Norrath gave birth to Tunare and from
her all life has sprung forth. Thus, by worshipping and protecting the land,
followers are paying homage and respect to The Mother of Their Mother, who in
turn protects and provides for them. Followers of Tunare will fight to the death
to protect nature in all it's forms. Many Druids, Rangers, and a great many
Elves follow the ways of Tunare.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">During <i> The Age of
Blood</i>,
the empire of the Elves was the last of the old races to decline. The Elddar
Forest spread across the entire southeastern quarter of Tunaria. Cities and
villages built high into the trees housed thousands of Wood Elves, and the
marble cities of the High Elves were built in the forest's clearings and
meadows, their white towers and spires climbing out of the forest, higher than
the tallest tree. But then came the last curse of the gods, as Solusek Ro, Lord
of Flame, arched the spine of the serpent mountains, bringing heat from the
burning sun to the ancient forest. The rivers ran dry, it rained less each year,
and while the great elven druids fought long and hard, using their powerful
magics to combat the change, they could only delay the inevitable. Slowly the
forest gave way to desert, and eventually even great Takish-Hiz crumbled, and is
know today as Befallen. The elves were forced to flee the continent of Tunaria,
leaving much of their greatness behind.&nbsp; The Elddar Forest stood once where
the Northern and Southern Desert of Ro (named for Solusek, who destroyed the
land) and the Oasis of Marr are now.&nbsp; Tunaria was eventually renamed by the
Humans to Antonica, after their first great leader, Antonius Bayle the First.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The fall of the Elves in
the Age of Blood can be attributed to Solusek Ro and the Teir'Dal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In <i>The Lost Age</i>, The
High-Elves and Wood-Elves retreated to the far eastern regions of the continent
of Faydwer, taking refuge in the Greater Faydark, beyond the Dwarven lands of
The Butchblock Mountains.&nbsp; The Wood-Elves built in the great trees of the
forest, their new home, Kelethin, and the High-Elves established the great city
of Felwithe, the City of Marble.&nbsp; They live in peace, but should not be
confused as the same race.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">King Tearis Thex of the
High-Elves, formed the secret order, The Silent watch, </font><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">in the early days of
Felwithe. King Tearis
Thex had many cruel deeds to do (these deeds where never documented, nor
reported). The regular Paladins were too righteous to
carry out any of the necessary missions and they dared not bring in the Feir'Dal,
because some of the operations were against Kelethin. King Tearis formed the
Silent Watch; Koada'Dal, not of prim and proper breeding. They act as a secret
guard and report only to him. They can be recognized by a distinct bracer
reserved for the Silent Watch.
</font></font></p>
<font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Silent Watch went virtually unnoticed until recently, until in the <i>Age
of Tumoil</i>, Princess Lenya
of Felewith went missing. After much investigation she was discovered imprisoned
by Carson MacCabe of Highhold by Tearon Bleanix. Tearon was eventually discovered by the
Highhold guards just after the Princesse's escape and is rumored to walk the
halls of Highhold Keep as the undead. Princess Lenya on the other hand never
made it home. She was last reported dwelling near the shores of Lake Rathetear.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The reason for her initial kidnapping and imprisonment still goes unknown,
but it is speculated that the Teir'Dal is behind this as a Dark Elf imposter of
the Princess has been sighted in Highhold Keep, attacking all those looking for
the real Princess Lenya.</font></p>
