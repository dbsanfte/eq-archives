        bit to get this for the past few levels.&nbsp; She made a vow to herself
        and to the guild that she would wait until which time she was
        &quot;qualified&quot; to get this weapon.&nbsp; Well I got news for you
        Andy,&nbsp; You have been qualified for quite some time now.&nbsp; I
        would salute you but your hugs are so much better!&nbsp;&nbsp; *HUGS*!</font></p>

        </b>An early morning post entitled "Sev is up log on if you see this" was enough to round up a ramshackle

		enough to shake a stick at and </font><a  href="http://www.legendsoftherealm.com/legends/images/sev-dead.jpg">

  <font face="arial" size="-1" color="#ffffff"><b>Aug 2nd Picture Page<br>
        </b>I have removed some pictures from the real life pictures page.&nbsp;
  I was saddened to
        see someone make a reference to how someone looked and they even had the audacity to post
        a link to the picture.&nbsp; I will not abide by such behavior and have removed several
        pictures.&nbsp; If a member wishes a picture to remain, they need to email me stating they
        do not mind the picture remaining up.</font>
  </p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#ffffff">That being said, a new picture has been
        put up of that little halfling rogue we know as Lumpin.</font></p>

        </b>Legends of the Realm is currently </font><b><u><font face="arial" size="-1"
        color="#FF0000">not accepting any new membership applications.</font></u></b><font
        face="arial" size="-1" color="#ffffff">&nbsp; We have recently grown fairly large recently
        and need to take time to get to know the newer members before accepting any others into
        our guild.&nbsp; If you are interested in joining Legends, the best advice I can provide
        is to simply group with as many Legends members as often as you are able.&nbsp;
        This will
        greatly expedite the process should we once again begin accepting new members.&nbsp;
        If
        you are not currently aligned with the Claws of Veeshan faction, that is something else
        you should consider working on before attempting to join Legends.&nbsp; We are Pro-Dragon
        aligned and actively hunting in areas where it is imperative you be at least dubious to
        CoV faction.</font> </p>

        <b>July 13-15 2001 Las Vegas Gathering a Success!<br>
        </b>Several of us met in real life in Las Vegas over this weekend.&nbsp;
        A great time was
        had by Rosha, Azlaan, Philander, Aylith, Vestrial, Thorkin, Yorke, and Veera.&nbsp;
        Yup,
        we called each other by our games names the entire time too :P hehe.&nbsp;
        Unfortunately,
        I had some technical difficulties with my camera so I was unable to snap all the pictures
        I wanted.&nbsp; We did get a group photo while we were at the Tournament of Kings Dinner
        Show.&nbsp; Phil has that and we should be able to have it scanned and posted at some
        point (provided all pictured consent).</font></p>
        <font face="arial" size="-1" color="#ffffff"><p>Real-Life Gathering update.&nbsp;
        Please
        make your own reservations with <a href="http://www.excaliburcasino.com" target="_blank">The
        Excalibur Hotel and Casino</a>.&nbsp; I will still see if we can get the rooms in the same
        area and work on getting a meeting room for the evening of July 13th.&nbsp;
        I am also
        checking on group seating for the Tournament of Kings Dinner show for the evening of July
        14th.</p>

        the first group photo of Legends!!&nbsp; Screenshots from the first ever Legends in-game
