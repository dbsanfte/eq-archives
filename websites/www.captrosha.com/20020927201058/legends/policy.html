<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><big><big>Legends Loot Policy</big></big></font></p>

<p align="left"><br>
This policy will be administered by the guild officers. Loot under this policy will be
distributed to primary characters
only, except secondary's may receive items when no mains have use for them, as long
as the secondary is useful
in guild raids. Each player will designate a primary character.<br>
<br>
This policy applies to all items and spells (&#147;Items&#148;) obtained by members of the
guild. Items obtained by members will
stay in guild, and not be traded or sold outside the guild except in accordance
with this
policy. With regards to items
obtained solo or in pick-up groups. The item is yours to decide to do with as you wish. If
you feel it's better served in
a trade for something for your own character, so be it. We will recognize your right to
determine what is best for your
character.<br>
<br>
Items obtained by Legends groups (defined as a group with 6 members) will become property
of the guild. Items will
be dealt with by the officers and appointed Guild Traders--with items being distributed to
those members who
contribute to the guild on a consistent basis. Members who turn over items they obtain
solo or in pickup groups are
considered before those members who do not. In lieu of items, donations of gems or
platinum is also considered as
contribution. We also recognize the freedom of guild members to gift others with items
(members or non-members).&nbsp; Simply inform a guild officer of such gifting and it will be considered as contributing to
the guild as if you gave the item
to the guild.<br>
<br>
Any person found to be actively and consistently avoiding grouping with other Legends in
order to bypass the policy
may be asked to leave the guild since it is obvious they are only out for their own
welfare and not the good of the
guild. (This will only happen after discussions with the individual and the guild leader
and officers...it will not happen
arbitrarily and without warning).<br>
<br>
<a href="#Example" dynamicanimation="fpAnimformatRolloverFP1" fprolloverstyle="font-variant: small-caps" onmouseover="rollIn(this)" onmouseout="rollOut(this)" language="Javascript1.2"><font color="#FFFFFF">
Officers will determine who receives Items with preference always being given first to
characters who can and will use
said Item who were present when such Item was obtained.<b>*</b></font></a> Any item that you are replacing
with an Item received
under this policy will be given to an officer for redistribution to other primary
characters in the guild who can and will
use it. Failure to turn over an item requested for redistribution will forfeit the
person's right to the new Item.&nbsp; <a href="#Case by Case" dynamicanimation="fpAnimformatRolloverFP1" fprolloverstyle="font-variant: small-caps" onmouseover="rollIn(this)" onmouseout="rollOut(this)" language="Javascript1.2"><font color="#FFFFFF">Exceptions to this will be considered by the
officer's on a case by case basis.</font><b><font color="#FF0000">**</font></b></a><br>
<br>
Distribution of items is not going to be an exact science, but we are going to do our best
to be fair to everyone.&nbsp; Factors that will be used to determine who gets an item include, but are not limited to:
level, time in guild, availability
for raids, donations of items to the guild, donation of time to the guild, and attendance
at guild events.<br>
<br>
Items should not be sold or traded outside the guild unless no primary (or useful
secondary) can use, and always with
officer consent.<b> If you leave the guild, to the extent possible, guild Items are to be
returned (in other words, if it is not No Drop it should be returned).</b> If you receive an Item
and then trade it because an irresistible trade offer comes along, the new item(s) are
considered property of the
guild. <br>
<br>
Certain guild officers will create characters to act as the bank for the guild.&nbsp;
These characters will hold excess items for the guild. In addition, one of the
characters created by the guild
leader will hold money for the guild for use in trading, for raids and to support our
craftspeople. Donation of platinum
to the guild is voluntary.<br>
<br>
Excess Items will be traded for items/spells the guild needs. Certain members of our guild
are very gifted in trading.
Officers will designate these members as &quot;Guild Traders&quot; who will trade on
behalf of the guild and have access to the
excess items and spells in the Guild Bank.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><b><a name="Example">*</a></b></font><i>This generally means that, for example, an enchanter at a raid will always get the
particular item before one not at
the raid.</i><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><a name="Case by Case">**</a></font><i>Why on a case by case basis? Whether or not something replaces something else can be a
murky question. Does a
2-handed weapon replace a 1 handed weapon? Does a +mana item replace an ac item or a
resist item?</i><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><big><big>So, what does this mean?</big></big></font><br>
<br>
<br>
If you are grouped with 6 or more Legends, Items obtained are property of the guild and
the guild officers will
determine what to do with the item. Also, you will receive the benefit of guild items
based on your contributions to
the guild. If you give freely, expect to receive freely. If you rarely give, then do not
expect to receive items in return.
If you give assistance teleporting people, assisting in corpse recovery, or on raids, you
are contributing (contributions
can be items, plat, gems, TIME, in-game assistance, but are not limited to this list).<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><big><big>What the hell? Why would I do this?</big></big></font><br>
<br>
<br>
It's simple. A group is more powerful than an individual. Have you ever wanted to make
some trade for some item yet
you lacked the plat or all the required items the person trading the item asked for?
Imagine the power of 80+ people
behind you, acquiring the platinum and items to make that trade! Some will likely view this
as a restriction on their
ability to trade or acquire items. I submit to you that it is a more powerful way to
acquire items!<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><big><big>What if I don't want to follow this policy?</big></big></font><br>
<br>
<br>
Then it is probably best for you to move on to another guild. There will be no hard
feelings and I will ask all guild
members to treat you with the respect of one who wore the Legends name.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><big><big>Who is responsible for this?</big></big></font><br>
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, Vestrial&nbsp; as the Guild Leader. If you wish to rant, vent, or blowup at someone,
then Vestrial is the person to whom
you need to direct the above. You should&nbsp; know the guild officers&nbsp;
have put a
lot of thought and effort
into this and feel this is the best thing for this guild. As already mentioned, a great
many people ALREADY follow
this policy. We are just making that the official policy.</p>
