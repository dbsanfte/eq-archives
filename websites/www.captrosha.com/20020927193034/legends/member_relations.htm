<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#0099CC">Member Relations <!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p>This guild was founded and operates on the principal of helping.&nbsp; As such, there
are certain guidelines by which members should follow regarding other guildmembers. &nbsp;
This is not an attempt to tell any player how to play their character nor an attempt to
dictate how one should relate to others.&nbsp; Just some suggestions and my ideals on how
I would hope we all treat each other. One note: Yes, it would be ideal to provide items,
services, and aid for no fee or cost at all, but I realize this is not always practical
and not everyone is so wealthy they have money to burn freely.&nbsp; </p>
