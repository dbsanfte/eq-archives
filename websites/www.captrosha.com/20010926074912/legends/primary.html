        </b>I have removed some pictures from the real life pictures page.&nbsp; I was saddened to
        see someone make a reference to how someone looked and they even had the audacity to post
        a link to the picture.&nbsp; I will not abide by such behavior and have removed several
        pictures.&nbsp; If a member wishes a picture to remain, they need to email me stating they
        do not mind the picture remaining up.</font></p>

        </b>Legends of the Realm is currently </font><b><u><font face="arial" size="-1"
        color="#FF0000">not accepting any new membership applications.</font></u></b><font
        face="arial" size="-1" color="#ffffff">&nbsp; We have recently grown fairly large recently
        and need to take time to get to know the newer members before accepting any others into
        our guild.&nbsp; If you are interested in joining Legends, the best advice I can provide
        is to simply group with as many Legends members as often as you are able.&nbsp; This will
        greatly expedite the process should we once again begin accepting new members.&nbsp; If
        you are not currently aligned with the Claws of Veeshan faction, that is something else
        you should consider working on before attempting to join Legends.&nbsp; We are Pro-Dragon
        aligned and actively hunting in areas where it is imperative you be at least dubious to
        CoV faction.</font> </p>

        we called each other by our games names the entire time too :P hehe.&nbsp; Unfortunately,

        I wanted.&nbsp; We did get a group photo while we were at the Tournament of Kings Dinner
        Show.&nbsp; Phil has that and we should be able to have it scanned and posted at some

        area and work on getting a meeting room for the evening of July 13th.&nbsp; I am also
        checking on group seating for the Tournament of Kings Dinner show for the evening of July
