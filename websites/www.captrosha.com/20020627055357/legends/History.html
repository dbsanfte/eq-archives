<td><font face="arial" size="-1">&nbsp;Legends of the Realm (LOTR) was actually
  born in March of 1998 on the Atlantic Shard in a game called Ultima
  Online.&nbsp; The guild was fairly small compared to other UO guilds.&nbsp;
  When EverQuest was released, I ended up shelving UO in favor of EQ.&nbsp; I
  met a few people on Innoruuk and we ended up playing together all the
  time.&nbsp; I thought it would be good to have our own chat channel to make it
  easier to keep in touch and find each other.&nbsp; The core members who helped
  form this guild were a trio of Elven Rangers named Talyn, Moshady, and
  Ropriest, a stout Dwarven Cleric by the name of Bandolaf, an Elven Wizard
  named Celestial, a Halfling Warrior named Tarro, an Ogre Warrior named Thulaak,
  and a Elven Enchanter named Sakuma.&nbsp; We joined and became the guild
  Legends in late April or early May of 1999.&nbsp; I do not recall the actual
  date.&nbsp; When the guild was formed, the name for the guild tag was
  shortened from Legends of the Realm to simply Legends.&nbsp; We didn't want a
  guild name that took up half of someone's screen.</font>
  <p><font face="arial" size="-1">The guild had it's ups and downs.&nbsp; Many
  people joined the guild and moved on the bigger and better things.&nbsp; Some
  members went on to form their own guilds.&nbsp; Some of which were far more
  successful and other guilds that have simply gone by the wayside.&nbsp; There
  were people who left for other, bigger guilds that offered them faster
  advancement than what Legends was able to provide at the time.&nbsp; Then
  there were those who stuck with the guild through it all.&nbsp; Those people
  who believed in the guild but more importantly, believed in the people in the
  guild.&nbsp; Legends was always about friends and having fun.&nbsp; About the
  person playing the character, not the character being played.&nbsp; Legends on
  EQ has finally begun making it to the higher level things and has become quite
  successful lately.&nbsp; I think the strength of this guild will always be the
  people in the guild.&nbsp; People who care about each other and are able to
  look past the game aspects and not get bogged down in loot and leveling.</font></p>
  <p><font face="arial" size="-1">A new chapter in the guild's history is now being written.&nbsp; I have stepped down as the leader of&nbsp;
  Legends.&nbsp; I feel I have led the guild as far as I am capable.&nbsp; The
  guild now needs a leader who understands the mechanics of the high-level
  game.&nbsp; A leader who can run raids for the high level
  encounters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Time will tell what will unfold in this new era of
  Legends.</font></p>
  <p><font face="arial" size="-1">And so a new era begins on EverQuest and the story continues to
  unfold...</font>
