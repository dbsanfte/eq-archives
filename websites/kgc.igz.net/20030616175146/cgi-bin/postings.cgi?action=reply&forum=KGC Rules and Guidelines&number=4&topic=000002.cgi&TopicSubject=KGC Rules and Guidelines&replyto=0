<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst:
[B]Below are the rules and guidelines followed by all members of the KGC. Any questions, please post in the members forum.

------------Karana Guild Central Rules and Guidelines----------- 
KGC Courtesy Guidelines
1. Post your in game name and your guild name in your posts often so we know who you are representing. 

2. Use common sense when posting and don't flame. 

Planes Scheduling Rules

1. A thread is started on Monday morning by the schedule administrator (currently Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst) or a designee for people to post their requested plane days for the next week. The thread may be closed anytime on Tuesday after 6:00 p.m. ET.

2. When scheduling a plane day you may list as many choices as necessary to try to ensure you get a day. Do not edit your post in the schedule thread. The schedule admin will compile the choices and attempt to give everyone a plane day, with priority given based on the current planes rotation. (unless rule 3 below applies). The planes rotation contains all the guilds/alliances and is rotated by seven guilds every week (this number may change as guilds are added or removed from the rotation). 

3. You can make ONE plane reservation per guild/alliance during the initial scheduling period. If a spot is still open after the schedule is posted, you are welcome to schedule another plane day then. The only exception is you can book multiple PoA days (maximum of three) due to the tactics involved with this zone. 

4. You can book for the PM (4:00 PM PST) slot after an Asian guild. Be aware that the spawns may be scarce, do not expect a fully popped plane. 

Planes Courtesy 
1. You should be out of the plane by 4:00 am EST (1:00 AM PST) to allow for respawn for the next guild. Please be especially considerate if an Asian or European guild is following you. 

2. Do not enter a plane when it is not your plane day unless you have permission from the leader or an officer of the guild/alliance that has scheduled the plane for the day. The only cases in which guilds shall ask to enter a plane are to help the guild that has the plane conduct CR, to perform CR from a previous raid, to kill Gwan in the PoA, or to kill Cazic in the PoF (See Large Target Rule #5). Under no circumstances shall the guild that has not reserved the plane kill any mini-bosses or epic piece droppers.

3. Be flexible when dealing with guilds that are up for gods. If you are in a plane and a god spawns, you must notify the guild up for the god immediately in game or via KGC, so they can kill the god during the required 24 hour time period. This includes, but is not limited to, informing them as soon as you know CT is up, letting them know when you're done (with advanced warning to allow for gathering time), and if you're moving slowly, inviting them to help you clear the plane more quickly (with all regular zone drops going to the guild owning the plane for the day).

4. If you fail on successive plane raids you should re-evaluate your strategy and stop scheduling planes for a while. Join an alliance if you need help or ask to attend someone else's plane raid for experience . It is very frustrating for the rest of us to see a plane go to waste with so many guilds getting left out during the scheduling process. 

5. Not including prospective guild members (or prospective guilds in the case of an alliance), there should be no more than three people not members of your guild/alliance on a planar raid.

Large Target Rotations Rules (Cazic Thule, Yelinak, Lady Vox, Lord Nagafen, Venril Sathir, Trakanon, Severillous, Talendor, Gorenaire) 

1. When a large target rotational mob is up the first 5 guilds may engage it. If more than 1 guild gathers to kill a mob, then the guild lower in the rotation must give way to the higher seed guild so long as the higher seed guild has a reasonable chance at succeeding against the target. The guild that succeeds will move to the bottom of the rotation. If a guild attempts and fails they will move to the bottom of the rotation with a (1).  [This section does not deal with Lord Nagafen, Lady Vox, or Cazic Thule.  Refer to section 1.4 for rules on them.]

1.1 If a rotation mob spawns before 8pm local time of the first seed guild, then that guild is required to mobilize their attempt or take a fail. The first seed guild may pass to one of the lower seed guilds for no penalty before 8pm local time if there is another lower seed guild mobilizing in the zone before that time and they accept. If no other guild is mobilizing then the first seed guild must make their attempt or take a fail and move to the end of the rotation.

1.2 If the mob spawns after 8pm local time and remains up past 8pm local time the next day, then the first seed guild will move to the back with a failure (1) notation. Local time will be determined by the time zone of the first guild in that rotation. 

1.3 If this passes it will be implemented for a 2 month trial period after which a permanent vote will be taken. The permanent vote to keep this must pass with a Supermajority of 76% or greater of the guilds voting to keep it. Should a guild vote to abstain in this vote it will be counted as a No vote as this will result in a permanent change to the KGC guildlines. Should this not pass after 2 months, the KGC will revert to its original rotations. Although the actual guild rotation will remain as it was the day the final vote was tallied so that guilds that killed mobs during the rotation change will not have second chances afterwards.

1.4 This rule applies to Lord Nagafen, Lady Vox, and Cazic Thule.  You must make your attempt to kill the target the day of spawn unless it spawns after 8:00 PM for your guild's local regional time (ex: EST/PST for USA, GMT+9 for Japan, GMT+1 for Euro). If it spawns after 8:00 p.m. local time, you should begin your attempt the next day within 24 hours of the target's spawn time. 

2. If you're going to pass, do so within a reasonable amount of time. (before 5:00 PM local). On rotations where pass/fail is tracked, passing when you are currently up for the target counts as a failed attempt. 

3. If a large target spawns 6-8 hours before patch or server maintenance, it MAY be considered FFA. The guild that is up for a target when a patch is imminent may NOT declare the target FFA and then engage the target. The guild up for the target MUST make an attempt to find a swap if they are not going to engage the target. 

In the case of a FFA god, the guild scheduled to be in the plane the day/night before patch can kill the god if they are able to, or call in another guild to kill the god. The "god" group may help them clear spawn with the understanding that all planar loot goes to the "plane" guild and all god loot goes to the "god" guild. 

Use your judgement. We have been handling these rare FFA situations relatively fine for close to two years now. If you think you are going to be flamed for your actions by a good portion of the KGC members, it is probably an abuse of the FFA rules.

4. There should be no help from ANY members of other guilds/alliances for large targets if their guild/alliance occupies a spot within that particular large target rotation. (this does not apply to Vox/Nag due to level restrictions). 

Example: Do not accept or solicit help from anyone in the Inny rotation if you are killing Inny. If you are killing Trakanon, getting help from another guild/alliance in the Inny or Vox rotation is okay as long as they are not in the Trakanon rotation. Keep all help such as this to a minimum as it is the spirit of the KGC that each guild occupying a slot does so because they are able to do it on their own and understands the concept behind having a rotation. It is all about being equal and therefore sharing equally. Having 1-2 groups but gathering 4-5 more groups in various other guilds/alliances would be considered abuse. 

5. The guild that is up for Cazic Thule may enter the Plane of Fear after 8:00 p.m. to help clear the plane so they can kill the god. They are strongly encouraged to work with the guild that has the plane to set up a time they may enter. Note: All drops from regular mobs, mini-bosses and the dracoliche go to the guild that had the plane scheduled for the day.

6. Post the results of the large target attempt on the KGC ASAP (pass/fail/success) so the next guild can prepare for their turn. It is customary to post the loot obtained. 

7. Kunark Outdoor dragons follow a progressive scale of Sev -&gt; Tal -&gt; Gor. You need to kill Severillous before entering Talendor rotation, Talendor before entering Gorenaire rotation. An additional option to get on the Tal/Gor rotations is without outside assistance to kill any of the following: Wuoshi, Klandicar, Sontalak or any of the named ToV dragons.

8. If you pass/fail on Nagafen, Lady Vox, Severillous, Talendor, Gorenaire, Venril Sathir, Trakanon or any rotation target 2 times in a row you will drop out of the rotation for 1 cycle. Your pass/fail count will be designated in parentheses beside your slot in the rotation. 

9. Do not kill fire giants on server reset unless you are up for Nagafen. Do not kill fire giants AT ALL if Nagafen is up. 

10. The prerequisite for joining the Yelinak rotation is killing (with no outside assistance) one of the following: Kland, Sont, Keeper.

NToV Rules/Rotation:

1) NTOV, with the exception of Eeshan and Indy is on a rotation. Although Indy and Eeshan are typically, FFA, guilds must step aside when the NTOV rotation guild arrives for their turn with at least 30 people.

2) Aary must be killed on the first night and must be killed before doing any NToV rotation dragons. If a guild does not kill Aary on the first night, their turn is over, and they go to the back on the rotation. THe next guild in the rotation is then up.

3) If a guild fails two times in a row on Aary, they get a (skip).

4) The rotation slot for NToV can last for up to three days. At least one dragon must be killed each day. 

5) If a guild completes their slot or gives up prior to the end of their slot the remainder of the zone is FFA till Aary repops or the next patch, whichever comes first.

6) If Aary pops but the remainder of the zone hasnt spawned the guild up shall be allowed 48 hour delay in starting time to allow for full pop, but once they start their time has started

7) To add their name to the NToV rotation a guild must be able to (without outside help) kill Cazic Thule and Keeper or Yelinak.

THe next guild in the rotation is then up.<P>3) If a guild fails two times in a row on Aary, they get a (skip).<P>4) The rotation slot for NToV can last for up to three days. At least one dragon must be killed each day. <P>5) If a guild completes their slot or gives up prior to the end of their slot the remainder of the zone is FFA till Aary repops or the next patch, whichever comes first.<P>6) If Aary pops but the remainder of the zone hasnt spawned the guild up shall be allowed 48 hour delay in starting time to allow for full pop, but once they start their time has started<P>7) To add their name to the NToV rotation a guild must be able to (without outside help) kill Cazic Thule and Keeper or Yelinak.<P><BR>[This message has been edited by Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst (edited 04-09-2002).]<P>[This message has been edited by Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst (edited 05-07-2002).]<P>[This message has been edited by Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst (edited 05-13-2002).]<P>[This message has been edited by Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst (edited 07-01-2002).]<p>[This message has been edited by Kellory (edited 01-20-2003).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
