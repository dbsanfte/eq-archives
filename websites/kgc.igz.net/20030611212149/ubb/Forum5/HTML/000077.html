</FONT><HR>copyinging here<BR>According to the hitlist, Yelinak has been up for something like 5 days. Dazzadi has already pointed this out on other MB, so are we trying to look bad? Please take out Yelinak ASAP, think you can skip the first three guilds or so because it has been up so long. This is exactly the kind of thing that has been causing these problems in the first place. If you don't care enough about a target to check for it when you are up (or even bother to check the hitlist to see if you are up) then do us all a favor and remove yourself from that rotation.<P>------------------<BR>Farrnusno<BR>Guild Leader of Souls of the Valiant<BR>Illusion of Shadows Council Member<BR>KCoG Planar/VS Liaison<P>[This message has been edited by Farrnusno (edited 12-28-2002).]<P>IP: Logged<BR> <BR>Andric d'Regor<BR>Member   posted 12-28-2002 12:06 PM                 <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>He was down on tuesday - apparantly killed ot of rotation monday I was told.

Ash alliance is in direct violation of the rule which states that a guild will engage a mob unless it spawns after 8pm. It is not up to me to check spawns but on this occasion I did. The spawn was indeed up on Friday the 27th and Ash alliance failed to engage until Sat the 28th. I may not matter to you...But I do believe that your actions should be made available for the rest of the KGC to view.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#cd7f32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://kgc.igz.net/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000077.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=KGC+Guild+Trading+Exchange&TopicSubject=Yelinak">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#000000">

</FONT><HR>Personally Dazzadi's credibility here and elsewhere is Nil. He admitted on another board that he had taken out Yelinak. Now he is trying to say that Yeli has been up for 5 days?<BR>He is trying to cause trouble and get attention. He was bothering our council while we were taking Yelinak down trying to say that it had spawned yesterday. <P>Sorta inconsistant there, wouldn't you say? 5 days or two or one. And if Yeli HAD spawned yesterday and nobody else knew then why didn't dazzi take him out? Especially if he cares enough to pester us about it.<P>Troll. DNFTEC (Do Not feed the Energy Creature<P>wrong YOU said he was up for 5 days on YOUR kgc site. Failed to update it being up or not. I said he has been up for over 24 hours.<BR>If you will recall I said I would play nice in the sandbox with all the other kids for a month....but also said I was watching. Thats why he was still alive for ash to kill after he was up and after their turn was up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#cd7f32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://kgc.igz.net/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=5&topic=000077.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=KGC+Guild+Trading+Exchange&TopicSubject=Yelinak">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://kgc.igz.net/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum5&number=5&thisthread=000077&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://kgc.igz.net/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum5&number=5&thisthread=000077&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
