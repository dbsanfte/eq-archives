<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Mechy:
[B]  Hello all , I would like to make a few comments as to about what has been going on for a while in Karana with the whole KSing that everyone claims to be going on. 

  Ok first off , its not Ksing to begin with unless the target mob is attacked by another guild first and then someone else comes in and attacks it thats not part of your guild and takes the kill. 

  Second , KGC has about as much authority in this matter as a bunch of babies in cribs in some unknown hospital which means exactly ZERO. KGC has never had any influence in anyones decisions other that that of said mobs and thats been only hanging by a thread for the last 3 to 4 years that KGC has been around.

  Third , The only people that give a damn about the whole matter really is the ones whos losing mobs in these rotations.

  Solutions , Well theres not many solutions to this as they can do pretty much any damn thing they want as long as its not a LEGITMATE KS. 

  Whats forseen? Ok heres whats gonna happen to break in down in a nutshell. KGC is powerless to any of this going on. KGC will fall due to other guilds getting pissed off about all of this and taking mobs on rotation when its not they're turn. This has all been done to set in motion what almost is inevidable and thats the fall of KGC. 

   So , What do us ( the ones who do abide by this shaky regulations) do about all this? Well hey , The bandwagon has started , Not a thing we can do but either bitch , piss and moan about it for the next 3 years or we can all start taking down rotation mobs when they pop. 

   So , whats the point of me crying over this? Why cant Our guild just go in and take stuff? I tell ya why , and the reason is none. Theres no reason why we cant. I pay my 13 bucks just like everyone else in this game and I expect full playability , not bound by anyones rules other than the ones that made the game. 

   KGC was set up to make it easier for more guilds to obtain rare items and not make any one guild alot more powerful that the rest. ITS OVER , the restless dagger thats been in our backs for so long has been removed and shall forever just be a whisper from now on. 

   So hey , lets get our asses out there and take whats ours and not let these other rogue bandings get all the glory I say. After all , since when has KGC paid any part of our accounts to bind us by they're ways? NEVER................
