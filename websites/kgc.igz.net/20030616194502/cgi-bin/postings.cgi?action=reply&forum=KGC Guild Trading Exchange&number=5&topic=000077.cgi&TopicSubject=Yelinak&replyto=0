[B]copyinging here
According to the hitlist, Yelinak has been up for something like 5 days. Dazzadi has already pointed this out on other MB, so are we trying to look bad? Please take out Yelinak ASAP, think you can skip the first three guilds or so because it has been up so long. This is exactly the kind of thing that has been causing these problems in the first place. If you don't care enough about a target to check for it when you are up (or even bother to check the hitlist to see if you are up) then do us all a favor and remove yourself from that rotation.

Ash alliance is in direct violation of the rule which states that a guild will engage a mob unless it spawns after 8pm. It is not up to me to check spawns but on this occasion I did. The spawn was indeed up on Friday the 27th and Ash alliance failed to engage until Sat the 28th.
