                      <B>Reflections</B>
<BR><BR>
                      Malgorm walked the tunnels of Black Burrow listening to the music of death,
                      the screams of pain and pleas for help. The gnolls had grown to fear him as
                      he hunted their leaders. He killed the giant black snakes crawling the halls
                      that were so much like him. Malgorm killed. Sometimes he would just sit
                      and admire the snakes, whose fangs he carried as weapons out of respect
                      for the cold blooded creatures. He just laughed as one ate a halfling, then
                      killed it to prove he was the bigger snake.
<BR><BR>
                      Malgorm turned to see the twins Stormangell and Silverann. Ah, how they
                      where drawn to him. As they spoke he knew they were more than just
                      corrupted. Malgorm had spent much time with Stormangell. He felt the boy's
                      pain, but something drew him closer to the twins inexplicably. The answer
                      was not yet to be seen. Silverann seemed to dislike Malgorm; harboring
                      strong hate and love at the same time. Both were following Sugan as Wind
                      Riders, and Malgorm corrupted as many of her followers as he could to hurt
                      her. There was something more about them though. He wanted them. The
                      hunger wanted them, and what the hunger wanted Malgorm was powerless
                      to refuse.
<BR><BR>
                      <B>The Trap</B>
<BR><BR>
                      Deep in the sewers Malgorm heard Lord Faileas summoning him. It was his
                      time... they had trapped the foolish Sugan. As Malgorm made his way
                      though the maze he saw once again the red haired female slicing at his
                      great Lord Faileas, but this time there was no divine storm. She was being
                      overwhelmed by the power of darkness. Lord Faileas crushed her with the
                      strength of his mighty dark blade as Malgorm tormented her soul with
                      shadows. Sugan's blood stained the sewer floor, and she looked up to see
                      her beloved Canelon. With her eyes she begged him at last for help from the
                      pain. Before the high elf could respond Malgorm started chanting unearthly
                      words, forcing a magickal gate open. Terror spread across both Canelon and
                      Sugan's faces. At the word of Bertoxxulous both twins were caught by the
                      unholy power and swept away into the gate. Malgorm only smiled as he
                      vanished, and the axe of Canelon only hit the wall where he once stood.
                      Lord Faileas had won.......

                      <B>The Return</B>
<BR><BR>
                      Many moons passed as Malgorm grew in power far beyond the normal rate
                      of a mortal. The Wind Riders hunted him, lead by the Knight of Storms, the
                      great Canelon Lightweaver. A blood hunt for his head; and Malgorm merely
                      taunted them. So many spies existed among the Wind Riders that they
                      would never catch him. There were many evil deeds he did during this time.
                      He killed many of the Temple of Life and tortured many of the brothers of the
                      robe. He was feeding the hunger and it grew stronger; a plague that covered
                      the land. Malgorm killed everyday; looking for the light to infect it with his
                      corruption. He had made his way to Freeport knowing Lord Faileas would
                      return soon. Malgorm prepared for the return of the twins, his will
                      strengthened to hold Sugan to the darkness. He worked on the boy
                      Stormangell on a daily basis, infecting him with the plague.
<BR><BR>
                      The time had come. Lord Faileas marched in from Bertoxxulous' void like a
                      great god of darkness with Sugan at his side. The Wind Riders' pleas fell
                      upon deaf ears as Sugan called those still loyal to the shadows. The pain
                      upon the faces of her loved ones made Malgorm smile in almost pure glee
                      as he sat watching from the shadows, cloaked by his magick. Their
                      pleading for their beloved Sugan and her evil look as she blew them off with
                      ease... for the first time Malgorm felt true joy. Then to hear Lord Faileas tell
                      Stormangell that he was his father and watch him join the shadows; the
                      plans of the hunger had fallen into place. All was as it was supposed to
                      be….
