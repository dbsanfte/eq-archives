                      Silverann watched Envy, Malgorm, and Faileas, as he awaited the verdict on
                      his actions. He knew the punishment would be severe as he waited numbly for
                      the sentence at hand. They spoke to him of his action and the lack of honor it
                      showed. He mentioned he had no excuses for his crime, nor would offer any. 
                      Faileas told Malgorm he was in charge of the punishment and to go on. 
                      As Malgorm chanted the arcane words of a spell in an old book, Silverann did
                      not know what it was he was being punished with until he felt his life force
                      being ripped from him and the life of his only child still unborn in the womb die
                      at the separation of its father from the family ties they all shared.
                      He watched Envy’s helplessness to his lost connection to his family being
                      stripped away. Her promise unfulfilled because he was not bodily harmed. He
                      didn’t mention to any of them in their justice to spare his life that he was
                      walking dead at the separation from his mother, father, uncle, brother, sister,
                      and unborn child, that what they tried not to do they had done.
                      As further punishment his father told him he was free of the curse that gave him
                      power and he was a bastard child, and quite normal little wood elf, and to live
                      a normal life marry and the like. 
<BR><BR>
                      It didn’t end there Malgorm walked forward putting his hand on Silverann’s
                      face and disfigured half his face with his hell fires, and told him he doubted he
                      would find a wife now.
<BR><BR>
                      Faileas refused to look at him through out the process of the sentencing, and
                      Envy stared at the ground helplessly. Malgorm was grim considering his nature
                      Silverann noted to himself.
<BR><BR>
                      With the sentencing and punishment being over they left him at the South Ro
                      Druid Circle, Silverann watched them leave sadly.
                      Casting his own spells from the Goddess Tunare, he visited his home in
                      Qeynos and burned his gardens and put his dog down, since in time he would
                      not be there to care for the animal anymore there was no point.
                      After leaving Qeynos he visited all the places he had acquired as homes and
                      gave them to the needy. Silverann gave all his worldly druid possessions to
                      complete strangers of the Druid and Clerical classes, as they would need them
                      more.
<BR><BR>
                      Writing a letter of apology to his mother that there was no point of her
                      watching him waste away he left his money to the temple of Innoruuk to exact
                      hate and vengeance against even his own father and uncle for the unwitting
                      death of his only child to their false pride, honor, and his father who had the
                      nerve to punish him for his lack of family honor, when he had none of his own.
                      Silverann teleported from Druid Circle to Druid Circle looking at all the things
                      half his family for so many years sought to destroy, and cried.
                      Standing up he then started his final cast to the last place he would go to Lava
                      Storm, to smell the sulfur and fire.
<BR><BR>
                      Staring at the molten lava in the land near the Druid circle, his misshapen face
                      hardly a concern, which he considered a just punishment for his crimes, he
                      thought back to all his troubles to save those he loved and cared for.
                      Silverann thought of his love for Envy, his broken connection to his brother
                      Stormangell, broken connection with his mother Sugan, her brother Faileas,
                      and his Father Malgorm. 
<BR><BR>
                      Continuing to look at the hot lava he allowed himself to feel the pain he was in
                      despite the loss of power. The loss of his family connection was the most
                      debilitating part of his curse that wasn’t lost with his removal from the
                      Imshee'Cro family line and curse. Feeling that ever present pain that came with
                      being who and what he was, pain so acute no amount of torture had yet came
                      close to being noticeable, today it would be over as was the death of his child
                      and his expected slow demise.
<BR><BR>
                      Thinking to himself, perhaps the end of pain is what I was after all along; this is
                      the end of all that maddening pain.
<BR><BR>
                      Silverann smiled slightly to himself, and jumped into the only pain he would
                      ever feel since he decided to chase the power, feeling sorry for all he was
                      leaving behind, and thinking they never needed to know how destructive that
                      simple separation from the Imshee'Cro was…..The end.
