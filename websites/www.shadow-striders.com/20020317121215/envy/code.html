<P><B>The Code.</B>
<P>I am a Knight of Shadow, and as such I've had many battles of morals and wit. Many challenges by ignorant, self-righteous lightwalker zealots who accuse me of wrongs they know nothing of. Assumption is a lightwalker's deadliest fault. It is set in the minds of the weak from very early on that a vile, perverse Shadow Knight is as different from their kind as night is to day. They think that nothing is below our standards. But how far from the truth…
<P>As I explain to them slowly, (like teaching a child) that all they have learned is false, I can observe the crusades and arguments crumbling from their eyes. It's a precious sight, and one that gains a great amount of trust that can be manipulated. Never can they fathom that an enemy could have honour. They become unsure. Doubting their faiths. Once this is established, lightwalkers tend to believe we can be "saved"; during which time I do them the favour of breaking their trust slowly. Delicately, leading them on as long as possible. As reality finally hits them… no, IF reality finally hits them, then I've accomplished a great betrayal, formed an enemy, and hardened the victim emotionally - most of the time to the point of Hatred. My goal all along.
<P>But I keep my Code during all this. I am a Knight, after all.
<P>Honour is my genius. My integrity. My coup d'état. It is also my tribute to the Irony that this land should be named for. I take great pride in the fact that all my deeds, all my "antisocially acceptable" acts, are performed in accordance with a code of honour. There are others who may live by the code, but any Knight worth his title should be depended on for it, whether one knows them personally or not. Self-proclaimed "knights" I find who don't follow a code, are no longer knights in my eyes… and further more, to be put to death the moment I'm able to hunt them down and do so. Such cowards are not worthy to carry the same title as I.
<P>Deception is not outside of these boundaries. Indeed, if someone is fool enough to believe all they see and hear, please do take advantage of them. I have lied in my time, but only at choice moments. Lying isn't something I indulge in often. When my word is given, however, expect only the truth. A Knight, clearly, is only as good as his word. Blackmail and other treacheries are useful as well. Intrigue is part of the romance… the more charisma put into a game, the more fun the game becomes. I will ardently refuse to face an opponent of skill obscenely less than mine, unless it becomes necessity. There is always the line of survival; or absurdity when the pitiful must be put in their place, or out of existence.
<P>It delights me to no end when I discover a rare gem of a Shadow Knight, who not only follows a code, but exploits it in ways I can appreciate. Lady Nauria is one of these. I've received a short list of insights from her, on the matter of conduct we Knights proudly display.
<UL><LI>Although we all may walk the shadowed path, conflicts will arise. If a guild mate enters into conflict with you, it is in the best interests of the guild as a whole to resolve the conflict. If the conflict cannot be resolved, destroy them.</LI>
<LI>Do not complain about any burden that you willingly subject yourself to.</LI>
<LI>Do not give opinions or advice to individuals unless asked or provoked.</LI>
<LI>Do not share your troubles with others unless they wish to hear them. It displays weakness. Make sure those you do share with are interested in assisting you. Most will only exploit your weaknesses. There will always be someone who can profit by aiding you. Seek such people out with your problems, avoid all others.</LI>
<LI>Do not take what belongs to another guild member unless you have cause to or they secretly yearn to be relieved of the burden. We are a guild of like-minded individuals; we serve no purpose when we hurt each other without cause.</LI>
<LI>Empty posturing can be most irritating. I've seen people dismissing Lord Faileas (and others) when it is quite clear that he could defeat them blindfolded and unarmed. Too many people desperately yearn to be unique by constantly dropping tales of their freakish past or selling themselves as the greatest thing since the invention of the sword. Prove yourself by your actions, not by how snobby you can act.</LI>
<LI>It's all right to conform to a person's wishes, if it ultimately benefits you. But only fools follow along with the herd, letting an impersonal entity dictate to you. The key is to choose a leader wisely instead of being enslaved by the whims of many.</LI>
<LI>Live not for other's expectations of you.</LI>
<LI>Never fight in vain. Chose your battles wisely, and do not enter into combat with someone better. In such cases, death may turn out to be the best outcome, life the worst.</LI>
<LI>One of the most deadly mistakes we can enter into is the act of deceiving ourselves. Thinking that you are better than you are, not knowing your own limits, these things can blind you to your own faults. Others will not be so blind. Pride is a good thing. If you do something well, be proud of it. Just don't let your own self-image become a myth that is disconnected from reality. As they say, pride goeth before the fall...</LI>
<LI>Projecting your reactions, responses, and sensibilities onto someone else is dangerous. It is the mistake of expecting people to give you the same consideration, courtesy, and respect that you naturally give them. They won't, they will react in their own way, according to their own beliefs. You will be hurt if you constantly expect people to live up to your expectations of them.</LI>
<LI>Rudeness is unbecoming and crude. There are better ways of hurting your enemies then to be a boorish oaf.</LI></UL>
Naturally there could be many more listed, but such rules are unnecessary in the face of our dignity. Knights simply know.</P>
