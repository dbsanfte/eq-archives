                 <I>This story takes place when Sugan was evil, right before she returned to the Wind Riders</I>
<BR><BR>
                 When he was out of sight, Envy released her breath and moved into the doorway. The
                 thing looked at her blankly through its scum covered eyes, waiting for her to cross the
                 threshold. Envy marveled at the work, and reverently decided never to let such a fate befall
                 her. Then she smiled at a mischievous thought, and took the moss she found out of her
                 pouch. Tossing it into the study, she laughed as the zombie rat pounced and gobbled it
                 up before it touched the floor. With a cold impish grin, she counted the seconds off
                 silently until the thing fell and began to convulse.
<BR><BR>
                 Envy stepped inside and peered around. The rat feebly attempted to snap at her foot.
                 Interest lost, she kicked it hard into the corner and headed for the desk. Laying open was
                 a big book of seemingly endless sketches, maps, and notes. The drawings were very
                 good, but that wasn't surprising for a mage. And Malgorm was especially devoted to his
                 craft. 
<BR><BR>
                 On the current page was a detailed picture of the half elf Joulian sitting in the plains,
                 holding Envy's battered body as Lord Faileas stood grimly nearby in black armor, gripping
                 his blood covered sword. Joulian was feeding her some sort of potion, and it seemed that
                 the dark elf's spirit hovered close. A big gray wolf was in the distance, and Malgorm had
                 scrawled 'Stormangell' next to it.
<BR><BR>
                 Envy gritted her teeth and looked at the date. A few days ago. She had hoped the wizard
                 hadn't caught word of her resent demise and resurrection, but apparently he had. 
<BR><BR>
                 What had happened was this: The vengeful Teir'Dal had vowed to kill Lord Faileas when he
                 hunted her down in the Karanas to bring her back to his service. She'd promised Malgorm
                 a corpse to prove she wasn't in love with Faileas. Envy had, as most expected, lost the
                 battle. But she wasn't blessed with death. Faileas was never that kind. As per her
                 agreement with Silverann, his uncle Joulian brought her back from death itself.
<BR><BR>
                 In frustration the shadow knight grabbed a handful of pages and turned them back roughly.
                 The picture shown here was of Sugan and Faileas, dated weeks ago. They sat fully
                 armoured on horses, side by side. That they were twins was obvious, as both displayed
                 the same dark expression and black armor. Sugan was drawing her sword as some man,
                 a Wind Rider whose name escaped Envy at the moment, cowered in prayer on the
                 ground. Faileas was laughing.
<BR><BR>
                 Looking at this, the dark elf couldn't help but get an eerie feeling. It was hard to get used
                 to your worst enemy suddenly fighting at your side. Sugan was a Shadow. Envy had to
                 admit though, that her Lord's sister had a dark side to match the best of them. Lately
                 though… the few times Sugan was seen she acted, well, not right. Malgorm was also
                 acting strangely. Envy frowned, thinking of the wizard talking to himself only minutes
                 before. She turned the page.
<BR><BR>
                 On this one, she nearly choked. There were no notes. There was however, the beautiful
                 face of a white haired half elf. Unlike the other pictures, this one was filled with light and
                 goodness and colour. So much emotion; the purple fires of the woman's eyes nearly
                 danced to life. Wind played through her short hair. The sun delicately brushed against her
                 pale skin. Envy felt truly disgusted.
<BR><BR>
                 Continuing through the book, she was even more shocked to see pages full of this
                 woman's picture. Every expression imaginable, but no where was a name written. It was
                 as if Malgorm knew he shouldn't be there, but stubbornly kept her name to himself like it
                 protected her. Pages and pages; Envy now knew why Faileas' expression was pained
                 when he looked at Sugan and Malgorm. They were losing themselves in madness. 
<BR><BR>
                 Deeply disturbed, Envy returned the book to its original state and stared at the vat of
                 green light thoughtfully. Sugan seemed to know her way instinctually around Legacy's
                 depths from the day one, as did Malgorm. Supposedly it was a part of the heritage of the
                 curse, but Envy was more inclined to believe that knowledge came from Faileas. She
                 knew the power of connection that existed between twins. Malgorm was created almost
                 as such himself. No, Envy didn't put much stock in this "all powerful" curse. Regardless of
                 how her Lord could argue, Bertoxxulous was nothing to Innoruuk.
<BR><BR>
                 Still, it was odd to wake up and see Sugan wandering the halls like a drifting ghost,
                 singing to herself. She must have known many passages that Envy did not, for her
                 appearance was rare- but she always ended up at the right places. Faileas though, was
                 never seen until he wished it. With the promise that yet more secret halls existed, the
                 dark elf left Malgorm's study and resumed her walk.
