                      The horrors of the estate of unrest were almost unbearable. Jamier soul cried
                      for the undead, the souless ones that were once mortal. It was all he could do
                      not to be ill at the scent of decay around him as he brought up his blade and
                      slew them one by one. 

                      <P>With but a moment to himself he sat and rested. His body and heart racked
                      with pain as he sensed something wrong; so very wrong. He looked deep
                      within his heart “what was calling him?”. With great urgency he picked up his
                      blade and made the journy to a high druid. “sir I need Transport”. The druid
                      looked upon the skin of the Dark Elf in descust; but finally agreed to transport
                      the knight for a price. Jamier looked sadly as he gave the druid the last of his
                      inherantance to the man.</P>

                      With a flash of light and a clap of thunder the young night found himself in the
                      West Commons, his heart raced with the sense of danger that awaited The
                      light of the sun was bright to his Dark Elven eyes. He pulled up his arm to
                      shadow the glare as he made tracks towards kithicor Woods. He didn’t know
                      what was propelling him other then gut instinct.

                      <P>The coldness of the january weather bit hardly at the Dark elf’s flesh, but for
                      all the discomfort nothing would stop him. He finally came to the piont of his
                      pulling. It was a gathering. A face off between the shadows and the wind. Envy
                      seemed to be the center of attention. Jamier growled under his breath, the
                      wenches endless taunting would have to come to a stop. His hatred for her
                      only fueled his strength. He stood by the side of the ranger ranewae as the
                      Enchanter Sorcere seemed to be mediating between the two enemies.</P>

                      His eye wandered slowly, as he caught the eyes of laele the she-demon, his
                      eyes softened for but a moment at the thought of her caresses. Shaking himself
                      back to reality he realized what a threat she was, her and malcron. He
                      brandished his holy blade and watched as she slinked further into the shadows.
                      Before he realized it he had already shot off 1 arrow from his bow. Just as a
                      simple warning.. Without warning he was awakened back to his senses as he
                      watched sorcere walk off with faileas. “I will keep my word..it is for the
                      child”….he turned back and said “wait here!”. Jamier could only look
                      confused. “envy’s child?” The Knight could only wonder.

                      <P>The hair on the back of Jamier’s neck stood up on end as he heard Envy’s
                      vioce..’how do you feel cattiebrie?” he knew there was something wrong, and
                      she had something seriously to do with the lady Cattiebrie’s condition. He just
                      stood there frozen, listening. Out of anger he threatened envy’s undead pet.
                      Whatever he said he couldn’t remember, but it had the striders surrounding
                      him. He sat in the face of danger. Envy wanting him ..daring him to fight her.
                      He could only refuse. No he knew Silverann loved her. Jamier thinks that and
                      her supposed pregnant condition were the only reasons he couldn’t kill her.</P>

                      He turned away only to see Sorcere walk up the hill with faileas. Jamiers eyes
                      Widened he knew it without words. The laughter that erupted from faileas’s
                      lips was a sound that will haunt his soul for eternity. “I must honor my promise”
                      sorcere sounded weak. Jamiers eyes glowed with the brazen beserker rage of
                      his god. Envy’s silvery ice giggle only feuled it “welcome to the shadows
                      sorcere”. He could hear no more as he reached quickly and pulled envy into
                      him. His blade at her throat. Sorcere screamed “NO!” but the vioce fell upon
                      deafened ears. “Jamier this isnt how a paladin would act!” another vioce
                      added. “I can have Sorcere kill him!” Faileas vioce echoed. “No if you do not
                      step back I will kill her”. Jamier was shocked to hear his own vioce threaten
                      anothers life. He grapped her arm and ran with her.

                      <P>Before he knew it he found himself deep within the caverns of ro with his
                      prisoner. He just sat staring into her eyes. “you were so brave” he looked
                      surprised at her response. He sat there but a few moments longer. Her death
                      would solve it all….he contemplated killing her there and now. Paladin they
                      call him. But that was not a word he used for himself. He raised his
                      sword..then stopped. He remembered Silverann’s words. “I Love her” he
                      always said in an emotionless tone. Sugan’s orders were to capture her and
                      save the child. Jamier paused. Jamiers hand reached forward and rested upon
                      her belly. She laughed. “there is no child!” For some strange reason he was
                      almost inclined to believe her.</P>
					  
                      Silverann met them in the caverns, Jamier knew he must make it right. He freed
                      envys hands and turned as Silverann consumated a marriage according to the
                      brutal teir’dal ways. He closed his eyes. He allowed it to happen. Jamier
                      turned and walked away. Blessing it in the name of Rallos Zek. 

                      <P>Suddenly he fell to his knees as he heard a distant scream.. “Ralnia” .. for the
                      first time in his life he sat there and cried … “ooh! GODS! Please no!” His fists
                      clenched as the tears streamed down his face. ‘RALLOS DAMN YOU!
                      WHY! WHY DO YOU MAKE ME FEEL THIS!” he screamed into the
                      Night. “Even the cries of war must have a paladin”…the soft vioce echoed into
                      his head. “I will bring her back! She cant go! She is the ony hope to sorcere’s
                      soul” Jamier staggered in the pain. He cannot resist his calling. He looked
                      down at the axe the gods have given him.. “is he a paladin or an executioner?”
                      for sugan for the four winds his destiny was to be both….. for he is the
                      obsidian Knight.</P>

                      “I hear your pain ralnia…I feel your tears Sugan, I bear your pain cattiebrie , I
                      share your hate envy!….I am coming…..”</DIV></TD>
