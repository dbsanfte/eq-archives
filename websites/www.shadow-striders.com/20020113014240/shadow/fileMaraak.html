								<B>History:</B> My name is Maraak.  I am 20 years old.  My story begins with my parents.  My father was a
								warrior.  I really don't know much about him, because he was only a father to me by blood.  My mother,
								Kileenia, was a barmaid.  She met my father in the tavern one evening.  He was in from a raid near Felwithe,
								celebrating the victory.  Later that evening when she was walking home, he approached her asking to
								accompany her home.  She refused, because she was a strong respectable woman.  He didn't take no for an
								answer.  Thus, in hatred I was concieved.<BR><BR>
								When I was growing up I remember being poor.  My mother saved every copper she could, so she could one
								day send me off to be trained as a necromancer.  I wanted only to be a warrior.  I dreamed of wielding
								the steel.  I remember having many arguments with mother over it.  I really regret that.<BR><BR>
								I remember like it was yesterday.  It was my 15th birthday.  I was just waking up, excited about the day.
								I heard shouting in the living room.  I got up to see what the problem was, only to be pushed back in my
								room by my mother.  She told me to stay put.  It seems my father had come back after all this time to
								claim me.  Mother would have none of that.  They screamed and yelled.  I could hear him beating her.<BR><BR>
								I reached under my matress for the rusty short sword I had bought a couple weeks earlier, it was still
								there.  I felt the adrenaline rushing through my veins.  I knew the only way I could beat him would be to
								suprise him.  I quietly opened the door. Poked my head out, I could see him.  His back was to me. I rushed
								out and swung blindly as hard as I could.  I felt that amazing feeling when the steel meets the flesh.
								The fury and hatred overcame me, and I blacked out.<BR><BR>
								When I woke up, my mother was dead.  I was covered in blood and there was a severed arm laying on the
								floor.  I vowed that day to find him again and claim that other arm.<BR><BR>
								So, with revenge and respect for mother's wishes, I took all our savings and sold the house to pay for my
								training as a Shadow Knight.  I trained under Master X'ner.  He showed me the ways to focus my hatred.
								He taught us respect and honor.  He was very hard on us, I suppose he had to be.  I still want to kill him
								though.<BR><BR>
								Upon completion of my training, I left the city to put my skills into use and improve them.  That is where
								I met Talisson Bonedancer.  At first I didn't trust him, being that he is a gnome.  But after training with
								him but a short time, I know now not ever to trust him, but to respect him.  He gave me armor and a weapon
								suitable for a knight.  Someday I will repay him for it.<BR><BR>
								He told me of your organization and your dark ways.  I was facinated.  I now only hope that you will take
								me in and allow us both to benefit.  I know that good allys and connections will make the finding of "The
								one armed elf" much easier for me.  I just hope I can bring as much to your guild as you have to offer me.
								<BR><BR>
								With true hatred,
								<BR>
								Maraak

								<B>Sugan's View:</B> <BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> It has resently been discovered that Maraak is Envy's half-brother. As much as it pleases me to have his talent with us, it disturbs me that he is so closely related to Envy.
