<BR><BR>
Much has been going on recently. We had a race against time and the forces of evil, when it was discovered 
that the first body of Malgorm Imshee'Cro, my ancestor, was entombed in Mistmoore. It was a race we won, 
and this flicker of hope could save both the Demon Malgorm and his daughter, Maluna.
<BR><BR>
Some of you may know about the events in Arena, and this report will clarify a few things. Syrene Celticmist 
discovered her Teir'Dal heritage, along with the disturbing revelation that she was born part vampire. This 
knowledge did change her in some ways, and she took up training with Nauria of Ancienne Noblesse to 
control her condition. For the time being, as she showed no signs of immediate danger to us, I allowed it. 
However, I did expect Syrene to research a cure, if such a thing was possible. To our surprise a cure was 
indeed found, and plans were made to lure Lord Saeyn of the Shadow Striders into a trap for it. This was in 
Arena, and it went as planned. Saeyn is once again a living mortal, although rather ungrateful for it. All those 
involved with his purging should watch their backs.
<BR><BR>
Syrene refused to be cured herself, however, and so could no longer hold her place in the Wind Riders. She 
left with Nauria that day, and Tdaael, who admitted that he was her father. I realize many of you still consider her a good friend, and I encourage that. But as the 
commander of an army, and one of light at that, I couldn't allow her to continue disobeying orders. As a friend, 
I was disappointed. Wind Riders, don't let Syrene sink further into corruption. Try and persuade her to 
reconsider, before we're forced to do anything against her will.
<BR><BR>
Yavie is now one of us, brought by the caring thoughts of Septus. It seems his faith in her paid off well, as she's 
been an asset to us. Help her to feel welcome. Sturmm Briteblade is still missing, since his confrontation with 
Talisson BoneDancer.
<BR><BR>
On Sunday, Lord Faileas Imshee'Cro was escorted to Freeport. Our Exodus Weaver, Thryn led the party 
until Faileas took advantage in West Karana and attacked him. He was injured in the battle, and a farmer who 
tried to help was killed. Aeluminadria took the lead, and Thryn supposedly went back to a Druid Ring for aid, 
alone. I'm looking for him, so if you see Thryn or hear of his whereabouts, please tell me immediately.
<BR><BR>
The Wind Rider party reported strange apparitions on the journey, which seemed to be speaking as Faileas. 
Little is known of this occurrence so far... but he's safe in his North Freeport cell now. Shannyn t'daisemi 
appeared to ensure Faileas' safety, and later turned herself in to the Wind Riders for her impending trial. The 
Shadow Striders, under Lord Saeyn and General Shizo, attacked us in North and West Freeport just as they 
arrived, and we had a couple skirmishes driving them off. Their current leader, Envy, wasn't a part of the 
battle. Aelumi reported that she seemed very ill, and likely poisoned. By whom, we do not know. Any 
information on this is appreciated.
<BR><BR>
I was in a meeting afterwards with Grymtooth near the Hall of Truth, when Arithorn approached us. I was 
unnerved at his mood swings... he's undoubtedly very dangerous in this state of mind. After nearly befriending 
him once more, Arithorn turned and attacked us. Aelumi was there to knock him unconscious though, good 
thing, because for some reason the knights nearby did nothing to intervene. Whether they were paid off, 
possessed, or something else, I don't know. Grymtooth was able to leave, thank his regeneration... Aelumi and 
I fled the place. We found Arithorn later though, near dead from the injury, and took him to the Marr Temple. 
Yavie helped care for him. I hesitate to say much more than this, but what's important is that we parted in 
"hopeful" terms. For now, he's still a Shadow Strider, and all should be wary of him.
<BR><BR>
Aeluminadria Thex, because you saved my life yesterday, and have given far more of yourself in our service 
than could be hoped for... I am offering you the position, Exodus Crusader of the Wind. I pray this honor is 
worthy of your acceptance.
<BR><BR>
Well, I have things to do and Trials to prepare for.. so if I think of other news, I'll let everyone know. Thank 
you all for your continued efforts in our crusade against darkness. May Karana's blessings follow you.
<BR><BR>
Sugan Imshee'Cro<BR>
Knight of Storms
