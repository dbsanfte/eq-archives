<P>Welcome Shades, to Fuath Dileab. Or in other words- Legacy of Hate. My lair.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadowed room is an octagon, with it's many walls roughly forming a circle. You do not recall how you got here, but you sense that this place is deep underground - perhaps miles.
The walls are made of small, fitted stones and meet the ceiling far above you. Each wall except the one before you has a door, inscribed with a single word you can almost read. Seven in all.
The place is clean despite it's apparent age; except for the bits of moss in the rocks, but even they seem strangely cultivated.
On the wall directly ahead is an enormous portrait of a beautiful elven child with dark blue skin and white hair, wearing a strange mixture of silk robes and metal armour.
Her skin is smooth as porcelain and her posture flawless, but something about her eyes is unsettling. They shine a cold turquoise from the darkness, of their own accord.
The girl's perfect violet lips are slightly mocking as she observes her room's intruder.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silvery female voice seeps from the room itself, interrupting your observations of the portrait. "My name is Envy. I am a Knight of Shadow, here to show Norrath exactly what our Lord Innoruuk means when he says, 'Hate them'..."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you draw closer to the doors, the strange word on each becomes legible, and the girl's voice dispassionately speaks of the room within.</P>
<DIV STYLE="line-height: 20 px">
<P>envy is of course, yours truly
<BR>pride is a collection of my arrogant philosophies
<BR>wrath is comprised of narcissistic stories
<BR>gluttony contains screenshots, all of me
<BR>lust contains self-centered artwork
<BR>greed ...what I take from my victims, naturally
<BR>sloth will name those responsible for this sanctuary</P></DIV>
