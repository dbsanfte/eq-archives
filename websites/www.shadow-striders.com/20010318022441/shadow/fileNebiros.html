								<B>History:</B> To My Esteemed Collegue, Neclo Rhelsar:
                          I am sending you another pupil, old friend. His name is Alstand Trask,
                          from a middling merchant house that only recently discovered his aptitude
                          for the Gift. He seems a bit rough around the edges, but which of us
                          were not?
                          Regards, Magus Galan
<BR><BR>
                          To my friend, Magus Galan:
                          Rough perhaps I was, but I do not remember being such an arrogant
                          snot before I had even mastered the must rudimentary of concepts. I will
                          grant you that he shows promise, but must you send me every young
                          apprentice who seems touched by the Warlord? I suppose I shall
                          endure.
                          Cheers, Neclo Rhelsar
<BR><BR>
                          To my friend, Magus Galan:
                          I thought I should give you a small notice of the progress of our newest
                          pupil, young Alstand. He has shown interest in some areas of magic that
                          we both consider highly unsavory. No, not necromancy - I would have
                          killed him myself if I detected that. Nothing we have banned, just
                          'questionable' areas. Namely, texts on the history of the Teir'Dal and their
                          religious practices. He explains it away blithely enough, but I am
                          watching very closely.
                          Your friend, Neclo Rhelsar
<BR><BR>
                          To my friend, Magus Galan:
                          My pupil has undergone a very strange transformation. Recently, his
                          unhealthy obsession with the ways of the Teir'dal had tapered off,
                          although I was frequently surprised by the depth of his knowledge on
                          rather obscure elements of their religious beliefs. Full of the vigor which I
                          have come to associate with a gifted student such as he, he announced
                          his attention to take a visit to the Karanas, to seek out and question the
                          Treants on some particular dogmatic snippet of Karana. After cautioning
                          him of the danger involved, I consented. Honestly, I suspected he was
                          running off to try some ritual that was beyond his ability - which of us
                          didn't do that, in our young days? I reasoned it would be healthy for the
                          cocky lad to discover his limitations. When he returned, however, he was
                          quite gaunt, and seemed very tired. Whatever he has done has exhausted
                          him, in body and spirit. He is currently resting, but if his condition
                          deterioates, I shall immediately send for you.
                          Your friend, Neclo Rhelsar
<BR><BR>
                          To my friend, Magus Galan:
                          He is gone. I take full responsibility for the unfortunate events that have
                          transpired in the few weeks since I last wrote. All seemed to be well; he
                          recovered within a few days... or, at least his body had healed. I feel
                          now that his mind must have shattered from what he attempted, for he
                          has gone utterly mad. I do not mean that he rambles as a lunatic; he has
                          become a madman with purpose, lucid in speech and thought, but utterly
                          delusional. He had come to believe that he was no longer human, and
                          insisted that I refer to him as Nebiros. I vaguely recognized the term from
                          Teir'Dal as the word for a liar, cheat, or deceiver. When I asked him
                          why he would take such a name, he grew angry, and ranted that his
                          'name' meant something entirely different in Elder Teir'Dal, and had been
                          bastardized to a derivative meaning. As I had mentioned - mad. I hoped
                          it would pass, so I asked who he was, what he had become. He
                          surprised me, then, by contradicting himself - he insisted he was fully
                          human, and seemed to be terribly saddened by this... almost terrified. He
                          spoke to me no more for several days, began drinking heavily, and
                          simply sulked. I found it rather childish myself, and hoped it would soon
                          end. It did. Rather abruptly, he told me that I knew nothing, was useless
                          to him, and he would seek out those who could help him 'chronicle deeds
                          of Hate and Plague', or some such nonsense. He mentioned the name
                          Lord Faileas, which sounded familiar to me - some miscreant that you
                          may know from Qeynos? A BloodSabre? A bandit? He then left, despite
                          my pleas for him to wait for a cleric who could help heal his mind. All in
                          all, strange, and very unfortunate. He was, despite his overweening
                          arrogance, a very promising enchanter.<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> Perhaps it's quiet insanity that drives him away for such long times. Perhaps not. I
								have heard no news of this enchanter for quite a while.<BR><BR>
								<B>Envy's View:</B> I do not know much of Nebiros. In fact, I thought him a Teir'Dal necromancer for the longest
								time. Odd..<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> Sorry, we haven't met.<BR><BR>
