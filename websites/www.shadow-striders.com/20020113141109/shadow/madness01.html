                 <I>This story takes place when Sugan was evil, right before she returned to the Wind Riders</I>
<BR><BR>
                 Her small, dark figure crept through the dim arched corridor without a noise, flitting from
                 shadow to shadow instinctively. The banded darkmetal armor in which she was encased
                 fit her well, and didn't hinder her at all; but special consideration was taken for the sleek
                 two handed sword strapped to the girl's back. The sheath was black, fringed by her
                 house's crests. A beautiful reddish jewel shown from the sword's pommel, glowing with
                 untapped power. The woman didn't wear a helmet of any sort, preferring her white hair
                 unbound, and victims to see the mocking in her bluegreen eyes. With distraction as she
                 moved, the Teir'Dal named Envy studied the moss growing from between the stones
                 comprising her Lord's underground fortress. She was merely looking for some small
                 amusement this evening, and hoped that perhaps by luck she would find yet another
                 secret in this labyrinth Faileas called home.
<BR><BR>
                 Below the city of Qeynos; below the sewers; below even the huge cavernous temple of the
                 Bloodsabers, was the Realm of Lord Faileas himself. Here he possessed what roughly
                 could be labeled a castle, although no gentleman in his right mind would be caught alive in
                 such a place. And so none were; not for very long anyway. Its name, Asslaynt Dìleab,
                 was from the old tongue like Faileas and Sugan's names, and meant 'Legacy of Disease'.
                 Most people who knew it existed simply called it 'Legacy'. This place was a part of
                 Faileas' birthright, passed down from his father when the necromancer grew mad with
                 power and disappeared to the plane of Bertoxxulous. It had countless chambers,
                 passages, and something this Teir'Dal relished discovering, secrets.
<BR><BR>
                 Since her arrival the night after the Duel that began her servitude to Lord Faileas, Envy
                 tested her intelligence on Legacy whenever she could. It was a game; albeit a deadly one.
                 There were many things she uncovered too, secret passages and hidden rooms used to
                 spy on who or whatever resided there. And traps. But the night she found a small,
                 ingeniously placed chamber used for observing one of the secret passages, her respect
                 for the fortress grew immensely.
<BR><BR>
                 Envy stopped briefly to pluck one of the mosses from it's spot. It was well known that she
                 dabbled in poisons and other arts of death. She thought of the fun it would be
                 experimenting with new ways to maim as she tucked the plant into a pouch. Continuing
                 her leisurely walk past mostly closed doors, she spotted one open room with strange
                 mutterings and an eerie green light escaping from it. Curiosity aroused, the shadow knight
                 quickly plastered herself next to the door frame and peeked in.
<BR><BR>
                 What the dark elf saw made her both smile slightly, and cringe. Malgorm the wizard was
                 restlessly bustling around his unusually disorganized study, doing ten things at once.
                 Dressed as always in his black robes embroidered with red symbols of power, the human
                 wizard's long dark red hair and green eyes were a feverish mirror of her Lord Faileas'. He
                 stopped at a large tome on the desk for a moment to recite some words, then noisily
                 gathered bottles from a shelf and tossed them into a bag. Malgorm repeated the words to
                 himself a few times, then checked the tome again.
<BR><BR>
                 'He's memorizing spells,' Envy thought, quietly snickering. 'Mal is going out tonight…'
<BR><BR>
                 The wizard turned in the direction of the door as if he'd heard her. Envy caught her breath.
                 Malgorm silently crept to the door and stopped. Then with serpentine quickness any
                 warrior would be proud of, he snatched something from the floor close to Envy's feet. The
                 thing squeaked in shock and fear as Malgorm held it up by it's tail and laughed. He tossed
                 the mouse into a large vat of luminous green liquid that served as the room's only light. It
                 flashed once brightly, and seemed to suck the animal to the bottom and hold it there as it
                 struggled.
<BR><BR>
                 Both Envy and Malgorm watched with interest as the mouse began to change. It grew to
                 six times it's normal size, teeth elongating, eyes covered with a dull milky whiteness, fur
                 and most flesh falling off in chunks and melting away… when it decided it was done, the
                 undead thing crawled out of the vat and off the table, leaving a glowing wet trail of green. It
                 sat in front of the wizard expectantly. Malgorm closed his tome, picked up both the book
                 and the backpack, and walked out.
<BR><BR>
                 He stopped once outside the door, and Envy once again thought she had been
                 discovered. Malgorm turned and spoke to the creature. "Guard Here" he commanded, and
                 walked off cackling.
