								<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top" WIDTH="510"><DIV CLASS="main">The Wind Riders and Shadow Striders take steps to ensure that
								the Roleplayers involved in our guilds are dedicated to a fun environment, OOC. We also maintain a PG-13 rating,
								but feel that more mature adult roleplay is fine if kept private and consentual. If any of these rules are broken, strict action is
								taken to correct the problem. We don't condone Harassment by anyone, in or out of the guilds. What is Harassment? 
								Webster defines it as 1. to be disturbed repeatedly, or 2. to be troubled by repeated attacks. That's pretty general, so be careful.<BR><BR>
								If you become involved in a storyline of roleplay in which you feel uncomfortable, make sure the 
								other person involved knows, in no uncertain OOC terms, that you wish to stop. Ignoring a request like that is considered Harassment.
								EverQuest has several ways to fight this, and a couple people have stepped forward with good advice on what to do if this happens to you.
								<BR><BR><B><A HREF="MAILTO: kith@unseelie.com">- Sugan Imshee'Cro</A></B><BR><BR>
								<B>Annabella of the Wind Riders:</B> The fact is, if you are being harassed in this game beyond a total of 5 minutes duration YOU ARE NOT
                               DOING ENOUGH TO BLOCK IT OUT. Why? Perhaps because you don't know what options you have available?
                               I'll give a stab then at coming up with my 5 step harassment dealer.<BR><B>Steps:</B>
								<OL><LI>If you think the person who has just said/done something inappropriate might be doing it in the name of
                               roleplay, send them an ooc tell to tell them to stop and that you're not comfortable or willing to be played
                               that way.
							   <LI>If it proceeds and you are ignored, inform a guild officer immediately. Don't worry about whether
                               someone will get in trouble, it's not about involving the "guild police" or anything, it's mostly about getting
                               a second opinion and from someone who could and would get involved to ensure that both people reach an
                               agreement about what they think is ok -- and if no agreement can be reached, then that's where the
                               story ends.
							   <LI>If it proceeds beyond that and the officer is ignored also and this member is either WR/SS, they should
                               expect to be disbanded immediately. I would also advise that the person be put on /ignore by the person
                               that is (at this point, definitely) being harassed.
							   <LI>Should an individual skirt by the /ignore filter by using an alt, locate the text in your chat scroll that
                               offends/harrasses you, /report it, and then "/petition I feel Soandso has been harassing me, I have
                               reported the appropriate information, and think the person is using this char [insert name] as an alt to
                               continue harassing me beyond the /ignore filter" (maybe that won't all fit in the /petition command, but no
                               matter, you can explain it when a guide contacts you).
							   <LI>Stick any suspected alts that give you cranky tells immediately onto /ignore.</OL>
							   <B>Notes worth mentioning:</B>
                               /ignore is your friend. You are also in control with how long people remain on it. Whilst I don't suggest
                               sticking everyone you have a tiny gripe with on /ignore, if you are being "harassed" after telling them to
                               stop, what are you waiting for?<BR><BR>
                               People remain on /ignore until you take them off again. I /ignore some people, gladly I've never had to do it
                               with anyone in the guilds or RP'd with. In any case, at the end of each week, I empty my /ignore list
                               again. End result: I have an empty /ignore list and nobody that was previously on it gives me any hassle.<BR><BR>
                               If this can't be resolved quickly as an RP misunderstanding, then it falls outside of the jurisdiction of our
                               guilds and guild leaders and you NEED TO INVOLVE A GUIDE.<BR><BR>
                               The main reasons for this, is that information you /report is FACT, nobody can worm their way out of it by
                               denying what was or wasn't said. Secondly, Verant CS people are not limited to only dealing with people
                               via their character name. They know the station ID (ie: account) used, and even the wimpiest of Guides
                               can locate any characters currently on the server using that account, even if it's a new alt nobody has
                               heard of.<BR><BR>
							   <B>Nauria of Ancienne Noblesse:</B>
								<UL><LI>/log is your friend. Multiple logs by multiple people will get the attention of the server GM.
                               <LI>eqclient.ini is your friend. Use it to set logging to automatic.

                               <LI>Harassment in EQ is a serious issue. If you tell someone to stop an offensive line of RP, and you tell them
                               OOC, and they do not, that's a bannable offense. If you tell someone to leave you alone, and they don't,
                               that's a bannable offense.

                               <LI>Someone switching alts to get past your /ignore is harassment. All characters are linked together in an EQ
                               account by a single ID. If someone is making new characters constantly to bug you, report it. The GMs
                               can and will track this down if it is serious enough.

                               <LI>Be more leery what personal information you give out.

                               <LI>Never think that you -have- to follow any line of RP. Never feel obligated to respond IC to something that
                               offends you.

                               <LI>If someone becomes so icky OOC that you despise that person, stop RPing with them, even as an enemy.
                               Enemies are something you have IC, everyone you play with is supposed to be your friend OOC. Trying to
                               avenge yourself on someone IC for the OOC actions is never going to work, and it's going to bring sickness into your life, and the lives
                               of your friends.</UL>
