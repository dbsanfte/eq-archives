                      My story begins on the streets and in the sewers of Queynos. It is not a happy
                      tale, but I wish for no pity from anyone. I was raised by my mother, but never
                      knew my father. She made ends meet anyway she could. Between scrubbing
                      floors at Crow's Tavern and comforting the lonely soldiers in her own special
                      way, there was little time for her to be a true mother to me. So, at the ripe old
                      age of eight, I was taught to beg in front of the local Inns, to help seperate the
                      rich travelers from their riches. At a silver or two every day, I felt like I was
                      making wonderful money, that is until another begger taught me the secret
                      ways into the Inn itself. Now I could sneak in and take what I wanted from the
                      sleeping customers. This skill worked great for some time, until I got cocky.
                      One night, while I was on my usual rounds, I came upon an old man who
                      appeared to be sleeping. Not only was he not sleeping, but was Meditating.
                      The moment I reached for his valuables my feet pinned to the floor and the
                      world instantly went black. I awoke in the secret jail under the city gates, and
                      there I sat for more than a week. The fear was terrible, as the darkness
                      surrounded me and the rats continually plagued me, asleep or awake. I was on
                      the verge of lunacy when HE came. As the door was picked and opened, I
                      knew my calling at once. He told me he had overheard the guards say that I
                      had been lured into a trap and that I had been wanted for a long time. Then he
                      reveiled to me who he was. "The Circle of the Unseen Hand has use for you
                      my child. Had I known you would be such a fast learner, I would have came
                      back for you earlier." Then he held my chin and looked into my eyes for a
                      moment and said, "You have your Mother's face...", with a glint in his eyes he
                      continued, " ... but you have my eyes! Come, be my eyes in my guild young
                      one."
<BR><BR>
                      Day one of my rouge training opened with me running errands and picking up
                      smuggled goods at the docks. I quickly made a great deal of contacts which in
                      turn led to me entering in other smuggling rings. Before long I had the city
                      rigged and continually making profits to the guild and my new family. As time
                      wore by I grew strong and quick. No longer were the rats and spiders of the
                      sewers any challegeto me. I began hunting the bears and wolves of the hills for
                      their wonderful pelts, which I in turn sold for a nice profit to a smuggler who
                      sold them in other cities. Thats when my life changed again. 
                      One day while roaming the plains of Karanas, I came accross a Caster of
                      great power. I watched in glee as he delt with attackers with one blow. My
                      understanding of the world chaged that instant. He spied me watching him and
                      chuckled slightly. "That was just a mere hint of the power I serve." he
                      admitted. Then he told me of a great struggle taking place between light and
                      darkness that was to change the very face of Norrath. I listened with interest
                      as he related the goals of his family of friends. It made perfect sense to me. I
                      had spent my entire life hiding in the shadows, trying to reach the hidden, but it
                      was all in vane. I now knew my goals as bright as the light I wished to
                      extinguish. I wished to be a Shadow myself. Eagerly I begged him to let me
                      join him in his quest, to let me serve the same goal he did. At this he stoped,
                      Looked deeply into my eyes, and held me with his will. Nothing I had was
                      hidden to him. Nothing I thought was not privy to his will. Then as quickly as it
                      started, he broke contact. Smiling wickedly he offered me a place within his
                      family, a place... as a Shadow!!!
