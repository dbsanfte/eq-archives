                      <B>The Dark Rose</B>
<BR><BR>
                      Many dark moons passed with Envy at Malgorm's side. He had grown to
                      considerable power and they together made a great killing machine. They
                      killed anyone and everyone in the sewers. It was their kingdom. Her dark
                      leather and dark blade and beauty was a great weapon that Malgorm
                      respected. Envy amused him with tales of her evil, and told him of a man
                      named Joulian that she toyed with and used.
<BR><BR>
                      A dark rose. She was a sweet flower that lured many, and Malgorm watched
                      as her victims' feelings and lust for her would pierce their souls deeper than
                      any blade. Malgorm's thoughts had become more complex with his power
                      and continuous torment of Sugan. He watched himself from that day so that
                      he never smelled that flower. He already thought of Envy as his mother in a
                      strange way and then like a reptile he forgot that feeling. She had shown
                      him much of the land, and finally took him to a most wonderful place filled
                      with death and fear.
<BR><BR>
                      Malgorm entered the dark lair of Black Burrow. There he heard the screams
                      of many; the cries for help. Blood was everywhere. Hundreds of creatures
                      Envy called 'gnolls' were killing everything in site. Malgorm smiled. This was
                      a place like his inner self and he stood amazed, taking it in.
<BR><BR>
                      Suddenly he felt pain and all went black. He awoke upon a ledge rock with
                      the dark elf nursing him, the corpse of his attacker nearby. She smiled in
                      disgust at Malgorm's foolishness, but what she did not know was that
                      Malgorm was growing fond of the pain. She pulled him up and Malgorm
                      entered his dark mediations. Once again he heard the will of the hunger and
                      the voices pull his spirit in rage and despair. They would kill many of those
                      creatures called gnolls before daybreak.
<BR><BR>
                      <B>The Gardener</B>
<BR><BR>
                      Malgorm stood in the secret entrance to the sewers patiently waiting for the
                      arrival of Joulian, the man he had called. Joulian stepped in from the night, a
                      half elf sickened from the need for love.
<BR><BR>
                      "I can give you what you seek; the lovely Envy. But for a price." Malgorm
                      said bluntly.
<BR><BR>
                      Joulian looked shocked, but the wizard sensed desperation. "How can you
                      do this?" Joulian asked. Malgorm smiled evilly, "I know how you can win her
                      but I do have price for this knowledge." Joulian struggled with conflict. His
                      soul lingered between the light and darkness, but by the end of that night he
                      had given him self to the darkness. Joulian told Malgorm of his sister
                      Silveril's coming marriage to Stormangel. Malgorm heard the hunger once
                      again; fate had placed another piece of the puzzle. Joulian would gather
                      members and spies for him, for the love of a dark elf.
<BR><BR>
                      Had Joulian only known that he could never have Envy. That the evil of
                      Malgorm had only lead to his spiral into the shadows where in the end he
                      would come out with nothing. Malgorm would come to corrupt many as
                      spies and lead many into the darkness; willing or unwilling. Everyone that he
                      met inevitably fell to his evil and the lessons Envy had taught him.
<BR><BR>
                      <B>The Shadows Grow</B>
<BR><BR>
                      In a short while Malgorm had grown far surpassed the powers of Envy. She
                      had been shocked to see him consume their enemies in single blasts. They
                      had come to debate often over the notions of honor and power. Malgorm saw
                      her flaw, and while he would always respect her he could never stand at her
                      side in equal battle. In just a year he had grown far past the power of the
                      common man and beyond the skill of his Dark Rose. Before he left,
                      Malgorm gave Envy a present; a fine blade to represent his respect for her,
                      just like she had given him his first weapon long ago. He began to stand at
                      the side of Lord Faileas. They trained at the small of isle of Erud's Crossing
                      where a ship of long ago had sunk. There were pitiful slaves of Bertoxxulous
                      trapped beneath the waves. Lord Faileas and Malgorm killed day after day,
                      punishing them. And every day they would return to be punished again.
                      During this time Lord Faileas grew worried, and Malgorm began to feel that
                      he did not want his sister dead. For the first time perhaps Lord Faileas knew
                      that Sugan was in great danger of the monster he had created. During this
                      time both Malgorm and Faileas grew in power. The Shadow Striders were
                      gaining respect among others. Malgorm had already drawn much of that
                      divine storm in Sugan out. She was being slowly drained of her will and he
                      knew it. She was grabbing at anything to save herself- Malgorm tormented
                      her on a daily bases and enjoyed her pain. One day the wizard sensed
                      something that Sugan had been trying to hide. She was planning to marry
                      the great paladin, Canelon. Malgorm knew he had her then, she was
                      reaching for outside sources to give her strength. He and Faileas made
                      plans to stop their marriage and have her join her brother in the shadows.
                      Malgorm still wished her death, but he knew he would love seeing her pain.
                      To see a defeated Sugan, to put out her light. Had he known then…
