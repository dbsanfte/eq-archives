&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Shadows of Luclin Spoiler<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Hail All,<br>
<br>
Got this info. from various sites, thanks to all those that let me Cut and Paste it  <br>
<br>
<br>
Spoiler Alert! <br>
<br>
In no particular order.... <br>
<br>
Wizard Familiars: <br>
<br>
They're going to be pets with no commands, that are set to follow their master. They do not generate agro. They can be hit by AEs however, and can also be made immune (or perhaps just very strong) vs it. Each one gives bonuses to all your resists (about 5 on the first one, increasing with each). The second one has and gives you see invis, and as a result, won't die if the controlling wizard goes invis. Familiars will also reduce their wizard's fizzle rate. The 49th level familiar gives some mana regen. The first two use the imp model, the next two use the drake model. They also give extra mana, with the top one giving something like 200-300 mana. They will zone with their controller, and will also logout (and log back in) with their player. <br>
<br>
Alternate Exp: <br>
<br>
Very little was said about it. It's &quot;like&quot; Diablo skill trees. Permanent stat and resists improvements will be possible. 1 point will be like the equivalent of gaining enough exp to go from 51 to 52. <br>
<br>
Vah Shir info: <br>
<br>
Starting stats for a Beastlord: <br>
STR 90 <br>
STA 85 <br>
AGI 95 <br>
DEX 70 <br>
WIS 80 <br>
INT 65 <br>
CHA 70 <br>
with 30 points to spend. <br>
<br>
Starting str on a VAH Warrior is 95 (with 30 points to spend). <br>
<br>
Currently, the Vah Shir are all Agnostic (though this may change). Their starting zone is Shadeweaver's Thicket, on the dark side of the moon. They're a large race, however, the decision on whether or not to give them Slam has not yet been made. <br>
<br>
Metal Info: <br>
<br>
There's a new metal in Luclin called Acrylia. It comes from giant mushrooms. There's a zone called the Acrylia Mines off of the Grimling Forest (which has some of these mushrooms). Expect it to be enchantable. <br>
<br>
Reaching Luclin: <br>
<br>
Wizards and Druids will NOT be able to port between the current world and Luclin. Every 45 minutes, at the large (like Greater Faydark) wizard spires, a scripted event will take place, giving people the opportunity to go to The Nexus, the entry zone. There's no delay to zone back to the various spires from The Nexus. There will be druid and wizard ports within Luclin. Death MAY send you back to the nexus if you die in Luclin and are bound in the current world, instead of to your bind point. Cleric Rezes will bring people to their corpse, regardless of location. (People leaving corpses to quickly move between planets is a concern though.) <br>
<br>
Bazaar Zone: <br>
<br>
There's a zone setup just to be a bazaar. The big new feature here is this: You'll be able to specify items you want to sell to other players, and set your character up to act like a NPC merchant selling those items. This feature will only be available within this zone. Yes, leaving your character online, overnight in this zone while you're afk is expected. (BTW, The Bazaar does have a horse stable for you to buy your horses from.) <br>
<br>
Zone Overview: <br>
<br>
Here's some details about a few zones (roughly half of them were shown during the demo). Some have more than others... <br>
<br>
Vex Thal - Uber Raid Zone (not shown) <br>
<br>
Ssraeshza Temple - The Home of the Shissar. 5 levels, meant for characters level 53 to 60. First levels has their Iksar slaves and a mine. There may be quests here for Iksar. The top floor has the Emperor of the Shissar, and he's meant to be an AoW level encounter. (2k melee hits). The fifth floor is a prep room, a really nice looking room with him and his throne, and 4 force field guarded side rooms (can't be deactivated) which will likely contain adds to make this fight more interesting. The throne room is very impressive, with great lighting effects (light streaming down from the roof). This zone also has very detailed textures, including worn down heiroglyphics, (that look somewhat egyptian), but are actually a Shissar language that you'll be able to read. Also, movement between levels is not a simple teleport, but is instead a huge complex rotating ring structure that moves you down (and up, I'd assume), that you need to figure out how to use. The Shissar got in trouble (the greenmist) by not worshiping gods. They do have clerics now, which get their power from (but may not worship) Zebuxoruk. Awesome looking zone. <br>
<br>
Paludal Caverns - Low level dungeon (5 to 20?) mainly for newbie vah shir. Lots of insects, some fish, and some (2?) bandit camps. <br>
<br>
Shadow Haven - The main trade zone that both light and dark side aligned characters can access. Includes a significant short (or shrunk) character only area. <br>
<br>
The Nexus - Main entrance to Luclin, with ports to a bunch of old world locations, and (obviously) some exit(s?) to new Luclin zones. <br>
<br>
Acrylia Caverns - (not shown) Mines for the new metal, off of Grimling Forest. <br>
<br>
Vah Shir City - May be named Sharvahl? Connects to Shadeweaver's Thicket <br>
<br>
Katta Castellum - The dark side combine city, there's a garden with each of the plants from the dark side, and a huge cathedral with stained glass windows, and giant candelabras. Connections to Grimling Forest and Twilight Sea. <br>
<br>
Sanctus Seru - The light side combine city, 3 zones in size, this also has the huge colleseum we've seen pictures of. Very nice looking city. Connects to Marus Seru <br>
<br>
Marus Seru - An outside zone that connects to both Sanctus Seru and the Twilight Sea. <br>
<br>
The Twilight Sea - One connection between the light and dark sides of Luclin, with (ug) a boat you can (but don't have to (like Lake Rathe?)) ride. Connects Marus Seru and Katta Castellum. <br>
<br>
Dawnshroud Peaks - Light side outdoor zone. <br>
<br>
The scarlet Desert - Very detailed sand texture. <br>
<br>
Quick Zone Connection Summary: <br>
The Nexus &lt;-&gt; Old World <br>
<br>
Acrylia Mines &lt;-&gt; Grimling Forest &lt;-&gt; Katta Sanctum &lt;-&gt; Twilight Sea &lt;-&gt; Marus Seru &lt;-&gt; Sanctus Seru (3 zones) <br>
<br>
Shadeweaver's Thicket &lt;-&gt; Vah shir city (Sharvahl?) <br>
<br>
Other zone names: <br>
<br>
The Umbral Plains <br>
The Maiden's Eye <br>
The Tenebrous Mountains <br>
The Grey <br>
Hollowshade Moor <br>
Mons Letalis <br>
The Deep <br>
Grieg's End <br>
Netherbian Lair <br>
Fungus Grove <br>
Echo Caverns <br>
Akheva Ruins <br>
<br>
There's a new graphical patcher which looks very nice, and handles all the patching at once, along with an autoplay option, to get you into the game faster. <br>
<br>
Other items which I heard about in passing: <br>
<br>
Items which will adjust your faction (good and bad) when you hold them. <br>
Weapons that do extra / alternate damage types. Cleric summoned hammers already have Bane DMG vs undead. Extra DMG for Magic, Fire, Cold, Poison and Disease are expected as well (perhaps) bane dmg for other creature types. <br>
<br>
There's a new user interface coming which you'll be able to heavily customize (including setting a custom bitmap as a background for a window, if you choose), which wasn't ready yet. Also, the only new player character model in the game was the vah shir model, the rest were old ones. NPCs wearing hats were much more common. One human guard in plate in Katta Castellum had a really nice big curved axe. <br>
<br>
And one old world thing: There's no port near Qeynos because there was going to be one in the Unkempt Wood, off of Surefall Glade. This zone hasn't been created yet, however, but if (IF) it is, expect a druid ring there. <br>
