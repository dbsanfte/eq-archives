They even had a regular scorne banshee drop the eye of inny. Most of these nameds are 56+, flurry and hit somewhat hard (200s if I remember correctly). A lot of the mobs also HT for quite an amount (downed a chanter in one blast heh).<br>
<br>
In fear the only changes noticed were to draco/cazic and the golems. They (the golems) hit for ~500, DT and drop random cazic stuff. Draco was downed on another server and supposedly dropped a CRoA and some new robe with +35 to all resists and 10ac. <p><BR>-Akahdrin Fatebringer, 58 Necroclerichantomancer

<br>
Grandmaster G'something was the first named we pulled. A named Mummy. Dropped two pieces of indo(legs and helm) and an Iksar Warrior bracer.<br>
<br>
Later we pulled an Evangelist of Hate, who dropped the supremely phat lewt of a.. shadowed book.(That's right. The same no rent one you get off Shadowed Men. Wtf?)<br>
<br>
Right after that we pulled High Priest M'krai(I believe that's how it was spelled, I'm tired ;P) who dropped two pieces of EM(gloves and bracer?) and Truesight.(Woot. Inny loot. Too bad it sux0rz.)<br>
<br>
After a few more pulls we got.. the Rogue boss(the name escapes me now too ;P) who dropped two WS lewtz, forget which ones.<br>
<br>
Then we pulled Maestro who seemed to be almost the exact same difficulty as before, only he rampages now. Dropped two lutes and when he died a green to 54(didn't ask anyone else, heh) 'Hand of the Maestro' spawned on his corpse. After about ten minutes of hailing and saying phrases trying to get it to talk we just BARSHED it and it dropped Maestro's hand.<br>
<br>
Then we moved on to the Enchanter boss(ugh.. I forget it's name. Coercer Something) who dropped pants, gloves, and the Inny clarity wand.<br>
<br>
Almost right after we pulled Mistress of Scorn who dropped two Bard loots and.. Staff of Elemental Mastery: FIRE.<br>
<br>
A few pulls later the Ashenbone Broodmaster was pulled into camp and we barshed it good for a Necro Focus.(you think I'm even going to -attempt- to spell that thing at 2 AM?)<br>
<br>
We didn't get to the Shaman boss, as we spent a good deal of time trying to pull these things out of a room, and they wouldn't budge and eventually called it a night.<br>
<br>
There is a DN swarm like floor trap in the SW corner now. You get the message 'tiny eggs of evil hatch in your brain' and four brownie sized imps named 'an evil little imp' spawn.<br>
<br>
Also to note: There are things in there with evil faction. Not everything, and nothing on the first floor and none of the bosses, but on the second floor there are things like 'A Greenblood Emissary' and such that have Ogre/Troll/Dark Elf/Iksar(depending on which it was, heh) factions. There's a room with a group of these, one of each evil race plus a Gnome, Human, and Erudite, surrounding a table that we couldn't get to path out of the room so we had to fight in there and ended up getting owned when we couldn't mezz some of them. I would assume they were quest givers, as they're on home city faction and with them all being stuff in one room, but we sent in an Enchanter with good faction and couldn't get any of them to speak. <br>
<br>
The only other really out of the ordinary thing(besides the new mobs on the second floor ;P) was a trap up on the second floor at the Druid ring. One of those Neriak symbols floating around it, when you click on it, sends you to the zone in.<br>
<br>
So there is a new 'boss' mob for every class that has Hate armor and those bosses drop two pieces of armor for that class and have a chance of dropping Innoruuk loots.<br>
<br>
There is a little new loot, too. We also picked up a new Rogue cloak(12 AC, 15 agility, 5 save vs everything), Ranger weapon(12/23 eight strength and wisdom), and a new caster robe(22 AC, 16 intelligence, and 10 save vs poison and disease).<br>
<br>
We also picked up an Eye of Innoruuk off a regular old scorn banshee on the first floor that we pulled close to the start of the raid.<br>
<br>
And after reading around on other boards it appears we were unlucky when it came to loot.   People were picking up Thurg-like(I believe it's the same stats, but I'm too lazy to go check ;P) armor for Paladins, Rangers, and Druids on the second floor.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  And while I myself wasn't in Fear, everything I've seen indicates that the Wraith of the Shissar has been moved off Cazic's spawn trigger.    He hasn't spawned on any server upon Cazic's death. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/usnootay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snootay</A> at: 3/15/01 5:33:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/ucamoman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Camoman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/15/01 10:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fecirathesplitfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fear / Hate Changes</span><hr size=1> The Biggest thing with Hate is that there are ALOT more mobs.  I don't foresee anyone clearing the zone in 3 hours, however the bigger guilds will still have little problems.  The smaller guilds, however, seem to have bent over verrants knee.  <br>
<br>
It's nice that they said the old stuff would be left alone minus like inny and maestro, however there's no way to get around some of the new stuff.  A posotive change, though, is that loot actually seems to be dropping in hate again rather then the usual 15 or 20 cleric drops and every other class gets the shaft.<br>
<br>
As for the new part of hate, well.....the mobs like to spam alot, it sucks.  Maybe causing hate to have what seemed like alot more LDs I dunno.  The mobs are pretty much like your normal icewell encounter I guess, they don't like to be pulled you pretty much go to them. <br>
<br>
Horror stories....well, finding a place to get started in hate was annoying.  Overall though I think it was the first time I never died in hate (though I did have to burn a disc to save my behind once). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub55.ezboard.com/fecirathesplitfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=123.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub55.ezboard.com/fecirathesplitfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=123.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fecirathesplitfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fecirathesplitfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=123.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fecirathesplitfrm1.threadControl?topicID=123.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fecirathesplitfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=123.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fecirathesplitfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=123.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub55.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ecirathesplitfrm1">General Discussion<option value="ecirathesplitfrm2">Guilds<option value="ecirathesplitfrm3">Raid Policy</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/becirathesplit>E'ci - Rathe Split</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fecirathesplitfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
