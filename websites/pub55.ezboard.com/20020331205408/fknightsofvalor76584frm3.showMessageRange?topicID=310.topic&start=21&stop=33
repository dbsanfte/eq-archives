<br>
It's about time I chimed in on this.<br>
<br>
I tend to agree with everyone.<br>
As I read it sounds like we are all moving in the same direction.<br>
<br>
/bravo to Myst for leading us in the past.<br>
/bravo to Tamzach for leading us currently<br>
/bravo to Xaerec for leading us (future)<br>
<br>
(the future/past/present could apply to all of them, I don't want to discourage Tam from future leading  : )<br>
<br>
Harsh rules might be what It takes to get it done.<br>
I'll follow Tam into battle again.<br>
I'll follow X<br>
I'll follow anyone else with the balls to lead a raid.<br>
<br>
We need to do some raids for loot, epics, etc.<br>
(and fun)<br>
<br>
I am at the point were most of my gear upgrades will come from raids.  (kael, planes, etc.)<br>
<br>
I for one have given up on my epic.<br>
my 10/18 & 12/22 weapons are just about as good.<br>
if not better.  some argument exists there.<br>
<br>
But we NEED to raid, or we will die as a guild.<br>
Holy Redemption failed as a guild because we didnt have anyone to lead raids, not enough showed up on time, etc.<br>
<br>
Most people get to a point where they are 50+  or 54+,<br>
and NEED to do things appropriate for their level.<br>
<br>
Yes my other post was a joke about me leaving.<br>
BUT  (this is not a threat) if we are not successful with raiding,  At some point I will leave KoV for a guild that is.<br>
Friends in Omani and HoN have been after me for a while to join them.   <br>
But no, I am not leaving anytime soon,  and in at least<br>
ONE scenario, I can see KoV being as successful, As I would need a guild to be.   This MAY be my final EQ Home.<br>
<br>
BUT  raiding is a skill,<br>
It requires<br>
Punctuality,<br>
Ablity to LISTEN,<br>
Ablity to FOLLOW Orders,<br>
A strong leader,<br>
dedication,<br>
and Teamwork.<br>
(probably a few other things as well.)<br>
<br>
IF KoV is to thrive as a guild  (family guild or otherwise)<br>
We will have to be successful at Raiding.<br>
We will have to go some of the tougher places.<br>
WE are almost all 50+ now and we need to act like it.<br>
I know I haven't, but hopefully now we can ALL take that step together.<br>

<br>
Sorry but I thought the majority of the feeling was that raids were going well. Because we didn't do the castle in Chardok should not even be a factor. We went there to learn the zone &amp; have fun.<br>
<br>
I would also like to point out, that KOV was never intended to be a &quot;raiding guild&quot;.  Yes we would like to do higher zones &amp; acquire items, but if constant raiding is what you are after, this is not the place.<br>
<br>
I will host Tuesday night epic raids. It was an idea that has been thrown around the guild &amp; I finally implemented it.  As far as any other raids, All of you that think you can do better, be my guest. But I won't be hosting any more raids.  It's alot of aggravation &amp; planning my RL around them for people to jump out of the woodwork to criticize. But I would like to comment, that being a bitch/bastard doesnt always work.  Contrary to what some think, I do get my point across without having to publicly humiliate anyone or Yell &amp; scream incessently.  This is a guild of loving caring people for the most part &amp; personally i think the scream/humiliate/Bitch approach is not a good way to go about it.  Oh believe me, I can be that way but It causes hard feelings &amp; resentment amoung your fellow knights.  Yes, I do think there is a happy medium. Hope that can be obtained. <p></br>

For me I always go in to the raid knowing that the group I am in will most likely not get exp.  Exp on a raid is a rare thing.  Loot will be highly competitive.  Know that you have a chance of going on a raid and not getting a single thing.  I went on 4 fear raids before I got lucky enough to win a single planar item.  What counts is that you made the effort of attending. You continue making the effort to attend.  Remember that this guild is comprised of your friends and "family".  We have all helped each other in non-raid situations. And this same togetherness can be used for greatness in raid situations.  If you have criticizm on how you think something should be run do not publicly berate someone, but try and talk to them in a constructive manner.  Remember that everyone has a different style on how they feel raids should be conducted.  IF one persons style is different from your own do not be offended or mad.  Take it in stride and learn from each other.<br>
<br>
Yes we are a family guild.  Yes we are a raiding guild.  I personally feel that we can be both.  Will we have 5 raids a day like Phantom Raiders ...probably not...will we have 2 maybe 3 a week...very possible.  It all comes down to being patient, allowing others to learn, listening and paying attention, and being friends with each other.  As Slaydark has said on numerous occasions....having Faith in your guildmates...that is what the Fide stands for in our call.  Valor and Faith!

Ryland:... 5 raids a day is no picnic and is VERY VERY stressful and frankly.. becomes very boring when you do it daily.  The whole excitement of the big end raid is to go somewhere you haven't been before. kill the uber mobs . and live!.. and if you die, you res up and do it again till you get it right.  Once you have it perfected. move onto the next big nasty<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
As for why we raid<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .. the higher you get in game and the higher the mobs, 90% of all loot is NO DROP!. and the only way to get it.. is get all your friends together and go kill something.<br>

If I offended anyone by what I say when I should have kept my newbie mouth shut, I apologize. Having a 35 main, I have not had the pleasure of attending many raids.<br>
<br>
Last Tuesday, I didn't ask to come to CoM to get loot, or to get exp. I went to be with my friends, and, most importantly, to help them out. I feel guilty quite often because many of you offer to help me and yet I can do nothing except yet again ask for help, especially w/ all the dumb stuff I do. Raids, to me, are the least thing I can do to help out my fellow Knights and friends.  And if I can ever help, and not be a hinderance, I will do my darnest to be there every time, no matter what you need. That's what friends are for. I have no say in how raids should be run because I have no right to. I apologize for my attitude in tonight's guildchat about Kael, just saying &quot;I'll see you there&quot;. I shouldn't have said that without asking first. I promise from now on I will ask before I assume I am wanted/needed. I apologize that I have to make that promise. With that said here's a couple of things I want to say about CoM:<br>
<br>
Tamz, you have done a wonderful job on the raids I have been to under your lead. This was my first raid and I will always remember the great fun I had. Thank you =). I'll respect and understand whatever you decide, but I would love to go to another raid under your leadership.<br>
<br>
I agree that waiting due to people unwilling to come before hand is very aggrivating. I apologize if my little incident in EJ was one of those situations that held things up, I should have been more prepared and careful.<br>
<br>
And on a final note, I apologize also for not at least being on and prepared before Kedge Tuesday, in the chance I might be needed/wanted. I should have realized my EB song might be needed. I understand we had plenty there, and I prolly would not have been needed, but I still should have made the effort. <br>
<br>
Just remember my brother and sister Knights, I am and always will be your friend.<br>

<br>

So you saying &quot;I'm not a bitch... so sue me!&quot;   was funny to me. I don't think anyone here is crticising you (sp) or your raid style.<br>

Want more proof?   You posted a raid and the entire GC shoed up to Chardok. I posted one last week and have gotten 4 ppl to reply.  Whats that tell you about how much ppl respect you. <p><BR>

It's not very different from what you guys been discussing.  In fact me not sure what the real debate is in honesty.  As me mentioned in other discussion, everyone was early.  Was no debate on leaving anyone cause der was noone to leave.  One person had to be yelled at, most of the raid did this.  Personally, I refuse to stand around yelling at people.  I will do it once, maybe twice depending on how bad it is.  After that your gone.  Why? I refuse to lead anyone that refuses to listen. If they are a risk to the raid they are not in the raid.  <br>
<br>
It took about 1 and 1/2 hours to get started...for most big raids thats impressive. <br>
<br>
Everyone assisted and waited for attack.  <br>
<br>
Almost everyone Brought with them coffins or money for dem (which helped alot!)<br>
<br>
No whinning on exp or loot was done<br>
<br>
AFK was announced by everyone as far as I knew<br>
<br>
Most of us read up at least some on da zone<br>
<br>
Brolly lead us through each part explaining as we progressed.<br>
<br>
Everyone knew their jobs and did it (Kit was a busy SA cause me was hanging around alot)!<br>
<br>
Kudos to all der escpecially Kit for another great job as SA!!!<br>
<br>
Ok thats how its supposed to look.  Now how did it get der?  Simple look at da members..dey all been on planar raids and raid after raid after raid. Its experience guys.  Dem what was der been grouped many times before also, that helps more than any statistics and webpages can account for.<br>
<br>
It's hard getting der, for me da journey is not complete yet. <br>

It's only a matter of putting our minds to it.<br>
<br>
We did DN the other day after cancelling Kael (it was camped)<br>
I know I hadn't read up on the zone, but I didn't think we were going there.<br>
I hadn't read up on SG either for that matter,<br>
Nor CS, Nor WW.<br>
<br>
One thing I want to point out for the MA's  and SA's and chanters etc.<br>
(and no I don't want anyone to get offeded just a friendly tip)<br>
<br>
make sure you call for MEZ or for ATTACK is clear.<br>
<br>
IMHO a sample ideal  call for attack.<br>
<br>
/shout =EVERYONE ATTACK NOW= ATTACKING <<<<<< %t >>>>>>><br>
<br>
the arrow brackets  add to the length of the message,<br>
and make it clear what the mob is.<br>
My ooc was spamming right along. my ooc and shout are fairly close in color.<br>
<br>
Incoming calls<br>
Attack calls<br>
Mez Calls  <br>
should be a hot key,<br>
should be one line only<br>
should be the full legnth of the line allowed<br>
should be hit more than once   <br>
no sense having someone miss it <br>
should be hit after the MA gets a taunt or two off.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PEELING<br>
If we are using an FD puller<br>
the MA should be 10 yards in front of everyone else<br>
the puller should FD at the feet of the MA when the mob arrives<br>
the MA should taunt and attack and then after a few hits and a couple taunts should hit the call for attack hot key<br>
and then keep taunting.<br>
<br>
Erveryone(melee) should rush up to the MA and attack<br>
but when the mob is dead<br>
everyone (melee) should go back up again 10 yards behind MA<br>
to repeat.<br>
<br>
I don't know why im writing this hear,  IMHO the people who need to read this don't read the boards.<br>

Ya'll ~ Here's my 2cp too! I really don't say much on these boards but I totally agree with Mystipul! When a person is running a raid, everything does run smoother when it is military style. So what if the raid leader sounds like a &quot;Bitch&quot; or a &quot;Dick&quot;. They are repeating the rules and the rules should be followed. People should be on time and ready to go! So, what's the problem?         When a guild is doing a raid the leader is not there to be a psychiatrist and help people with the problems that they have amongst eachother. I have noticed many times that so and so won't play with this or that person. BS! When on a raid, people should be mature enough to drop the crap and get the job done.<br>
                Here's another rant that I have too! *Jens on a roll*  I really don't think ANYONE should be speaking in /OOC or /Shout unless they are running the raid. This creates unwarranted spam and important instructions are missed and people die. Oh! And the E-motes! Sometimes I just wanna puke! This one kissing this one, hugging, dancing, pointing.....BLEH!BLEH! BLEH! BLEH!YUKKERS! I know - I know...everyone wants to have fun and is excited to see eachother....Let's get the raid going..<br>
                Yes, I can be mushy too but during the raid it's annoying. More spam I gotta look through to get my instructions.....sure, you can turn the e-motes off................but still. Raids are pretty serious to me. I want to attain the goal of the raid....whether it's to get an epic or just loot. I want to get there and get the job done! There is NO reason it should take more than an hour to get a raid going.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As for all the people that have been leading the raids.....Kudos to you for having the patience to do it.  As for Tam not leading anymore raids...That sucks! But it is your decision.......RL shouldn't get rocked because of EQ. Also, Tam takes a LOT of time to smooth out the wrinkles in this guild on top of raiding.........That's a big job in itself!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Also, criticism of people leading the raids - - - - - Maybe more people should volunteer to do it. Everyone always sits on their butts waiting for someone else to do it................Sure, I'm guilty of it too but I'm only very knowledgable of a few zones. I will however offer my services of making groups or shouting instructions to people on a raid. I'm gettin' purty good at the Plane of Fear...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
                Well, that my 2cp.....he he I wonder how many peeps are offended...........I would'nt lose any sleep over it anyways! *grin*<br>

<br>
for raid newbies   ask about these general raid to do things if you have any questions<br>
<br>
/seversidefilter on   <br>
     keeps all the extra info from adding to lag<br>
     with this off  then the auctions that you have turned off  <br>
     still add to lag  but dont add to spam<br>
    <br>
/auction off unless that's the raid channel<br>
/guild off  unless its a guild raid<br>
/showspelleffects off<br>
     saves bunches on lag<br>
/assist Kitaqua  (or whomever the MA )<br>
/g assisting  Kitaqua on  << %t >><br>
learn /assist <br>
know /assist <br>
use /assist<br>
let your group know you are using it  (optional)<br>
but i like it if i missed original call<br>
also lets group leader be the one to tell you dont start yet<br>
vs making the raid leader do it.<br>
(or if you slipped up once and no one else caught it)<br>
(catches some errors)<br>
<br>
others hits off<br>
others misses off<br>
bard songs off  unless you are a bard  then self only?<br>
<br>
spell casting off  unless you are a caster  then self only?<br>
actually  npc spells on   where i can slam and inturupt the spell     i like to see when the mob is casting<br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
