**********************************************<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The ring of mountain peaks stood tall, guardians of the sacred valley of the forest.  For untold generations they had kept intruders out with their forbidding granite cliffs and massive caps of cold white ice.  For all those untold generations the forest had stood untouched by the hands of any being and lived only in the legends of the Elders. <br>
<br>
The dreams had haunted the Druid for two weeks now.   Each day, just before dawn her mind would fill with images of a broken druid ring in the center of a great valley.  Some of the massive stones that made up the ring had crumbled and lay broken and overgrown in the grass and ferns.  Others still stood upright or canted at an angle and showed signs of erosion from wind and rain.  As she looked at them they seemed real.  Every detail stood out in her mind, the flecks of mica in the stones caught the sun’s light like a shimmering fish.  The darker stone crystals stood in sharp contrast and she could see each blade of grass and its rich green as the breeze stirred them.  That same wind made the leaves of the aspens rattle and the little chirping frogs raise their songs in contest with the trees.  It all stood out so vividly in her dream, then she whirled upwards in her minds eye and she had a broader view of the valley and could now see the network of streams that coursed through it, veins that brought the gift of cold clear water to all reaches of the land.  Even from this height she could see and hear the water crashing and flowing over the rocks in its bed as if she were sitting on the bank.  Now she could see the deer cautiously approach one of the little rivulets and pausing for a moment to sniff and listen to the air before it bent its head to sip the water.  Once again she was whisked upward and now could see the peaks that surrounded the valley, she could see where the aspen groves turned into the tall straight evergreens on the flanks of the mountains.  She could see the birds as they flitted among the branches and could feel the cloud as it brushed by her leaving little cold drops of condensation on her eyelashes and bangs.  From this point things faded to darkness and then she heard a voice repeating something, soft, to soft to hear at first.  It seemed each time she heard the dream the words that were being spoken became more and more clear but just before she could comprehend them she would wake. <br>
<br>
Needless to say it frustrated her, she could still hear the mumbled words when she awoke but could not put them to voice yet…  she knew she must give the dream more time.  Yet with each dream she soon realized not only did the words grow clearer but they grew in urgency as well.  It was finally on the night of the Full Moon that the words were clear to her.  “Clan’tsano Virisa Nomanno.”  She repeated the words in her head and tried to figure out what they meant as she watched the sun rise on the great plains of Karana.  She recognized the first two words as those common to a self-gate spell, but she had never heard of the last word Nomanno.  She sat there as the sun continued to rise and thought through her mediations and prayers to Tunare.  She wondered to herself what this meant?  Was it just a dream or was it a message, and if so from whom?  That night she lay down to sleep again and once again the dreams o’er took her just before dawn.  The same words were spoke and there was no mistaking the speakers sense of urgency but this time she woke with one more word ringing in her head: “Please!”  There was something now irresistible in the dream and part of her, the part with which she believed in her duties to help aid and protect nature, seemed to be called by this plea. <br>
<br>
Her meditations complete for the morning, and her supplications offered to Tunare she stood and faced the East and the rising sun.  Slowly and deliberately she spoke those three words. <br>
“Clan’tsano” <br>
“Virisa” <br>
“Nomanno” <br>
She felt the familiar tingle of the gate spell spread across her skin and the world dissolved in front of her in a shimmering of lights.  The next moment she found herself standing at the broken ring she saw in her dreams.  She stood there for a second with her disbelief at her dream’s existence.  She turned slowly around seeing all the detail that she saw in her dream there before her.  Slowly she reached out her hand and felt the grain of the giant granite stones and could smell the sweet fresh air of the valley as it washed over her.  Then she felt it, something deep inside of her, it was like feeling a sound more than hearing it.  Something was resonating within her very body and spirit.  The power of the place in which she stood was amazing.  It frightened her a bit at first but as she became accustom to it she realized it was the life energy of the place.  The next thing that struck her was how tiered she felt.  It seemed that casting that one spell had taken quite a bit out of her.  The sun, she saw, was nearing the mid day position so she took a seat atop one of the fallen stones crossing her legs and resting her hands upon her knees. <br>
<br>
The sun felt warm as it shone down upon her dark skin.  It coursed through her deep red hair and touched the highlights in it turning them golden.  In her peace she began to regain some of the mana that she had lost during the port and she opened her body to its flow.  She listened as the insects buzzed around her and the various birds called from their perches among the trees.  She could feel the breezes caress her shoulders and play with her hair as she sat there, and then for a moment she thought she heard that voice again carried to her on the breeze.  The Elf blocked out the other sounds and listened. Two little lines of concentration creased her forehead.  She strained to listen and as the breezed picked back up she heard it again… <br>
<br>
“Wildarea,” it whispered <br>
<br>
Her eyes popped open and she stood up, she looked around for whomever had called her name.  Again she heard her name, this time from behind her.  She turned on her heel and scanned the area behind her but saw nothing but the waving stalks of grass.  Again she heard her name to her left, so she turned and again found nobody, and then behind her once again so once more she turned and this time found a small creature standing before her.  A startled yalp escaped her lips as she jumped back down off the fallen stone.  The creature made no move towards her or away from her.  She stood there regarding it; somehow she wasn’t scared of it.  It stood only three feet tall and wore a garment of birch leaves.  Its body seemed to be made from greenwood, its characteristic soft green bark providing skin for the creature’s body.  It had no mouth or nose that she could see but two yellow eyes in what she assumed was its head.  The limbs served as legs and arms in the traditional sense and had knots where the knees and elbows should be; the head seemed to be merely where the tree stopped growing, kind of like a stump.  It rustled and creaked a bit as it proffered an awkward bow toward her. <br>
<br>
“My people of the Valley of Tunare welcome you Wildarea.” The whispered voice sounded in her head.  “We were beginning to think that the dreams would not summon you here to us… We are glad to see that we were mistaken.” <br>
<br>
Wildarea stood there in a mixture of shock and disbelief all over again.  “Summoned? The fabled Valley of Tunare?  A sentient greenwood tree that talked to her in her mind?” she thought. <br>
<br>
“Do not fear Wildarea of Kelthin.  We have called you here because we require your assistance.  Tunare has always watched over you, guided you, and protected you.   You have proven yourself worthy through your actions and selflessness, your love and devotion.  Tunare chose you for us to summon to her Valley.”  The words died away in an echo in her mind. <br>
<br>
The shock and honor of what this greenwood was telling her was still too overwhelming for her to form words so she stood there.  As she looked at the greenwood she felt a smile in her mind and knew that the creature was smiling at her.  This in and of itself seemed odd enough and she tilted her head fractionally and looked at the greenwood. <br>
<br>
“Yes.  What I say is true and I am sure you are taken by surprise, come, sit, Wildarea and let me explain to you why Tunare had us summon you to her valley.  Long ago Veshan stuck this planet with her claws to deposit her young.  The power of her blow was enough to scar the crust deeply.  Deeply enough that in some places the molten innards of the planet oozed to the surface.  Tunare knowing the power struggle that would emerge between the Gods came down and She used her powers to raise the mountains around you.  Her hands carved their craggy walls and jagged peaks, her breath capped them with thick sheets of ice and cloaked them in the white clouds and her love gave rise to the life you see in the valley.  That bit of molten earth that Veshan released in her strike, Tunare took up in her hands.  She brought it here where she molded it into the stones here and blessed each one and set them in this ring upon which you sit, the first druid ring made in anticipation of her creation, your kind.  Yet, when the mighty Dragon God struck the earth it did not yield willingly.  The tip of her talon was caught and broke off.  Tunare saw this and within one stone she set that chip of Veshan’s talon knowing the power it possessed.  Rallos Zek released his minions into the world, giants and their kin, and in time they grew so powerful that he led them against the greater Gods.  Zek was a fool thinking his mortal creations could destroy his divine rivals, and so he was defeated and the giants cast down into chaos.  The Gods erected a barrier to keep mortals from their realm and they have never let Zek forget his folly.  Now, Wildarea, he has somehow learned of the talon that lies encased within this ring.  Zek still seethes at his loss and longs for a way to revenge himself upon the Greater Gods.  He believes that within the talon lies the power to restore the giants to their once state of glory, intelligent beings.  Tunare summons you here to help her protect her valley and keep this from happening.” <br>
<br>
The silence hung in the air for a moment and the Druid cast her eyes down into her lap then looked back up at the Greenwood.  “How am I to defeat Zek?  I am but one mortal Druid and he is a God!” <br>
<br>
“You do not have to kill or even fight Zek, you must merely thwart his plans.”  The shadow of the words passed through her head <br>
<br>
“And how do I do that?” <br>
<br>
“You, Wildarea, must destroy the talon.” <br>
<br>
“Destroy it?! But isn’t there another way?  What will that mean for the Valley?  For you?” <br>
<br>
“Wildarea, the talon chip is merely a focusing agent for the magics of the ring.  That is why he wants it, to focus his powers to break the curse of the Greater Gods.  We have held off Zek’s giants and his anger grows daily.  Soon we fear that he himself will come and try to possess the talon.  This cannot come to pass.  As for our valley, we will live on but the power of the rings will be diminished.  Nobody would be able to gate to these rings afterwards.  It is a small price to pay for denying Zek his revenge and protecting the order of things.” <br>
<br>
“So why don’t you or Tunare shatter it?” <br>
<br>
“That is the problem.  We have tried but there is an enchantment cast upon it.  Only a child of Tunare and one wielding her Blessing can destroy it.  You are her chosen one Wildarea.  You are to wield her Blessing and destroy the talon shard.  By destroying Zek’s goal he will have no use of this valley.  He would not dare to openly challenge Tunare so he would slink away and he will be forced to find some other means of revenge.” <br>
<br>
“I will do whatever my Goddess asks of me.” <br>
<br>
“Then turn and take up Tunare’s Blessing.  The talon lies embedded in the central stone.  Only the pure virgin light of the dawn and the Blessing of Tunare combine can shatter the talon.” <br>
<br>
Wildarea rose on stiff legs and turned behind her.  Her breath caught in her throat as she saw a small forest of the greenwood beings.  She had neither seen nor heard them approach her.  In unison they bowed before her and their creaking and rustling was loud in her ears.  One greenwood moved forward to her and parted the leaves that hung from his chest.  In a cavity behind them Wildarea saw a mace.  The greenwood’s eyes pierced her as she reached inside of him and pulled forth the mace.  She held it in her hand and looked it over.  The handle was carved from Darkwood, its grain rich and think in the evening sun, the head of the mace was made from a metal that had been folded hundreds maybe even thousands of times.  Dark lines marked the folding process and contrasted with the dull gray-silver of the alloy itself.  She turned it over in her hands and could feel the power of the weapon.  Its heft was perfect and with it in her hand she felt as if she had gained more wisdom, strength, and knowledge than she had ever had before.  She turned back to the first greenwood.  “Tunare’s Blessing?” <br>
<br>
“Yes” she heard in her mind “it is the ForestDawn, crafted in Tunare’s forge by her own smith.  It was forged for her champion to destroy the talon before Zek could plunder it.” <br>
<br>
“I will destroy the talon.” <br>
<br>
“Wildarea, you must wait until the dawn and as its first rays strike the talon then so must you strike it at the same time and place.  That is the only way it can be destroyed.” <br>
<br>
“I understand.  Thank you.”  And this time Wildarea knelt before the greenwood. <br>
<br>
Night slipped its veil up over the heavens and through it only points of light could make it through.  The Druid sat up that night and watched the stars and offered her prayers to Tunare and her thanks.  In her mind’s eye she saw what she had to do and the echoes of the greenwood’s instructions lingered as well.  She let sleep overtake her and slept soundly and dreamlessly for the first time in a month. <br>
<br>
The pre dawn chill woke her and she stretched out her own limbs and then stood up.  She walked silently over to a little stream and in the glow that precedes the dawn.  There in her solitude she removed the armor that she wore and lay it neatly on the bank.  She tied her long red hair up in a lose knot on top of her head.  Where a large boulder lay in the stream the water slowed and pooled calmly behind it.  Little rings spread outwards from where her delicate feet then her smooth legs pierced the water’s surface.  As she rinsed herself the cold water brought goosebumps to her exposed skin but when she left the pool she felt refreshed and clean.  Clean before her Goddess and her task. <br>
<br>
Dressed and cleansed she walked back to the ring and straight to its central spire.  She looked to the east and saw first one ray crest the peaks and then a second and a third.  She looked at the spire and could almost see the shard of talon.  It lay half embedded in the rock of the spire.  It was so pure and so clear that it was nearly invisible.  She could only tell where it existed outside of the rock because of the reflections of other things along its rounded edges.  She looked upwards just a bit to see the shadow of the mountains slowly working its way down the spire as the sun rose up higher and higher.  She drew the ForestDawn back in both hands and readied her swing. <br>
<br>
“NO!! I COMMAND YOU TO STOP WILDAREA!! DO NOT DESTROY MY TALON!!”  The voice, deep, rattled everything in the valley and echoed off its walls. <br>
<br>
Wildarea’s fingers flexed and her knuckles grew white as she clasp it waiting for the rays to strike the talon.  She never shifted her gaze but just  continued to tightened her grip on the ForestDawn.  She spoke quietly and determinedly “By Tunare’s order it will be done.”  And she watched as the sunray made the correct angle and illuminated the shard. <br>
<br>
<br>
“NOOOOOOOO!!!”  The voice all but screamed as she swung the mace down with all of her strength and will power.  The ForestDawn struck the talon at the point that the first ray of the dawn had hit it and bounced off.  The talon lay there in it’s rock unhurt.  At first Wildarea looked in disbelief.  She had failed, she had done just as the greenwood had said though. <br>
<br>
A low laugh began to roll down the sides of the mountains.  Wildarea sunk to her knees before the shard, but even as she knelt there in her failure and the laughter of Zek washed over her she heard something else, something like the popping of lake ice when it is warmed by the sun.  She looked up and saw the shard and as she did the laughter came to an abrupt halt.  As Wildarea looked on she slowly regained her feet.  A small glowing crack had formed where she hit it and slowly it was radiating out through the rest of the talon.  As it ran through the shard it split into many other glowing cracks and each snaked their way through it, each giving rise to their own new faults.  As each fault line found its way to the edge of the shard it shattered from its recess in the spire and fell to the ground at the Druid’s feet. As the sun continued to rise its rays found each piece in turn and as each ray struck a piece of the talon it melted into a small puddle of water that the grass and earth quickly claimed. <br>
<br>
“ARGGGH!!” <br>
<br>
Wildarea picked up the ForestDawn and turned with a smile on her face.  There standing before her was the greenwood again.  He once more proffered her a bow and creaking as he stood up she once again felt his smile inside of her.  “Wildarea, it is my honor to confer to you Tunare’s great thanks for your service to her.  I must ask however that the ForestDawn be returned to our people for it is Tunare’s own weapon.” <br>
<br>
Wildarea returned the smile and placed the mace back inside the other greenwood that had stepped forward.  This one bowed his creaking rustling bow and the disappeared back into the forest around them. <br>
<br>
“Now Wildarea, return home.  Your family misses you and they worry.  Go to them and let them know that all is well.  We all thank you for your help Wildarea.  Know that Tunare is always watching. <br>
<br>
Wildarea waved as they disappeared into the forest again.  She let her gaze sweep across the valley and its beauty before reciting the words for her gate to the Commonlands. <br>
<br>
As the tingle faded from her skin she found herself back in familiar territory and as she sat to regain a bit of the mana she used in her gate, that familiar voice touched her mind one last time.  “Your honor and service will be remembered this day Wildarea, in remembrance and gratitude, Child of Kelthin, Tunare herself whishes that you take the last name of her Blessing, the Forrestdawn, as your own.”  And she could feel his smile in her mind. <br>
<br>
