I've been around since this guild was created, and I've met alot of good people. I'm not intending to step on any toes, just thought I'd share my opinion on current events.<br>
<br>
The Good:<br>
<br>
The guild is growing. More people equates to more things to do, more friends to group with, more exciting eq'ing, and less shouting LFG. I welcome all mature additions to the guild, people that can contribute and grow with us. I'm not that concerned with the rules and processes, but perhaps they might weed out the people who could care less what guild they are in. On the other hand they could make us seem overly selective, like we are innately better than everyone else, which isn't good either. If a reference and an e-mail is too much work to join our family, there are plenty of other guilds out there.<br>
<br>
We are getting higher in levels. We can accomplish more goals, obtain those items that we've only dreamed of for the last 2 and a half years. Unfortunately level alone won't allow us to do all the things that we want to, we also need the strength of numbers. The Grey Coalition helps us with this, but since verant didn't put in any cross-guild chat functions, it's basically only good for uber raids, not everyday eq'ing. We still need to actively recruit, imo, to be self-sufficient.<br>
<br>
Lastly, we are still a quality guild. I don't know everyone in the guild on a personal level, but I'm proud of what and who we are.<br>
<br>
The Bad:<br>
<br>
Mobilization. This is our biggest problem in my opinion. In 2 and a half years of eq, I've done alot of travelling across Norrath. Port or no port, SoW or no SoW, map or no map, if there's somewhere I need to go, I'll get there by any means that I can. Learn the loc system, max your sense heading, print maps if you need to. Granted there are classes that can't invis or sow without potions, and there are people on slow computers like my old 200mhz that I finally retired, hehe, but crossing a few zones shouldn't take hours. I don't know how many times someone has tried to organize something, only to spend the next hour or two on tracking hunts and CR's. Leaving 45 minutes or an hour to actually raid. Maybe we need to have some mandatory map printing:P<br>
<br>
Communication. Just because guildchat isn't flowing constantly doesn't mean we're anti-social. Coming online, asking &quot;who wants to do something&quot;, not getting any responses, and camping frustrated isn't the way to go. I'll be the first to admit that I can't always commit to doing guild events and groups, but I'm usually aware of where everyone is. If you want help with something, do a /who all GUILD, see what everyone is doing, what zones they're in, send tells to people in your area or an area that you want to go to. If they're busy it's no big deal, if they're not, a personal invitation will get you farther than the &quot;who wants ta do stuff&quot; request.<br>
<br>
The Ugly:<br>
<br>
I'm sure this won't be a popular topic so I'll make it brief. I realize that EQ attracts people like me that aren't overly social in RL, but it doesn't mean I don't act civilized in game. I'm not here to get to know everyone on a personal level, which may make me seem uninterested. I play to get away from RL, enjoy accomplishing small goals, and help out others when I can. The ugly topic I'm referring to is the whole KoV soap opera bullcrap. Marriage, divorce, he said, she said, I'm leaving, I'm staying, you stole my loot, you hogged all the cookies, you didn't say hi, you didn't say bye........bah. Eq isn't a dating service, the world won't end if you don't get all the uber loot, and no, not everyone in the guild is going to do exactly what you want them to at all times. All I ask is that if you're going to get involved in arguments and bickering and any other odd human emotions through a phone line, keep it in perspective.<br>
<br>
It's late and I'm probably a bit cranky, hehe, but I just thought I'd get a few things out in the open that some of us have been thinking for quite a while.<br>

Addendum: I know I said I wouldn't name anyone, but since there are new members to the guild, and a recent eq &quot;divorce&quot;, it should be known that I wasn't directing this at those members. I respect all of our members, new, old, or otherwise. I'm simply reflecting on the goings on of the past couple years of the guild soap opera, along with all it's side effects. Personally, it's just a side of the online life I could do without.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=17.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm8.showNextMessage?topicID=17.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm8.emailToFriend?topicID=17.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm8.threadControl?topicID=17.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=17.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=17.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub55.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="knightsofvalor76584frm3">General Discussion<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm4">Event Suggestions<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm5">Scheduled Raids<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm14">Epic Quests ~ General, Mobs Needed<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm19">Raid Committee Discussion<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm9">Quest Inquiries/Spoilers<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm7">Stories<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm20">**MEMBERS ONLY**<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm15">Charter, Bylaws, Loot Rules<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm10">Membership Application<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm13">Tradeskills & Guild Armory<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm8">Inquiries/Feedback <option value="knightsofvalor76584frm6">Roll Call<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm11">Computer Q & A<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm16">Removed Threads</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/bknightsofvalor76584>Knights of Valor</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm8>Inquiries/Feedback </a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://knightsofvalor.freeservers.com">Knights of Valor</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top">
