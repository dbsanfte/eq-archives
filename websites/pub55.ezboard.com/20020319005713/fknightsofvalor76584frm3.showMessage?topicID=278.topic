I was just surfing around the net looking up some info on the TS quests and I felt like posting what I had found and my opinion on em. Here goes =) :<br>
<br>
From what I've seen the TS armors are not all that exciting. But I think it was designed not to be that way on a beneficial purpose. From the little while I've been playing I've noticed the armor sets that each class has. For example: Bards have Lambent, Singing Steel, Thurg/Kael/CoV Armor, and now Bravado.  From what I've gathered, each class as at least 3 sets of armor(ex: Warriors; Crafted, Thurg/Kael/CoV Armor, Planar Armor[Or sumthin like that lol]). Ok, now to stop stating what you already knew and what I'm unsure of =). <br>
<br>
The benefit of the TS armor seems (at least to me) that you can aquire certain pieces that your earlier sets (at least mine) did not have. Once again for example Bravado (the bard TS armor) set contains all equipable slots(except jewelry as in all quest armor), including a weapon. This makes for Mask, Shoulder, Neck, Back, and Weapon slots that my lambent does not cover. These pieces have all around stats that cater(sp) to a bard. I think the real benefit of these quests will be found in our lower level mains and alts. I can't afford SS, I'm not going on any planar raids anytime soon, and my Kael faction is too low to even think about the quests yet.  I cant afford nice armor for all these slots. That's where TS armor really shines IMHO. I'll wholeheartedly agree that gathering the pieces is both aggrivating and time consuming, not to mention a little late in levels. This is one thing I wish Verant could change, but I know that's not gonna happen. But to allude again to bards, I just now finished getting all of the Lambent pieces I really needed(Dinged 39 tonight), and I wouldn't have gotten any w/o help from my friends and family here in KoV. So, how do we make these quests easier? I recommend that we try to help each other out by saving the Lore items we find on Luclin, if at all possible. Just think, wouldn't it be nice to twink your alts w/ quest armor and save money? Lol, I'm not just saying that to help me out, I think these quests would help us all out. In the very least, none of the TS armor is No Drop (from what I've seen), so you could make a pretty penny off saving the quest items. I agree not all the pieces are worth the trouble. For example, once again, the Bard Bravado Breastplate is only slightly better than Lambent(Same AC, more stats though still minor), but some of em really are worth the trouble IMHO.<br>
<br>
All the quest armor items known can be found on the GC boards (or Allakazams now) in a huge chart that labels the mobs and zones for the pieces. Specific mobs supposedly drop specific pieces 100% of the time.  So, the hard part is not neccesarily finding the item, the hard part is catching the mobs spawn and taking them down. I would link the page here, but I'm not versed in html so Im not quite sure how do that(plus it's 2am atm lol). I'll post the link as a reply to this later.<br>
<br>
Sorry to rant and rave, and to take up space, but I just felt it was worth mentioning. Please post your opinions on this, feel free to shoot me down. Lord knows I don't know a lot about the world of Norrath, so I've more and likely typed a lot of blunders here.  Also, let me know if you are questing for any of the TS armour and if I can help in anyway possible.<br>

P.S. Thanks Flogg for this research =). I figured I'd post here to go along w/ what you had found and because I knew there had been a post about this earlier. Sorry if this is hard to read guys and gals, it was late but I wanted to post my thoughts before I lost em in sleep. =) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/uspeeiddeeamon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Speeid Deeamon</A> at: 1/31/02 1:31:08 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/utamzachshadowslayer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tamzach Shadowslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight Distinguished</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/31/02 10:52:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=278.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Twilight Sea Quest info part 2</span><hr size=1> Great Info Floggy thanks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></br>
