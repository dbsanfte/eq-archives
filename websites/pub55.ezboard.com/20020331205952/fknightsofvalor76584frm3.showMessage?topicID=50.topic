It's one of the best things about the guild and the reason that Shal and Phat are still a part of it.. Lvl restrictions are something that a family orientated guild doesn't really have to worry about.. Yeah it's necessary to do in order to start raiding and such but is that why KoV is here?  Or is that why GC is there in order to unite many of the family orientated guilds in order to give them the chance to do what the pure raid/uber encounter guilds accomplish at the cost of their family atmosphere?  Just something to chew on..<br><br>     Now as to why I agree with lvl restrictions?  Just because what another person said, by the time they hit 30 most of em have a pretty firm grasp of what Norrath is like, what is expected of their class, and have shown the dedication to get to that lvl...

KoV started at low levels and that is where most of us came from...if you change the level requirements you are looking at to things...  yes your going tolose a lot of the family feeling because if you only recruit higher levels they as you say are experienced and will want to do the epics.. raids... you will be getting people not after the family feeling but the army feeling as mentioned before...... you need to allow people who look for the game while new... look at Zaney.. Wyle.  and countless others who joined at low levels andare still here with KoV...they grew up with a family.. not an army...yes moving the level restriction up has a great potential but at what cost.. i think its said best.. go the middle ground and test the water.. bump it up to 20..they will have a second name...and will be a turning point in their characters...  but my one word of advice is if you do bump it up to 30 or higher you will need to be more strict with your invites... most people at that level range has either left a guild or looking for whta they can get... Avvisone has a pretty tough recruitment process but its fair... and more important it forces the individual to get out and meet guild members before they get to join... and it takes more than just one person to vouch for them...  i wish you all the very best and i miss each of you... you all be careful and as most of you know i'm only a Tell away and  will alway do my best to help my friends out... <br><br>  Nobody<br>  Fortitudo et Decus <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/ukitaqua.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kitaqua</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight Templar</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/4/01 12:00:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Proposed level increase</span><hr size=1> I was actually leaning towards lvl 20 myself, but then as I remember back to all the members of that level that we have lost over the past 6 months or even in the last year because we could not set up enough playtimes with them with our alts or raids suitable for their level, and how they always said the same things (that they did not feel like they were made to feel at home and did not have enough guild members to play with of their level to really make being in KoV viable for them), I have to cast my vote for lvl 30 in the level increase.  I would say that, as in any &quot;rule&quot;, there will and can be exceptions made, but it would be something we did for our members and family as a whole because most of us do play our main characters most times and we really do best when we are all playing in zones where any of us know we can go and join in anytime and not exclude anyone or make them feel like they will never catch up or be able to make a contribution to the group or even to the guild.  I know I felt overwhelmed at times when I first joined the Knights at lvl 14, and so many were in their 30's and 40's...I was lucky and had a great support group of friends that I always ran around with outside the guild (who are all in the Knights now *woohoo*), but a lot of folks don't have that and that is what they seek out a guild to join...to have peers to run with and make close friends with for support anytime they need it.  I am not saying we cannot do that for younger members who join...it's just harder to get to know those we do not group with and it's equally hard to give up the friends we already have and are used to hunting with to play really low alts (many of us have alts now at least into their 30's) on a consistant basis.   <p><center><img src="http://www.avvisione.com/members/Kit52.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/ulangleyevocateur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Langley Evocateur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>KoV member</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/4/01 12:39:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   30+ or not</span><hr size=1> Another avenue that could allow for the best of both worlds would be a guild for below 30 that is a development guild.  One of the major problems is someone who is not of sufficient level to have to observe the raid chat, which at times must be overwhelming.  That alone could make you feel not wanted.  Are there guilds that have a level cap at the top?  It would be a huge undertaking but to have a Knights of Valor Junior could work, or just find a guild and take it under our wing.  There are guilds that split to become two, one being &quot;elder&quot;.  With this in place there could be an overlap, 30 to 40 for instance where the person could decide to jump to KoV.

However it should not be a hard and fast rule. If a person who is say 20,21,etc is extremely good at their class and would be a benefit. Why not let them in? This is where the sponsership would come into play.
