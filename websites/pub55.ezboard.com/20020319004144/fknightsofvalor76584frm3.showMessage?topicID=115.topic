Behind each tree was a deadly Orc or Bear, wasp or Bandit.  You felt your pulse quicken as you got 2 baddies on the both of you, your Health was dropping, so was your new friends and the bad guys hp weren't dropping quite as fast as yours... Thinking oh crap, I'm gonna die and I'm not sure where I even am!  Then you get a lucky hit or you finally manage to get that spell off and you kill it.  You and your friend congratulate each other and as you sit and heal and med up you talk of that battle. How close it was, that lucky spell he/she got off and that nice hit you got in at the end...<br>
<br>
Where have those days gone?  <br>
<br>
Now you go to the plane of Hate or Dragon Necropolis, or any other high lvl zone and what happens?  It takes 3 hours to even get in the zone, rules are set forth before anybody goes in.  Rules about loot and attacking, and camping, and drops, and god knows what else.  They are plastered on websites like the pages of a Law book from a Judge's private chambers.  Tempers and patients go the oposite way they should, rising and falling.  <br>
<br>
Where did the fun go?  it seems the High the level we reach the less this is a game and some serrious investment.  The higher the Lvl we attain the MORE fun this game should become.<br>
<br>
Now don't missunderstand me.  I know there need to be rules, guidlines to follow.  All games have them, basketball, baseball, poker, chess, horseshoes, you name it.  Rules are set up to keep game play fair and equal and ensure fun for all players.  But now tell me, when you play games with friends, if somebody makes a mistake, how do you react?  A foul in Basketball. Do you kick them out of the game or the group?  If you invite somebody to play poker with you, do they have to wait an hour before they can place any bets or before they can win the pot?  If you have somebody in your game that is cheating, or fouling intentionally what do you do?  yes, then you kick them out and you don't let them play till they can play nice.  So?  you have a problem with somebody then you discipline them.  It just seems a sad day to me when I have to see these kind of rules laid out in plain text for the FAMILY of KoV.  (For a large coalition, like GC, I can moreso see the need for that, because diffrent guilds do things diffrently)<br>
<br>
Guys, this is a game.  People make mistakes.  I was listening to the last time you tried to raid Fear, and seen the other rules for the big raids.  Needing a 'police force' to watch for people who break the rules?  If you break Mez on a mob, and die, you won't get a rez, only a revive and no exp back.  God knows losing exp at 45+ sucks, but it IS only exp.  You don't have a black eye, or a broken limb.  People make a mistake because that's just how we are.  Human, faliable.  And I don't see any forgivness in all this.  If I am grouping with any of KoV, I'll be honest.  I'm not even paying attention to your loot rules.  If something drops that somebody needs, then fine, it's theirs.  If I don't need it, I won't mess with it.  and if I want it for an alt, I'll ask if anybody has a problem with it, and if they do, fine.  It's common courtsy people.  It shouldn't have to be spelled out to the letter of the law for us.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Rules like that just don't build good will.  personally I don't care to be on a raid like that.  (and it's sad that it seems it must be like that)<br>
<br>
Remember the Golden Rule?  then use it! <br>
<br>
I Know I haven't been around much, at least as Atrox.  To be honest, for those of you who didn't know,  Atrox is now and has been retired.  Lvl 54 Cavalier of Marr is no more.  The game was not fun for me, for many of the reasons above and some others as well.  Namely I find that I am disagreeing with the way verant has structured the Paladin class.  The vision in my head of what a Paladin should be is not the same as Verants.  I love that class, and would rather not play them, and pay my respect to those who choose to, than to play something that doesn't fit the immage in my head.  But anyway, I started playing an alt.  He's not guilded, and wonders around, finding grps or grping with a few friends who know of him.  And it is so nice.  We dont' have to write out rules for loot and when you can loot and what you can loot and what you can't loot and who gets to loot what when and if you can't than see sub paragaph w-3.45.  <br>
<br>
And then, THEN I realized what was wrong with Atrox.  It wasn't a game anymore. I had fallen into the trap, and it was serrious. too serrious.  And when I stepped back and played my alt for a few weeks, I finally saw that.  It hit me like a brick.<br>
<br>
As it stands now I play my alt off and on.  I'm not sure if I will keep my account or quit Ever Quest for good.  As it stands now, the only reason I have to stay on EQ are a few very good friends.  My alt has nothing to look forward too but pages of rules and regulations to dictate to him what he can and can't do when and where and how.  As it is now, he will hit the same wall Atrox did.  <br>
<br>
Helping out in Kedge was my honor and a pleasure Kit, and Faewynd.  It is Atrox's last act.  <br>
<br>
I bid thee all a fair well for the time being.  If I decide to keep my alt, now my primary, then perhaps I will see you on some path through Norratth.  May Brell guide your feet, Elorsi give you compassion, Mithanelle grace you with the light of Truth, Tunare grant you sweet passage of time and Karana keep his rains from your head.  It has been a pleasure, and my honor to be there, to help and contriubte to all those who have needed me.  <br>
<br>
Fair thee well. <p>Atrox Runeblade <br>

The rules arent meant to be a restriction, but a way to help everyone get along.  Some people may have no problem with loot and such, but others do...it fits into their goals of what they want to get out of this game.  I do agree that the low level vs the high level game play is two completely different worlds.  I do feel that the rules that we have set forth are extremely fair...we are fair with penalties.  In anything rules must exist or their is total anarchy...<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you have lost your desire to play the game Atrox.  I hope you find something that makes you happy with life.  Good luck in whatever you do.<br>

<br>
I must say that you've expressed in words what I've felt for the last 2 months or so.<br>
<br>
I also have noticed that people have told me that I shoulden't be allowed to try for pieces of my epic because I'm only level 41.  I feel if I'm there risking my XP and taking my time I should at least get a roll/a chance to get it.  <br>
<br>
I understand the need for the Loot rules.  I hate to say it, but I'm glad they are there.  It eliminates people argueing during a raid about who gets what and why they deserve to roll or not on it.  That is a good thing, I salute the officers for taking care of this part.<br>
<br>
I think this is all a matter of Greed.  I've been greedy as of late and some of you might know Tamzach and I had a heated discussion about it.  Once she and I were able to connect about the issue, it was clear.  I've had to realize that this IS a game.  I'm going to keep playing with or without that ES Sleeves I really want.  I'm sure that everybody else will as well.  <br>
<br>
I've decided that I'm going to keep throwing Bascomb into the frey during raids.  Keep being agressive.  I figure if I help Tam and the others get their stuff, they'll be there for me.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to give up on my Epic because I'm level 41 and people don't like it.  But I'm not going to push hard to get pieces.  If I'm there and a piece drops and I can roll, you better believe I'm going to do it!<br>

See you online!<br>

I think something everybody should be asking themself is when did that change and why?  If each indivdual can find an answer to that, then perhaps once again there won't be a need for those rules to be posted, and if one person comes in and makes problems, you will all be the stronger for it, stand together and throw them out.  KoV is imho, the finest guild on Bertoxx.  I know what I speak of is the Ideal and not necessarily the Real.  But the guild did exist and function very well for a long time before the rules were posted as such, and had to be laid out in such a manner.  <br>
<br>
And don't get me wrong, having to post those rules probably was for the best, in the situation.  I just find it a sad day when they must be posted.   <p>Atrox Runeblade <br>

Call them what you will.  Why does KoV need them when previously they did not?  Perhaps with the growing number of higher level members and the multigroup raids that become the norm is the reason.  Why would we need complicated looting policies if there are five of us at orc1 in EC?  Rules are like all laws, they really only keep the honest honest, there are many that will not heed them anyways.  The work put into forging a workable looting policy is what should be the focus and thanks to those who have spent hours and hours of their time trying to find a way to keep us all happy.  These rules are not meant to be an insult to people, but a way to make the raid organizer have something to base a decision on.  How would you propose 36 people standing over something of value decide on the spur of the moment who should have?  Their would be no need to loot anything because it would all decay before we could decide who gets it ).  The rules need to be in place for all to digest and now we are doing just that.  I am very happy with them and see a need for them.<br>

 <br>
The rules went up because KoV is growing, and new people need to learn about KoV.  It helped me see that KoV intends to be fair about it, just a couple guidelines.  No fancy points, nor special treatment.  <br>
<br>
If people are to invest 5 hours at any raid,  to ensure enjoyment for all, there has to be some guidelines known before hand, or many won't waste their time going.....<br>
