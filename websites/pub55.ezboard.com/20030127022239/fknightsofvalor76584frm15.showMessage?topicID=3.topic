By-Laws<br>
----------------------<br>
I. Knights must follow the Codes of Conduct and Chivalry. They must show honesty, courage, humility, and kindness. In combat, a Knight shall show no fear. One must honor thy opponents as thou art honored. One must help those in need, but not debase thyself. Thy fellow Knights are thy Brothers and Sisters and are to be treated as such.  <br>
II. We are the members of a family that must rely on one another at all times to help fight the tide of injustice that is sweeping our land. If you are nearby when a guild member makes a request that you can help with, you are expected to make every effort to do so. You are encouraged, but not required, to perform any trade skills (such as blacksmithing or tailoring) that you may have at base costs for members of the guild. Remember that it is our duty to make sure that none of our followers dies in pursuit of our common dream.<br>
<br>
a. Members will refrain from begging other members or players for trade skill items, equipment, pp or services such as ports, binds, rezzes, etc. We are here to help each other, but each member must respect the time and effort that others have put into their crafts and characters as well, and work for their own items and make their own way in Norrath just as their elders have done. <br>
 <br>
III. Any member who has proven themselves will have equal say within the guild. If a conflict arises, an officer will make the final judgment. In cases where there is no argument, an officer has no more say in a situation or vote than any other member, but there will be due respect given as earned by the High Council and Counsellors. Whenever troubled, a Knight is encouraged to talk to their immediate superior or other officer to resolve differences amicably. All decisions of the council are final.  <br>
a. If you are having a problem with guild policy or other guild members, please take it up with your immediate superior (check officer rankings). Although we will not try to make you stay if you decide your destiny lies elsewhere, we do not want 'bad apples' chasing you or any other members out of the guild either.  <br>
IV. Every member should be conscious that his or her actions reflect upon the guild as a whole. As a Knight, you should always be courteous to everyone around you. We shall avoid attacking creatures under attack by others unless they are clearly in trouble or ask for help. Our enemies are to be respected as they are fought, and you should salute a fallen foe for fighting an honorable battle. We do not hate, for hate is the bile of Innoruk. We sing glory to honor and justice as our magic and blades hew down evil. Always give the benefit of the doubt and lead by example.  <br>
a. Seek to help those new to the game, whether it be saving them from certain death when they get in over their head or offering them a minor piece of equipment that you are about to sell for a few coppers. You may forget that person in an hour, but they will certainly remember your kindness for a long time to come and the good name of the Knights of Valor will be respected and revered throughout the land. <br>
 <br>
V. PVP is a necessary evil. It shall be used when it is deemed necessary. Knights may resort to PVP when they have been dishonored, when they witness an evil act, or in defense of a just cause. Childish insults do not constitute &quot;dishonoring&quot;; there must truly be a stain upon one's name.  <br>
VI. No arguing or harsh words will be tolerated on the Guild Channel. Any disagreement is to be taken to /tell immediately. Officers will NEVER disagree on the Channel.  <br>
VII. Regular raids, suitable for all levels or level-oriented, are to be encouraged. They will be posted well in advance on the website calendar. We will do our best as a guild to provide transportation to raid zones, but if you are planning to attend a raid or event, you will want to arrange to be in the area ahead of time and be prompt in arriving for guild functions so we can all enjoy our times together in their entirety. Friends and alliances are always welcomed.  <br>
VIII. We will remember that it is a privilege to be in the Knights of Valor, and not just anyone will be accepted. It is deemed that there be no limit to the number of members the guild may admit, but we will follow these guidelines for admittance.  <br>
a. Prospective KoV must visit the website and agree with the charter and guild codes and fill out the guild application. They may apply at any level, but must be a minimum of level 10 to be invited. Secondary and subsequent characters of current KoV members may be admitted at any level. <br>
 <br>
b. Every new member must be vouched for by one member of the KoV in good standing who will agree to sponsor the candidate. The integrity of all Knights of Valor make this sponsorship the cornerstone of the Guild's future strength.<br>
 <br>
c. If a member is asked by another player who is interested in joining the KoV or finding out more about the guild and what it stands for, they will courteously direct them to speak to the Knight Ambassador if he is available. If he is not available, another officer may be sought out to speak to the prospective member. Officers are expected to take time out to do this if at all possible. If no officer is available, a member may direct a prospective member to the guild website and tell them that they will let the Knight Ambassador or other officer know of their interest in the KoV at the earliest opportunity. <br>
 <br>
d. Upon invitation into the guild, the new member will be under a 30-day probation period and be given the title of apprentice regardless of level. This period of time will allow both the guild and the apprentice to determine the compatibility of the merger before induction into the regular ranks of the KoV. The officer who extends the invitation to a new member will contact the Knight Ambassador at his or her earliest opportunity and give the new member's information to him or her so that fair and accurate records can be kept. <br>
 <br>
e. Prospective members must be beyond reproach and Knights should feel that they could trust them with their lives. No member of the KoV must have had bad dealings with prospective members or other characters that they may have. This may be ascertained in guild chat either before a member joins or during their 30-day probation period and will be at the discretion of the Council. <br>
 <br>
f. In order to ensure adequate forethought to their decisions on leaving the Knights of Valor, let it be known that any member who /guilddelete(s) one of their characters from the guild (and subsequently changes his or her mind about having done so) will have to reapply on the website for that character before they can be invited back into KoV. In addition to the regular application questions, they will be asked and expected to answer additional questions as to why they left and why they wish to return. The application will go through the normal channels and vote on Council, and the Holy Champion will inform the applicant via email of the outcome of the vote and when they will be eligible to be inducted back into the guild. <br>
IV. A Knight may not hold more than one (1) position in the leadership heirarchy at any given time. The High Council and Chancellor positions, when vacated, may only be filled by Knights currently in the leadership heirarchy.  <br>
V. A Knight shall wear their guild tag with pride and honor at all times. If he or she chooses to use anonymous for whatever reasons deemed necessary, he or she must also use roleplay mode so that the KoV tag is visible and apparent.  <br>
