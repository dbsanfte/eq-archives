<br>
        My attitude and actions tonight were niether justified or acceptable. I apologize for any grief I may have caused any of you or your friends and apologize for not sticking in there to help those of you who were still out there. I got mad and gave up and that is totally not what should have occured. After this sensless act of selfishness I withdraw my inquery for leadership consideration of the Knights of Valor. I do not deserve a position among our best.This attitude is not that of a leader, and as a Knight I would not accept it from my leaders. Again I am sorry I have let you all down and beg for your forgiveness, please be safe out there and I will be with you again soon. Love you all and thank you for your consideration.<br>
<br>
                                                       Sincerest Apologies,<br>

by the time i got to WL side of Kael  all the corpses were there.<br>
<br>
ie. All went well after you left.<br>
***<br>
side note:<br>
see my other post, elahana is camped out by your corpse waiting to rez you.<br>
*****<br>
I wasnt there to see the cause of he frustration.<br>
However,   your realization and admission, show a<br>
good quality,<br>
maybe putting a temporary hold on leadership....<br>
Good officers are hard to find.  <br>
lets not let one incident stain the process.<br>
<br>
Also,  IF you ARE pissed.  Logging is often the best answer.<br>
(you were RIGHT on that.)<br>
And you didn't leave anyone in the lurch,  everything was under control at that point.<br>
<br>
( atm I know I DONT want to be an officer,<br>
it's a tough job, maybe someday I'll change my mind)<br>
there are many who don't want it,  so when we have a good canidate, and a good friend,  we have to cut some slack now and again.  (well maybe that's why ive been well liked as an officer of HR,  i will help anyone, and will cut everyone some slack now and again.)  <br>
<br>
Good luck....... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/uatrapas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Atrapas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/7/01 7:25:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Eternal Forgiveness requested...</span><hr size=1> Officers = human too, hence prone to error just like the rest of us Ayuden..

<br>
I camped earlier so I didn't see what transpired.  However, as Shaluk said, officers make errors as well.  I've often maintained that while prevention is important, a more useful measure of a person is how they respond when problems do occur; admitting to a mistake with sincerest apologies says many favorable things.  Any sort of retribution is really up to those affected by your actions so you'll want to take this up with them one-on-one.<br>
<br>
And Jook, I hear ya on the officer thing.  I didn't think I wanted an officer spot as well.  Then some rough times occurred earlier this year and I contacted Kit, offering to help in any way I could.  That started a process of more and more involvement in guild matters until I realized that it was something that I actually liked.  It just progressed from participating in the old Raid Committee, then accepting a Chancellor position, and now my current position.  Over this time, I've come to realize that we are all officers to an extent; holding an official position isn't trivial but it is like a recognition for your efforts.  Over the past few months I've read several positive posts on these boards and I keep thinking to myself that the officers are able to perform their duties largely due to the oustanding membership we enjoy as Knights.  It is very much a symbiotic relationship.   And when members acknowledge to any wrong-doing, whether perceived or actual, it is just that sort of honor and integrity which is the cornerstone of this guild.<br>

The theory goes, If you have two way of doing something, It's usually the Harder Way that is the right way. Ayuden could have choose the easy road and ignored what happened last night and today pretend that everything is ok. He choose the Harder Way and admitted his faults and asks his brothers and sisters for forgiveness.<br>
Now it's our turn...<br>
Do you as a Knight or Valor take the easy path and choose to condem? Or, do you choose the Harder Way and look for reasons to forgive and encourage? The theory of the Harder Right applies.<br>
&quot;Those without sin cast the first stone&quot; John 8:7<br>
No disrespect to any Knights of Valor, but none of us should be throwing rocks in this case. Not after Ayuden has exposed his own short comings.<br>
Leadership:<br>
IF you had qualities that would make an effective leader before this, than what you have learned can only enhance you abilities. People are going to make mistakes, there is no way around this. It's part of our growth process. What is important is learning from these and applying your new wisdom when the situtation arises again. That is the only thing that matters after the fact, and should be expected from others.<br>
Your actions are not of failure. Everybody falls, but it is a rare quality that a person can admit to ones failures and learn from them. This shows COURAGE, HONOR, and GREAT HEART. Everything that encompases a Knight of Valor.<br>

Ayuden I think what you did was right by camping. If the game gets frustrating or you get too angry, that is the best way.  I know how bad you can feel about it now, I had to camp unexpectly last night as well &amp; don't like to do that if CR's or Rezzes aren't done yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It has also happened several times to you that you come to our camp spot only to find that the party is breaking up =(  Very sorry for that, I think it's just a case of bad timing. But you are always wanted &amp; welcomed amoungst fellow knights. I personally hold you in high regard &amp; still think you have Officer qualities. I know others think the same of you. Your dedication to the guild &amp; your willingness to help others does not go unoticed. Hang in there bud. Loves ya lots *hugs*<br>

<br>
You have just ensured you have an enchanter and an ugly troll for as long as I play this game. That to you is a promise.<br>
<br>
I thank you all for replying and after taking today off from playing it was a very welcome and very needed ending to my evening to see these posts. You have all inspired me deeply and I thank you all for understanding the way I felt and for forgiving my selfishness. I am thankful that everything was successful despite my hasty decisions, a large burden lifted. I thank you more so that you have been able to find the good in what I do when I admit a wrong, this takes you beyond friends, it makes you family. A friend will tell you when you are wrong, but family, those who truely care, will tell you when you are wrong and help you to see how to grow. For this you are all commended. If there has ever been a more distinct group of honorable individuals than this composition of Knights I am oblivious. I would take any of you at any time as family because you have so dilligently displayed the willingness to be so. I love you all and long live the Knights of Valor as a system of honor, integrity, and character for us all.<br>
