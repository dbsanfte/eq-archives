The war had devestated so much land that even the most savage of creatures could no longer survive it's harsh climate for long. Tired and battered the group pushed on, it had been months since he had seen his son but Sylvers was determined not to give in. He refused to accept that a dark elf could simply walk in and take all he had created.<br>
 &quot;Hey slow down, you tryin to kill us or somethin?&quot; Kusac panted as his feet dragged after the shaman.<br>
 &quot;Kus is right Sylv, we've been on the move for over 12 hours now, let's stop and take a breather behind those rocks in the shade.&quot; Dariya, the half elf warrior had seen him like this before, and knew that the only way to stop him would be to reason with him, if there was still any reason left in him. The past couple months had been harsh, and they still wore the blood on them.<br>
  It started in Erud's Crossing, they had found the spirits and had begun the journey for the spear of the epic legends but upon returning to Qeynos Sylvers had learned that the dark elves had struck, hard, into Kunark and much of the continent was ablaze with war. The Iksars were forced into an alliance with the &quot;lights&quot;, the humans, elves, shorties to stop the legions of the dark army from taking complete controll over one of the largest continents in the world. The battle lines had been drawn from Warsilk Woods down to the Emerald Jungle. Innoruks legions had controll of 60% of Kunark and were quickly gaining allies with the Frogloks and Sarnaks. The travellers had learned that only days before Firona Vie had fallen after 2 weeks of bloody siege, no survivors had been reported yet. In shock Sylvers had sent word to Cabilis asking about his brood and what he could do to help. <br>
 Looking over the letter as they rested it tore into his chest like a dagger...<br>
 &quot;Mystic Sylvers of the Clan Bloodwynn<br>
It is with the deepest of hearts that I must inform you that your broodling, Sabans Bloodwynn was captured on the outskirts of the Essex War Academy in the Emerald Jungle on the 3rd day of the full moon in the year of the wolf. Your youngest daughter Alexiez is fighting at the frontlines in lake of ill oman and is said to be in good spirits. At this time the Mystic Council asks you and your group to help sabatoge the Dark Elvan alliance and possible force a hault in the invasion, to allow us the time to counterattack and force these vile retches right back into the water before they have a chance to reinforce their positions.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Sylv..put the letter down you know it can't help us now.&quot;<br>
Dariya said as she tried to comfort her friend. He looked up at her, staring deep, almost through her he folded the letter up and placed it inside his tunic. His eyes no longer green but a frost white, ribbling with mystical energies. She could see the hate that was now consuming his soul.<br>
&quot;We've rested enough, beyond this pass is South Ro and the gateway to Hate.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hey listen bigguy, I'm all for these suicide charges and all but do you really think it's smart for us to sneak into the gods house and retake the kid? Like shouldn't we go down to Erudin, catch some sun and sand an relax?&quot;<br>
Snarling crisply at Kusac was the only response he could give, he was going to get Sabans back if it killed him, and them.<br>
 Passing through merchants and gypsies they recieved more updates from the war, it didn't look good, the Dark armies had begun pressing the attack against Cabilis, the civilian population had been moved into Old Sebilis for protection, and a garrison from Kurns Tower moved up to help reinforce the lines but they were green troops, young and foolish. Word came that a dark elf spy in freeport had bombed the docks killing 13 people and severing the elves from Antonica. A patchwork group of warriors was heading to strike all across the world, a guild in Rathe was going to strike into the Plane of Hate, and hopefully force the Darks to pull back and try to reinforce what they had, an Iksar legion would strike out from Trakanons Teeth and hopefully strike into the flanks of the enemy liness, and an Elvan, Dwarf, Gnome armada of ships would lead to a landing outside Firona Vie hopefully allowing the recapture of the city.<br>
 &quot;Hey man, you see we don't have to go up there, let the armies fight it out we can go in for like cleanup.&quot;<br>
 Kusac through on his mock smile, like a scroll merchant.<br>
&quot;No, we go up and use their attack as a diversion.&quot;<br>
Setting up camp around what was left of the wizard spires, they set guard, knowing that one of the favorite targets of Ogre raiding parties was druid and wizard port ins. It didn't take long before the ambush was sprung.<br>
 &quot;Hay Boz, dere's some sofies near da spires.&quot;<br>
Half drunk, half asleep the ogre warrior shook his head, crawling forward he caught them in his view.<br>
 &quot;Oooo deh's got shinies, deh be rich! Wes eatin good tonight!&quot;<br>
Standing up and pointing towards the spires the Ogre called his men forward, as they stood up from the resting spots and began their charge they were greeted with a hail of arrows, the band of travellers having overheard the drunkin band had setup an ambush of their own using Sylvers and Kusac as bait, Dariya had crawled forward and sat in waiting, upon seeing the leader stand she took aim and fired. One dead, 2 wounded. Moving quickly Sylvers, Kusac and Kann the mystics pet, shot forward to join their ally. The fight was quick but bloody, Kusac having more fun using the Ogres as a punching bag. A flying kick was usually enough to seperate the neck from the spine. Another 2 dead. Sylvers was less tactful, standing infront of 3 the magical sparks began to grow around him, astonished by the light show the ogres paused, it was their last mistake, the rain of ice and poison peeled their armor off leaving nothing but a bloody pile of bones. Dariya still able to move in concealment had come in from behind, she liked combat close, warrior on warrior, blade vs blade, it was more personal like that. Bringing her axe down hard she tore into the ogres shield shattering it, swinging quickly she landed a kick into the beasts gut, before he knew it her blade was sitting firmly in his neck and the light slowly faded from his eyes. Another victory, more dead in a war that had already left millions dead or missing, it sickened them but they knew they were in the right this time.<br>
 It was two days before the guild from Rathe arrived, more news from the front, Freeport had closed it's walls to all in wake of the attack on the docks. The Militia had been sent to Neriak with orders to burn the city. Qeynos had freed to units to head into the Karanas were bandits had come together to announce their new independant kingdom, they had tortured and killed many of the Karanas residents who didn't agree. A troll army had been moved across the seas with the help of stolen gnome ships and had engaged the Dwarf home guard in Butcher, the battle was a standstill with both Troll and Dwarfs reporting heavy casualties and the Trolls having taken controll of the docks, if the Elvan armada that had already been sent out failed now they would have no where to return to.<br>
 Meanwhile in the Plane of Hate, prisioners from all over Norrath had been gathered before Innoruk the Prince of Hate.<br>
&quot;Welcome my future childern, you have been brought here to help me take back what is rightfully mine. You will be the second wave of my invasion I will give you powers beyond your dreams! Like the first elvan kings who I made into the dark elves I will now remake you into dark versions of your selves and you will move forth and bring death, destruction and fear to the world, freeing me to move into the other Planes and taking complete control.&quot;<br>
His maddening laughter haunted them. Sabans looked over the crowd, he could see people of all races and classes. No one he recognized though, his legion had been slaughtered, most of his classmates were dead or dying when he was captured. His last memory was seeing the academy burning as wave after wave of mystic energy slammed into the building that was as old as the iksar nation it's self. They weren't allowed to speak to each other, punishable with death, and writting was also strictly forbidden. The only news they recieved was the propoganda force fed into them from the Dark army. Sabans hoped what they taught him at the academy was true, that 90% of it was all lies and maybe the Iksars were fighting forward, maybe even striking into the heart of the Dark Elf alliance, sadly he was wrong. A bloody standstill was devestating moral and sabatoge from dark elf spies was doing as much damage as frontline combat. The Unified Army's generals knew that this raid was their one chance to break the stalemate and push the Dark's back, they hoped hitting them in so many places at once would break their &quot;invincibility&quot; illusion.<br>
 The battles began almost simaltaniously, the Dwarfs charged into Butcher Block with the help of a ranger unit from Felwithe, the Trolls didn't know what hit them, but the shock wasn't enough to prevent a flawless win, the trolls took two warriors for every one they lost, it was only the mass of numbers that had allowed the dwarfs to retake the docks. In freeport the milita had engaged the Dark Elfs but were forced back, Neriak forest was full of traps that left many wounded. The Iksars charged into the fray with a blood curdling howl, they were fighting to the death, after this there was no where to run so they had nothing to lose, one general noted that more iksars died on this day then had died in the past 5 weeks combined.<br>
   In South Ro<br>
The guild had gone up 2 hours before, Kusac, Dariya and Sylvers had finished gathering their equipment and snuck in behind them. Hate was full of the screams of the dead and dying. Or was it all an illusion? They didn't take the time to debate it, moving quickly towards Innoruks temple they could see the fighting going on all around them. The bodies of golems, specters, erudites, gnomes, warriors, clerics, everywhere. It smelled of death. Moving in the shadows the approched the temple and could see the evil transformations of Innoruks creations, the &quot;Second Wave&quot; as he called it was beginning, 1/3 of the prisoners had been transformed and had ran out to engage the invaders. Their powers still weak from the transformation process many died, but they took out many of the heros gathered to save them. The raid was near total collapse when Sylvers band struck. Moving into the transformation room they struck, Dariya and Kusac engaging the guards they were joined by some of the raid members, an enchanter who had known Sylvers when he was younger and her cleric friend, together Sausha and Joanna fought, healed, mez'd and did all they could to aid the group. Moving quickly and freeing the remaining prisoners attracted the attention of the Legions of Innoruk, turning from the raid they charged into the chamber with Sylvers group, the fight was bloody. Sylvers looked up to watch as Sabans blade struck deep into Joanna's chest, her corpse dropping to his feet. Lost in shock and anger Sylvers shot forward, short to spear, wolf to skeleton father and son fought.<br>
 &quot;Poor iksar, father has given us so much! Join us, we are the future of the world!&quot;<br>
Caught by surprize at the strength of his former child Sylvers was knocked back, slamming into a wall. Struggling to his feet only to watch another friend fall to Sabans, using his powerful necromanic energies the shadow knight placed a hand on Sausha's shoulder, watching her body tremple as pure necromanic power filled her body, then drained her spirit, she dropped dead.<br>
 Meanwhile the raid had finally gotten the upper hand with the help of the prisioners they had the legions of Hate on the run.<br>
&quot;Father is calling so I must go, but we'll see you soon. Just remember you have won here today, but tomorrow is a new day and we have waited a long time for our final victory.&quot;<br>
Sabans turned and began to run towards his dark allies. Gathering all his strength Sylvers picked up his spear, throwing it with all his might it tore through the sky with an unholy sound, striking through Sabans back it pierced out from his stomach, the magic locked inside it shattering the spear exploding spreading ice and metal throughout the former iksars body, he lay slumped over gasping for air. Sylvers collapsed unconsious, drained of all mana and most his health he felt death near. His last sight before passing out was Sabans shattered body being scooped up by a dark elf cleric and rushed to saftey. The raid gathered in the temple healed who they could, but mostly counted their dead before returning to the Southern Desert of Ro. Word spread quickly of the Unified Armies victories. the Iksars broke through the lines aided by the elves of the freshly liberated Firona Vie, the statue still standing strong, though damaged, they had recaptured a large portion of Kunark, the fragile Dark alliance broken and now fighting itself, the Sarnaks and Frogloks claiming territory for themselves. The trolls having lost so much in butcher block withdrew their warriors back to innuthule. The Ogres refushed to give in, war was in their blood and they would fight to the end. The Dark Elves had been trapped in Neriak, as the Unified Army of Antonica had surrounded them From Lava Storm to Kithicor with Freeport in the South and Rivervale's legion coming in from the west.<br>
 Resting in the inn at Freeport Sylvers awoke, it had been a month almost, his trance like state, almost a coma, as his body tried to rebuild it's mana resources. He learned that Sabans had survived and had been seen moving through Neriak forest. An even darker version of himself they now called him a Vampire, said to drain the souls of his victims after defeating them. Two batlike wings sprung from his back.<br>
 Though it was described as a victory Sylvers didn't see any reason to celebrate. He would dedicate his life to either saving his broodling, or destroying him. Ignoring calls to return to Cabilis to aid in the war effort there Sylvers recruited a band of heros to help him move into Kithicor. When Dariya and Kusac woke up they found their friend was missing.<br>
 &quot;Kusac we gotta find him! He'll get himself killed!&quot;<br>
Dariya pleaded.<br>
&quot;Hey babe, better him then us, what can we do anyways Neriak is a fortress, full of traps, monsters, spiders, and you know how I hate spiders!&quot;<br>
&quot;Is that a yellow streak I see going down your back Kusac? Sylvers is our friend and we have to help him, even if he doesn't want it..&quot;<br>
Kusac sighed, he hated when Dariya attacked his ego. He started to back his bag he knew this would be a long journey. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/ualtanna1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Altanna1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>KoV member</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/18/01 3:54:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Dark Child</span><hr size=1> Please say it's not finished.... :-)<br>
