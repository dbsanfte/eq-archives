------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
GC Raid and Looting Rules (for parties of 2 or more groups)<br>
<br>
Raid Rules:<br>
<br>
Pre raid<br>
Please be at the meeting place on time or early. There are a substantial<br>
number of people who will be late, and if you are on a reserve list and<br>
there on time, you might just get one of the late people's spot, if you are<br>
on the group list, be early, or at worst, on time. If the raid leader has to<br>
fill a lot of empty group slots, it could take up to an hour to work it all<br>
out.<br>
Please be sure to bring the food/water/spell component supplies that you<br>
will need.<br>
<br>
Some of the loot from the raid might be given to a specific person. If this<br>
is going to occur, the raid organizer should make that clear before the raid<br>
starts, preferably as part of the announcement for the raid.<br>
<br>
Respect your raid personnel, they are probably swamped with tells. Ask your<br>
group leader your questions first. If they cannot answer you, they can<br>
probably refer you to the person that can answer your question. If you have<br>
issues with the way things are bring run, please bring them up on the<br>
message boards after the raid. If you berate the raid leader during the raid<br>
about something you think is unfair, don’t be surprised when you are not<br>
invited back or asked to leave, even if you were right! If you have<br>
immediate concerns, please send a tell to the Raid leader with your concerns<br>
in a calm and courteous manner. You will be treated with the same respect or<br>
lack thereof as you give out.<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
Use your Hot key to assist MA<br>
Wait for MA to shout before engaging<br>
Only MA breaks mes<br>
Keep chatter down on /ooc and don’t use /shout<br>
Only Group Leaders check for Loot<br>
Loot goes to the Loot master<br>
One loot per customer<br>
If you’re disruptive, you will be asked to leave.<br>
<br>
The Raid itself<br>
Assisting:<br>
Please insure you know who the main assist (MA) and second assist (SA) are<br>
and set up hot keys for both. Please understand that if MA goes down or Link<br>
Dead (LD) in a fight, the SA will be promoted to MA and take on all the<br>
duties of MA until the original MA comes back. Assuming that Grumm is<br>
announced as MA, your hotkey should read something like /assist Grumm or<br>
/ass gru if you are lazy like me. Please do not add a comment to your assist<br>
hotkey, we don’t need to see 36 people spamming us with /ooc assisting Grumm<br>
with this %T. We should all be assisting all the time. It should be second<br>
nature.<br>
<br>
Use that assist hotkey:<br>
Do not press f8. Do not target with your mouse. If you need to acquire a<br>
target, press your assist hotkey that you made. If you do not use that<br>
assist kotkey, you will get yourself killed and probably take an enchanter<br>
and shaman with you.<br>
<br>
There are some exceptions to this rule:<br>
If you are an enchanter or otherwise in a crowd control role on the raid,<br>
you may target however you darn well please. If you are in a debuffing role,<br>
it is important to get the MA’s target debuffed first. After that is<br>
accomplished, you can start debuffing any mob that has been successfully<br>
Mesmerised (mes) or otherwise stopped. Damage breaks mes. Debuffs do not<br>
break mes. If you are in a debuff role on the raid, usually only Shaman and<br>
Enchanters, you may target and debuff a mob that has been successfully mesed<br>
without using your assist key. If you are not sure you are an exception to<br>
the always assist rule, please send a tell to your raid leader or someone he<br>
has designated to answer questions.<br>
<br>
Wait for the MA to shout:<br>
The main assist will be making hotkeys to /shout out their targets,<br>
something like /shout smashing %T &gt;&gt;&gt; which when pressed would come out:<br>
Grumm shouts ‘Smashing &gt;&gt;’. If you are SA, please have your hotkey ready,<br>
but don’t use it unless the MA goes down.<br>
<br>
Only MA breaks mes:<br>
If you break mes and you are not MA, you have probably just gotten an<br>
enchanter or shaman killed and you are the next on the list. Mes, slows and<br>
other debuffs are a huge taunt. The MA will be taunting for 5-15 seconds in<br>
an attempt to get to the top of the MOB’s hate list before he breaks mes. It<br>
is very important that you wait for the MA to shout the target. Once the<br>
main assist has shouted his attack, you may unload the firey wrath of<br>
heavens on that poor unsuspecting MOB (mobile object, or soon to be dead<br>
thing)<br>
<br>
Sometimes MA will be forced to change targets:<br>
Sometimes in PoH we will get a delayed pull and all the sudden we will have<br>
a spite golem beating on us. There are mobs out there that cannot be mesed.<br>
If you see the MA shout his target again, please hit your assist hotkey<br>
again. OK, you did it? You hit your assist key again? Well do it 2 more<br>
times to be sure. You can hit your hotkey anytime you are somehow unsure<br>
that you are on the correct target. Re-assisting is a good habit to get<br>
into. There might be a rare occasion that we get 2 unmessable MOBs at the<br>
same time. In this instance, it is permissible for the SA to target the<br>
additional MOB and tank it while the first is being killed. Unless you<br>
happen to be the SA, or the SA’s cleric, this will not concern you… please<br>
continue to beat the living snot out of the MA’s target.<br>
<br>
/shout:<br>
Raid Leader, MA, SA, Loot master, Raid Police. If you are not on that list,<br>
please do not use shout unless we have an emergency that jeopardizes the<br>
entire raid. You may use /ooc, but please try to keep the chatter down,<br>
especially during periods of heavy action or when the Raid Leader is trying<br>
to communicate. If you are a group leader and your group gets a kill, you<br>
can use shout to call the loot, some raid leaders prefer to reserve the<br>
/auction channel for calling loot. Which brings us too:<br>
<br>
Pets:<br>
Pets have the tendency to mess things up for the enchanters. i.e.: I have my<br>
skeleton pet up, I assist and send my pet to attack the main assist’s<br>
target. I sit down and an additional MOB (add) shows up out of nowhere and<br>
hits me. That add gets mesed, but my pet remembers that I got hit. Anytime<br>
during that fight, my pet could decide that it hates that add that hit me a<br>
while ago and it will run over and hit it, waking it up. This gets the<br>
enchanter, then my pet, and then myself killed. Pets and mes don’t mix well.<br>
I do understand that some of you can control your pets better than that, I<br>
can too, but I don’t put one up unless asked. There is too much to loose if<br>
you make just one mistake with your pet and it usually does not merit the<br>
risk. Anytime that you have the chance at getting more than one MOB in a<br>
raid situation you should leave the pet at home. Mages can Nuke and Necros<br>
can help the enchanters with Crowd control and do their very low resist<br>
lifetap line to help deal the damage.<br>
<br>
DoTs:<br>
Damage over Time, a necro’s best friend. Sorry, my dark brothers, for the<br>
most part, DoT’s are not allowed in raid situations and here is why. If the<br>
MA has to switch targets, the old target can be put to sleep by the<br>
enchanters, but not if it has a DoT on it. The damage every tick will wake<br>
it back up, making it very angry at both you and the enchanter that is<br>
trying to mes it, yet another situation where both you and the enchanter<br>
ends up dead.<br>
<br>
Loot!:<br>
I knew you put up with all those rules for a reason. If you are a group<br>
leader, you will check the loot for your group if you get a kill. If you are<br>
not a group leader, you will not check loot unless directly asked to by the<br>
Raid leader or Loot master. If you are a group leader, and do not want the<br>
chore of checking loot, please assign the duty to one of your group that you<br>
trust.<br>
<br>
OK, you are a group leader and just checked a Boogyman’s dead and twitching<br>
body. On the body are: a blighted robe (necromancer, no drop), a Blue<br>
Diamond, Words of Bondage and Ruby Crown. You need to /shout Necro Robe and<br>
BD on Boogie. No drop items, rare gems and rare droppable items get called<br>
out. Cash loot, research components and other weird things do not need to be<br>
called. You will get to know what needs to be called and what can be ignored<br>
after a while, that is why the Raid leader tries to pick seasoned experts as<br>
the group leaders. If that Boogyman only had a sapphire necklace on it, you<br>
could call out /shout Boogie-MT. MT is short for Empty. All cash loot and<br>
droppable items should go to the Loot master. The Loot master’s job is to<br>
rout all that loot to the correct people and to call for rolls when they are<br>
appropriate. Please do not random unless the Loot master has instructed you<br>
to. It is disruptive.<br>
<br>
Clerics and Enchanter will get most of the cash loot to cover the costs of<br>
buying Peridots to Symbol and Rune you guys to keep you alive. One peridot<br>
is 10pp, and they will go through more that one stack a night on a raid.<br>
<br>
Rare Gems will be rolled on at the very end of the raid. If you won<br>
something during the raid, you will not be rolling for the rare gems. My<br>
goal is to have everyone leave with something from the raid. It is not<br>
frequently met. The Rare gems are Blue Diamond (BD), Diamond, Jacinth, and<br>
Black Sapphire (BS). All other gems are considered cash loot and will be<br>
given to the clerics and enchanters to cover buffing expenses.<br>
<br>
Research components and craft skill items will be distributed as the Loot<br>
master sees fit.<br>
<br>
The Loot master will call for rolls on no drop items as soon as possible<br>
after the drop. If you win a no drop item, please do not expect get to roll<br>
again until all of your class has won a similar item. i.e.: the cleric<br>
bracer drops and you win it, if the cleric BP drops later and the other<br>
cleric on the raid has not won anything, they will be taking it home with<br>
them. Once all of a class has won an item from their class armour, all can<br>
roll again.<br>
<br>
Sometimes one member of a class is LD or has been killed when there has been<br>
a drop for their class. It is a Group Leader’s responsibility to make the<br>
Loot master aware if you have a LD or dead person that should get a roll. In<br>
most cases, the Raid Leader or Group Leader will roll in place of the<br>
missing person. The preferred method is to get the person in question<br>
resurrected so they can roll for themselves. If be chance a LD person does<br>
win a roll by proxy, they will have 5 minutes to get back in game and loot<br>
their prize. After 5 minutes the next highest roll should win.<br>
<br>
Reserves that come up after the break is done: we have a one hour no looting<br>
rule. Some raiding guilds have a 2 hour rule, some have no rule. I believe<br>
that the people that worked hard to break the plane, typically the riskiest<br>
time of the raid, should be rewarded with a little bit better odds to get<br>
the loot that drops. This one hour rule also insures that the following<br>
situation never occurs: reserves are brought up, the mage robe drops. There<br>
are 2 mages one that has been there working hard for hours and the one that<br>
just spent 10 mins. They roll off and the 10 min mage wins and decided that<br>
he is done for the night and gates out. You have to contribute at LEAST an<br>
hour to an endeavor to be considered for loot. This rule can be waived at<br>
the raid leader's discretion, but woe to the raid leader who finds himself<br>
in that hypothetical situation.<br>
<br>
Raids have more than one part:<br>
There are 5 distinct parts of a raid. Group making, the Break, the Raid,<br>
sometimes an Epic battle, and the Loot handout.<br>
<br>
Group making is long and boring for everyone except the group maker. That<br>
poor sot is being hammered with 3 tells per second and has to try to write<br>
people’s information down and form balanced groups at the same time This<br>
will take between 10 and 90 minutes.<br>
<br>
The Break is perhaps the time of most uncertainty and excitement. This can<br>
be a very chaotic time, with some going link dead, feeling disoriented upon<br>
zoning in and running the wrong way, perhaps MA and SA both go down and no<br>
one is sure what is going on. All kinds of room for failure here. The key<br>
thing to remember on a planes break is to keep your enchanters alive. They<br>
will be working overtime to get any MOBs under control. They will be risking<br>
their lives so that all may live. If the enchanters stay alive, we will win.<br>
The second key thing is to listen carefully to the directions for the break.<br>
The raid leader may call for everyone to be invis, or perhaps there will be<br>
specific instructions on where to run to when you zone in. The break takes<br>
from 20 minutes to 2 hours.<br>
<br>
The Raid takes from 3-12 hours to get though depending on stamina, people<br>
leaving, availability of reserves and how fast we can plow through the MOBs.<br>
<br>
The Epic Fight is another part that does not always occur. They will be<br>
taken on only if we have the proper manpower to take the MOB down. This part<br>
usually takes around an hour. Epic parts will be open roll for the class<br>
that needs them. Sometimes a raid will be run to get a specific person a<br>
specific epic part, if this is the case, it will be part of the raid<br>
announcement and that person will get part without a roll.<br>
<br>
The loot takes a while to get through as well. We will either do loot after<br>
the last pull is finished, or we will all evacuate to Toxx forest and meet<br>
at the bridge for rolls on droppable things and rare gems. Some of the key<br>
players in the raid might be awarded a rare gem without having to roll. They<br>
worked hard for you, please respect the Loot master and Raid Leader in the<br>
calls they have made. The loot handout takes from 10 minutes to an hour.<br>
<br>
Specific to Plane of Hate:<br>
The meeting spot for Plane of Hate (PoH) is traditionally the Wizzie Spires<br>
in South Ro. It costs 250pp per group to go up to hate. This is for the Soul<br>
stones that the raid leader buys in Neriak. You need one stone(250pp) per<br>
group that is going up, and at least 3 extras, for emergencies. Once in<br>
Hate, there is no evac, if a fight goes very badly, we will call CLERICS<br>
CAMP NOW. When the train is done, they can come back and res us all. After<br>
all cleric have camped out safely, you may attempt to camp out as well, in<br>
that situation .As a general Rule after clerics have camped, please log on<br>
as an alternate character (if you lived) and give the raid leader a tell.<br>
The raid leader should set his /AFK message to something like “Safe to log<br>
back in” or “Not safe to log back in”.<br>
<br>
Specific to the Plane of Fear:<br>
The meeting spot for Plane of Fear (PoF) is traditionally the PoF Portal in<br>
the specter cave in Ferrott. BTW invis vs. undead does not work against<br>
those specters and they have to be cleared.<br>
<br>
Loot Rules: (overall)<br>
1. One person will be designated as the only looter in each group. After the<br>
kill they will immediately loot the corpse and call out in /ooc the contents<br>
of corpse to include negative contents. It is paramount that this is<br>
immediate as to avoid decay of items. If you are the looter, the only<br>
exception to this is when you get the kill on a mob that may drop your class<br>
specific armor. DO NOT loot your class mobs. When this happens you will<br>
designate a person (of a different class) to loot the corpse and the above<br>
procedure will then apply to them for the contents of this mob.<br>
<br>
2. All rolls on items will be based on a random roll with a range of numbers<br>
decided in advance by the raid leader(s). People will be designated to give<br>
calls for rolls and classes affected, and only those designated as such<br>
shall make these calls. This is to prevent erroneous looting.<br>
<br>
3. Rare Gems (i.e. Blue Diamonds, Diamonds, Jacinth, etc) will be held by<br>
one designated person until the end of raid. At this time the group leaders<br>
will roll for the gems. The winners will then in turn take the group back<br>
and do rolls among the group for the loot. If the group leader wins more<br>
than one, the group member that wins one is out of the next group roll,<br>
until everyone in the group has won. In the event that one or more person<br>
must leave the raid early, the rare gems collected thus far shall be rolled<br>
for in the above manner, and this shall be repeated at each such juncture.<br>
This rule final part of this rule may be made exception to in such cases as<br>
that those leaving have only been present for a short time, or other<br>
unforeseen circumstance.<br>
<br>
4. Cash Loot: (i.e. Ruby Crown, Plat Emerald Ring, etc.) will be held by one<br>
designated person. At the end of raid the cash loot will be divided evenly<br>
among the clerics as to compensate for cost of buffing components. If one or<br>
more cleric needs to leave at a point before the raid ends, the cash loot<br>
collected thus far should be distributed at that point. In the event that<br>
there is not enough cash loot to distribute to all the clerics, the raid<br>
leader(s) should decide on a manner in which to randomly decide the<br>
distribution.<br>
<br>
5. Class Armor: You are entitled to win only one piece of class armor until<br>
all of your class has a piece. What does this mean to you? You need to<br>
decide if you want to roll on the bracer and take a chance that the BP will<br>
not drop. On the other hand, if all present pass on an item, it will then be<br>
decided by open roll and only in a case such as this will this piece not<br>
count towards class armor and the winner allowed to roll on the next drop.<br>
(shields are included as class armor)<br>
<br>
6. Weapons: Will be rolled on by classes that can use the weapon and are not<br>
counted towards any other type of rolls. The manner of rolling for weapons<br>
shall follow the same rules applied to class armor, though considered<br>
separately from those, categorically.<br>
<br>
7. Epic items: These are always class specific open roll, regardless of<br>
previous winnings unless otherwise stated (i.e. going for the specific<br>
purpose of helping a person to complete the epic quest)<br>
<br>
8. God Loot: This is also always class specific open roll, regardless of<br>
previous winnings, unless otherwise stated (i.e. going for the specific<br>
purpose of helping a person to complete the epic quest)<br>
