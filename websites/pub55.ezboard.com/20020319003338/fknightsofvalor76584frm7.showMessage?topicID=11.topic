<br>
The dark healer could hardly believe the company she was with on this particular enchanted night.  Next to her was a woodsman, one of the savage bloods that found their abodes in the trees.  What she would consider one of her mortal enemies.  He was a sword wielder, two, for he used one in each hand, a talent only the most combat trained of her own dark skinned race was able to master.  His seemingly comfortable, even expert use of those twin blades did impress her, though it did little to ease the ancient emnity between their two races.<br>
<br>
Ever since her early teachings in the temples underground, she had learned that her race, and only her race was supreme, that they would one day come out of their underground city and come to rule the surface world under their iron hand.  It was also her tiny part in that grand scheme to be one of the healing arts.  She studied and slaved so many countless nights and through her young seasons intense with the blood of countless victims who did not understand, she became a master in her art, even near the ability to bring back the dead.  And dead she would see on this night.  For she had little love for that savage blooded one.  Nor the stocky mountain dweller, nor the thief, nor the northsman with his huge stature towering over her.<br>
<br>
She perhaps hated that one the most, for he was from the northlands, and though they were not considered a mortal enemy of her dark origins, they stood for a form of justice she did not care for.  Peering at him through emerald green eyes filled with hate she saw that he was a few seasons below her.  But that did not mean he would be easy to down in a battle, should that occur.  Those witch doctors from the northern lands used a magic she had no knowledge of, and his powerful physic alone would prove highly dangerous.  The mountain dweller, so short and stocky, she also had little love for.  They were allies with the fairer sylvan races and this particular one was a warrior, more advanced than she, and also quite dangerous with the weaponry he so skillfully wielded.<br>
<br>
Surveying the rest of the lead party, she noticed a short, stocky warrior, a human who was a master at fighting with her bare hands, and one other that kept to the shadows.  The human intrigued her.  The dark healer always thought fighting with weapons forged of iron much more effective whether enchanted or not, than using her bare hands, but that human and her many years of simply staying alive proved otherwise.  And her dark race had no concept of battle with fists and feet alone.<br>
<br>
The dark healer looked down at herself, partially hiding her disgust at both those around her and herself for being in such company, but also to fill her vision with her own dark sylvan features in hopes to drive away those others, if for just a brief moment.  She also reminded herself that on this night they were not here to due battle, or more specifically, not to due battle with one another, but to attempt to down a very dangerous creature that threatened all of them equally.  A very old wyrm inhabited the mountains north of her homeland.  And his proximity to her race proved more dangerous than to any of the others assembled.  Yet it was not possible for her race alone to destroy him, at least not with the intense internal fighting and competition for rank and station that kept their numbers limited.  She reminded herself once again, that this night, this meeting, and this venture would be for the greater good, that is, the greater good of her dark race.<br>
<br>
The dark healer shot the savage one a sly smile.  At least she took comfort in that those with her held nearly the same emnity as she did for them.  And her position was not overly distasteful.  She was the sole member of the healing arts within their party.  This group was the initial charge group, the shock troops that would rush in to the lord wyrm first.  And it was all of their lives she held in her dark hands.  She more than once entertained the notion of leaving one or another to die at the mighty claws of the wyrm in his abode of fire and flame, but sadly, she depended on them to keep her alive as much as they did her.  And the dark healer had no intention of making this her last hunt.<br>
<br>
That atmosphere was getting heavy.  There was tension eminating from the small army of all races and various arts assembling for the charge.  Being in a cave deep without the mountains of fire and flame made her extremely uncomfortable, as she could feel her body fighting to keep cool beneath those magically enhanced gold plates that protected her.  She wondered if those plates would protect her against the powerful claws of the lord wyrm and did entertain thoughts of removing some of that armor for more comfort.  But a nude dark elf, though cooler, would be little aid on a venture of this magnitude, except perhaps to distract the wyrm.  And the dark healer did not survive her many combat seasons by being so foolish.<br>
<br>
Hearing the command to charge, the healer rushed into the lava hallowed chambers following the five other members of the lead group.  For the first time she saw the lord in all his magnificence, as he slowly turned to face these new intruders into his abode.  And for a brief moment, she locked eyes with the lord and could feel his own rage born of countless ages of his existence on this world nearly imprisoned within this place of fire and flame, which so stunningly matched the reddish tinge of his powerfully muscled body in all its fiery splendor.  Barely noticing the curling back of scaley lips to expose rows of fangs each one larger than her lithe form, the healer was torn from her allurement by a wave of searing heat as a blast of flame engulfed her entire party.  Raising her shield while rolling to one side to somehow decrease the intensity of the inferno, she noticed half the lead party was in flames while they held their charge and started picking apart the lord's mighty front paws while scoring a few good hits on his soft underbelly.<br>
<br>
Struggling futily to keep the lead group up and fighting, the healer could not possibly keep up with the amount of carnage given from the lord's powerful talons and his ferocious jaws.  Mercifully it would be a bit before he could again engulf them all in flames.  None too soon, the second party charged to join into the fray sending their swords and spears into the lord wyrm.  Seeing the size of him and the seemingly toy weapons in comparison, it did not look to the healer like they would be of much effect. But the wyrm was injured as his front paws were nearly shredded as if by an army of vermin each with their tiny bites and stings.<br>
<br>
The healer was losing her battle to keep her group alive as one after another fell due to multiple wounds ironically cauterized from bleeding by the intense flames coming from the wyrms gigantic maw.  As the lead group was falling around her, the wyrm was hit by several blasts of azure blue lightning boring into him leaving residue arcane energies channelling down his powerful flanks.  The casters finally joined in hurling an arsenal of death and destructive magics into the lord wyrm.  The healer dearly fought to overcome her own urge of casting her own destructive spells into the creature.  The sight of the mortally wounded beast combined with the stench of the burnt and smoldering bodies of the fallen, the internal rage of losing her group for their differences no longer seemed to matter, and also her own bloodlust dripping with bitter venum, she was barely able to hold herself in check.  Steadfastedly she reminded herself, &quot;I am a healer, I am to keep people alive.  It is for them to down the wyrm.&quot;<br>
<br>
The lord staggered from a multitude of blasts by the few remaining casters as it filled the high vaulted cavern with a deafening roar of defiance at its own mortality.  With several mighty sweeps of its blood drenched claws in an attempt to take as many hunters with it into the great beyond, the lord wyrm thundered to the lava hallowed rock ground.<br>
<br>
Overcome by an odd passion that nearly consumed her consciousness, the healer screamed her own rage at the heavens that such a magnificent creature had to die.  For who was she to aid to destroy such a mighty beast?  Turning threateningly upon what was left of her own party, she barely held her offensive energies in check while sending an ice driven stare full of rage at the would be murderers sorrounding her.<br>
<br>
But it was over.  The dark healer was glad the wyrm was dead, yet angry that she partook in its destruction.  The mighty lord of the mountains of fire and flame who lived for countless generations before she walked this world was reduced to a broken, bleeding, and lifeless corpse.<br>
<br>
With the death of the wyrm, her own bloodlust abandoned her, leaving a peaceful calm as if in some dream as she surveyed the battlefield.  It took several moments for her to register the magnitude of the carnage as bodies upon bodies of the fallen littered the ground.  They had succeeded, but barely.  Very few of the original assembled were still alive.  Slowly the healer resigned herself to her duties, perhaps the most important reason she was on this venture, to bring back the fallen.  For once in her life of passionate hate, she did not care who or what she would bring back.  Savage, mountain dweller, northsman, rogue, it did not matter to her.  Only that she had to bring them back.  The ceremony to return them to life seemed to take days as the healer and several others as advanced as her systematically worked on one, rested, then moved onto the next.  But even that was finally done.<br>
<br>
Staring at her original party in her fatigue induced stupor, which allowed for one of her more mischievious natures to show, the dark healer wondered if she could come to have feelings a bit less than pure ire.  Some of them certainly were elegant in an exotic fashion.  But her passions born of dark evils were the very source and foundations of her power, and in it, there was no room for courtship with any member of a fairer race.  To do so would be risking doom with her dark deity.  Her race, though they knew lust unbridled, had little concept of a gentleness termed &quot;love&quot;, shared by those races that did not walk the nights.  Staring again at her form, she reminded herself that she was a dark one, and they of the light.  They would never understand her, nor she them.<br>
<br>
Turning away in her own disgust, with the most regal bearing her exhausted body could muster, the dark healer stormed out of the hall. <br>
<br>

<br>
Not so long ago, I was on a very well planned raid, specifically in the charge group to take down Lord Nagafen.  So well planned and organized was the raid, that I thought to write this up as my small contribution to their efforts.  The guild leader of the FB enjoyed the tale, along with several others his members wrote I am certain, and decided to make a new fictional section for his site.  Since I took two of my tales that I posted on the old KoV site and copied them to his, it was only fair that I take this tale from there and copy it here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/ujenaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jenaria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>KoV member</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/11/01 5:47:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Speaking of older stories!</span><hr size=1> Hey Lashandra!<br>
