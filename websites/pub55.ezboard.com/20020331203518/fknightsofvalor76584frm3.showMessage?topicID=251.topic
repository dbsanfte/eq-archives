<br>
It was brought to my attention that my attitude and abrasive personality has grown tiresome to the other fine members of this guild.<br>
<br>
First and foremost, I need to apologize for my attitude and for my undesirable conduct as of late.  It's unnecessary and unwarranted.  It's definitely not aimed at any one person or group of people.  It's purely personal and obviously I need to get over it.<br>
<br>
Now, an explanation...<br>
<br>
I try hard to enjoy this game.  I use it as an escape.  I use it to have fun.  I use it to wind down after a bad day or as a crescendo to a good day.  I use it to visit with friends.  I use it to kill time.  I use it as entertainment - <br>
<br>
I'm sure you all use Everquest for similar or different reasons alltogether.  <br>
<br>
The frustration is that I look forward to getting on and playing.  A guild is a group of people that enjoy each others company.  They hunt together, they quest together, they die together.  I would do all of that for any of you at most any time.  I'm sure you know that.  Level be darned, if there's room, I'm going to come.  When I get on and try to find a group, try to encourage getting something going, suggest a place to go - AND it doesn't happen it sucks.  <br>
<br>
Tonight, I was planning on going to Kael.  I volunteered and my darn ISP crashed.  SO, when I logged on, I was ready to come join.  Then I was promptly told, &quot;Good luck, it's full.&quot;  Well, you better believe I was disappointed.  Yet again, my plans fell through.<br>
<br>
Yes, I might be feeling sorry for myself.  Yes, I might be overreacting.  Yes, I need to step back and realize this is a game.  However, this is a game I enjoy, and I enjoy it with you guys as a whole...<br>
<br>
So, that being said - I would challenge the Knights of Valor to try to hunt together when possible.  Should you accept that challenge, I will challenge myself to lighten up.  Take the good with the bad.  Realize that a hairyfooted halfling isn't always wanted around.  <br>
<br>
I hope you guys can understand what I've said - <br>
<br>
I look forward to hearing back from all my brothers and sisters on this matter - your thoughts and opinions are appreciated and asked for.<br>
<br>
Should you wish to share an opinion with me that you don't want to post - send me mail...  krag6@charter.net - I will read and respond.  If you want to call me, send me a mail and we'll setup a time.<br>
<br>
I enjoy you all and I hope that I can be enjoyable to be around...From now on...<br>
<br>
Remember, tomorrow is a new day.  I'm going to go at this looking forward - Why don't you join me?<br>

<br>
Ayuden had a situtation that mirrors yours in many ways. The bottom line of it was: We all make mistakes, but as long as we learn from the mistakes, they can only make us better as a person. If you don't mind, read what I posted for Ayuden. Again, we all make mistakes. What you have done is recognize it and choose to improve from it. Congrats to you!<br>
(errr, just remove Ayuden's name and replace it with yours.  hehe)<br>
<br>
******************************************<br>
<br>
Has anybody ever heard the theory of the Harder Right?<br>
The theory goes, If you have two way of doing something, It's usually the Harder Way that is the right way. Ayuden could have choose the easy road and ignored what happened last night and today pretend that everything is ok. He choose the Harder Way and admitted his faults and asks his brothers and sisters for forgiveness.<br>
Now it's our turn...<br>
Do you as a Knight or Valor take the easy path and choose to condem? Or, do you choose the Harder Way and look for reasons to forgive and encourage? The theory of the Harder Right applies.<br>
&quot;Those without sin cast the first stone&quot; John 8:7<br>
No disrespect to any Knights of Valor, but none of us should be throwing rocks in this case. Not after Ayuden has exposed his own short comings.<br>
Leadership:<br>
IF you had qualities that would make an effective leader before this, than what you have learned can only enhance you abilities. People are going to make mistakes, there is no way around this. It's part of our growth process. What is important is learning from these and applying your new wisdom when the situtation arises again. That is the only thing that matters after the fact, and should be expected from others.<br>
Your actions are not of failure. Everybody falls, but it is a rare quality that a person can admit to ones failures and learn from them. This shows COURAGE, HONOR, and GREAT HEART. Everything that encompases a Knight of Valor.<br>
/em salutes Ayuden<br>

Your post was probably one of the best written ones I've read in a long time though, speaking from just the reader's viewpoint you have a real gift with words. <br>
<br>
As for the content: <br>
<br>
Bascomb = Craig..<br>
<br>
Craig = Human  <br>
<br>
Shaluk = Justin<br>
<br>
Justin = Perfection on two legs, God's gift to womankind,The great redeemer, Holder of the sacred TV remote, The omniscient one, Spinner of worlds, Destroyer of nations, Cat enthusiast, and The kicker of arses belonging to anyone who makes fun of me for liking cats. <br>
<br>
With all that pressure, I still make mistakes bud.. I know for a dang sure fact I'm annoying at times.. Kinda get a certain thrill out of it in a wierd pre-adolescent sort of way. /shrug    It's human nature to get ticked off when something happens that we don't like.  Go with the flow man.  <br>
<br>
EQ is for me personally the way to do things I could never do in real life.. We live in a world where there is a set and accepted way of doing things.. Shaluk is my way of thinking or acting &quot;outside the box&quot;.  Whatever pops into my head, I share.. If I feel like doing something, I do it...  Most of the time this comes across as totally meaningless babble in Guild Chat and behavior that causes people to flee for fear of catching rabies. <br>
<br>
So what?  As long as it doesn't hurt anyone or put people in a disagreeable mood, I'm more than happy to share how I feel  And you should be too.. Am I saying bitch and complain all the time? Nah, of course not.. But that doesn't mean you should give yourself a coronary holding things in while trying to &quot;lighten up&quot; <br>
<br>
Be yourself.  I personally like that guy named Bascomb.. He's a dr00d, but you can't blame someone for something like that.. With some work, and if you stop trying to make out with the trees, we'll have you casting Ice Comet and summoning familiars yet! Just you watch and see <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Right now is a high stress time for people.. For those trying to make luclin work, and for those who don't have luclin who are getting frustrated at those of us that do ...we get to go play where they can't!.. hehe.. and those that just can't get the game cause its not sold where they are yet or its sold out.. etc etc. or their pc's can't handle it... And those that are frustrated at the lag factors, the LD's and the foreverzoneing syndrom.  Take a step back.. relax.. walk away from the computer.. It will get better... each patch makes things worse or better(hopefully better).. and things will get back to normal soon enough... <br>
<br>
There are a lot of people out there LFG because their guild mates are all playing in Maidens end or the fungus grove... But also look at it as a chance to take over those high camped places.   Like today for example. Kael.  I was in kael for 3 hours. there was 5 people there the entire time!.. Arena. here we come. hehe. Or Seb.. or any of the Exp hunting grounds.. they are all deserted!.. <br>
<br>
Its time to have fun peeps.. try not to leave your guild mates behind.. ... on 90% of all raids I ever ran for you guys.. If I could.. I always made room for the extras that showed up... formed short groups or just made a whole new one.. only when i got past 7 groups did i ever say enough was enough.. there is no reason to tell your guildmates they can't come.. full up.....  make room:P <br>
<br>
There is nothing worse in eq than a player that feels useless to their guild because they can never get a group, or can't get on raids cause they aren't needed... This is how my last guild lost me...  please. don't make the same mistake with the friends you have around you.  You might sign on one day and that person is no longer there.  Take the time to look around.. Someone is looking for something to do. .your not doing anything... speak up.. say HEY X whacha doin.. wanna kill a spider? giggle....<br>
<br>
Right now is the worse time for conflicts in the guild and among friends.. ITs the holidays!!!&gt; holidays are stressful enough with Xmass, new years, family and everything else that is going on in their real lives..their Eq life should be their fun time away with friends that care about them and people to play with.  Make the most of it folks!... If someone seems frustrated during this time of great stress.. gently take them in hand.. aim them at the nearest giant you see and say KILL IT!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Happy holidays from your guildmate and long time friend.<br>

Craig is right. We all come here to escape something, or whatever. I would rather be in Norrath or Luclin or hell, Karnor's than anyplace in real life. Heck I would rather be in EC fighting with noob's about the price of Tanna's jewelry. Bottom line is it's a game. It's for fun. Let's have fun.<br>

The best thing is that we have friends here who think enough of us to put up with temporary losses of judgement, and welcome us back with open arms.<br>
How often does THAT happen in the real world?<br>
