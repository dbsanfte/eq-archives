impromptu or epic quest raids that we can do and schedule or attempt without<br>
the aid or backing of Grey Coalition)<br>
1.) Follow GC Raid and Loot Rules (see GC Loot rules)<br>
   a.)  Keep in mind that any raid that is planned in advance that will<br>
require more than 2 groups to complete MUST be posted as a GC raid on that<br>
board per our agreement in good faith with the Grey Coalition. If only one<br>
or two groups are needed, but more show up, that is fine, but we will still<br>
abide by GC raid and loot rules to keep ongoing consistency.<br>
2.) We will adhere to Need Before Greed (NBG) in ALL instances:<br>
   a.)  For all zone raids (other than epic and class-specific quest raids),<br>
Knights and invited friends in attendance will have equal roll on any item<br>
that drops that their class can use for the character that they are there<br>
hunting with at the time.<br>
   b.)  If there is no need of an item in that a currently owned item is<br>
superior to what has dropped and they would never use the item for their<br>
main in attendance, it should be rolled for by those of the class who can<br>
use the item, who are there, and for whom it would benefit from the use of<br>
more, rather than to just be sold or handed to an alt or friend's character.<br>
In other words, those who have participated in the raid effort should<br>
rightfully benefit first from drops made while they were there.<br>
   c.)  If a drop item is looted and no one of the class who can use it are<br>
in attendance, the whole party in attendance may roll for the item, provided<br>
they have not won another non-class-specific drop item during that raid.<br>
   d.)  No-drop items will, of course, only be rolled for by those in<br>
attendance who can loot and use the item for the character they are hunting<br>
there with.<br>
       1.)  If we are hunting in a zone in which there are no-drop items<br>
(i.e. Skyshrine~Guardian armor, etc), and an alternate character has been<br>
brought beforehand and &quot;parked&quot; in the zone, they MAY roll for a no-drop<br>
item that has dropped IF there is no one else who can loot and use the item<br>
for their main in attendance.  That roll would then be only between those<br>
who have alternates close enough to be able to loot right away and without<br>
disrupting the raid in process.  The raid leader will be the final judge of<br>
for whom and when this will be applicable and for the safety of all<br>
concerned.<br>
   e.)  Epic, class-specific, and all other quest raids/items will be<br>
mandated under these governing rules:<br>
        1.)  If a member puts out a &quot;Call to Arms&quot; for help in obtaining a<br>
part of an epic or other quest item on the Knights message board or GC<br>
message board, they will more than likely be running the raid in an endeavor<br>
to fulfill a part of their quest, and will have the right to the first quest<br>
item obtained in the raid.  This will also hold true if the Knight puts out<br>
an impromptu plea in guild chat for help and enough members and friends can<br>
be gathered immediately for a raid of this type.<br>
        2.)  If a member posts that he or she is organizing a raid for all<br>
others who need quest items, then he or she can set a plan of action for how<br>
the loot order will go; keeping in mind that higher-level members and those<br>
who are in attendance for the whole raid will have priority on the list that<br>
he or she makes up.  This type of raid is for the good of the entire guild<br>
in helping as many obtain parts of their epic as possible, and is highly<br>
encouraged.<br>

<br>
1. First offense. A warning will be issued.<br>
2. Second offense. A formal warning issued. You will lose your KoV in good standing status and put on a probationary period of 30 RL days. Wherewith if you still are not able to get off probation during the 30 RL days you will be removed from the guild.<br>
3. Third offense. Regardless of whether you are not on probation and you violate the loot rules by ninja looting or whatever you will be removed from the guild and on your own.<br>

<br>
It is not specifically noted that alternate characters in attendance are afforded all the priviledges of main characters IF that alternate is of sufficient level and is in attendance, as opposed to &quot;parked&quot;.  It is beneficial to the guild as a whole that this be the policy, developing alts to fill gaps in guild needs or personal enjoyment MUST be encouraged.<br>
<br>
NO DROP items being looted.  We will have someone designated as a raid organizer or leader.  When it comes time for a NO DROP item to be looted it is the responsibility of the looter to be sure that PERMISSION to loot has been given by the this organizer to avoid confusion and hard feelings.<br>
<br>
One other omission is that of a time frame for being in attendance.  If an ongoing raid is joined by someone do they have the immediate NBG rights of those who have spent time on the raid?  I am not sure how I would suggest addressing this.  If the raid has been rather lengthy it may be a good idea to have some kind of policy to remove arguments or conflicts in the future.<br>

<br>
Basically if you are in a raid and a NO DROP item drops...then you must wait for the raid leader or group leader(if they have been designated as the looter for the group) to let you know if you are approved to loot the NO DROP item.  People who violate this rule will be subject to disciplinary action.  Group members are to report such actions to an officer, so that the high council can take the appropriate steps in this process.<br>

But as for handing over items when you get new items there should be a stipulation to that..If the item you win is superior and you have another item that was won during a guild raid by all means should be rolled on by people who could use it but I don't feel that should be done for items you had before you entered the guild or won outside guild raids. Lets face it some of us have very nice items not won with the guild and have plans for them when our Mains arn't using them. I personally have 8 characters that are 50+ 60 warrior 58 cleric 54 Mage 52 shaman 52 monk 50 warrior 50 rogue 50 bard all of which would benifit from my hand downs from him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/uryland29.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ryland29</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Holy Champion</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/14/01 9:55:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: KoV Loot policy/addition</span><hr size=1> I think that you may have misunderstood one of the rules...we don't expect anyone to hand over equipment that they have obtained from previous raids and such.<br>

<br>
I don't follow this.  My understanding is that there is no rule/policy where if you win an item roll you have to turn in your old item to a guild fund or something.  Was this how other guilds handled things?  It's an interesting option, but one that to my knowledge has not been discussed within KoV.  The basic intent of these rules was to reduce contention over loot with regards to who would most benefit from it as well as the I-can't-use-it-but-my-&lt;insert_alt_here&gt;-can scenarios. <p>--<BR>

When dealing with rolls and not merit I guess that's just up to the person themselves.. Jook seems to be making an obvious decision though on what to do with old gear, and I've always liked the idea of passing it down to others that could use it once I can't. /shrug<br>
