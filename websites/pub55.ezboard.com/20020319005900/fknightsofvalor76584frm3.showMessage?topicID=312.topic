<br>
Well, I told myself this morning that I was going to refrain from posting for a few days to let recent events, both guild and RL, settle down a bit.  Today's posts seem to carry an urgency about them such that I feel a need to post some thoughts to consider.<br>
<br>
For those who may not have read this in a while, or even those that have, I encourage you to reread our charter.  There are many things in it that may offer guidance during these times.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://knightsofvalor.freeservers.com/Charter.html">knightsofvalor.freeserver...arter.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Each member shall influence the way the guild grows and lives; every voice will be heard and none silenced.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;... live our lives as an example to those around us ...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;... plant the seeds of hope and serenity wherever we may travel.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;... his or her actions reflect upon the guild as a whole.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Slaydark and Longbow have a talent beyond that which I possess to express these things in a much more eloquent way so perhaps we might hear some of their thoughts in here as well.  Let truth be your guide and honor your path.<br>
<br>
Safe journeys to all.<br>

Even though the post is a year old the thoughts he presents concerning the guild remain the same.  Please read it. :)<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
First, I'd like to preface this message by saying that I have not heard of, or witnessed, any members of the Knights of Valor conducting themselves in a way that is contrary to our Charter.<br>
<br>
With any business or company, it is always great to see growth because it usually means that goals, revenue and hopefully profitability are moving in the right direction. So it is with the Knights of Valor. Lately we have seen our numbers increase, an i'm sure it's because of the "name" we've created for ourselves. We've created our name / reputation by our actions as individuals and as a guild. But with growth, it is common to forget what made us successful in the first place, and with the increase of our numbers, now may be a good time (as individuals and Knights of Valor) to revisit it.<br>
First it starts with our leadership. I must say "hats off" to our Officers. I believe they all have shown themselves to be genuinely concerned about the members of the Knights of Valor, and have conducted themselves in a way that is an example for the rest of us to follow. From Ryland running across Norrath to bring me an item, to Langley helping port me for a quest, to Slaydark bringing a piece of armor for Humma at Highkeep. The examples are endless and too deep to list them all. Now, saying that, we should also keep in mind to respect the time of the Officers as they also are enjoying their expereience. But they are always there to help and answer questions.<br>
As far as conduct, the only thing I'd like to say, is to remember that your actions and words are not just a reflection of you, but you are also representing me,...and Ryland, and Slaydark, and Colins, and Moksoon, and all of the Knights of Valor. I feel that above all-else, we must protect the integrity of our guild, the Knights of Valor, and be deligent in doing so. I went back and re-read our Charter, its outstanding. If you hacen't done so in a while, please re-read it. Particulary to our newer members.<br>
The meaning of this message is not to define our conduct. That has been done (quite well) in our Charter, but to share my perspective and the hope that we all are aware of the work involved in maintaining a cohesive family. It is always great to see everybody welcome a member when they log on, or saying Goodbye when someone leaves. It's the little things...its in the deatil...It reminds me of a management philosophy called Kaizen-meaning Continuous Improvement. Just think of the little old gaardener working in this big beautiful garden, and he is busy pruning one little branch.It's not the one little branch that he's pruning that makes the big garden beautiful, but all the little branches,on a whole,that was improved in the process.<br>
So it must be within our guild, to continuously improve the relationships between ourselves. Always remember "the little things". <br>
As for me personally, I'd like to let you all know that I'm kind of playful when I'm playing Longbow and enjoy joking around and looking for humor in situtations. Please don't ever take offense to anything I may say. I would never say anything disparaging to any member of the Knights of Valor. When I call Seiyan "The Crazy Monk", its all in good fun and jest, and is not to be taken as a lack of respect. Not that anybody has ever complained, but I tend to be animated in my communication using hands, face and hands, tone,and emotion, and all that can be hard to translate into static words. For example, I love talking to Colins because he and I joke around a lot. He hammers me about being a weak Ranger,and I hammer away at everything that is wrong with a Warrior...heheh (actually I like him because he's so big, in a fight I can hide behind him or hang on to one of his legs!)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I hope this wasn't too long, but I felt that our maintaining our honor and integrity as a guild should not be forgotten or taken for granted. I DO NOT think that it has been in jeopaardy, but we must be proactive in maintaining the "reasons" on what made us successful in the first place.<br>
Thanks for the ear...<br>

<br>
This is a very good time, as the new year sets in, for us all to review the charter, and o review our own lives and actions and set our level of dedication NOW. What you decide in these first few days is how you will act and react throughout this year with the Knights. Our charter is merely words on a non-existant piece of paper, but it holds itself to so much more than reality. It represents the views we are to have regardless of our outside lives, but in so many ways it directl reflects and guides our everyday relationships. Take to heart your personal integrity as you read and I thank you all for the humility to admit your fears, faults and discretions so that we can grow closer, together. I love you all and thank you for having me on board. Animo et Fide indeed! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=312.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm3.showNextMessage?topicID=312.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=312.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm3.emailToFriend?topicID=312.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm3.threadControl?topicID=312.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=312.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=312.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub55.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="knightsofvalor76584frm3">General Discussion<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm4">Event Suggestions<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm5">Scheduled Raids<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm14">Epic Quests ~ General, Mobs Needed<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm19">Raid Committee Discussion<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm9">Quest Inquiries/Spoilers<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm7">Stories<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm20">**MEMBERS ONLY**<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm15">Charter, Bylaws, Loot Rules<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm10">Membership Application<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm13">Tradeskills & Guild Armory<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm8">Inquiries/Feedback <option value="knightsofvalor76584frm6">Roll Call<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm11">Computer Q & A<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm16">Removed Threads</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/bknightsofvalor76584>Knights of Valor</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm3>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://knightsofvalor.freeservers.com">Knights of Valor</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top">
