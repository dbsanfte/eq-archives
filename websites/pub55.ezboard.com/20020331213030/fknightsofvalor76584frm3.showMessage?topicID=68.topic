        I've got a special project I am working on at work! (Don't laugh, this is good) It's called Operation: Good Mood Food!<br>
                The major objective is to figure out what kinds of foods and munchies will last and endure the shipping process of the U.S. Mail. Many troops have been called to duty and I am doing my little part in helping....Hopefully this will be spreading through my affiliated agencies...*fingers crossed*<br>
                And I bet you are wondering who my test subjects are.......Well, my first batch is the M-Division on the Roosevelt...And no. I'm not posting any info on where anyone is at.<br>
                        After being a member of KOV for some time......I have knowledge of certain members being in the military. Well, I wanna mail ya'll some food too!<br>
                        If you are interested in receiving a &quot;care package&quot;, please send yer address to my e-mail at Wildwoodelf@hotmail.com. I am not exactly sure how much of a response I will get to this, so I'll be sure to answer every e-mail and tell ya when I'm shipping you something.<br>
        Also, considering the fact that this board is public, I'll be checking the addresses for validity. (Yeah - I got connections...ha ha!)<br>
                        Also, if anyone has some recipes they may want to share or special requests....e-mail me! I WANT new ideas!<br>
                Thanks for taking the time to read my post!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *UPDATED*<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It appears that my first package was received in 2 weeks - the second one (VERY HEAVY ONE) in two days and the third package took 5 days. It is best to send stuff priority mail and even better if it is a VERY heavy package.Also, a customs slip needs to be filled out! When sending anything to the troops such as homemade goodies, I double wrap what I made and put the food in &quot;cookie tins&quot; and gladware. It seems to be working pretty good! Of course, I have slipped in a few store bought items..............like Charmin...he he<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thanks for the ideas ya'll!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Be Safe!<br>

<br>
  what your doing is great... the best things you can send will be store bought instead of home made.. &lt;Marine Corps side of the house&gt; when they first get where they are going the mailing to them can and will be hectic.. anything you send can take up to one to 4 weeks getting there spending lots of time in hot warehouses... when i was in africa my folks sent me a King Cake &lt;Mardi Gras&gt; 6 weeks later i'm back in the states on another exercise when that package gets to me.. you don't want to know the condition of the cake .. lets just say it had a lot more colors  on it and they were furry too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   &lt;Faelene i think you were there that time LOL&gt;.. so look at expirations dates.. and things that might be forced to suffer days in a hot climate ....  store bought cookies.. beef jerky... snack crackers and cookies.. healt bars  ect.. ect.. those tend to survive shipping and once they get settled the mail system will work better for home cooked goodies... also magazines and comics are a big hit with the younger troops <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ...  <br>
<br>
  speaking as a Marine deployed out many times.. there is nothing better than getting a care package from a friend or in some cases a stranger.... while in Africa we received numerous letters addressed to the Marine Corps and i would hand them out to my troops and let them open them and read them.. and they would come looking for me every day to see if i got more... so Jen i want to thank you for what your about to do for the military being sent overseas.. and i think its Awesome..  &lt;GySgt Jackson Salutes YOU&gt;  if there is anything i can do to help let me know...you can contact me <br>

Great idea Jen and thanks for being sweet enough to think up something like that.  As Nobody mentioned previously jerky of any type works out great for care packages and lasts quite a while as well, go figure. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Had a buddy in Hawaii that everytime we'd head on over to Oki he'd get a five gallon zip-lock bag full of home made venison jerky.. Guy had no shortage of friends whenever his name was called out at mail call!  When UDP'd over there it would sometimes take up to two weeks for the packages to be routed around, but if it ever had any effect on the jerky we never noticed.  Cookies are a great thing too.. Just something about getting cookies in the mail that improves a day quite a bit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Nobody reminded me of another care package story as well.. We're in Hawaii which of course doesn't have much in the terms of Mardi Gras celebrations.. So this guy's mom sends him a King cake ever year.. When he'd get it, he'd get all the guys from good ole' Louisiana together and we'd sit around eating it and wishing we were back where the parties were <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So anyways, one of my other close friends that had the misfortune of never being to Louisiana comes up while we're munching on the cake and wants to try some.  Well of course we give him a piece and he says it's pretty good.. We're all sitting there still talking and all of a sudden he lets out a shout. Nearly scares the mess outta us.  I turn around and he's holding his hand over his mouth with this incredulous look on his face.  We're all asking him what's wrong and he turns around with his back towards us and then starts cursing..  Turns back around holding the  culprit and asks us what kind of people put a little plastic baby in the middle of a cake?!?  We're all laughing by this point and trying to explain to him that it's considered good luck to find it, but I'm afraid he didn't find it too amusing.  Two years after that he comes home with me and we go to New Orleans for the 2000 New Years Eve countdown.  First cake we buy he gets the baby once again.. *Sigh* Some people have all the luck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
