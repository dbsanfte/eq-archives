The idea behind these epic nights is to assist others &amp; yourself in getting their epic pieces. If you help others get theirs, your turn will come &amp; you will have the opportunity for your epic with help from the guild. Everyone should participate as much as possible &amp; eventually getting epics for all our 50+ members is not an unaccomplishable task.  <br><br>  Now this is purely my perspective, but I feel epic loot drops should go to <br><br>1.  Who need it the most &amp; level:<br>       This is based on how far along in your epic you actually are, if       working on your epic at all. For example:<br><br>Person A is level 49 he has his epic 1/2 done<br>Person B is level 54 he has his epic 1/2 done<br> <br>Epic loot drops: it should go to B based on level.<br><br>Again, the idea behind this is that level 49 will have his chance for his epic peice as well, as long as everyone participates in Epic Nights as an ongoing thing.  Even if we do a zone &amp; get only one epic peice for one person each Tuesday, its an accomplishment &amp; it's one less person that needs an item.<br><br>There is also an underlying theme here that I should mention. It's called selflessness, caring for your fellow Knight.  Wanting to see others get items &amp; excel as much as you do yourself.  I don't know about anyone else, but when Floggy &amp; Forgelin got their epics, it made ME feel good &amp; good for them.  Same as when Cornwalis received his title. Good for the Knights as a whole.<br><br>But again, this is just my opinion. I do hope others feel the same.<br><br>*hugs* <p></br><a href="http://angelfire.com/games3/TamzachShadowslayer" target="_blank"><img src="http://members.aol.com/blackmist2/tampost.jpg" border="0"></a> <BR>Tamzach Foxyone <BR>57th Season Preserver & Goddess of all things Huggable =)<BR>Knights of Valor<BR>Knight Distinguished<br><italic>Animo Et Fide!!</italic><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/ubascomb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bascomb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>KoV member</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/3/02 1:41:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Tuesday Epic Nights for January ~~</span><hr size=1> Ok, how will we handle a situation like this:<br><br>A) Level 54 1/2 Done<br>B) Level 51  3/4 done<br><br>A has higher level, but B has more done.

This is the first I've heard of it.  /cheer<br><br>On Epic looting:  unless an epic raid is organized for a specific purpose (e.g. get so-and-so their named-epic-drop) epic loot is distributed according to level and need (level first, then need).  This has been stated in the KoV loot rules thread (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm15.showMessage?topicID=4.topic)">pub55.ezboard.com/fknight...D=4.topic)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> under paragraph E), parts 1 and 2.<br><br>Several approaches were presented during Council discussions, as well as some additional discussion in the loot rules thread itself, but the Level-Need method received the majority approval.  Keep in mind that this does not necessarily mean it's the final decision; it's a work-in-progress such that the things that work will stay in place and those that don't will be revised.<br><br>I think that no matter what method is chosen, one could argue a certain degree of bias in any of them so I encourage all to exercise patience and understanding during this time.  To help keep tensions to a minimum, I have but one request to everyone: if you have a criticism please try to offer a viable alternative approach, such as what Bascomb saying.  Of course, we can't try all of them at once so once again please be patient as we go through the alternatives until we find one that is most satisfactory and can be applied uniformly.<br><br>Some commentary on Bascy's suggestion: you stated Honor System in the same breath as what amounts to a merit-based approach.  I don't see how Honor system looting would work here.  I'll use my Paw spires experience as a reference: one of the group member's starts looting corpses until either 3pp or a fine steel weapon is found; the same person loots multiple corpses if necessary until either of the conditions above is met.  Then the next person in alphabetical order follows the same procedure and the pattern repeats itself throughout the night.  No one checks for 3pp accuracy: it could be 5-50pp for all anyone really knows; it's up to the looter to be honest, hence the Honor System.  This system fails in the epic scenario since it becomes a point of contention as to who is the first to loot.<br><br>We could continue discussions of the merits of the Merit-based (ya, sorry about the pun), Roll-the-dice, and other approaches but this gets off-topic for this thread.<br><br>Important things to remember:<br>1) We all come out ahead when we work together<br>2) Trust is crucial to success<br> <p><IMG src="http://www.battle.net/images/battle/diablo2exp/images/animations/bestiary/act3/zakarumpriest.gif"><BR>Badorin<BR>55 Preserver<BR>Knight Ambassador, Knights of Valor<BR>Alt Rep to Grey Coalition<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/ubascomb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bascomb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>KoV member</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/4/02 1:10:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Tuesday Epic Nights for January ~~</span><hr size=1> One thing to Clarify - <br><br>What I'm getting at with the Honor System is that I don't believe that if a Jade Reaver drops and a level 55 that hasn't even started their epic should get it over a level 51 that is just waiting on that and a few corrupted to finish the epic.<br><br>We need to be honerable in truely stating how far we believe we are along with our epic.  <br><br>I'm about 25-33% done with mine.

For the sake of argument EXACTLY the same point.  Does the 55 have looting rights over the level 54 in that instance in your opinion? <br><br>It is easy to create an infinate number of permutations to the level/need policy.  We are trying to make it clear to avoid confusion at that critical moment that some rare drop is decaying while we hash out who loots.  It is my opinion that the looting rights should be established before the drop to avoid confusion at the time.<br><br>I am in an enviable position being the highest level wizard in KoV.  I am close to completion of my Epic.  There are a series of time consuming events that only involve spending a few kPP and porting to get to the point of needing to get three staffs.  <br><br>The Staff of Gabstik - <br>Loot the oil from the spawned (triggered) Enraged Golem in Plane of fear and turn it in to Kandim Firepot in and he gives you the staff<br><br>I have this staff<br><br>The Gnarled Staff -<br>Drops occassionaly from Venril Sathir (25% approx)<br><br>I need<br><br>The Blue Crystal Staff -<br>Drops from Phinigal Atropolis in Kedge (10% approx)<br><br>I need<br><br>Once I have these three staffs in my possession it is a matter of travel to complete the acquisition of my Staff of Four, the forth staff being supplied by Arantir in Everfrost to comlete the making of the powerful combination of four staffs.<br><br>Using the wizzie epic as an example, it seems reasonable to let those who have one or more staffs to loot the ones needed to allow at least one of us to have that Epic.  To have me in possession of the SoG and the BCS in another wizard's hand and the GS in another makes little sense to me.  It is easy for me to feel this way, I must admit, considering my situation.  Then again Langley was created in Oct of 1999 so he could hardly be accused of being a powerleveller.  It may have been too much time spent helping others?  Or maybe just lazy LOL.<br><br>Another note is that the Epics were implemented with the RoK and at the same time the level limit was extended to 60 from 50.  Is this relevant?  I think it is, the Epics being something to accomplish with the higher levels.  They are Epic.  One thing mentioned was that is someone being punished for slow levelling because time was spent working on their epic?  My feeling is the time would have been better spent working on those said levels and getting experience in the higher end game before allotting time to getting their epic.  That is only my opinion though.  If we are not honest we are doomed.  Honesty is the KEY to anything working and should not be questioned.  Selflessness is also an attribute that is imperative for success.<br><br>Lang     <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/ubascomb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bascomb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>KoV member</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/4/02 4:12:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Tuesday Epic Nights for January ~~</span><hr size=1> To Answer Lang's Question - <br><br>ABSOLUTELY.

It's a win/win situation and with the support of our family and friends, we can only benefit.  Level and need first as described so eloquently here are truly the best way to go.  There is a reason the planar levels are set the way they are, just as epics were introduced with the expansion that enabled us to advance beyond level 50...I am not saying that those who have not achieved these levels should not work for their epic at all, nor be able to work for whatever goals they want, but it does stand to reason that we should not come to totally trivialize the respect that the &quot;elders&quot; of our perspective classes deserve.  In example, I can tell you that I used to do lots of quests and I worked on my Soulfire quest from lvl 4 all the way up to lvl 48 before it was finally realized and I held Soulfire in my hand for the first time.  I worked for and dreamed of that day for ages and many levels and many other highlights in my growing up as a Paladin, and it really meant something to me to finally achieve that pinnacle.  The next week, I was in Highkeep hunting with Katalayna and a zone shout came up stating, &quot;Lvl 22 Paladin with Soulfire LFG&quot;.   I still cannot describe exactly the way that this affected me and trivialized in a way all that I had worked for and I had to camp out.  I was confused, upset and, yes, angry...it was not jealousy or pride that got me feeling this way, but the thoughts of how many levels I had worked and fought and savored the moment of achieving my goal.  I thought to myself...How could a lvl 22 really appreciate the full meaning of acquiring such a Holy weapon, what would they have to work towards and be proud of, and how it looked for my class in particular that now could put our long-coveted achievement in the hands of a Paladin who might very well have only been playing that character for a mere matter of hours...it bursted my bubble, I don't mind admitting.  All I am saying is..give honor and respect and due course to those who have been working for their epics and other goals for possibly a dozen levels or more...cheer them on, be there to support them and let us all work together to boost all of our members and our guild in this fine way and we will all be just that much stronger for it=)<br><br> I really like the way this thread has panned out and feel that having a central person in charge of making the call on our objective on these nights can alieviate a lot of concern.  With Tam in charge of making that ultimate decision, I am confidant that we all know the fairness and commitment that she exibits and can trust that she will look out for the best interests of all concerned, and it gives those of us going on the raid the peace of mind to participate without worry or hard feelings, as we know that someday we shall be looked out for also.  We have our NBG policy and the guidelines have been set down here for how these epic nights will go with concern to loot management.  If you need an item in a particular zone that we are raiding for epic or otherwise, take the initiative to let Tam or other leader know...they can only make the best and fairest judgment when they have all of the facts, so don't be shy to speak up and let them know in tell because no one can guess or keep track of who is sitting where in their quests.  Above all, let's go and have a great time, support, encourage, and cheer on our family members...that is so much more important in the whole scheme of things than anything else...what is an epic or any other goal achievement worth if you do not have those who you love and admire to share it with?)'

For you Tam, Lang, Bado, Kit.<br><br>Tam and I are both at the same spot in our epics we both need 3 items to complete it. 2 of them which are the same thing VS remains and a Jade Reaver, VS remains is no problem because 2 stones drop. I do agree being 51+ for rolling on epic items. But would it not be fair that since we are both in need and at same spot in our epics to roll for the Jade reaver? We both have been bottled necked for quite awhile with this pesky reaver and Yoda is not that far behind. I feel it should be those who are the farthest and closest to finishing their epic should roll on the items IMHO this would be fair. This insures that there will be other raids and unity in helping gain those items for the rest of the guild instead of waiting to reach a certain lvl to gain that item. <br><br>Faewynd Forestmyst <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>55 Outrider KoV<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/ufaewyndforestmyst.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faewynd Forestmyst</A> at: 1/8/02 1:57:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/ukitaqua.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kitaqua</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>KoV member</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/8/02 8:28:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Tuesday Epic Nights for January ~~</span><hr size=1> Hugz Wyndy!  Since you included my name in your asking, I will give you my humbled opinion on this one=)  The druid and ranger epics, while congruant in some aspects in that they need some of the same harder-to-acquire items, are still two separate epics.  If it were up to me, I would say that, according to the guidelines that have been set down here for the epic raids; the highest level and closest to completion of each class (druid and ranger in this case) should both get a roll on the jade reaver should we be fortunate enough to get one to drop tonight or in any epic night on CoM or for quest items that involve more than one classes' need in any zone.  Wooters if we get two or more...I hope, I hope, I hope; that would be THE best...hey, I can dream can't I?)' hehe  See you tonight in CoM!=) <p><center><img src="http://www.avvisione.com/members/LL.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub55.ezboard.com/utamzachshadowslayer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tamzach Shadowslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight Distinguished</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/8/02 11:31:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Tuesday Epic Nights for January ~~</span><hr size=1> The Druid and Ranger epic are two separate epics. Because Ranger/Druids require the same items up to a certain point, it is indeed 2 separate epics &amp; will go by Level &amp; need.<br><br>Again:<br><br>Epic Loot will go to:<br><br>1. Who need it the most &amp; level:<br>This is based on how far along in your epic you actually are, if working on your epic at all. For example:<br><br>Person A is level 49 he has his epic 1/2 done<br>Person B is level 54 he has his epic 1/2 done<br><br>Epic loot drops: it should go to B based on level.<br><br>Again, the idea behind this is that level 49 will have his chance for his epic peice as well, as long as everyone participates in Epic Nights as an ongoing thing. Even if we do a zone &amp; get only one epic peice for one person each Tuesday, its an accomplishment &amp; it's one less person that needs an item.<br><br>also what Badorin has pointed out:<br><br>On Epic looting: unless an epic raid is organized for a specific purpose (e.g. get so-and-so their named-epic-drop) epic loot is distributed according to level and need (level first, then need). This has been stated in the KoV loot rules thread (pub55.ezboard.com/fknight...D=4.topic) under paragraph E), parts 1 and 2.<br><br>So in the Case of myself, Faewynd &amp; Stormmy, I will get first jade reaver based on level, Fae the second then Stormmy.<br><br>I would also like it noted that I have thought about how many people in the guild need epic peices from this zone. Druids, Rangers &amp; Shamans  That is why COM is held twice this month &amp; most likely will be that way in future months, until everyone gets what is needed.  By then we will be so sick of COM we will never want to go there again! =)  I sincerely hope this is the case.<br><br><br><br><br> <p></br><a href="http://angelfire.com/games3/TamzachShadowslayer" target="_blank"><img src="http://members.aol.com/blackmist2/tampost.jpg" border="0"></a> <BR>Tamzach Foxyone <BR>57th Season Preserver & Goddess of all things Huggable =)<BR>Knights of Valor<BR>Knight Distinguished<br><italic>Animo Et Fide!!</italic><BR></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=42.topic&start=21&stop=21>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=42.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.showNextMessage?topicID=42.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.emailToFriend?topicID=42.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.threadControl?topicID=42.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=42.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/fknightsofvalor76584frm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=42.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub55.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="knightsofvalor76584frm3">General Discussion<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm4">Event Suggestions<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm5">Scheduled Raids<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm14">Epic Quests ~ General, Mobs Needed<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm19">Raid Committee Discussion<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm9">Quest Inquiries/Spoilers<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm7">Stories<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm20">**MEMBERS ONLY**<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm15">Charter, Bylaws, Loot Rules<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm10">Membership Application<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm13">Tradeskills & Guild Armory<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm8">Inquiries/Feedback <option value="knightsofvalor76584frm6">Roll Call<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm11">Computer Q & A<option value="knightsofvalor76584frm16">Removed Threads</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub55.ezboard.com/bknightsofvalor76584>Knights of Valor</a><font color=#FFFF00> -
