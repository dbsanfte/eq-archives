Basicly you go through a regualr sized corridor area to a huge staircase. and huge halls, on up to a cave behind illusion ice. and here is the maze, basicly(SPOILER...) Make a right hit the portal you see on the ground. and from then on look for the portals on ground(somtimes hard to see) and go into them, at one point you will end up in a room with a gate and a ball behind it...<BR><BR>Go through to the libary area wich is very large as well. you basicly goto the top and thru alot of corridors, to another ball(past a ball that goes nowhere) to an area that I was kos in. I saw a small pyramid thing with like 15 mobs on either side that were green and scowled. they were most likly on "Yellusk"(sp?) faction. Wich is like the boss of this dungeon, Did not go farther than that. but where I did go was MASSIVE. Not sure how to raise the other faction to become non-kos there as well. This is the Trakanon of Velious. Probably harder I imagine than trak is. He is the Ice Dragon. Also rumored there is a zone to Temple of Veeshan tword the end.
