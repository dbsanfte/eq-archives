				<p><font color=660000><b>February 25, 2000 - Veny</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight is the marathon event in Lower Guk!  
				We are gathering around 12am CST, so that we can strategize, form groups 
				and target special areas to infiltrate. We will set our sights on the 
				King room but will also look for the Frenzy, Assassin, Arch Magi, and 
				Priest Crusader areas to open up as well.  At this point, having fun and 
				getting some experience is our overall main goal but I believe we can be 
				fortunate enough to get some special items at the same time.</p>
				
				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>February 17, 2000 - Veny</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Friday Feb 18, 2000 at 10pm Eastern, 
				Lofon will be going after Sir Lucan to earn the final piece of the 
				Soulfire quest. All of the guild is welcome to come show their support. 
				Note, you do not have to be involved in the actual fight to help. There 
				are plenty of things to help with.  This includes buffing the group that 
				will attack, healing those who zone back to the commons, being in the 
				group to hail Sir Lucan after he is pulled from the militia house, 
				volunteering to be the Lucan puller who just runs for the zone after 
				getting Lucan to follow. Following the event, I hope to gather in the 
				Freeport arena so we can give Lofon a chance to try out his new toy! 
				See you al there.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the GM incident in Kedge Keep last 
				Saturday, Abashi and Lokkison issued the following statements...
					<blockquote>
					Abashi:
					<br>Regardless of the events that lead up to the incident, our 
					customers always deserve courtesy and respect. They weren't given 
					that in this particular case, and we'll continue to work at providing 
					better customer service for our players. 
					<br>
					<br>Lokkison did want to say a few words: 
					<br>I would like to take this opportunity to address the situation 
					that arose on the Xegony server last weekend (2-12-00) in Kedge Keep. 
					This incident has caused many debates over the roles of GMs and 
					Guides as CS representatives. 
					<br>While both sides have their points, ultimately it is my 
					responsibility to treat each and every customer with respect and 
					dignity regardless of their treatment of other CS personnel or 
					myself. We are responsible for maintaining the playability and 
					stability of the game as well as good customer relations. The last 
					of these is the point that I have failed on and for that I apologize 
					to the players involved. I am not going to offer up any excuses or 
					make any statements about what happened and why. The bottom line in 
					all of this is that a group of people’s enjoyment of the game was 
					lessened by an interaction with me, and that is unacceptable. I will 
					consider this an experience for me to grow from and I hope the 
					players do as well. 
					<br>Our main goal here at Verant is to provide the players with a 
					gaming environment that we hope they will enjoy, sometimes things 
					we have to do to maintain this game upset people. I assure each and 
					every one of you that not one person working here at Verant would do 
					something that intentionally detracts from your enjoyment of the game. 
					<br>
					<br>Thank you,
					<br>Lokkison
					<br>Night Lead-GM/Server Monitor
					<br>Verant Interactive
					</blockquote>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy to see that the situation was 
				properly researched and could be resolved in such a mature manner. It 
				gives me a renewed faith in Verant's abilities and standards.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>February 12, 2000 - Veny</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a post that can be found on EQ vault 
				reguarding my experience with one of the Xegony GM's:
					<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early hours of February 
					the 12th, my group experienced perhaps the most disgusting and 
					distasteful use of GM power I have ever witnessed. We were insulted 
					and belittled by the very people that are supposed to be dedicated 
					to helping us. 
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Brotherhood of Norrath guild started 
					their invasion into Kedge Keep, our group (consisting of myself - 
					Veny Tier'Gristal, my husband - Apenance Tier'Gristal, and two of our 
					good friends - Serieux and Wolfen) had been fighting and maintaining 
					the spawn on the second level for over two hours. As BoN got closer 
					to defeating Phingel, they realized and petitioned that there were 
					some spawns that were stuck in the depths of Kedge. GM Lokkison, 
					Tarskok, and Nabben came to analyze the area. When they came to a 
					conclusion to re-pop the entire zone, neither the GM's nor BoN had 
					taken in to consideration how this might affect the people who had 
					been fighting there all night. As we all know, a zone or server re-pop 
					can be very devastating. Anyone fighting high level mobs has to 
					struggle to work their way into the dungeon and secure a spot to 
					pull to. As well as spread out the spawns so one can safely pull to 
					their party. This can take hours. This is what our group would now 
					have to attempt again if the whole zone was to re-spawn.
					As you might expect, we contested the zone re-pop. Yet we did so in a 
					rational way despite our anger for being overlooked. We requested that, 
					since Lokkison had fixed BoN's problem by creating one for us, perhaps 
					he could TP us out of the zone for re-pop and help us break the spawn 
					once again so we could continue to play. According to GM Lokkison, we 
					were "clearly ignorant as to what was going on in the zone" and needed 
					to keep our "uninformed opinions to ourselves".  Apparently this type of 
					request is unacceptable, and he "does not take crap from whiney little 
					players like you who are selfish and ignorant and cry when they don't 
					get their way."
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that was a direct quote from a GM on 
					Xegony. GM Lokkison resorting to immature name calling of the players 
					he has vowed to assist.
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being verbally abused, we made sure 
					to log, report, and take screenshots of the incident, which we considered 
					unfit GM conduct. We also stated to Lokkison that we would be doing so. 
					At this point, for no apparent reason other than to perhaps show his 
					'power' over us, he told Apenance to "take a break, fool" and disconnected 
					him from the server. "Anyone else wanted to play?" he sarcastically asks.
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after Apenance returned to the server, 
					we were summoned into a 'safe room', in which we could not move or access 
					any of our belongings. In addition to this, Apenance was 'silenced' the 
					entire time. Lokkison took this time to explain to us that he doesn't have 
					to explain his actions to anyone and that we were "wasting his very 
					valuable time" because he had to "explain this to a group of immature 
					individuals". He told us that we, the players of Everquest who put in 
					over 200 hours a month of time into exploring dungeons, slaying beasts, 
					and tactically maneuvering to a camp, "have no idea how this game works 
					and why {a GM} would need to do something."
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were eventually dropped back into Dragnor's 
					Cauldron and forced to leave Kedge Keep for the night.
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This entire event was completely unacceptable. 
					After any comment we are either ridiculed or disconnected from the server. 
					I fail to see any of the justice, which GM's are supposed to provide, in 
					Lokkison's tactic. I think all players on Xegony as well as other servers 
					should be aware of the GM's that watch over them. I consider GM Lokkison 
					to be unjust, short tempered, and certainly not fit to be a GM in Everquest. 
					I also would like to see appropriate action taken against Lokkison for his 
					actions against us. I will not tolerate paying to play a game to be harassed 
					by the staff.
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a full log of this incident, visit 
					<a href="lokkison.html"> this page</a>. I have posted Apenance's log from 
					that night as well as added personal tells and such from the other players 
					involved.
					</blockquote>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we have all had bad experiences with GM's but 
				personally I cant stand back and let such blatent abuse of power go on. 
				Please post feedback and other experiences you have had perhaps with this 
				GM or others on this thread (Abusive use of GM power) at the EQ Vault.</p>
				
				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>February 4, 2000 - Veny</b></font></p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few more updates, including some weapons listings, 
				and Druid spells.</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be another Guild Event on Satuday the 26th. 
				Please come join us in Guk, we plan on kicking some major booty. We are also going 
				to hold a contest in the the theme of "The Run of the Naked Ogres" the first one 
				to make it from Ogre Town to the final destination will win! I believe it starts 
				at 10am pst.</p> 

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>February 3, 2000 - Veny</b></font></p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several LARGE updates, including the Members List and 
				Pal, Bard, Ranger, and SK Equipment and Quest pages.</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guild Event in Paw last Satuday wet well, 
				unfortunately Lanasi had to leave early and Torlon was expierencing DSL problems. 
				But those of us that made it got to spend many hours of quality D.O. time together 
				which involved lots of dead gnolls, a few res's, and tons of laughs. Meganea is 
				still in need of the spilt paw hide gloves though... go figure, 8 hours camping 
				there and we get none. Hrmph.</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the raid in Paw was going on, there was also a D.O. 
				Event happening in Permafrost. The other half of the guild was up there slaying 
				Ice Giants. At one point, we even crossed paths and got a great group photo of all 
				that were there!</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good News: Dalos is ok, he is just away on a business 
				trip. I spoke with Qwalar, one of his good friends, and was informed that he should 
				be back in a couple weeks. If you read this Dal: WE MISS YOU!</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really working hard on trying to get new info up on 
				this site, so you all can just come here for quests, equip, etc... so if you could 
				send any info on items that you have it would be greatly appriciated. Also if you 
				notice any mistakes of equip already up, corrections would be nice too. Thanks!</p> 

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>January 24, 2000 - Veny</b></font></p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did some updates today, so if you notice a few things 
				changed around that was me = )~</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next Guild Event will be on the Saturday the 29th at 
				9am in Paw, contact Lanasi for any more info.</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladins of Norrath celebrated the recent changes 
				Verant made to the game! They also honored Romidar Trueblade, one of our very own 
				noble Paladins, by slaying Sir Lucan. Romidar was instrumental in bringing the 
				Paladin's shortcomings to light, as seen in his post on eqvault.com.</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to welcome back Kyroz, who has 
				unfortunately lost most of his belongings to a bugged corpse. As of now I dont 
				think there has been any restoration of items from GM's, so if you have any type 
				of paladin armor or a magical weapon, I am sure he would greatly appriciate 
				donations and loans.</p> 

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>January 16, 2000 - Veny</b></font></p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guild Event on the 15th had a nice turnout, even 
				Qwalar and Ndyar joined us for the day! We killed several Ice Giants, and witnessed 
				the union of Demme and Meg! Rumors are that our next event may be in Runny Eye but 
				I am gonna let someone else plan that one...</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you havent stoped by and seen Romidar's post .. that 
				made it to eqvault.com go check it out!</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LANASI IS BACK! The most spunky druid to cross trails with 
				Hill Giants has returned from a vacation!  If ya havent met her yet, say hello, she 
				is one of our Elder's and most respected members.</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palludar hearing that the first rogue to our guild (Wikki) 
				continously broke daggers due to his high strength, gave him an unbelivable gift: a 
				Serrated Bone Dirk from lower guk!</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MANY THANKS to Hast and Gnostic who purchased the Shield 
				of Stalwart Seas for me, as well as Caladar who sold it to them. It is an Erudite 
				Paladin only shield from the Plain of Hate, with incredable stats: 35AC, 20STR, 20STA, 
				and ULTRAVISION. It also looks like a ribcage!!!</p> 

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>January 10, 2000 - Veny</b></font></p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the old news from 1999 has been archived and can be read 
				by following the link at the bottom of this page. The members page was also updated 
				since we have lost, as well as gained, a lot of members.</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The character duplicate bug that I reported in the last 
				update has been fixed, so there is no need to worry about it any further.</p> 
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next guild event will be next Saturday (Jan 15th) at 10am 
				pst. We will be invaiding Permafrost as well as celebrating the wedding of Demme and 
				Meganea. If anyone would like to volunteer TP's up near Perma, it would be greatly 
				appriciated, we would like to see as many members participating in guild gatherings as 
				possible. There was a semi guild event last night in Kedge Keep, where some of our high 
				lvl members grouped up and slaughtered. Thanks goes out to Aravail who organized that, 
				I heard it was a lot of fun.</p>
