				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was sent to me from Bumguren today, and posted on 
				the web, we are not sure if it is fact or fiction but its better that we all know 
				about it in advance.... This is the original post by a player in Fennin Ro:</p>
					<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought you might want to know this. A new 
					dupe bug has been  discovered in EQ and it's causing people to lose their 
					accounts. It  almost happened to me on Fennin Ro. <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's what I understand about it. Some hacks are 
					looking for high level characters. When they see a character they want to try 
					to dupe, they watch the character on the /who list. Apparently when you zone, 
					you're character is temporarily unavailable to the name server. They quickly 
					create a newbie character with the same name. When you log back on or zone 
					back on, there are now two of you. You may not notice this, though. Now when 
					you log off or zone, the other person with the dupe name is able to some how 
					log on with that character name and they get the high level account instead. 
					They then proceed to strip the account. Apparently if the legit person logs 
					back on afterward, they get the low level character instead and have now lost 
					all their stuff in their other account. <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know all the specifics, and even if I did, 
					I wouldn't post them, hehe. Fortunately, I avoided having my account duped 
					although there were two of me on at the same time. I personally witnessed this 
					happen when my friend told me to do a /who on Supa (another high level 
					character on Fennin Ro) and sure enough there were two of them. One of them 
					disappeared pretty quickly. <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GMs are aware this is happening and are trying 
					to respond to petitions very quickly when it happens. A GM told me to log out 
					and then he deleted the duplicate name. I then had to change my password for 
					extra security. <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently one way to hinder these dupers is to play 
					/anon so that it is harder for them to tell what level you are. It isn't worth 
					it to them to dupe lower level characters. Of course, it doesn't help if they 
					already know who some of the higher levels are. <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, until this bug is fixed, I would advise playing 
					in /anon or /roleplay. </blockquote>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please everyone be aware of this, and hopefully the bug will 
				be fixed soon. See you in Norrath!</p>

				<p><font color=660000><b>December 28, 1999 - Veny</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made a large member update (sorry I took so long). 
				Soon Ameenra will be helping with the updates (at least for the members and the news 
				portions) so we can have more info and regular updates. Our family is growing rapidly 
				and it would really be great if we could see each other more often to keep the guild 
				as close as it is. It has been suggested that we have a guild meeting, gathering, or 
				raid of some sort every 1st and 3rd Saturday of the month. I would like to try this, 
				we have a paw raid coming up very soon (look below for details), so I would like to 
				propose a perma/everfrost raid on Saturday the 15th at 10am pst.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upcoming Paw Invasion will be Saturday the 1st of 
				January 2000 at 5pm pst! YES, we will all be hungover! YES, we will all drink more! 
				and YES, we will also be saying goodbye to Nannen who will be gone for 3 months. 
				This wont be about experience, this is about having an experience. We should all 
				group for the best of our safety, regardless of levels... to keep a maximum security 
				for lower lvls. Can't wait to see you all there.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>December 10, 1999 - Veny</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The camp for the GhoulBane didn't turn out as well as 
				planned but we are trying again this weekend since so many ppl were willing to lend 
				a helping hand. First up for the GB will be Kyroz, our lvl 28 Paladin, and next in 
				line (if we are lucky enough to get two - doubtful I know but worth a try) will be 
				Rggillian, our lvl 25 Paladin. The plan, as of now, is to get up early tomorrow 
				morning (5am pst) and pray it isn't already camped. The only reason we may not end 
				up doing this will be if Kyroz has to work. In which case, we will frantacly try to 
				inform you all so you dont wake up at the crack of dawn.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We still need to make a trip to Everfrost and pick up 
				various items for a ton of different guild members. If you need stuff from there or 
				want to help out with any of the camps please tell me what you need and when is a 
				good time to go.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be updating the members info soon... (as soon as 
				Torlon gets the info to me)... I made some of the updates that I knew off hand.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still working on getting Apenance to help out with the 
				page. It would mean more updates and maybe even and "Apenance's Answers" page, where 
				you could pick his brain for varias locations and other info. Tell me what you think 
				about it.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be going out of town te 16th through th 23rd. See 
				you all on the 24th, when it is quite possible I will be on all day long to make up 
				for the EQ I missed while I was away.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>November 18, 1999 - Veny</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mistmore raid went well. As did our second guild 
				meeting. It was a great time to get to know some of our new members and hang out with 
				old friends. There are tons of new names popping up in guildsay so take a look at our 
				members page to see who they are. Next event that we are trying to get rolling is to 
				go pillage the depths of Perma frost. There are many useful items for everyone in the 
				guild so we should all be able to hang out and help each other get cool stuff. Please 
				give me or Ameenra feedback about a time you would be available to come. Within a few 
				days or so we should have an exact date and time on this event.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is some feedback from Orbz reguarding the new feign 
				death patch. This effects every class with the feign death skill or spell, as well as 
				any other players that are around them, so please read:<br>
					<BLOCKQUOTE>The new feign death *nerf* patch is really a BAD thing, not so much 
					for lower lvl monks fighting under lvl 35 mobs (its actually improved for them) 
					BUT, the way lvl 35+ mobs now react to feign is a REALLY BAD THING for not just
					monks but everyone.  There will be lvl 35+ "feign trains" that will get ppl 
					killed and generally make monks who feign (necros and SKs that use the spell 
					also) hated by everyone. Most of the monk community, at least most 35+ monks, 
					are not at all happy about this patch.  Some monks who don't yet fully understand 
					how feign [used to] works seem to think this patch is an improvement.  Its NOT.  
					Its not only going to effectively eliminate the role of a monk pulling 35+ mobs 
					its also going to essentially end feign pulling of 35+ mobs. Torlon probably 
					remembers the day I was pulling single lizards in Cazic for our group, out of 
					rooms of 5 and 6 even. The days of that are over,  at least when it comes to 
					lvl 35+ mobs.<br>
					What I would like to ask is everyone please send a /feedback ASAP along the lines 
					of: "Please change MOB reaction to Feign Death back to the way it used to be 
					before the recent 'Feign Death patch'.  This new change is NOT a good thing.  
					Thank you"</BLOCKQUOTE>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there are people who think it was good to nerf the 
				fiegn death skills, that it was unfair for a feign user to be able to pull one npc 
				when no one else could, and that now the classes are more balanced. I personally 
				refuse to take a stand on this situation and I am only trying to provide you with 
				the info I am aware of so you can send knowledgable feedback.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>October 27, 1999 - Veny</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I added Paladin Armor (that can be found at the Equipment 
				page) and some really old Quests (which are under the new quests link). I will be 
				adding more to both of these areas as soon as I have time...</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you all got Torlon's great news letter (if you didnt 
				it is becuase you havent gone and signed up ate onelist.com. He welcomed our new 
				iniaite Rggillian - WELCOME! - and honered all of our valuable members for each of 
				their unique talents and all of their generousity. We do have a truely great guild 
				that I consider a family.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been determined that the Guild Meeting wil be on 
				Sunday the 7th of Movember at 11am. If this time is no good (work, church, ect), 
				please suggest a better time to Torlon.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are planning an event to help Dalos get the icon for a 
				cleric only quest weapon. If you are of a level to help out with this quest, please 
				contact Torlon or Dalos to find a suitable time to help them out. If you have a 
				expedition like this that you need help with, we are always willing to come together 
				and help our fellow guild members. Just inform Torlon or I and we will announce it.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>October 26, 1999 - Veny</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our next Guild Meeting will be Sunday the 7th of November. 
				We will meet in Freeport Arena to duel and drink. Then procede with "The Run of the 
				Naked Orges". Torlon will decide on an exact time to start it soon, but plan on being 
				in that area early afternoonish. That is all the news for now... see you in Norrath.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>October 25, 1999 - Veny</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still need everyone to sign up at the guildvault page 
				and become a part of our newly "registered" guild. Go to 
				http://www.playervault.com/guilds/default.asp?gid=1653, chose "join this guild", 
				start a registered profile if necessary, and be proud to show your name as a member 
				of Dragon's Order! Once again, I think that there are members that are not signed 
				up on the onelist, and therefore not getting all of Torlon's updates and other fun 
				and important information, so please visit this site as well at 
				http://www.onelist.com/community/DragonsOrder.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A date has not yet been decided for our next Guild 
				Meeting, although I predict the first Sunday of November (mostly cuz that will be 
				the day I am available to be there hehehe). We will meet in Freeport Arena to duel 
				and drink. Then procede with "The Run of the Naked Orges" (a truely hilairious 
				and brilliant idea thought up by Torlon himself- read least weeks post for more 
				details). Aravail, one of our newer members to Dragon's Order, has generously offered 
				his teleporting, binding, and invis abilities. Our good friend Gnostic will also be 
				avaiable for teleporting and such. Thank you both!</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>October 20, 1999 - Veny</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please visit the guildvault at 
				http://www.playervault.com/guilds/default.asp?gid=1653 and become a part of our 
				"registered" guild. Dalos, Torlon, and I did it but we need more ppl to sign up 
				to show em all what we really got! Also, I'm not sure if everbody is on the onelist 
				so please check it out at http://www.onelist.com/community/DragonsOrder and sign 
				up if you're not on it. We want to be able to send out lots of guild info and this 
				way you email is protected to all but Torlon.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon we will have our second GUILD MEETING, please 
				inform Torlon of a good weekend next month to have it. We will be trying the 
				freeport arena for our next location, prviding the lag isnt too bad. Torlon and 
				I will both be providing language lessons, and I will be making jewelry for those 
				who need anything (if you could email me in advance with what you need, that 
				would help a lot). But the most exciting highlight of the up and comming event 
				is the "Run of the Naked Ogres": <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create 1st level ORGES, group up, run to FREEPORT, sneak 
				through the tunnel at the south gate, get bound near the fishing dock, CHARGE the 
				fishing girl at the end of the dock till the boat arives, take the boat to KALADIM 
				and jump off before it  docks there,  swim to shore, attempt to make it to GREATER 
				FAYDARK, bind at the zone, and either rush the gates of FELWITHE, or just swan dive 
				off the planks of KELETHIN.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>October 15, 1999 - Veny</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I updated the members page again, please send me you last 
				names if they are not listed. Tell me if there is anything else you would like to see 
				up here. I will do my best to keep all the info available that I can. We were added 
				to the guildvault page so we are a "registered" guild.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>October 4, 1999 - Venyth</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have updated the members page, if your character has 
				not been updated please email me and I will make the correct changes. New rules 
				have been added as well as links to our allies' web pages. Apenance will soon be 
				helping with our news portion of the site to keep us informed about updates and 
				other general EQ info.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>September 17, 1999 - Venyth</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to our new server! Please update your bookmarks. I 
				put in a new application page and Torlon is working on a new message board for us 
				(without advertizements and password protected). Hope you like it.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>September 8, 1999 - Venyth</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I added more class sites, as well as a paladins and 
				necromancer spell list, and the research lists are complete! There is a new dieties 
				section and a few other updates. I am hoping you are starting to see all the 
				information you are looking for by just coming here. Please 
				<a href="mailto:venyth@hotmail.com"> tell me</a> if there is anything you are looking 
				for that you dont already see here.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>September 6, 1999 - Venyth</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well our journeyman's boot party was very very long and 
				unfortunately only partly successful. Although, I thought it was a great oppertunity 
				to hang out with guild members that I wouldnt normally get to group with. I think we 
				have a great guild going and it is due to all the great people in it. Because not 
				everyone got boots, we are planning another gathering next Friday, the 9th of September. 
				I hope to see you there.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torlon will be helping me with the site as soon as we move 
				it over to the new server (the new addy will be www.fairechaser.com/dragonsorder- but 
				I will tell you when it is up over there). With both of us working on the site, we 
				will be able to give it more attention and get more organized, and hopefully it will 
				eventually be your one stop to find out everything that is going on with the guild. 
				It will also be password protected, so hopefully that means you will find even more 
				of the secrets of Norrath hidden among those pages... In the mean time, please send 
				Torlon or I you email addresses so you can get signed up on our "one-list" emailing 
				list. This way only Torlon or me know you actually email addy, incase you are worried 
				about it getting out, and we can all keep updated on what is going on.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>August 18, 1999 - Venyth</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow! The site and the guild are finally up and running. 
				I made some additions such as a necromancer research guide and enchanter spells. If you 
				have information that you would like me to add please email it to me in .txt format 
				and I will add it as soon as possible. I also signed up at onelist.com for the xegony 
				emailing list. I havent gotten much incoming mail thus far but if you are interested 
				it is there. I have also suggested to Torlon that we make a list there for the guild, 
				that way we can all communicate a bit easier... I hope you all are enjoying the site 
				and the guild.</p>

				<br>

				<p><font color=660000><b>August 7, 1999 - Venyth</b></font></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok I made a few more changes and additions, but this site
