				<P>Followers of <font color=660000><b>Bertoxxulous, The Plaguebringer</b></font>,  
				believe the only truth on Norrath is that everything dies. They view the decay 
				of flesh as a thing of ultimate beauty. The subtle purples of a fresh bruise, 
				the almost irridescent yellow green of an infested pustule, are but a few of the 
				things that His followers relish. It is not suprising that many of His followers 
				pursue the dark art of Necromancy, for to them nothing is more desirable than to 
				be surrounded by beings who, even in unlife, continue to rot and decay. Do not 
				take this to mean that His followers are suicidal or seek a quick death. To the 
				contrary, they wish to live long, painful lives, spreading their dark, diseased 
				stain across all of Norrath. </p>

				<p>Followers of <font color=660000><b>Brell Serilis, The Duke of Below</b></font>, 
				believe that the surface world is a waste of space. They find true happiness in the 
				caves, caverns and tunnels that perforate the belly of Norrath. But this is one of few 
				points that all followers of Brell can agree upon. There are many different factions 
				who all worship Brell. The Runny Eye Clan of Goblins claim he is their father much to 
				the disgust of the Dwarves of Kaladim who know that the Dwarves are the true children 
				of Serilis. But the vicious Gnolls of Split Paw disagree entirely. For was it not Brell 
				who sculpted them out of the sacred Clay of Cosgrove? Followers of Brell Serilis in one 
				form or another can be found nearly anywhere you enter the Underfoot of Norrath.</p>

				<p>Followers of <font color=660000><b>Bristlebane, The King Of Thieves</b></font>, 
				believe in having fun, at the expense of nearly all else. Bards, rogues, jesters, 
				gamblers and gypsies are all typical followers. They are almost always very charming, 
				clever, and witty, traits which all Bristlebane followers should strive to have. 
				Mischief in all its forms is encouraged. Practical jokes are performed as if they 
				are the highest of rituals. Very few of Bristlebane's followers are outright wicked 
				in their desires but it is best to keep at least one eye on your purse if they are 
				about. And never let one deal you a hand of King's Court. </p>

				<p>Followers of <font color=660000><b>Cazic-Thule, The Faceless</b></font>, fear their 
				Lord and believe that only by causing terror in others will they be spared his vengeful 
				wrath. They strive to beat down and suppress all hope. Fear rules their lives and 
				through fear they rule the lives of others. Pain, misery, violence, torture, living 
				sacrifice; these are the tools of a Cazicite. Many Lizardman tribes are devout followers 
				of Cazic-Thule, but his number of humanoid followers grows daily, a cold shadow slowly 
				engulfing the bright spots of Norrath in a nightmare of horror and pain.</p>

				<p>Followers of <font color=660000><b>Erollisi Marr, The Queen Of Love</b></font>, cling 
				to the belief that love conquers all. It should be pointed out that while love is a 
				generally peaceful concept, Erollisi worshippers are not pacifists. They would like to 
				live in a world where everyone loves everyone else and violence does not exist but 
				they are not naïve enough to think that Norrath is that world. They have passionate 
				loves of people, places and ideas and are more than willing to fight and die to preserve 
				those things. The dream of every follower of Erollisi is to die in selfless defense of 
				someone or something they love. Many Paladins hear the true calling of their hearts 
				and follow Erollisi Marr.</p>
				
				<p>Followers of <font color=660000><b>Innoruuk, The Prince of Hate</b></font>, include 
				nearly the entire Dark Elven race who regard him as their "Father." They believe that 
				Hate is a creative force, or rather "THE" creative force in the universe. Creativity 
				born of destruction. Love and kindness are tools for those too ignorant to know what 
				they want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to obtain it. It is only through the 
				total disdain of your enemies that you can gain true power over them. Pity and mercy 
				have no power when confronted with contempt and viciousness. It is the honest belief 
				of the followers of Innoruuk that if they were to hate strong enough they could destroy 
				all of Norrath. </p>

				<p>Followers of <font color=660000><b>Karana, The Rainkeeper</b></font>, believe in the 
				absolute power of storms. They worship the life giving power of the rain and respect the 
				destructive force of a sandstorm or hurricane. Typical followers of Karana are rural 
				humaniods, farmers, ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will often offer shelter from 
				the elements to strangers. Many Karana followers live a nomadic lifestyle, travelling 
				where the winds take them. They are humble, generous people who value strength and 
				honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana and his work for they know it is only through 
				his wisdom and kindness that all of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal tempest.</p>

				<P>Followers of <font color=660000><B>Mithaniel Marr, the Lightbearer</B></FONT>, believe that 
				valor is what separates civilized beings from beasts. His followers live by a 
				strict charity. They are champois of downtrodden and the most noble of warriors. 
				His followers strive to rid Norrath of all things dark and evil, often 
				sacrificing themselves in this never ending quest. They will not rest until the 
				day when all of Norrath is cleansed in Mithaniel's light. They take themselves 
				and their duty very seriously, and have little patience for mischief or mayham. 
				Many paladins are devout servants of Mithaniel Marr.</p> 
				
				<p>Followers of <font color=660000><b>Prexus, The Oceanlord</b></font>, believe true 
				power lies in the vast depths of Norrath's oceans. They believe that eons ago life first 
				formed in the murky deep and that one day the oceans shall rise again to consume those 
				who are unworthy and to embrace the faithful. The Oceanlord's servants tend to live and 
				work near, on, or beneath large bodies of water. They seek to spread the word of Prexus 
				to all who will hear and defend the oceans and seas of Norrath against any who would 
				cause them harm. Many sailors and fishermen are followers of Prexus.</p>

				<p>Followers of <font color=660000><b>Quellious, The Tranquil</b></font>, seek peace. 
				They are not strict pacifists though and will fight to defend themselves and those they 
				care about. The peace they seek is an inner one. They wish to know all there is to know 
				about themselves and the world around them. They thirst for knowledge of their true 
				selves and strive to help others attain enlightenment. It is through the sharing of this 
				knowledge that they believe universal peace can be obtained. If every creature fully 
				understood itself and its neighbors there would be no need for conflict and war. 
				Followers of Quellious often follow a nomadic lifestyle, constantly seeking what there 
				is to know and hoping to find themselves along the way.</p>

				<p>Followers of <font color=660000><b>Rallos Zek, The Warlord</b></font>, believe in 
				survival of the strong and death to the weak. Strength, courage, but above all, victory 
				is what the heart of a true follower of Zek yearns for. In the heat of battle is the 
				only place where enlightenment can be gained. The universe was formed by conflict and 
				in conflict it will end. The victors feasting upon the remains of their fallen enemy. 
				No respect or regard is given to the dead, for if they were worthy their hearts would 
				still pump blood through their veins and not upon the soil of Norrath. Followers of 
				Zek are almost exclusively warriors.</p>

				<p>Followers of <font color=660000><b>Rodcet Nife, The Prime Healer</b></font>, take a 
				solemn oath to fight disease and death until one or the other finally claims them. They 
				are very generous and humble, asking little more than the recipients of aid from them 
				pass their kindness onto another. They are not content to deal with the effects of 
				disease and death after they occur and vigorously seek to destroy the sources of these 
				evils. Healers and mystics are typical followers but many noble rangers and paladins 
				also have also taken the Nife Oath. They believe that, through faith in The Prime Healer, 
				the wounded heart of the universe shall one day be mended and death's dark shadow will 
				never be seen again. </p>

				<P>Followers of <font color=660000><B>Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince</B></FONT>, believe in the raw 
				and unbridled power of fire. Fire birthed the would and in fire shall it be 
				consumed. True aggressive action is the only way for one to obtain what is 
				desired. Power is gained by superior force. Followers of Ro have little fear. 
				They are bold and brash and say what they mean and do what they say. Social 
				graces are something they neither possess nor desire. They demand the respect of 
				their peers and more often than not. Earn it as well. Those who seek true 
				elemental power follow Solusek Ro, and thus many wizards turn to his burning 
				embrace. </p>
				
				<p><font color=660000><b>Tarew Marr</b></font> is one of a triumvirate of beings who 
				rule over the Plane of Water. The people of Norrath know little of him. His relationship 
				to Mithaniel and Erollisi Marr is a source of constant debate amongst their followers.</p>

				<P>Followers of <font color=660000><B>Tribunal, the Six Hammers</B></FONT>, seek one thing 
				above all else: justice. While some claim to express the desire by pursuing 
				careers as guards or magistrates, true believers in the Tribunal do not 
				recognize the rights of any court on Norrath and enforce the Tribunal's sense of 
				ultimate justice on the rest of the population. Retribution, vengeance, and 
				punishment are sacred duties. Followers of the Tribunal are methodical, patient 
				and just. They must be so, for it is their belief that if they punish an 
				innocent, the Tribunal will pass judgement against them, and doom them to an 
				eternity of endless torment. </p>

				<P>Followers of <font color=660000><B>Tunare, the Mother of All</B></FONT>, believe that we are 
				all Tunare's children. The children of Tunare seek to help Norrath, which they 
				believe to be a living and breathing being, to blossom and grow. Followers 
				believe that the world of Norrath gave birth to Tunare and from her all life has 
				sprung forth. Thus, by worshipping and protecting the land, followers are paying 
				homage and respect to the Mother of theirr Mother, who in turn protects and 
				provides for them. Followers of Tunare will fight to the death to protect nature 
				in all its forms. Many druids, rangers, and a great many elves follow the ways 
				of Tunare.</p>

				<P>Non-dragon followers of <font color=#660000><B>Veeshan, the Wurm Queen</B></FONT>, believe 
				that dragonkind is superior to all other forms of life. They swear allegiance to 
				the Mother of Dragons and often sacrifice themselves or their loved ones to one 
				of Her children. In return for this undying devotion, Veeshan is very protective 
				and generous to her loyal followers. Many humanoids have gained great riches and 
				anciennt knowledge through servitude to the Wurms, but these gifts came with a 
				high price... knowing that one is less than cattle to the dragons, and that they 
				can take your messy life whenever it suits them. To most follower of Veeshan, 
				however, serving a deity is its own reward.</p>
