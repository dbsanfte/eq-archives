I was wandering over to EC to start on my baking skills. When I arrived at the rings there were 6 GMs standing in front of me! Of course I forgot all about baking to find out what was going on. At first Maltyn wanted to hear stories of others adventures. Then he started to tell a tale of a young halfling rogue who wanted to prove some guards corrupt! I missed the first few lines of the story in the log but here is the rest of it. Maltyn will be finishing his tale on Saturday night! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:49:12 2001] Maltyn says, 'Well he saw that the guard could only have what could be Blackburrow Stout!  '<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:49:55 2001] Maltyn says, 'Dreezl stood quietly...breathing soflty as to draw no attention to himself.'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:50:21 2001] Maltyn says, 'Of course they were well intoxicated by this time, but Dreezil never became complacent'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:50:35 2001] Maltyn says, 'This was one of his strongest qualities as a rogue'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:50:52 2001] Maltyn says, 'He was not lazy about being careful of his movements and actions'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:51:12 2001] Maltyn says, 'He watched as first one....then the other of the guards began to nod their heads'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:52:00 2001] Maltyn says, 'And as each drifted into a deep sleep he crept closer..stopping occasionally to make sure they were sleeping as was evidenced by their snoring piercing the nite'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:52:33 2001] Maltyn says, 'When he felt the time was right he moved in slowly to where they were and picked up the large skin sack he had seen'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:53:10 2001] Maltyn says, 'He looked inside slowly and picked out the still full bottles of Blackburrow Stout...holding as many as he could in his little halfling hands and arms'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:53:55 2001] Maltyn says, 'He thought to himself...now I have the evidence that I need.  These guards were corrupt...and if I can expose them...what a reward their must be!'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:54:31 2001] Maltyn says, 'Dreezil salivated just a bit at the thought of rewards and riches they would no doubt place upon him...'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:56:12 2001] Maltyn says, 'He slowly turned and headed toward the castle entrance, smiling to himself.  Looking upon the first tall human he encountered and open his mouth to speak of the guards actions when he heard a startled SQUAWK!@!!'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:56:25 2001] Maltyn says, 'and the guards yelling behind him'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:56:43 2001] Maltyn says, 'AHA!!! Now I have found you, you smuggling thief!!'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:57:06 2001] Maltyn says, 'Carson Mccabe will be pleased to hear that you were so considerate as to walk right into the castle and give yourself up!'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:58:42 2001] Maltyn says, 'Dreezil was in a predicament as the very evidence he was going to use against the guards was being used against him!'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 21:59:19 2001] Maltyn says, 'They began to drag him into the castle protesting and struggling all the way'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:01:12 2001] Maltyn says, 'Well...they took him before Carson McCabe, but transferred eight bottles of the stout to a wooden case leaving the rest in their private chambers'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:01:46 2001] Maltyn says, 'When they arrived Carsn looked closely at Dreezil and recognized the guild symbol on his collar'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:02:29 2001] Maltyn says, 'Having the sign of the Deeppockets clearly identifed him as a rogue and therefor to McCabe a scoundrel as well'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:03:14 2001] Maltyn says, 'He ignored the halflings protests of innocence and viewed the contents of the wooden case as proof of Dreezil's crime.  He sent the guards to confine Dreezil to the dungeon of Highkeep.'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:03:29 2001] Maltyn says, 'Should I stop now...does thou grow weary?'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:04:24 2001] Maltyn says, 'All right then...the guards took great pleasure in escorting the halfling rogue to the lower keep'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:15:33 2001] Maltyn says, 'The guards took great pleasure in chaining Dreezil up'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:16:29 2001] Maltyn says, 'They chained him with his hands spread far apart on the wall beside him...the standard practice for those with acknowledged pickpocket skills'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:16:57 2001] Maltyn says, 'Dreezil looked very forlorn in this dark dungeon as the great iron cell doors clanged shut...'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:17:23 2001] Maltyn says, 'The other half naked, smelly, sweating prisoners stared hopelesslt at him through sunken eyes'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:18:28 2001] Maltyn says, 'It was not untl the sun sank low and the darkness of the cell enclosed around him that he rezlized his predicament...it had not seemed possible that this could happen...but here he was and no idea what would happen next'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:19:32 2001] Maltyn says, 'He languished there in the prison as the days turned into weeks, the weeks into months until they seemed to meld into one long, endless, boring, miserable nightmare of existence'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:21:49 2001] Maltyn says, 'Well as Dreezil was eeking out existense in the dark cell...he could not help but hear the whisperings and pieces of conversations echoing through the dungeon that told him that something terrible was happening in the world'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:22:39 2001] Maltyn says, 'He heard rumors that Highhold was under attack and his hometown of Rivervale had been ransacked and taken over briefly.'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:23:20 2001] Maltyn says, 'He assumed from the sounds of revelry some unknown days later that things had worked out, evidently in favor of Carson McCabe and high Hold'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:23:58 2001] Maltyn says, 'Nevertheless he missed his family and feared what may have come upon them in his absense and this attack on Rivervale'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:25:00 2001] Maltyn says, 'This only added to his ceaseless misery'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:25:30 2001] Maltyn says, 'Unbeknown to Dreezil was that his fortune was about to change...but from and unexpected source'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:26:38 2001] Maltyn says, 'You see there was one known as Firiona Via and Sionachie that had traveled many weeks across Antonica, finally arriving in Rivervale in search of young Dreezil'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:27:32 2001] Maltyn says, 'They came upon Wurrin and Teezil in a burrow not far from the inn, known as Fools Gold.  Perhaps you have seen the place?'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:28:23 2001] Maltyn says, 'Well Firiona thought is was a fitting name for an establishment that encouraged gambling and housed the local rogues guild'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:29:15 2001] Maltyn says, 'In either case Teezil and Wurrin welcomed the Paladin warmly'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:30:17 2001] Maltyn says, 'Welcome t' our home me lady, the diminuative woman smiled up at firiona and amiled, scurrying to find the largest chair to offer her'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:30:45 2001] Maltyn says, 'Me 'hasband an' me we've heard a great deal about ye lately'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:31:03 2001] Maltyn says, 'Tis said ye defeated th' Child o'Hate in Kithicor, it is'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:31:42 2001] Maltyn says, 'Wurrin her husband coughed slightly and nodded'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:31:50 2001] Maltyn says, 'A gentlemen of few words was Wurrin'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:32:05 2001] Maltyn says, 'He pulled out a briar pipe and bagan to pack it with tobacco'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:32:28 2001] Maltyn says, 'He listened as his wife rambled on and watched teh beautiful high elf lady from uder his beetled brow'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:33:04 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona responded kindly and thanked Teezil and Wurrin for their hospitality and smiled.'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:33:33 2001] Maltyn says, 'I was hoping you would be able to offer a bit of information as well? replied Firiona...her face begininging to cloud with concern'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:34:40 2001] Maltyn says, 'At this point Wurrin her husban sat up sharply...puffing sharply on his pipe and slowly blowing blue white smike in tiny rings'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:35:48 2001] Maltyn says, 'Really, me lady? What kind o' information mich sech as we have f'r ye? Teezil folded her hands across her apron as she stared puzzled at the high elf lady'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:36:16 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona said, It concerns your son Dreezil....'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:36:44 2001] Maltyn says, 'Teezils eys grew wide and Wurrin blew another set of smoke rings high into the air'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:37:32 2001] Maltyn says, 'Dreezil has been a companion of mine in the past as you know, and i would find him again. I have missed his ready wit and his skils wiht locks are second to none'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:37:59 2001] Maltyn says, 'In my travels it would be useful to have one of his abilites nearby and the Lady Tunare has charged me with gathering up my companions'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:38:20 2001] Maltyn says, 'I have not been able to find Dreezil's whereabouts which is not unusual for a rogue <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:38:39 2001] Maltyn says, 'But I thought I would pay you a visit to see if you could direct me where he might be found'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:39:26 2001] Maltyn says, 'Teezil's eyes began to mist over and she blinked twice, a tear falling soflty down her cheek'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:40:06 2001] Maltyn says, 'He was arrested in Highkeep, my'lady..they tell me'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:40:37 2001] Maltyn says, 'For smugglin' I KNOW my Dreezil wouldnae do sech a thin', 'tis nae possible'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:40:50 2001] Maltyn says, 'I jus' know it. He's a good boy, 'e is'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:41:19 2001] Maltyn says, 'Meith you speak with great insight'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:41:50 2001] Maltyn says, 'As they were speaking Carson McCabe himself stood at the thron room in Highkeep'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:42:28 2001] Maltyn says, 'He looked around at his chamberlain and advisors, listening to them recount the myriad of problems that were his to resolve during his afternoon session'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:43:01 2001] Maltyn says, 'Little was he to know that his afternoon would have very different results than he could ever have imagined'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:45:04 2001] Maltyn says, 'Ahh Dreezil...'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:45:35 2001] Maltyn says, 'As Carson McCabe was talking to his advisors about to begin his afternoon sessions they heard a commotion at the door to the chambers'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:46:20 2001] Maltyn says, 'Two guards opened the door and ushered in a familar high elf woman and her half elf friend.  Carson smiled.'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:47:10 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona! How good to see you! And this must be Sionachie. I ahve heard of your ability with the madolin my dear and your excellent singing voice!'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:47:31 2001] Maltyn says, 'I certainly hope you plan on staying and favoring us with a song or two'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:47:47 2001] Maltyn says, 'Sionachie blushed and smiled.  Thank you for your kind welcome and words'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:48:12 2001] Maltyn says, 'But I believe Firiona has some urgent business to attend to...Firiona nodded'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:48:53 2001] Maltyn says, 'Yes that is true, Carson.  You see I am looking for a certain halfling lad by the name of Dreezil'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:49:09 2001] Maltyn says, 'I understand he was here in Highpass...would you know anything about it?'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:49:49 2001] Maltyn says, 'Carson looked over to Arvelion, his chamberlain.  The man's bald head gleamed with sweat as he stepped up to answer'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:50:12 2001] Maltyn says, 'His heavy jailring key rattled with the keys on it about his neck'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:50:32 2001] Maltyn says, 'Yes sire. I beleive that is the name of the smuggler we arrested and have in our dungeon'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:50:43 2001] Maltyn says, 'Caught em red-handed we did'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:51:44 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona raised both of her eyebrows and stared with steel eyes at the man, who narrow mustache and sparse beard appeared very black against his now pale face.  she waited for him to continue.'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:52:36 2001] Maltyn says, 'He was carrying the contraband on himn when he was caught!! He said earnestly'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:53:22 2001] Maltyn says, 'In fact I locked it up in the stores myself!  Sweat began to trickle down his forehead.  Firiona continued to stare direclty at him...her gaze unwavering'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:55:51 2001] Maltyn says, 'go bring this halfing here, Carson said in a stern voice...let me see for myself'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:56:33 2001] Maltyn says, 'There you see...we caught him red handed, said the chamberlain.  His face was very flush by exertion and his ernest assertions'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:57:04 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona peered at the so called evidence and held a bottle up to the light'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:57:22 2001] Maltyn says, 'YEs it does indeed appear to be blackburrow stout, as she lowered the bottle back into the case'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:57:43 2001] Maltyn says, 'You say my little friend smuggled this?  How long is his jail sentence?'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:58:09 2001] Maltyn says, 'Carson's btow furrowed....Sentence?? Hell sit down there until he rots as far as I am concered!'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:58:24 2001] Maltyn says, 'Rogues like that are not to be trusted...particularly halflings!'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 22:59:31 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firionas expression grew bland and she tilted her head to one side...No trial has been had yet?'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:00:20 2001] Maltyn says, 'TRIAL!! said Carson with such laughter that it shook the bottles in the case...for a HALFLING SMUGGLER?!?!?  I will not waste my time!'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:01:08 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona's eyelids lowered slightly and her voice was very soft as she spoke'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:02:09 2001] Maltyn says, 'Then perhaps I can arrange for a judge to come here and hear his case. I will represent him myself. He can have a jury as well.  I know you are a fair and honorbale man, McCabe. And I know you to be just, as well.'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:02:20 2001] Maltyn says, 'It will be no trouble at all. I will see to everything personally'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:02:59 2001] Maltyn says, 'Carson sputtered and spat as his face turned a deep shade of crimson.'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:03:11 2001] Maltyn says, 'Oh dear, if you must firiona, then you must'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:06:09 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona responded kindly and said Nonsense Carson!  Id be happy to do it in the interest of justice.'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:06:31 2001] Maltyn says, 'She smiled sweetly and looked toward the case of stout...you dont mind if I take this for safekeeping?'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:07:15 2001] Maltyn says, 'Carson's puzzled frown disappeared in a resigned smile when he could think of no reason to deny her andhe nodded his assent'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:07:43 2001] Maltyn says, 'Certainly my dear!  Dont drink it all in one sitting now!  He chuckled at his own joke'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:08:51 2001] Maltyn says, 'Three days later Firiona had assembled 12 jurors from the surrounding countryside and the visiting judge, a retired soldier, Furgly Wiggins in the great hall of High Keep Castle'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:09:34 2001] Maltyn says, 'Avelion had been appointed as the prosection and Firiona was prepared with her defense'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:10:11 2001] Maltyn says, 'Furley, a grizzled veteran of many battles, was sitting comfortably in a velvet cushioned chair behind a large table'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:10:46 2001] Maltyn says, 'Two guards walked in with Dreezil between the, his wrists bound to a length of wood that he carried upon his shoulders'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:11:46 2001] Maltyn says, 'Dreezil, looked pained and a dejected expression was upon his face that was normally cheerful'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:13:47 2001] Maltyn says, 'Judge Wiggins pulled a dagger from his belt and rapped the table with the base of its hilt'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:15:19 2001] Maltyn says, 'Citizens I would like to finish the story....but the citizens of the server are calling quite loudly now and I must give them some attention'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:15:59 2001] Maltyn says, 'Can we finish the story this Saturday evening...perhaps around 5pm PST?'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:17:06 2001] Maltyn says, 'OK back here Saturday at 5pm PST then...hat is 6pm MST&lt; 7pm CST, 8pm EST'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:18:06 2001] Maltyn says, 'I thank you for your attentive ears and hope to see you back Saturday..tell others that Dreezil is about to be tried and his advocate is Firiona herself'<br>
[Thu Jul 19 23:18:28 2001] Maltyn says, 'Be well citizens'<br>

Thanks for posting this.  It was very intriguing to be there.  I was upset I had to log before he was though (can you believe he took almost an hour and a half to tell this much?). <br>
<br>
Now it will be continued again when I cant be there (and most of the officers will have to leave within an hour).<br>
<br>
I hope someone else will be there and keep a log so we can hear the rest of the story.<br>
<br>
Thanks again;<br>

Here is the second half of the story. Hope you all enjoy it. The whole point to the story is a very good one. Ya just never know what is lying behind the cover of that book!<br>
<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:05:57 2001] Maltyn says, 'The name of the Judge was Wiggins I do beleive'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:06:15 2001] Maltyn says, 'and he said...Settle down, now, settle down!'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:06:24 2001] Maltyn says, 'He tried to get the attention of the assembly'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:07:02 2001] Maltyn says, 'The jurors murmered as they settled in their seats...Firiona stood quietly and watched while the room grew queit and then stepped forward'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:08:02 2001] Maltyn says, 'Your Honor...I want to thank you for allowing us to present this case before you, and for taking the time to travel here from Rivervale for this purpose. If you will permit me, I woul like to explain the details of the case before you today'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:09:37 2001] Maltyn says, 'Dreezil Pocketdip here who is a resident of Rivervale and is an ackknowledged member of the Deeppockeyts guild there has been accused of smuggling'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:09:56 2001] Maltyn says, 'To be more precise, he is accused of smuggling one case of Blackburrow stout.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:11:35 2001] Maltyn says, 'ahh yes...His accusers are int he courtroom today as is Dreezil himself'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:12:48 2001] Maltyn says, 'your honor, I beleive what has happened here is that the defendent has been accused strictly on the basis of circumstantial evidence - evidence which in and of itself, is not sufficient to demonstrate the commission of any crime'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:13:36 2001] Maltyn says, 'As the defendants counsel, Your Honor, I will be attempting to show how the vents occurred which led to Dreezils arrest and inarceration'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:14:12 2001] Maltyn says, 'I beleive the Jury will see that Dreezil was not involved in smuggling, but rather, was attempting to assist the authorities here in High Hold Pass in their efforts to end smuggling.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:14:42 2001] Maltyn says, 'furthermore, I will try to demonstrate that there are in fact other parties involved in inferious and illegal activities right here in Highkeep'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:15:34 2001] Maltyn says, 'The onlookers then began to murmur amongst themselves at this revelation'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:16:05 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona looked over at Carson Mcabe and noted with satisfaction the mild look of surprise on his face'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:16:41 2001] Maltyn says, 'She turned back to the judge and said, your honor, I think you for allowing us to appear before you today.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:17:02 2001] Maltyn says, 'The high elf sat down and folded her hands in her lap, looing over at Arvelion'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:17:20 2001] Maltyn says, 'The chamberlain/prosecuter stood up and faced the jury...'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:18:01 2001] Maltyn says, 'It is very simple ladies and gentlemen...this halfling rogue (said with obvious distaste) was caught with evidence in his hand just outside Highkeep.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:18:37 2001] Maltyn says, 'After I have produced my witnesses and you have heard their testimony, there will be no doubt in you minds that he is indeed guilty of smuggling blackburrow stout'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:19:22 2001] Maltyn says, 'I am certain you will see your way clear to finding him guilty as charged and this rogue deserves to be punished for her crimer and activities.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:19:39 2001] Maltyn says, 'I thank you too, your honor and members of the jury for allowing us to appear before you.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:20:09 2001] Maltyn says, 'He turned back to Firiona and smirked, smuggly anticipating his easy victory'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:21:38 2001] Sayah says, 'Your honor I would like to present you the evidence .'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:21:41 2001] Maltyn says, 'There is a certain case of Blackburrow stout in the possession of the defendant's counsel that I would ask she produce at this time'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:22:56 2001] Maltyn says, 'Arvelion sneered at Firiona.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:23:19 2001] Maltyn says, 'She returned his glance blandly and stood, easily lifting the wooden case and carrying it over to the judge's bench'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:24:12 2001] Maltyn says, 'At the prosecution's request, I present to you the case of blackburrow stout into evidence at this time'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:24:48 2001] Maltyn says, 'The judge looked down, one eye blinking slightly. He montioned to Firiona to place the case on the floor near his seat, behind the bench'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:25:12 2001] Maltyn says, 'Very well, said Judge Wiggins.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:25:28 2001] Maltyn says, 'It can remain here until it can be properly identified by witnesses'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:25:47 2001] Maltyn says, 'He peered down at this side where the case lay just out of sight behind his bench'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:26:03 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona smiled and returned to her seat'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:26:24 2001] Maltyn says, 'Now then said Arvelion, I would like to call one Guard Heptal to the stand if you please'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:26:50 2001] Maltyn says, 'a Tall guardsman moved to the front of the courteoom and took his place in front of the jury'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:30:09 2001] Maltyn says, 'Judge Wiggins looked down glaringly from his bench at Guard Heptal and said, you must speak the truth by your oath of fealty and your honor as a guardsman, do you understand?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:30:57 2001] Maltyn says, 'Heptal nodded quickly.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:31:17 2001] Maltyn says, 'Arvelion faced him and cleared this throat delicately before beginning'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:31:53 2001] Maltyn says, 'Heptal, please tell us under what circumstances you met the accused, if you would?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:32:22 2001] Maltyn says, 'The tall guards face reddend slightly as he was not accustomed to speaking in public'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:33:00 2001] Maltyn says, 'Well ou see...I was comin out of the gate to take my place of duty, y'know'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:33:25 2001] Maltyn says, 'Walkin' up t' th' gates and grinnin''<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:33:53 2001] Maltyn says, 'so I says to m'self, I says, hmmmm...somehin's funny about that one, I just know it'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:37:03 2001] Maltyn says, 'So I walks up to him and I says HOLD!!! Tat's what we says to strangers ya know.  So he stops and i looks and sure enough, there he is, big as day, holdin' a case o' Blackburrow Stout, he was!'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:37:28 2001] Maltyn says, 'I know that's got to be smuggled, sinc it isnt legal here in Highkeep or parts hereabouts'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:37:56 2001] Maltyn says, 'So I takes and arrests him, your lordship sir.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:38:13 2001] Maltyn says, 'And there he sits, plain as day, right over there.  He points at Dreezil'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:44:23 2001] Maltyn says, 'Dreezil frowned unhapppily'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:44:44 2001] Maltyn says, 'The judge ducked down behind his bench, momentarily out of sigh of all the onlookers.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:45:10 2001] Maltyn says, 'A tiny pop and hiss could be heard if you were close enough, though no one but Dreezil actually was'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:45:37 2001] Maltyn says, 'He tilted his head to one side slightly and looked over puzzled'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:46:37 2001] Maltyn says, 'The judge popped back up and Dreezil could see a slight flush on his face from the close distance'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:47:29 2001] Maltyn says, 'Arvelion continued...How did he say he had come by the contraband Heptal? Would you please tell the court?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:47:53 2001] Maltyn says, 'Well, um...Heptal hesitated...'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:48:39 2001] Maltyn says, 'I didnt exaclty...er...well, y'see, I didn't question him m'self, y'know. I took himt'Carson Macabe y'see, an' he told me t' put th' rogue in a cell, is what happened, y'know.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:49:05 2001] Maltyn says, 'but the only place he could've got it is from some gnoll in blackburrow o'course'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:49:30 2001] Maltyn says, 'Everbody knows where it comes from y'see, and' so that's where he must've got it'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:49:50 2001] Maltyn says, 'Have you ever seen this kind of contrband before, Heptal?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:50:47 2001] Maltyn says, 'Yup, I sure have, yer chamberlainship, I sure have. They always runnin it through the pass, those gnolls, That Guurich, o'er in Misty Thickey, he's part o' this, y';can count on it, y'can'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:51:27 2001] Maltyn says, 'So you are somewhat of an expert on this smuggling ring, then eh, Heptal?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:52:00 2001] Maltyn says, 'The guard preened visibly, I am at that y'know. Yes I am!'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:52:27 2001] Maltyn says, 'Arvelion smiled and turned to Firiona. You may cross examin if you wish m'ylady'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:53:19 2001] Maltyn says, 'firiona stood up and walked over to Guard Heptal.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:54:07 2001] Maltyn says, 'Thank you Arvelion, and thank you too, Guard Heptal, for your expert witness here today. I see you have had a lot of experience uncovering and breaking smuggling rings, eh?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:54:33 2001] Maltyn says, 'Heptal grinned back...openly admiring Firiona.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:55:16 2001] Maltyn says, 'Yes, my'lady, if I do say so m'self, I have probably done more than any other guard in Highkeep t'keep things sage that way. Yep. That's what I'd say.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:55:40 2001] Maltyn says, 'You said you saw the defendant heading toward the gates when you first saw him correct?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:56:42 2001] Maltyn says, 'Heptal nodded enthusiastically. Yep, That's what he was doin. Headin' right toward th' gate. Funniest thing I ever saw. Him smugglin' an' headin' right toward a guard. He chuckled..'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:57:09 2001] Maltyn says, 'Do you often see smugglers walking right up to the gates with incriminating evidence in their hands for you to seize?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:57:55 2001] Maltyn says, 'Heptal looked a bit confused. Well, no, o'course not my'lady.That's what's so funny about it. He just walked right up and let me arrest him. Oddest thing I ever seen, it was.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:58:32 2001] Maltyn says, 'As he spoke, the judge chortled to himself softly. He ducked his head uner his desk again for a moment or two while all eyes wee on Firiona dn the witness'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:59:28 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona continued....Did it occur to you that perhaps ther might be something more to the defendants presence than met the eye?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 20:59:39 2001] Maltyn says, 'that perhaps he was not in fact a smuggler'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:01:15 2001] Maltyn says, 'That perhaps he was not in fact smuggling, but rather that he might have been attempting to produce evidence against some other perpertrator'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:02:33 2001] Maltyn says, 'Te guard stammered then coughed a little.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:02:56 2001] Maltyn says, 'well nom my'lady, o' course it didnt. He is a rogue after all. I mean you can see he wears the guild emblem.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:03:19 2001] Maltyn says, 'Rogues dont helpt he guards y'know'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:03:49 2001] Maltyn says, 'He laughed in wonder, trying to imagine anyone not knowing that'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:06:08 2001] Maltyn says, 'So you assumed then that since Dreezil was a rogue he also was a smuggler, is that it?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:06:26 2001] Maltyn says, 'Of course it is! Heptal looked at Firiona in surpised confusion.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:07:28 2001] Maltyn says, 'Judge Wiggins leaned down behind his bench for a bit and came back up with his face flushed red. He put his hand over his mouth to muffle a belch.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:08:10 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona looked over and grinned slighly. She nodded to herself and turned back to Arvelion. Would you care to cross-examine, Lord Chamberlain?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:08:45 2001] Maltyn says, 'Why firiona, I thin the prosecution has made its case rather well already, thank you. The Chamberlian smiled down his nose at firiona'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:10:14 2001] Maltyn says, 'That will be all, you may step down.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:10:38 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona watched as Guard Heptal stepped down and march back to his seat on the front bench.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:10:53 2001] Maltyn says, 'She then turned to the judge and said, At this time I'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:11:08 2001] Maltyn says, 'would lke to call CArson Mccabe to the stadn, your Honor'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:11:44 2001] Maltyn says, 'Carson moved up to the witness stand and stood quietly'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:12:16 2001] Maltyn says, 'The judge nodded at him and said You knowth tha'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:12:37 2001] Maltyn says, 'you mus' spek th' truth, 'ere, an' nothin' els' eigh'?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:13:07 2001] Maltyn says, 'Carson frowned up at the judge, but only nodded his compliance'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:13:52 2001] Maltyn says, 'Judge Wiggins smiled blearily and ducked down behind his bench for a moment. Carson's frown mad ean upside-down V in the skin over his nose'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:15:18 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona stepped up to Carson Mccabe, distrcting him. Carson, do you recall the occasion on which ou first saw the defendant?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:16:42 2001] Maltyn says, 'Well as you can see...this went back and forth between CArson and Firiona for some time...both to the reason why he was incarcerated without a trial, held in a dungeon trained etc'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:17:09 2001] Maltyn says, 'Carson became more and more angry with each question till he was literally shouting his answers back spitefullt at Firiona'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:18:01 2001] Maltyn says, 'She asked one final question...Did you Carson McCabe examine the evidence yourself?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:18:22 2001] Maltyn says, 'He angrily answered NO!!! I did not'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:18:44 2001] Maltyn says, 'She replied then, then you dont truly know what was in the case is that correct?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:19:12 2001] Maltyn says, 'Yes THAT IS CORRECT!'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:19:31 2001] Maltyn says, 'Carsons sheepish expression fitted him oddly'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:19:56 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona smiled at her friend, Dreezil.'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:20:23 2001] Maltyn says, 'Well perhaps we shoudl take a moment to look at the evidence in question at this time.  Your honor...'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:20:39 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona looked up at the empty bench...Your honor?????'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:21:01 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona approached the bench and walked around it to the other side where the case of stout had been sittting'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:21:18 2001] Maltyn says, 'The judge suddenly popped back into view...his face red and grinning'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:21:27 2001] Maltyn says, 'Yesh, what izh it?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:21:33 2001] Maltyn says, 'teh judge slurred'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:21:50 2001] Maltyn says, 'He reached down and lifted the wooden box up which rattled loudly'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:22:08 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona quicly grabbed it, fearing it would fall'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:22:15 2001] Maltyn says, 'She placed it atop the desk and looked over it'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:22:43 2001] Maltyn says, 'All the others had been emptied'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:23:02 2001] Maltyn says, 'She peered up at the judge, her expression bland'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:23:29 2001] Maltyn says, 'She picked up the remains and took them over to  Carson...is this the  case you saw the defendant carrying?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:24:19 2001] Maltyn says, 'Well I didnt actually see him with it...the guards told me that he had ot'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:25:00 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona picked up the box and carried it over to Dreezil and placed it on the ground'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:25:37 2001] Maltyn says, 'It was easy to see that the halfling would have a difficult time carrying even a few full ceramic bottles of the potent brew in a heavey wooden box like this'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:26:07 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona asked that Dreezil be unshackeled'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:26:18 2001] Maltyn says, 'She then instructed Dreezil to pick up the box'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:26:51 2001] Maltyn says, 'Dreezil knelt at the knees and tried to reach the sides of the box to pick it up...but his short arms just would not reach'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:27:23 2001] Maltyn says, 'Try as he might he could not get his arms around the box to pick it up!'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:28:05 2001] Maltyn says, 'Firiona said...you see your honor, Dreezil could not have very well carrie this box now could he?'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:29:02 2001] Maltyn says, 'With this new light and evidence the Judge stood, pounded his  dagger hilt on the table and Yelled ORDER!'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:29:27 2001] Maltyn says, 'This is not a case of smuggling, but a clear case of a frame up based on circumstantial evidence!'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:30:20 2001] Maltyn says, 'I hereby release Dreezil and order that he be compensated for his time being held against his will in these dungeons'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:30:48 2001] Maltyn says, 'This shall come from the treasury of Highkeep. Dreezil you are free to go!'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:31:12 2001] Maltyn says, 'A resounding cheer went up around the courtroom as Dreezil was in shock'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:31:45 2001] Maltyn says, 'Dreezil and Firiona walked out of the courtroom hand in hand'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:33:23 2001] Maltyn says, 'Or you may find him in the company of Firiona'<br>
[Sat Jul 21 21:33:58 2001] Maltyn says, 'I hope you enjoyed this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>
