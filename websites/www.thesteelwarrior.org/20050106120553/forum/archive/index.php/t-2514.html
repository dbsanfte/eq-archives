<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gotten the SoBs and paired it with red epic, its very nice aggro. However I note in PoP lots more riposte damage when using 1hs. I've been using 2hs epic,  GoT, and Windblade and noticed about the same aggro from all three. The Windblade seems to make up in dps aggro what it lacks in Proc.<br />
<br />
Now I see the 2hs bloodsworn. Its 30/32, slightly worse than GoT (31/30), but procs acrimony, which seems to be a mana/hp draining dot. I wonder if this is a good aggro weapo? Has anyone tested it? I guess you could say why switch off from GoT, but I get bored with the same weapons, heh. A proccing 2hs weapon with better ratio than epic appeals to me if it is good aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Noone answered, so when I saw one for 6k I just figured I'd try it.<br />
The shaman in my group swears its the best aggro I have compared to 2HS epic, GoT, Windblade, SoB/Red epic combo. The shaman was never summoned when I used this whereas once in a while was summoned with the others.<br />
<br />
The &quot;acrimony&quot; spell procs enough so that mobs are almost continuously dotted. <br />
<br />
Setup: 65 warrior 59 shammy 58 cleric 59 ranger killing Desert giants/Cave frogs in P of Storms. The shammy would slow, malo, cripple, bane of nife x3 and cast DD on the giants...was totally ignored even when resisted.<br />
<br />
Kind of makes sense...&quot;acrimony&quot; sounds hateful...and it drops off the same mob that Verant planted one of the other new aggro weapons on. Maybe they invested this spell with a lot of hate.<br />
<br />
I hope some other people will try it out and see if they agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a bone spiked crusher wich is a nice weapon (link (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16495)) hopefully they fixed the picture there by now, it is showing the wrong weapon but the stats are there.<br />
<br />
In any case the weapon procs a 5 or 6 tic dot with a dd component and procs it often.  The down side here is if you are on a raid or even an exp group and get an add you can't try to keep its attention long enough for a mez to get off because the dot will proc and you will break mez.<br />
<br />
You would think that the situations would be rare and far between but for some reason it happens allot.  Just today a mob came on in, resisted a mez, went after the cleric of all people.  I AE tunt, it swings at me, i riposte and proc.  Now i have to tank two.<br />
<br />
I am bagging the weapon now for most uses.  It is now in my bag of DoT weapons for the rare uses they provide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm.. maybe this sword is worth investigating..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quakr - How frequently does it seem to proc?  and what is your dex normally..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It takes us about 3 minute 30 sec to kill a Desert giant. I'd say it procs 5-8 times in that fight. Since the proc lasts around 30 secs,  the mob is perma dotted. My dex in that situation is around 200. We don't have a chanter in my &quot;normal&quot; group so it isn't an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thats pretty good..  I dont have a GSoT, procs more or less often you'd say?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to hear more about this?  Any new findings guys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that damn sword has been irritating me in the bazaar; i was so close to buying one until my guildmate gave me a GSoT....<br />
from what has been said of it + cost of the item; sounds like one hell of a nice mid-higher level weapon for the populus.</div></div><hr />
