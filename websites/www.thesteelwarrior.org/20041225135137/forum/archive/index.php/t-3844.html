<br />
Well Ive been told..&quot;Hey, your keyboard broke...&quot;...By a cleric...<br />
&quot;Well, if you can hold aggro, then you can Tank&quot;... By a SK<br />
&quot;The Pally is is MT&quot;, and I was higher lvl then him and all he really did was sit on his high horse...<br />
<br />
Yes I am starting to see the inbalance in the classes...<br />
<br />
/forgive my ignorance :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Now that Ive just hit 64 and doing he 50/50 split on xp..have 10aa so far, Does AA make any real difference and anything you guys know that I should strive for...working on the second tab of aa points, hopefully there be some difference.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gladious</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes makes a gigantic difference.  Work on ND CA CS and raise your sta for even more hps.   You want to get hit less and have more hp for when you do get hit.  So you can make a great tank.  I assume you have run3 and regen3 all ready.  Those are important as well.  From what I have gathered it is best to work on your defensive AAs first before you go offensive but that is up to each player and how they like to play thier char.<br />

Get 65 first but then focus on the defensive AAs.  They're much more effective than teh offensive ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xiliz</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regen3 is the most usless AA ever.<br />
When your getting hit for 500+ do you really think that 3hp a tick is going to make any type of difference?<br />
Anyway, as silly as it sounds, if you want to increase your hps and smooth out your bank roll get metabilism3. then buy the stat increasing food...<br />
