<br />
:D<br />
<br />
You may also set up megelo and make all the skills maxed, then add a lvl and see what difference sta makes there, add a few points of sta and see the difference, Megelo has been right on with my in game stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, what I know:<br />
<br />
Level 54 = 5hp/sta<br />
Level 55 = 5.1hp/sta (i think, will check)</div></div><hr />

<br />
level/10 = HP per stamina<br />
<br />
lvl 50 = 5hp per stam<br />
lvl 55 = 5.5 per<br />
lvl 58 = 5.8 per <br />
<br />
you get the point.<br />
<br />
this is before ND as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Undafut</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HP per point of stamina is:<br />
<br />
HP = (ND* INT[Lvl x LM / 300 ])<br />
<br />
From my crib notes, taken from elsewhere  (I believe this is the formula Magelo uses):<br />
<br />
Total HP = INT [ND* (5 + INT[ Sta x Lvl x LM / 300 ] + INT[ Lvl x LM ])]<br />
<br />
ND is the multiplier bonus they use (Natural Durability, Physical Enhancement, etc; percentage based, so  ND = 1 for no mods, 1.1 for ND3) <br />
<br />
LM is a class and level dependent multiplier as indicated below:<br />
<br />
<br />
Level multipliers known:<br />
<br />
Monk, Rogue, Beastlord and Bard:<br />
Level 1-50: Levelmultiplier = 18<br />
Level 51-57: Levelmultiplier = 19<br />
Level 58-65: Levelmultiplier = 20<br />
<br />
Cleric, Druid, Shaman:<br />
Level 1-65: Levelmultiplier = 15<br />
<br />
Magician, Necromancer, Enchanter and Wizard:<br />
Level 1-65: Levelmultiplier = 12<br />
<br />
Ranger:<br />
Level 1-57: Levelmultiplier = 20<br />
Level 58-65: Levelmultiplier = 21<br />

Level 35-44: Levelmultiplier = 22<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">more accurate formula ( shamelessly stolen from magelo forums ). this formula is exact, with 1 small problem : they are still trying to figure out when are the TRUNC. until now, this is the best they have :<br />
<br />
HP = TRUNC[ 5 x ND ] + TRUNC [ Lvl x LM x ND ] + TRUNC [ TRUNC [ ( STA - TRUNC [(STA-255)/2] ) x Lvl x LM / 300 ] x ND ] <br />
<br />
Where the term TRUNC [(STA-255)/2] is always 0 or greater (i.e. when STA is below 255, it is considered equal to 0). LM is a class and level dependent multiplier as indicated in previous post</div></div><hr />

<br />
My warrior is lvl 33 with 1405hp/144stam equipped.  I don't know his naked hp but his naked stam is 100.<br />
<br />
If you could please repost one of the formulas with my numbers inserted, I would greatly appreciate it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my 'TRUNC' and Undafut's 'INT' means truncated and integer , and mean you remove the decimal part of the number : 1.2 becomes 1, 10.999 becomes 10 ( it is truncated and not rounded), ...<br />
<br />
<br />
back to your 33 warrior with 144 stamina : ND = 1, LM = 25, Lvl=33, so<br />
HP = [ 5 x 1 ] + [ 33 x 25 x 1 ] + [ [ ( 144 - 0) x 33 x 25 / 300 ] x 1 ] <br />
HP = 5 + 825 + 396<br />
HP = 1226hp , more hps from your stuff = 179 = 1405 hps. luckily i get same result than magelo , using same formula they use :)<br />
<br />
and on your magelo profile :<br />
 Base Direct Indirect Total <br />
1105 179 121 1405 <br />
<br />
Base is your naked HPs , Direct is hp from stuff , Indirect is hps u gain from going from 100 to 144 stamina ( with stuff ).</div></div><hr />

Thanks for clearing that up Sylviania, makes much more sense now.  I was thinking that TRUNC and INT were some &quot;magic number&quot; that everyone just knew.<br />
Now if I could just figure out why I'm missing 23ac on Magelo.  I double checked all my gear and updated all my skills.  In game says 675 ac, magelo only comes up with 652..../shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is that with buffs? On the main character update page on Magelo, it has a spot to inflate your AC based on ingame discrepancy. Apparently they haven't gotten that formula correct yet. When I set mine up origonally, my AC was right on, but my ATK was 1 pt lower then it was supposed to be. <br />
<br />
Check these out, and it will fix the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
level/10 = HP per stamina<br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
If you look at my profile, it shows an indirect increase of 93 HP with STA having been increased by 36 points. 93 / 36 = 2.58<br />
<br />
level / 10 = 3.1<br />
<br />
Not trying to flame or cause an argument, but where is this discrepancy coming from?<br />
<br />
(BTW the HP total is correct from ingame as of last night)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The stamina / 10 formula is a good rule of thumb but it isn't completely accurate. The modifier is applied at alternating levels, not at every level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nyyhte</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks so much for all of your help on this subject. I should have been more specific and said I was looking for an estimate. The Level/10 is good for me. Did a little research myself last night. I am level 34 and **3 sta difference worked out to 9 hp**. Thanks again Steelwarriors is my Warrior encyclopedia of info. u guys rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as i said in my post , they still have problem finding where is truncation, leading to that +/- 1 error ( for AC , atk , Hp, ...), and they are missing the AC modifiers for iksars and for monks too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elamap</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm... as a 65 enchanter I did a little experiment. <br />
<br />
According to the formula deltaHP = ND * INT[Lvl *LM/300] * deltaSTA<br />
<br />
I have ND3 so ND = 1.1; INT[65*12/300] = INT[2.6] = 2<br />
<br />
So deltaHP = 2.2*deltaSTA<br />
<br />
I put on a strictly +5 Sta necklace (gold bloodstone) but deltaHP=15<br />
<br />
I put on a +9 sta necklace (gold opal) and deltaHP= 26<br />
<br />
What did I do wrong? or what am I misunderstanding. <br />
<br />
thanks in advance, Elamap of Karana Server</div></div><hr />
