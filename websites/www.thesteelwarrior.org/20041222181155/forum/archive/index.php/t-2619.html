To my knowledge, there is no real way of determining if the ring is &quot;up,&quot; meaning completing the ring will actually net any loot other than some Runes. Maybe I'm missing something, I don't know, but why the hell is it like this? What is the point of doing this? if there's something I'm missing, please enlighten me, because from the looks of it, it's little more than an annoying way for guilds to never trully determine when a ring is up or not, and allow one guild to pretty much control the ring spawns on a server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 It's just a stupid thing, just like PoAir. Should have been fixed/changed long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, we always have to ask the HKs what they cleared in PoE the morning of server ups, so that we know what we can do w/o wasting all of our time.  Had this issue last night, but luckily we found out and switched from the Rock to the Mud ring... netted a SEWS and SEM.</div></div><hr />

lol, i cant believe i posted that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beeffy Jeerky</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah  no way to tell if the ring is up other than timing it and trying it. and what is worse is the pH is harder than the real guy, at least in POE.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skycrasher</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that if 'A Dusty Warder' or whatever is up, then the Dust ring (Perfected Warder of Earth) that's it, and I even doubt that's right, just something I noticed everytime we've done it<br />
<br />
Everyone is right, Wilhelmm, there is no way to really check if they are up, just gotta kinda go for it, it's not that bad, the only one that really sucks is the vine ring, because it takes so damn long to do sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">'a dusty warder' (or several if your POE is really hosed) is almost always up.  I have seen 4 at once, each one of them will trigger the dust ring as well, regardless if another ring has been started.</div></div><hr />

Saves everyone a ton of time each night and I can't remember the last time we raced for a mob.<br />
<br />
To echo what has been said there is no way to tell if the rings are up unless someone told you when they were last killed.</div></div><hr />

I forget what theyre called..i think a frenzied vegarog or someshit.  Not sure if it can be used to tell what version of the ring will spawn tho.<br />

I hate when the game hickups and your guild does too much dps to rumbling rocks or whatever (4 red guys on stone ring) and they die instead of reseting blowing the ring for a few hours!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if you can do enough damage to the Sludge Lurker so it wouldn't split at 20% and save you the time of one wave of junk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that would just bug the ring phantron, because the script goes as far as I can tell something like this (Using 8 as a number i'm not sure how many mudlings there are per round)<br />
<br />
if mudlings killed ad +1 to mudlingKillCount<br />
if mudlingkilldcount = 8 then spawn SludgelurkerB<br />
AND reset mudlingkillcount<br />
if sludgelurkerB HP is below 60%, then spawn 8 Mudlings<br />
if mudlingkilled add +1 to mudlingkillcount<br />
if mudlingkilcount = 8 Then spawn SludgelurkerC<br />
<br />
etc etc</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is not true.  There is no way to tell what rings are up or not, same with the avatars and related things in Air.<br />
<br />
And yes it sucks.</div></div><hr />

Actually, there is. Just not a &quot;legal&quot; way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
