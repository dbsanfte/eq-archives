Which do you think is the better of the 2 (I know there are more but I am just tlaking about these 2!) fast food estiblishments?<br />
<br />
I prefer McDonalds myself.  Nothing like sitting down to a Big Mac and grabbing a 20 peice box to take home for late night raid snackage!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah...i prefer McDonald's myself</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that's not a viable choice, then Wendy's<br />
<br />
If I simply must choose one of those two, then McDonalds for the 20 piece Chicken nuggets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really, really hate fast food.  I prefer my own cooking.  If I HAD to have fast food from one of the two, I'd pick McD's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like to cook also, but have one kitchen to share w/ about 100 other people = not cooking often or at all.  I usually just buy a ton of frozen dinners and cans of soup and heat up something when I get hungry.  Saves me time, and since I am never sure when I will be done work its hella easier to just do that then try to plan out a full meal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hardee's is a special treat 2/3lbs of beef = heaven on earth. with currly fries omg.<br />
<br />
eat in it's dominos large deepdish PJO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Burger King burgers are the highest in fat and calories than any other fast food chain.  BK also ranked lowest of any major fast food chain on cleanliness.<br />
<br />
That said, their burgers are pretty good.  I try to stay away from all those places tho, that stuff will kill you.<br />
<br />
I really wish they had Hardees down here, becuase sometimes you just need a mushroom and swiss burger and they are the only ones that have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Neither. I'll make a sandwich instead.<br />
<br />
As for Hardees, I lived in Augusta, GA for about 13 years and they had atleast 10 Hardees in the area. They used to be the absolute worst fast food restaurant, especially the hamburgers. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what was in them, but they didn't taste right. Sorta like they put spam in or some other filler, but they boasted 100% beef like everyone else. It mighta been all beef, but not ground steak. I especially liked the commercial where they fessed-up to being crappy food and decided to use angus beef. Haven't heard from them since, but judging by the reactions here they have done a full 180.<br />
<br />
Out of the 10 original restaurants only 2-3 were still open when I moved in 99'.<br />
<br />
edit: Just checked online and there are still 2 of them, but they used to be all over the place. One road even had 2 of them about a mile apart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't think there is a single hardees left anywhere near me.. Wendy's spicy chicken &gt; *<br />
<br />
Burger King Bacon Double = good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Back when I was still willing to eat in fast food places I liked BK because it was cooked over a fire, and you just cant beat meat (or whatever it is) cooked over a flame.  Since I've been actually eating like a bodybuilder is supposed to I just avoid them.  Tried one of Hardee's new burgers once and it was pretty tasty for a fast food burger, far superior to Mickey D's. <br />
However, there's a little locally owned short order place across the street from my job that makes some outstanding burgers.  They use real meat, cook on a flat top grill, and their portabello mushroom and swiss burger makes one hell of a good cheat meal on Fridays. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually now that I think about it... Culvers &gt; *</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I remember Hardee's wanted to be an everything fast food restaraunt, they had fried chicken, roast beef and just about everything else.  They have since scrapped all that and just went back to being a burger place.</div></div><hr />

The roast beef sandwiches had that funky spam-like flavor I was talking about in my previous post. Maybe its just too hard to put fake stuff in a chicken leg.;)<br />

BK microwaves ever shamich they make, which makes it slightly soggy. No way can you successfully nuke a burger the same way every time. Besides... McD's adds sugar to it's buns for added flavor...mmm mmm good.</div></div><hr />

I'll just go hungry for a night before I eat at one of those places (In-n-out is an exception...or would be, if there was one near me).</div></div><hr />

<br />
but McDonalds is the better then Bk  because simply  2 things. The ice cream cone and 1 dollar mcChickens</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Marduka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Big Kahuna Burger.  The Hawaiian burger joint :D</div></div><hr />

I'd go with Arbys.<br />
<br />
Then Quiznos then Subway.<br />
<br />
McD &gt; BK I think though, but I hate them both.</div></div><hr />

it's basically an open faced sandwich made with whatever ( you'll never eat the same one twice ) is on the grill after 2 am with a side of homefries and a coke for like $4.00<br />
<br />
McD's fries tho are the win. Plus the all-white meat McNuggets.</div></div><hr />

Oh man Albertos owns.  Even after they got busted by INS and one of their branches got caught with cats in the refrigerator, I still went there.  I really missed that place when I left Phoenix.  Carne Asada Burrito and the Chimichanga were awesome.  Albertos taught me that when it comes to Mexican food, the grubbier the place looks, the better the food is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where in Pa Tarn?  I am from the King of Prussia/Philly area and have never heard of it.<br />
<br />
Now someone mentioned Cheesesteaks earlier and I still get into arguments w/ the few guildies I got from back there about which is better Pats or Geno's.  Personally I love Pats, but when I am back home I'll take whatever I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">The best Burger I've ever had would be from Rally's the Double Barbque Bacon Cheesburger &gt; All.  Man it's awesome if anyone has a Rallys around them should try it.  Coming in close 2nd would be the Mushroom and Swiss Burger from Hardee's it is pretty awesome to.  Also those new Atkin Wraps from Subway are pretty uber I eat them all the time.  <br />
<br />
If I had to pick between McDonalds and BK though Mickie D's all the way.  There is nothing BK can do better than McDonalds at least where I live.  BK fires suck it's like they cook a whole thing and use them all day always soggy and cold.  Burgers taste like shit.  Drinks are always flat.  McDonalds whew nothing beats a Big Mac and 20 Nuggets since the ones here are open 24 Hours.  <br />
<br />
Wendys ugh I don't know how anyone can like them besides just for there Frosties.  The ones here there Burgers are mega soggy there fries are half cooked there Frosties do own though.  Incase you all can't tell I eat Fast Food a lot :p.  Thats because never anything to eat at home.  Taco Bell is good I love there Steak Soft Taco and KFC sucks ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Ah how could I forget Dairy Queen they are the best fast food.  Nothing wrong I can find with them great burgers awesome fries great barbaque sandwiches and THE awesome Blizzards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a few of them about. I didn't think they were too spread out over the state or country, but around here, it's the busiest &amp; best place around for burgers or chicken sandwhiches.<br />
<br />
Comes with all you can eat steak fries. ya just can't beat that. LOL.</div></div><hr />
