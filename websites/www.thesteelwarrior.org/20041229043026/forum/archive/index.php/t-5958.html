<br />
With all the recent claims about which class tanks better than some other class, I decided it might be of interest to see exactly how the classes compare to each other when tanking. Most of the testing I did was to compare how the classes tank when using end game equipment. However, in certain cases I did test to see how the classes tanked at a much more attainable AC level.<br />
<br />
The tests were done tanking a Valorian Guard in Halls of Honor. Each class would tank the mob for 40-60 minutes at a time. This is about the duration of a LdoN adventure so should have some bearing on the performance of adventures. After having performed these tests, I am not sure what to think about how monks tank. Certainly the tests created a lot more questions than they answered.<br />
<br />
The classes that were tested all had max tanking AAs. Each class had virtue as their only buff. Each class was able to keep agro easily, without using any spells that decreased the mobs attack or attacking the mob, while being healed by a cleric. Each class was always facing the mob. The information below only applies to the punches from the Valorian Guard.<br />
<br />
         <br />
CLS   - Class<br />
AC    - AC with virtue<br />
SHLD  - Amount of shielding on items<br />
AVD   - Amount of avoidance on items<br />
DB    - Damage Bonus of the mob.  This is modified by shielding.<br />
DI    - Damage interval of the mob.  This is modified by warrior innate 5% reduction of the DI.<br />
MIT%  - 0% mitigation would be max hits every single time.  100% mitigation would be min hits every single time.<br />
ATKS  - Total number of punch attacks<br />
HIT%  - Hits that landed divided by total punch attacks<br />
MISS% - Misses divided by hits that landed plus misses not including blocks, parries, dodges, or ripostes<br />
BLK%  - Blocks divided by total punch attacks<br />
DDG%  - Dodges divided by total punch attacks<br />
PRY%  - Parries divided by total punch attacks<br />
RIP%  - Ripostes divided by total punch attacks<br />
DMG   - Avg damage taken per punch attack, basically AVG * HIT%. <br />
<br />
<br />
On top of the previous information, the warrior had a 8% riposte mod, monk had a 8% block mod, rogue had a 8% dodge mod. Also, the known magelos are linked to in their class name. Though some have changed since the test.<br />

So if we look at this we see that warrior &gt; monk &gt; Paladin &gt; shadow knight &gt; ranger &gt; rogue &gt; beast &gt; cleric &gt; shaman &gt; druid. Which doesn't seem so bad for us. However, there is certainly more to tanking than just taking damage. And in getting agro monks are severely lacking. Please look at the histograms provided to get a better sense of how each class mitigates. I don't think the mitigation numbers I provided give an accurate picture in the VERY large differences in mitigation across the classes. Also it can clearly be seen that some of the classes I used to test weren't as well equipped as others. I would expect a paladin and shadow knight to easily take less damage than a monk given the appropriate shielding equipment and armor class. This does not mean we make good tanks though. Far from it.<br />
<br />
However, with that information I would still expect that monks would take less damage than any other class except warriors, paladins, and shadow knights. Can't really argue with that, or can we?<br />
<br />
Now, of course some monks here are going to say that they can't obtain that type of equipment and that it is the non-raiding monk that is really hurting here. So I ran some more tests.<br />

<br />
*MNK This is where I took 35000 copper to remove all monk AC bonus and tanked. It removed 219ac from my monk. Was it mitigation AC or avoidance AC or both? No one knows. <br />
<br />
As you can see, at 1331 I mitigated nearly the same as at 1854 ac. The change was miniscule. Here is where we see a 'soft cap' on AC. I always thought the softcap would depend solely on the mob you were tanking. I thought you could keep piling on AC unitl you got to a point where the majority of hits were for min and thus you had your diminishing returns. It turns out that soft caps are on a per class basis. No matter how high my ac gets I do not think I could ever mitigate like a 1300ac warrior. Of course, I also bet rogues are susceptible to this mysterious softcap since they mitigate so poorly for having such high ac.<br />
<br />
Speaking of warriors. They mitigate damn well. In fact, that 1380ac warrior takes about as much DPS as does the 2066ac pally. But then the pally and shadow knight could still see significant gains in their ability to take damage, so that probably isn't such a big deal.<br />
<br />
Looking at the ranger you can see that they get fairly good gains in mitigation from increasing their ac. Something monks don't get.<br />
<br />
All of this does show that a non-raiding monk was in fact not hurt nearly as bad by the mitigation nerf as the raiding monk. They mitigate fine. They tank fine. 1331ac WITH virtue is not that hard to achieve. And I would imagine that the monk 'soft cap' is probably below this AC level. <br />
<br />
What I really hate about all this is that, I have no idea what AC does anymore. When does it become useless? And for which class? 20ac on my monk certainly doesn't do nearly as much for me as 20ac on a warrior. But go look for AC augs. We get 5ac they get 10ac. What is the point? The nerf has completely eliminated AC as an avenue to progress my character. And I don't see the need for it. At 1300ac I still get hit for max 13% of the time and at 1800ac I get hit for max 12% of the time (compared to 3% for 2200ac warrior or 6% for 1400ac warrior). I should still see gains from getting more ac. <br />
<br />
Besides from getting more hp, a monk can only get substantial gains in tanking from 3 items. One is the time tunic, the other is a quarm bracer, and the last are legs that drop from RZ in Time. Sure there is the TZ orb, but can't hardly see myself constantly swapping out my range. And I certainly won't tank using one handers, so shinai is out the window.<br />
<br />
Are monks a class meant to take damage? YES. Take a look at the quarm bracers and time BPs. These items have mods on them that make the class that gets them perform better at their job. Chain classes get an accuracy mod on their bracer and tunic, supposedly helping their melee dps. Monks get avoidance mods. Something that is only of value when taking damage from mobs. <br />
<br />
I don't see the need for a 'soft cap'. Just making ac worth less on certain classes is more than fine. I should be able to mitigate like a 1380ac warrior even if I have to get 2000ac to do so, but I can't under the current system. <br />
<br />
I still think monks should take the same damage as a warrior. We are still crippled by lots of max hits, almost no way to get agro (though keeping it is ok.), and lower hp. But that point is very hard to argue, since many people still see the best tank being the one that takes the least amount of damage. Which is hard to understand with all the hubub that surrounded hybrid agro generation compared to warriors.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">werdara</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very good study, but the results do seem skewed somehow.  Did I read the histograms wrong, or did a DRUID tank better than a BEASTLORD up there?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure the results can be totally accurate concerning AC, because I believe AA abilities change the importance of AC quite a bit.  Considering CA gives a flat % to dodge and CS gives a flat % to mitigate, once you have CA5 and CS5, we all know that you tank much much better than someone w/o.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say a Monk with 1500 AC and CA5, CS5 is going to tank way better than a warrior with 1500 AC that doesn't have ANY defensive AAs.  The hugely powerful defensive AAs to some point trivialize AC.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I don't have a way to test this theory, and I'm not sure anyone does.  Anyone got access to an Elemental+ geared monk with 0 defensive AA? :(   Or an Elemental+ Warrior also with 0 defensive AA? I hope not :p<br />
<br />
Then again, we're rarely worried about how well someone with no defensive AA tanks in the planes, so maybe its moot.  But I'm refusing to believe that monks have no incentive to get past 1300 AC, its just becomes unnecessary if you put the time into your AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Very good study, but the results do seem skewed somehow.

<br />
You read the histograms correctly. You'll also have to note that the druid has a lot of +AVOIDANCE, which is most likely making an impact, even for a druid.<br />
<br />
&quot;because I believe AA abilities change the importance of AC quite a bit. &quot;<br />
<br />
One of the conclusions from Thep's parse is that the importance of AC is quite meaningless for leather wearing classes, and that they are indeed soft-capped far below their plate counterparts.<br />
<br />
AS THEP STATES in his thread: &quot;The classes that were tested all had max tanking AAs. &quot;<br />
<br />
AAs don't really affect this data much at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm refusing to believe that monks have no incentive to get past 1300 AC, its just becomes unnecessary if you put the time into your AAs.&quot;<br />
<br />
As stated, all the toons had their defensive AAs. So putting the time in to get AAs is meaningless in the context of this data. And ... most monk/beastlord gear doesn't improve much in AC between Luclin and Planes of Power (and some key items go down in AC by quite a bit, such as pants).<br />
<br />
Anyways, you really should read the full thread at Monkly Biz. Thep gets very much in detail about the parses and answers many many questions about them.<br />
<br />
It's a fascinating thread.</div></div><hr />

what is this?  He's got warriors listed at 15 with all the other classes at 0 or 2.  If it modifies dmg per attack you end up taking by that %, then that alone accounts for the difference between paladins and warriors.

Shielding and Avoidance are both (worn) effects on armor found in Time and beyond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't know this had made it here.<br />
<br />
Shielding is the amount of shielding on the items of that warrior.  In this case each percentage of shielding took off one damage from each and every hit since the DB of this mob is ~100.  The paladin and SK I used in this test had very limited shielding.  The warrior put a lot of effort into getting that extra shielding.  However, if the kngihts had been as well equipped they would have had at least 10+ shielding which would have put them much closer to the warrior tanking.<br />
<br />
The only thing that really upsets me is that going from 1330ac to 1850ac (about 450 ac the rest was avoidance ac) netted a change of 4 damage on each hit.  (remember that I lost 2% shielding which accounts for 2 average damage.)  The warrior mitigated 35 damage by gaining about 900ac.  <br />
<br />
So 450ac on monk equals 4 less damage on a mob with a DI of 20.<br />
900ac on a warrior equals 35 less damage on a mob with a DI of 20.<br />
<br />
And the wierd thing is that the warrior is already mitigating far far far better at 1380ac than my monk at 1850ac, yet gaining ac beyond that point is about 4 times as effective as a monk gaining ac beyond that point.<br />
<br />
Why dont they remove the monk ac cap and just put 5-10 ac on all the monk items?  At least I would know what I was getting.<br />
<br />
Against those mobs I was fairly pleased with how well I tanked as a monk with 60 avoidance.  However, the new GoD mobs do seem to have a much higher hit % than previous mobs.  I haven't looked at it in detail, but this would seem to be a huge detriment to monk tanking since we rely so heavily on being able to be missed in order to tank.<br />
<br />
But who cares, right?  Monks don't tank.  =P  Or at least they don't now!</div></div><hr />

<br />
i would expect the war with lower ac to get more of a spread in the max, max -1, max -2... area. i see the 1% increases but didn't expect 5% difference all in max.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how you could complain about that.  60% avoidance?  That's some crazy good gear available for monks in Time.  <br />
<br />
Later you have a 1331 AC monk with no avoidance taking 148 per attack and a 1380 warrior taking 131.  That doesn't seem too bad.</div></div><hr />

Well, that does take into account avoidance, but yeah it seems fine.  The monk takes less damage than the knights simply because they don't have the shielding they would have if they were geared as well as the monk or warrior.<br />
<br />
I don't really care that much.  I don't tank.  Certainly not in god.  I just wish that I continued to tank better by increasing my ac.  Increasing my ac by 450 had no noticeable affect.  Only thing that matters to me is avoidance, shielding, and hp.  AC has become meaningless.  I run around at 50 weight with no regrets now.  It certainly doesn't effect my abilities at all.<br />
<br />
Monks lose tremendous ground on warriors and knights in the elemental planes and can't get close till they start getting avoidance again.  <br />
<br />
I just hate their combat system.  I hate that there are two peaks at min and max.  I hate that no matter how much AC I get I can never mitigate as well as a warrior 1400ac.  <br />
<br />
But in the end it doesn't really matter to me all that much. So.. /shrug</div></div><hr />

If they made your extra 450 AC mean something,  could that not mean monks would take damage better then warriors over time.  Now if you think that since monks have less hp's then warriors and knights it is ok for them to take less damage over time then any other class, then ok ask for it.</div></div><hr />
