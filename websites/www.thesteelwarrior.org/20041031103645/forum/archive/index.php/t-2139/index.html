<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I will be applying to a guild that requires a minimum cold, fire, and magic resist of 120 soon.  I am below 50 in each of those areas, and would like to know what some common resist gear sets I could find to push me up to 120 and their cost.  Also, does resist work with a 'flat rate', with a 10 MR item giving +10 resist, or like ac where a 10 ac item will give approximately 15ac?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">+10 gives +10, for resist gear you should consult your local jewelery grandmaster for various blue diamond and diamond stuff which raises resists up to 11pts per item. Your magelo might help too :P</div></div><hr />

Then there is the normal &quot;resist gear&quot; that everyone starts out with - none of it has AC or HPs but it will get you to the minimum resist needed.  <br />

There is a cazicite version of the above with better stats but it is very rare.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are MA, you'll want to wear your normal gear with a few exceptions.  If you are not MA, resists can be very important since clerics can't spare the mana to keep healing you from the AE if you are taking more damage than you should from it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but I looked and there isn't any.  Not that is common and droppable.  Most nice no drop stuff has good resists on it as well as stats - my cleric has 120 unbuffed with no resist gear - but for droppable stuff that the average person can pick up the above was all I could find.  <br />
<br />
Would love to see other stuff though!  My shaman needs resist gear...<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Thought of something - it isn't cheap but it is nice.  The imbued smithed armor has decent resists as well as overall stats.  It isn't cheap though although it isn't as bad since blue diamond prices have fallen.<br />
<br />
EDIT AGAIN:  Found these but they don't have a lot of resist on them - had originally searched for minimum +5 MR/FR/CR.  There are probably other items as well with resists that also have HPs but I dont' think many that have enough resists to count as resist gear.<br />

If you have the CoV faction, you can get the above with a single group (can probably duo it with a shaman or cleric depending on level) and it should take you under an hour.  Also needing CoV faction, BoB is worth getting for normal and resist wear and isn't lore so you can have two:<br />
