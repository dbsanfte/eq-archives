I tried surfing the Library for a post on this, but didn't find anything.  <br />

What items do you turn in for the most efficent return on tribute?  I know it used to be the HE Cultural armor and Cultural Tailored robes, but they appear to have been nerfed in the recent patches.   I do not have all that much cash, but if it turns out that platinum is the best return on tribute, then that is where I will head.  Any responses would be most welcome.</div></div><hr />

I know on innoruuk they go for 6-7kish so you may want to look into getting those</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plat is a horrible return on tribute, it's 1:1 ratio. I wouldnt want to spend 40pp every 10 minutes for 41% haste. Problem is telling people what is good to turn in for tribute usually ends up in the tribute value on those items being nerfed soon after.<br />
<br />
Gear that drops in LDoN is usally pretty good, but it's better to get the drops than to buy it these days because most now sell for more than theyre tribute value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But ya, in general, tradable LDoN items are the best in Tribute Value to Usefulness ratio. I think because all that crap has Minimum Level = 65. So that makes it seem harder to come by in the game sense, meanwhile players don't value it much because most level 65s have better, and those under 65 (especially twinks) can't use it. So Ldon crap goes for plat = 1/20 of its tribute value... except on many servers where going prices have adjusted up because of this. So ya just mow through some LDoNs for some good tribute loot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">08-01-2004, 03:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">beware. recently there was a patch that both improved tribute and nerfed it. the improvement was you can turn it off and on at will. that saves a lot of wasted tribute while standing around. the bad part is they nerfed a lot of tribute items. its probably a wash between the two but it makes it very important to remember to turn off your tribute when you dont need it now. i used to use a rule that an item was good for tribute if its tributes points were at least four times the cash cost. the items ive checked with the tribute master recently have all been nerfed far below that but i havent checked lucy or anything to see if all items were nerfed or just the ones i was commonly using.</div></div><hr />

Friends of mine used CUltural tribute to buff their tribute numbers before the patch, but now they are better off vendoring the items.  Unfortunately, there is a catch in publicizing anything with a good tribute cost, as it will likely be nerfed if people use it much... =/</div></div><hr />

Tae Ew chain legs were good for 10K tribute last I checked, and tunics 6K and both generally sell for less then 3K plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavelloc</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm lookin at that last it seems its better to just give plat as a trubute on druzzilro, lookin at the cobalt bp gives you 23k tribute but sell for like 35kpp on druzzil and goes for most of the stuff from 50 to 100 on the list there but druzzil ro's economy is so f'd up its not even funny</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not all of them have large tribute values.  Try junky things like: Defender's Lightblades, Greatstaffs of Thunder, Architect's Scepters.  You'll probably get 4:1 on all of these, though they're only in the hundreds.</div></div><hr />

Really?  I hadn't noticed worse gains from cultural tribute, a few days ago I did about 60 cultural combines (220+ trivial) and made about 30k tribute.  I don't farm all my pieces, I buy a lot of the temper stuff in bazaar, but I still do a lot better than getting a 1:1 plat-tribute ratio, and certainly better than selling the items back to vendor.   Certain slots give more than others, iirc vambraces give about 3x more tribute than helms which trivial a few points higher, so what is good for tribute isn't necessarily good for tradeskilling.  Did your friend just move up to a higher trivial item that gave less tribute?</div></div><hr />

Yoda's list looks like it's just a list of the top 100 tribute value items.  I wouldn't even begin to look at that list if I wanted to get tribute efficiently, having a high tribute value doesn't have anything to do with getting a good plat/effort to tribute ratio.  It's a nice list to look at, but it's pretty much worthless in regard to what the topic starter asked for.  Like Sassinak said, most of the efficient tribute items are going to be 100-1000pp items that go for 240-3000 tribute.</div></div><hr />
