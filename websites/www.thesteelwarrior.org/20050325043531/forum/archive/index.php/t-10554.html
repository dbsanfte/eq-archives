I use what ever the best possbile weapon is I can get my hands on no matter what the type is.  I'll bet there are gonna be mobs that take more damage from a daggar than a mace, or something like that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-06-2005, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the reason daggers &quot;suck&quot; (near as I can tell) is two fold: <br />
<br />
1) Their low speed makes their instant attacks reletively low damage compaired to the instant attacks from big slow weapons.<br />
<br />
2) Daggers generally have a lower DPS at their level vs other weapon types becuase rogues can get so much more DPS from them. <br />
<br />
Neither factor kept me from DW a pair of Glinting Steel Daggers when they were level appropriate and the best DPS I could find.</div></div><hr />

The low damage per hit is gimpifying to your instant attacks.  That being said, a fast dagger (or anything) makes a great offhand weapon to force more dodges.  If you don't have to apply instants into the forumla, dps is dps.</div></div><hr />

well tell me this then, do you think daggars suck?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, and besides tthat it is hard to find a better offhand weapon than some knives/daggers 90% of the time in DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also need to consider warriors don't get any dagger specialization ie. 5% Crit or Chance to attack twice or 5% extra dmg. The low dmg instant attacks can be offset with weapon switch, but a high crit percentage is what makes fast attck speed weapons viable dps sources since they usually only hit for 30-60dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gin</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only &quot;instant&quot; attacks that factor in weapon damage are Heroic Strike and Mortal Strike.  (Slam also does bu that is hardly worth bringing up.)  Retaliation will perform better with the highest damage weapon you can find, regardless of speed, however choosing a weapon based on a 30-min ability is unwise.<br />
<br />
I used the princess dagger from maraudon for quite a while.  The argument that fast, light weapons generate less rage over time is flawed.  While it is true they generate less rage per single hit, they hit more often.  Over time I guarantee it's a wash.<br />
<br />
In any case, I like daggers, even thoguh I dont currently have one.  I dont think there is any kind of &quot;penalty&quot; for using one as a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm Heroic Strike is based on delay. Overpower, however, is instand + weapon damage (and can be a big part of DPS with the +crit talents).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gin</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heroic Strike's damage is not based on delay.  It is the next weapon hit + X damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Overpower, however, is instand + weapon damage&quot;<br />
<br />
Overpower is just a free swing, it does not include any additional damage like HS.<br />
<br />
Overpower is delay-less, though, so the weapon with the biggest base damage is superior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong:<br />
<br />
Overpower (Rank 4)<br />
Instantly overpower the enemy, causing weapon damage plus 35. Only useable after the target dodges. The Overpower cannot be blocked, dodged or parried.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gin</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh good call.<br />
<br />
the additional damage of Overpower kinda makes faster weapons more viable, in that while each overpower will be for less, there will be more of them.  maybe.<br />
<br />
hard to say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overpower negates the dodge, which should happen more the faster you swing (10% dodge rate on 10 attacks = 1 dodge, but it's 2 dodges on 20 attacks), but you also only get to overpower 1 dodge per 6 seconds or whatever the cooldown is, so there is an upper limit on it's effectiveness.<br />
<br />
I think faster would be better, but only to a certain point.  A lot of times shit will dodge right after the overpower lands and then I can't get around to landing the second before it greys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An excellent point.  I have this happen all the time when I dual wield.<br />
<br />
Even though Overpower adds damage, I really don't think you're going to see 1handers beat out 2handers since it will take lots of +35 damages to equal the damage you're getting from that big 2hander hit.  <br />
<br />
For me (Prot spec), it really isn't worth bothering to dual wield and swap in a 2hander for Overpower unless my DW combo DRASTICALLY outshines my 2hander, which is only very rarely the case. <br />
<br />
Tinuvas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless you're getting enough dodges so that you have an extra Overpower that you can't use due to recast (assuming the cost of Overpower is negligible) 1H or 2H obviously comes out in favor of 1H for overpower damage.  <br />
<br />
Let's say a 2H has twice the delay and twice the damage as a 1H (even though that's being very generous). each Overpower will hit twice as hard, but you only get Overpower half as often with a 2H.  It comes out to be the same damage (actually 1H is more, because it's not just weapon damage).<br />
<br />
This of course assumes you're not swapping weapons for overpower.  This also ignores that if you dual wield you get way more than double the swings, even though your each overpower is still only 1/2 the strength as a 2H.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreary</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did think that I got more dodges when DWing, but when I checked cosmos after a longish grind, the DW dodge rage was the same as the 2h. What DW does let you do is &quot;buy&quot; main hand overpowers with your off hand.<br />
<br />
The number of overpower oppertunities will be higher, the percentage stays the same.</div></div><hr />

I still want to know if you think daggers suck or not (and of course why).</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Well if you had 1 1H versus 2H, you'd roughly expect double the opportunity for Overpower with 1H and 1/2 the damage.<br />
<br />
But with a second weapon you actually have about 4X the opportunity (I don't think you can ever fail to dual wield, unlike EQ) for Overpower with 1H at 1/2 the damage.<br />
<br />
If you assume a mob has 10% to dodge, with a 4s 2H weapon you're looking at one Overpower every 40 seconds, and 1 Overpower every 10 seconds for DW with 2 2s 1H weapons at 1/2 the damage. <br />
<br />
So DW actually should do a lot more Overpower damage than 2H.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes have used daggers and imagine that I will again. As a fury build with about a 1/3 chance of getting an extra rage every hit, having a fast off hand makes a lot of sence.<br />
<br />
The only thing mitigating that in my case is I am trying a crit build--which leaves my best options as axes or polearms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">R27</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres nothing wrong with daggers, the only real thing is that they usually have a bit lower durability, which can be annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thengel</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another advantage to daggers that I have seen listed here is that adding damage to them is generally more beneficial than adding to other weapons.  For instance a dagger with 1.5 delay that is the same base DPS as a sword with 2.5 delay will benefit much more by enchanting and/or sharpening stones applied to that dagger, making it a higher DPS weapon after the fact.  As a protection/fury spec with no MS I find myself using the fastest weapons I can find, which often times are daggers.  With a hotkey to weaponswap for overpower I can get the benefits of both worlds.<br />
<br />
Another advantage of fast weapons is when used in conjunction with heroic strikes.  If you ever find yourself with a lot of rage and not much to do with it (max sundered mob w/shouts used) spamming heroic strikes with a 1.5ish delay weapon can put out some pretty good damage.</div></div><hr />

Its great actually, Low delay is raping mobs... not much to say..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalidor1997</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">received deathstriker last night, 46 dps dagger with a proc that makes the next 3 seconds automatically both 1) land and 2) critical.  So I'm fighting in strathholme last night and I at least got the feeling i was actually less effective with this over a normal thrash blade.<br />
<br />
I'm a protective spec'd warrior, with full 1h weapon talents for an additional 10% dmg...no mortal strike, not much arms.  Going to run more tests later to see if I can figure out whats going wrong.  I'm striking fast and for decent amounts, generating rage quite a bit faster and more regularly...but the threat generated seems less.  Before I could sunder once or twice at beginning, then autoattack and pretty much maintain the threat over anyone else in group...but now with dagger I have to still periodically fire off a special to out aggro my groups rogue (who is dual wielding 41 dps weapons i think, dagger spec backstab rogue).<br />
<br />
Now, my dagger skill is at 298 right now...2 points shy of max.  My sword skill is of course maxed at 305...human racial trait bonus.  That could account for some of it, but I don't seem to be missing any more than normal (logs around 11%).  This dagger does crit though like a fiend....seeing easily twice as many crits (duh, go figure, 1.7 delay vs 2.7 delay).<br />
<br />
Still not totally sure if it was worth spending the points on, but hey, its nice having a purple weapon.</div></div><hr />
