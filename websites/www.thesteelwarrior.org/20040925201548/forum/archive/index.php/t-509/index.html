<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cartolis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night my guild did the ringwar in gd for one of our members.<br />
all the problems aside we got it done but wow did we get grief from some of the people in the zone.<br />
<br />
Now this is not so much about the people in the zone as it is the way verant/sony did the war, and more specifically the one or two idiots that insist on griefing the people trying to do the war.<br />
<br />
It all started off last night with the raid standing around for an hour /oocing and /shouting that a ring war was going to be starting, and the books and portals would be closed.<br />
<br />
the first tilthead that gave us problems decided that it would be fun to train the raid group with drakes. now for the group assembled this didnt pose that much of a problem, but the clown kept doing it, and then supposedly petitioned us for &quot; ksing his drakes&quot;<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
anyway the next issue was with people asking for punts after the war had begun.<br />
<br />
Knowing that we had shut off the only exits(minus the zoneouts)<br />
we stationed a wiz at thurg for punts.<br />
I thought that was a nice thing to do, in light of us shutting the zone down for the war. All we asked was that people not being agro to thurg. we even warned them to stay clear of the spearmen cause they suck alot.<br />
<br />
3 punts, 3 giants.<br />
<br />
now for thoes that have done the ringwar you may be thinking wipeout, but we managed to somehow pull it out from this.<br />
<br />
Then despite the /ooc and /shout broadcasts every 5 min someone pulls and kills a named dorf. <br />
As you can imagine we were a bit miffed at this. Now they had cost us loot on top of all the other heartache.<br />
<br />
Finally we got down to the last wave, and narandi spawns.<br />
<br />
after kiting him a bit we brought him to the main group for the last battle and I get this tell.<br />
<br />
noob: dude your guild sucks. you are hogging all the mobs. I petitioned you and several other members of your guild for kill stealing. enjoy the ban, dick<br />
<br />
Now, I understand that there are thoes among us that got fed lead paint chips by the shovel full as wee ones but damn.<br />
<br />
For thoes that are intrested my reply was simply &quot;I will :)&quot;<br />
<br />
the level of idiocy in this game never fails to amaze me.</div></div><hr />

Yine B*tch Lewt Whore....:D :eek: <br />
<br />
/Boggle @ .... I'm not sher.......SOE and the level of preparedness they show new folks (it's a Massive amount of info fer any true n00b), Or @ the level of sanity shown by some of these newer folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Troll are cool, they make outlandish comments just to spark a reaction. I did that when I was like 5 and learned a couple profanities, my mom beat that out of me soon after. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You should have set your punter up somewhere away from Thurg. Like maybe the zoneline to EW?<br />
<br />
Not everyone in the world likes Dorfies.<br />
<br />
Other than that, /shrug ... sounds like your standard 10th ring war.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your banning man, because I'm sure half of the guides in the game have NEVER heard of the 10th ring war and will side with the person who petitioned you!<br />
<br />
;-)<br />
<br />
Seriously though, keep your chin up. At least you won the ring war, heh.</div></div><hr />
