<br />
<br />
Weapon wise im looking for  bargain based  price weapons that  still  for what they are  do well for our class till we can either afford the better weapons  or win stuff thru ldon or in groups...<br />
<br />
Currently i have a venomous axe, a bed post,lance of tormenting, a weighted halberd &lt; forgot the proper name but they are cheap&gt; oh and a kunzar kitch or whatever that is that procs  that necro snare &lt;dont know what level that will work &gt; <br />
<br />
I'm looking for at   least weapons you dont laugh at when your in your 40s or so ...<br />
<br />
Gear wise im also looking for those  under used but good bargains out there ..   Crusty ill afford  for the parts i need upgraded.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind guys gals this is gear to buy for the non twinked main whos strugling to  gear up ...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) DOn't worry about keeping up with the twinks. <br />
<br />
2) I can't really tell you of a weapon that is buyable at your level and usable into the 40's. Possibles, without knowing prices are Weighty Pole Arm, Wyrm Slayer and Frostbringer. I suspect the Weighty is quite in your price range (about 50-100 plat). <br />
<br />
The last couple of adventures in LDoN (at 27-28 level) I have seen some nice rings drop, and I find the cash from there is good. I suspect, that even if you are an up and coming newbie (if I am reading the post correctly) that you will be much better geared than I was at your level and the game only went 50th. I think, unless you try and do poorly with gear, you will be ahead of the curve and have enough to get the job done.<br />
<br />
For now consentrate on AC first, then HP. You don't need to worry about anything else until you are 50th (at least).<br />
<br />
EDIT: Having read more carefully, your weapons sound good. The Kunzark (sp) is a nice 8/22, and if I am recalling the stats on the rest, this is your weakest weapon.  Frankly I see nothing wrong with your set up and would have no problem inviting you into my groups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BryBbury</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play my warrior as my main, and I don't use alts to try and grind pp for him.  My advice to you.<br />
<br />
Worry more about your haste item than your weapons.  You won't see significant changes with upgrading the weapons you have as much as you will with upgrading (or getting your first) haste item.  If you dont' have one yet, save up your pp for an FBSS or SCHW.  Your weapons are decent enough and spending more on new weapons (barring most likely a very expensive upgrade) you will not see much improvement.  Going  from no haste to an FBSS (1.5k on my server now) you will see a drastic improvement.<br />
<br />
For &quot;bargain weapons&quot; check the bazaar frequently.  This is going to vary from server to server, but the best &quot;deals&quot; I have found are for Warrior only, min level weapons.  This kind of stuff you aren't going to use until you get to a higher level, but I post it in order to give you an idea of what to look for.  Some examples that have made me happy (with min level 50+):<br />
<br />
Bed Leg Club<br />
Great Staff of Thunder<br />
Club of the Ice Ocean<br />
Defenders Lightblade<br />
Stonebladed Axe of Dismay<br />
<br />
At your level check out maybe a Jarsath Trident, Centi Shortsword, Centi Warspear, or a Centi Warhammer.  These can sometimes be found cheap in the bazaar (my server anyways).  Oh, and last but not least KEEP ALL YOUR WEAPON SKILLS MAXXED!!!  Nothing sucks worse than trying to gain 200 points in a weapon skill with a higher level character (2hb comes to mind as a good example).</div></div><hr />
