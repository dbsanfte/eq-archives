<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious if anybody's killin the dragons.  Somebody needs to start farmin em so I can update my magelo :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I know everyone on Prexus is doing the quests and not killing anything in VP.<br />
<br />
I need that damn book so I can turn in my quest pieces /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most items on Lucy that start with &quot;Aged&quot; (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=Aged) (i.e. probably all that were submitted 07/2004 or later) are from new VP, notably this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69436), this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69414), this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69413), this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69410), this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69439), this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69412), this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69425), this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69428), this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69429), this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69411), this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69437), this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69422), and this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69421).  In general, it appears that all of the old VP loot has a corresponding new &quot;aged&quot; version (and the old versions still drop from rare trash), and for casters the 2 handers became 1 handers.  Since the old VP was almost 100% weapon loot, there are a lot of weapons in the new VP too.  I've heard of breastplates and other non-weapon loot also dropping from the dragons, but haven't seen the links.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea, I'm wearing one of those &quot;non-weapon&quot; items and somebody needs to go kill the dragon and get it and upload it to mangelo dangit!  (very nice item too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cant you run magelo update yourself? :P</div></div><hr />

Doesn't work on test....well it works sometimes, but it's on the order of a day or two every 6 months, and if you don't know about it you don't have a chance.<br />
<br />
I was also just curious whether any guilds were farming the zone.  It's a very nice raid zone with some good loot and far easier to get into than the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fair enough, forgot you were on test :)<br />
<br />
May try and persuade my guild to have a run through, we've done the key dragon a couple of times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have yet to hear of anyone actually raiding this =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We've killed the dragon a couple times, mainly to get the Key for the Aug ;p  We've been really damn busy with GoD progression lately but I'm sure at some point we will have a &quot;fun&quot; day and go clear VP.  Dammit that reminds me, I need to do cleric bots key.  Anyone know if I can pull the Chardok mob to zone in with good faction?  (not Niblik, the echo of chardok guy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>hungri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have never seen anyone other then myself in the zone. which considering the suprise basiliks at the 2nd draw bridge was a pity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There's no reason for a time+ guild to go there unless they like watching loot rot.  For an elemental or subelemental guild it would be a good zone for getting some more loot every week.  I'm sure the faction quests make it tough to raid though when people are working on quests and don't want to trash their faction.</div></div><hr />

The clickies, even though some are on a long recast, are priceless.</div></div><hr />

Fun would be a reason :P  VP has always been one of my favorite zones hehe.</div></div><hr />

I pulled him to zone in on friday. He must have followed me for 30 minutes thru the whole zone while I tried to remember how to get back to the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The Chardok mob can actually SPAWN at zone in.  Not a pleasant surprise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">its non kos...its way better if it spawns at the zone in rather than down in the royals area...</div></div><hr />
