<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raramooga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there :)  Was curious about these 3 weapons:<br />
<br />
Hooked So'Shar (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21674) <br />
CHoS (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22010)<br />
SotB (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22009)<br />
<br />
Currently using CHoS primary, Hooked So'Shar offhand.  Curious if I should try and get my hands on a SotB?  Would it be a better agro weapon than the So'Shar?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stuns have been calaculated to be around 400 hate or so. In theory the SotB would be slightly better agro, but I am not so sure I would bother. the difference is minimal and your weapon is not very common. I normally recommend function &gt; style, but in this case the weapons are close enough that the style points are worth not looking like every other CHoS+SotB warrior out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as style points go, is the graphic anything different than it looks on the item pic?  Is it pretty much just the same graphic as a firerune brand?  If so I would have to say style points are pretty low then....  a SotB has a nice graphic.  But it is cool to be different....</div></div><hr />
