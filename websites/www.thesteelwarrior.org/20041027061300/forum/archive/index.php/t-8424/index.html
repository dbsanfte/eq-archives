<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there,<br />
<br />
i know that a warrior is not a solo class of course  :D <br />
But it happens that im on at times where its hard to get a group or i know that i will probably have to log in 30min. I dont want to join a group them and leave them short time later. For situations like this i like to go soloing a bit.<br />
Its may be not as efficient to do as with other classes but it worked pretty good for me so far. My equipment helps me alot of course, i have Fungi Tunic and being a Troll and adding tribute regen i have 42HP/tick standing unbuffed regen. (Magelo shows wrong standing regen for Trolls btw, my naked regen without AAs is 16standing at level 57)<br />
I was hunting in Dulak for some Levels and the Fire elements in Nadox but EXP is really going down now.<br />
The last i tried are the Turtles and Hynid Fleshrippers in Natimbi. I can hunt there with minimal downtime but i need quite some time to kill them and exp is not great.<br />
The way i do it is this:<br />
- First i equip Truncheon of Doom until mob is slowed.<br />
- Then i use best DPS Weapons to beat mob down<br />
- When mob runs at 20% i equip 2xBloodpoint to get some livetaps<br />
- If im below 70% after fight i bandage<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone have a suggestion where i could hunt for faster exp?</div></div><hr />
