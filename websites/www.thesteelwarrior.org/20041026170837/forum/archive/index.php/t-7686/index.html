You've just made a really bad impression on me those couple of times we ran into each other. I met you first when you were in your 40s in Solb. meaniehead is bad analogy anyways. Being mean has nothing to do with anything here, the way you act does.<br />

You know, thats very strange I only went to Sol anything once before I went to do dragon raids and I still don't recall ever meeting you there, of course you just may be utterly forgettable. Or maybe I am mature enough to move on and grow past 4 years ago in a video game. Either way, you quit, I didn't, I raid time, you camp boards, guess everything works out as it should. <br />
<br />
I am in your face, ready to debate, i'm not afraid of hurting your feelings, I get into the conversation and tell you I think your a pud if your a pud. I don't live in a cutsie world, so think what you want about me, and I'll disregard you as another internet winner, and go about my daily life with out worrying. <br />

Love you much, next topic thanks, guess I can save an hour and not read the whining here anyway, only signed up to read what Raaj had to say about the summit.<br />
<br />
omg forgive me your uberness time raider.... Let me kneel before yee!<br />
<br />
Mature? Grow up? Where did you see me whining? The only thing I said and stand by is that I don’t like you. What is there to fucking debate? Learn to comprehend, ya?</div></div><hr />
