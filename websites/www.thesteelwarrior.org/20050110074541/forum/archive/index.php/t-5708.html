<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did this expedition last night, i had no real problem with aggro all the way up to the room where you fight the 9 placeholders to spawn the mob.  Those 9 PHs and the named that spawned afterward got kinda wierd.  Incite didnt work on em, and niether did enraging blow.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I tell ya one thing it sucked for trying to take agro back once the named turned on someone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you're sure you were losing aggro or it could've been them just eating the AE ramp.  Did that one on my bard, just stood back and pumped mana/overhaste/dots because I didn't want to mess with the AE ramp.  Warrior was using a BoW though, didn't have any trouble it seemed, not sure if it was aug'd or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i never got the &quot;SoandSo face contorts in rage&quot; and after incite i never got &quot;SoandSo looks angry&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">spells dont work underwater in that room. incite is a spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That room is just whacked. Um, what we did was put casters on the stairs, cleric in the water, and me and cleric shrunk. Pushed the mob into the corner. That AE rampage is brutal for casters... Don't let anyone do anything for agro early on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not necessarily the room, but the mobs.  No spells can land on them if the caster is underwater.  We pulled another mob to the room under water to test if it was the room, and you had to be underwater to cast on it heh.  We just used lev on everyone, can melee them from above water.  That way everyone could cast on eachother, and you can proc on them.  And definately keep casters away from the ae ramp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best way i've found is to have eveyrone levved and the tank slightly levving against the pipe so hes douesnbt bob in into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i will have to try that if we decide to do that expedition again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">interesting. we had whole group shrunk and in water except the chanter and everthing went fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilson</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also pull all the mobs up to the ledge running around the edge of the room and fight there, that seemed to be the easiest solution for us when we did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those mobs *need* to not be fought in the water.  Find the corner on the ledge (levitate) and youre golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had no probs fighting them in water.  Had melee and the healer in the water and the slower out of the water and had no probs at all.  <br />
<br />
I don't remember seeing an EB message (this thread was already here so I was sorta looking out for it) and probably didnt use incite, but had no problems holding agro despite that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xiliz</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some mobs are flagged to ignore taunt...<br />
The event in Bir with the colossis of war event is setup like this.<br />
Example.<br />
Their are two robe looking guys called golem masters. Each controls 3 golems. for a total of 6 golems.<br />
two of the golems will assts the chick in the center.<br />
two of the golems will assist each of the robe guys.<br />
These 6 golems IGNORE their aggro list until the golem masters are dead.<br />
PERIOD.<br />
Once the golem masters die you take out the 6 golems, and then focus on the chick in the center.<br />
@ 50% the Collossis comes alive and you have to finish him off.<br />
Mobs die, you collect loot.<br />
Each mob mitigates a damage type. blah blah...<br />
<br />
This is just one example of how the devs now have the abiliy to tunes encounters so that tuant, ae tuant or anything else means jack shit...</div></div><hr />

Someone turn this useful coversation back into a rant and flame about something ! Nooo the outhouse is turning into a place for discussion ~ AHHHHH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladymir</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok Kadah...<br />
<br />
Aggro is just weird on them I (paladin) was having a little trouble holding aggro...<br />
<br />
<br />
STFU Pally... I really really don't want to hear about how you &quot;was having little trouble holding aggro&quot;. <br />
<br />
Don't you have some other forum to go to? Like HighelvesrGhey.org or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Vlad your a life saver sir.<br />
<br />
STFU Paladins go home and cry !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should rename the outhouse to 'Ku Klux Knights'<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I doubt even the most classist warrior would dare be seen in public with the title of 'Wizard'</div></div><hr />
