<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ainmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At least it's a highend warrior whine.<br />
<br />
High-end PoP itemization seems rather hit and miss.  Some items increase the power of the characters massively, while other items intended for characters are laughable.  Now that we are seeing some of the end of the expansion loot, I feel compelled to complain.<br />
<br />
A few items have a massive and direct increase in caster power.  <br />
<br />
Wizard Legs have a massive impact on Wizard DPS, which is their only real role in the game at this point.  Let's say these increase the ability of what Wizards do by 50%.<br />
<br />
Time's Antithesis and Serpent of Vindication also grant an incredible power increase to Shamans and Enchanters.  Shamans have an item that allows them to cast slow for no mana cost with the ability to recast it instantly, as opposed to the six second recast on the real spell.  Enchanters get a slow they can cast in half the time as the regular spell, once again with instant recast.<br />
<br />
Even druids are looking at an item that allows them a mana free version of Swarming Death, a spell that normally costs 350 mana.<br />
<br />
My question is this:  Where is the warrior item that increases their power by 50%?  What allows us to tank 50% better?  Why do we see other classes get massive increases to their overall power and see very minor upgrades to what we do?<br />
<br />
Those questions are rhetorical, really.  I know why they can't make us 50% better at what we do, as once again the risk of &quot;trivializing the game OMG&quot; is greater when you increase the power of our class.  Honestly, to get warrior legs on par with wizard legs you would need to put Effect: Enraging Blow (Must Equip/Cast Time:3.0) on them.  <br />
<br />
If the designers of the game can not make us significantly better at what we do through itemization, then they need to create another role for us that does allow us to get significant power increases.  Otherwise the effort we make to improve our characters is rather meaningless.<br />
<br />
And don't try to tell me how great AC/HP are to build up and how wonderful that feeling is.  Last time I checked I was #5 on eqrankings for warriors on Hp and honestly, I don't give a shit about HP/AC anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sargman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think that's part of why the braintrust at SoE is claiming they're looking into ways of increasing the DPS of pure melee classes, once again missing the point that we're the low end of pure melee dps, and that needs to be addressed more than across the board dps. I'm holding out at this point to see what they plan to change involving disciplines along with lower tier god drops. I'm very doubtful of much along the lines of improvement at this point, but I'd love nothing better than for them to prove me wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well they promised melee classes an upgrade.  I really hope they remember the warrior class.  Also I hope its a pure melee upgrade that doesnt include other fighters.<br />
<br />
All my toon can do now is lvl up and be ready for when the upgrade comes.  I think a lot of folks still prefer warriors to tank unless theres a knight thats higher lvl.   Then again, there are only so many knights and lots of groups out there :D</div></div><hr />

It is nice, it's aggro, it's versatile, and it is terribly one dimensional and corners us even more in our little field of abilitis without opening any gameplay change for the warrior wielding it.<br />

We want something new, unique, or something that helps us make our job better.<br />
<br />
How would a gimmick like a shield help us do anything else than look like retarded pallies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shields ARE new and different. Since when has a shield ever been a viable option for a warrior? It seems that they're really trying to steer the class in that direction. What if shields actually WORKED? More AC, HP, Aggro ... the trade-off would be DPS, obviously. <br />
<br />
I read Ainmer's rant about how he tried to make shields work for his guild. It's unfortunate it didn't work. Perhaps the right shield paired with this weapon would be the combo that clicks.<br />
<br />
Perhaps not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bingor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nobody here likes you. Why bother posting? =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">High end warrior itemization has been out of wack since Velious. Its nothing new that lots of other classes get better items than warriors, that increases thier power. Why? Cause we are stuck in the role of tank, thats it, we dont do damage, we dont have a utility.<br />
<br />
Sure, I'd like to have a rightclick 0.1 second stun on warrior legs, but it wont happen. I think that new sword and shield will be a good combo, one that I would use, will it produce damage, doubt it. but I think it would produce agro, and thats what I care about</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sargman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Any changes they plan to make I'll be skeptical about...3+ years of promises do that to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sumill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aegis of the Earth/Furious Bash items get you agro about as quickly as you loose it.  Just as fast as you pop to the top of the agro list, you drop off because the dps is not there. <br />
<br />
Also, after testing one for a few weeks now I'm convinced they do not modify the proc of any other weapon you wield.  This would also be in line with game mechanics for any other focus item.  They will not modify right click or proc effects. <br />
<br />
IMO, agro is not gained &amp; maintained on procs alone, nor is it typically dps - it is a combination of these two main factors.  Your(vova) attempts to wholely discount dps in other threads for the &quot;analysis&quot; of BoW Vs. EB1&amp;2 really ignores how the game tends to work.<br />
<br />
For example, we have one warrior with a SEWS(2h excellent dmg, rune2 proc) that does ok with agro, although I think there is typically alot higher rate of splatter than compared with when one of our BoW warriors is tanking.  Splatter being the instances where someone else gets agro and dies or at least takes non-riposte based dmg.  I think as more of the guild gets the higher ratio pop weapons, our SEWS warrior will encounter more problems with agro.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind using a shield, but they just don't work even after the latest change to FB.  I would love to see a companion weapon that ONLY procs when you have FB shield equiped.  Make it a pop lvl dmg output, say on par with Ivory Hilted with an insane proc rate to make up for the loss of an offhand weapon - the key being it only works when you have the shield.<br />
<br />
If secondary slot = Aegis of Earth, <br />
     Then cast &quot;Angry Bash&quot;<br />
Else &quot;your will is not sufficient to command this weapon&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, Shimmering Sleeves of Flame can bite me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cause we are stuck in the role of tank, thats it, we dont do damage, we dont have a utility.<br />
<br />
<br />
How can you say you have no utility and then list your primary utility in the same sentence? Without a defensive warrior to get and hold aggro and absorb TONS of damage, some raids are simply impossible. That's a level of utility no single class other than clerics approaches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bingor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">GTFO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Panazule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think what he is getting at is something I have felt we have been cheated out of over the last few expansions, espescially since AA showed up.<br />
<br />
If you look at many other classes, they all have some sort of &quot;goal aa&quot; to accomplish in order to significantly improve their classes &quot;role&quot; in EQ.<br />
<br />
Rangers get EQ/AM3, Shaman get Canni V, Clerics get Divine Arbitration and a few others, SK's get leechtouch along with the ability to turn their life tap procs into doing a possible 1200+ per proc, monks get rapid feign, bards get fading memories and other aa's, the list is virtually endless.<br />
<br />
Warriors on the other hand have basically the same AA's as all the other melee classes, even Hybrid classes.   Our class only skills have nothing that significantly increase our role in everquest and make our job easier.  Sure we have a few decent aa's that are situational but there is nothing you say &quot;OMG , I can't wait to get that!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a bit unfair that a warrior must rely solely on high end items in order to do their job in a group, much less a raid.<br />
<br />
Even with enraging blow weapons and high taunt weapons, in exp groups in PoP, warriors are generally the last choice for tanks because we have no ability to snap aggro, such as an SK or Paladin does.<br />
<br />
I think balance is something that has long been lost in everquest and most likely never will be restored.  Some classes have received ridicuously trivializing abilities while others have been left behind, I think all we can hope for is that in time we'll wind up with something because we all know SoE doesn't have the balls to nerf someone else in order to fix the problem, which would really be the only way to truly fix our issues without trivializing the high end encounters.  We all saw how long the &quot;bow aggro&quot; nerf lasted until it was adjusted back down again.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately a warriors &quot;goal aa&quot; would need to be taunt related, but if they give us something that is taunt related it will most definately effect the game tremendously.<br />
<br />
I just hope they remember we exist, you can count the number of warrior only changes in the last 2 years on half a hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Utility is not value Vova, utility is defined on this board and in EQ in general as &quot;skill subsets which increase your value beyond your core skill&quot;.    <br />
<br />
Warrior Core Skills:<br />
<br />
Tanking<br />
Delivering Melee Damage<br />
<br />
The *only* &quot;utility&quot; we have is as follows:<br />
<br />
Warcry<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
Warcry is beyond worthless, it maddeningly worthless.<br />
<br />
/shield is useful, it's our single &quot;utility&quot;, although it increases a mob's damage output by 25%<br />
<br />
Please dont' talk about our core skills as &quot;utility&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, now you're getting into semantics and hijacking the discussion. <br />
<br />
Please dont' talk about our core skills as &quot;utility&quot;<br />
The first- and second-most common definitions of &quot;utility&quot; in every dictionary I could find on my shelves and on the 'net go something like this: <br />
<br />
Utility: <br />
1. The quality or state of being useful; usefulness.<br />
2. Adaptation to satisfy the desires or wants; intrinsic value. <br />
<br />
<br />
Utility is usefulness. Utility is intrinsic value. <br />
<br />
The warrior's utility is his ability to absorb more damage than any other class while holding a mob's attention. This isn't to say that the warrior is perfectly balanced. I'm not saying that the warrior's utility is well designed. But &quot;tanking&quot; is a warrior's utility. It's why, when no warriors are present, raids are called off. It's probably the only reason &quot;merit&quot; loot disbursement systems have any viability whatsoever -- stacking a warrior augments his core utility to a guild. <br />
<br />
I agree with the general feeling of warrior discontent and can understand why many in the class want something more, but you cannnot deny that this game is designed around the warrior and the cleric relationship. Everyone else augments these roles.<br />
<br />
<br />
The big concern lately is that the knight has become a substitute for a warrior in experience groups (but not on most raids). This is something designers had to struggle with as they were doing it. They didn't want ONE class to be the only viable exp-group healer, so Shaman and Druid core utilities (healing) were augmented. They didn't want warriors to be the only viable tank for experience groups so they augmented knights. This augmentation marginalized the cleric and the warrior in exp-group settings, but they're the undisputed kings of the high-end raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends. If you are tanking, your dps will be weak. If you are not tanking and just there to do dps, the rogues and monks will outdamage you by a fair bit. Even when I get over 2k atk, use a 2her and stay in the back of a mob, I cant really touch a rogue and only get very close to the monks, who probalby dont have 2k atk.<br />

So instead of having the extra warriors on dps, just get more rogues and monks :P</div></div><hr />

Not true, and totally off topic. Still, it's interesting that you remember our guild launch of over 14 months ago. =) I remember those threads fondly, because flamers (like you) heaped invective and profanity upon my head and predicted that we'd never succeed with the vision laid out in those threads and here we are, thriving in the EPs. Who'da thunk a bunch of level 50s would make it?<br />
<br />

<br />
Sure! Just as soon as all warriors stop posting in all forums that have nothing to do with their class. (Read that sentence twice: there are actually no such forums. Every class is interdependent.) <br />
<br />
Seriously, this class is part of a larger EQ community. To suggest that someone who is not playing a warrior as his main has no right to post is antithetical to the amazing community energy and spirit that's made this game such a success.<br />
<br />
But none of this has anything to do with Ainian's topic, so I dubb thee Sir Fulorian a troll and welcome you to board ignore until you're ready to make salient, unhateful replies and stay on topic. <br />

So that my own post makes SOME effort to stay on track, this is what I hear most often from almost every warrior: <br />

LOL..now I know some of you are saying &quot;he went overboard on the changes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nope I don't think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Uh.. Yes, you DID go overboard with the changes. You'd take a gimp little quest that isn't hard and give it a reward that is better than any item that will ever be put in this game. I can see them making it on par with a BoWar through requiring smaller, but highly focused *read as, no reward for anyone except the war in question* events to upgrade it.. that are rather difficult. But pump up the difficulty instead of the people, make it trial-like. 3 groups max, maybe time trial like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">You went WAY too far.  The epic quest is much too easy to warrant that calliber of weapon.  The epic maybe could use a minor upgrade, but given it's difficulty I wouldn't think it should be upgraded more than just a small change in ratio.  If you boosted it's difficulty to RZtW level, then maybe I could see the reward you posted as acceptable.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they mind the fact that you don't play a warrior as your main... they just plain don't like you :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Vova, the reason people want you off this board is because YOU are the troll here.  We accept most anyone.  People like you, who insult others, then call everyone else trolls, are not worth our time.  Your &quot;better than you&quot; attitude is simply annoying and pathetic.  Once you decide to mature to maybe a jr high level, we'll stop asking you to leave.  Until that time, you leaving the boards would be preferable.</div></div><hr />

If so, Ed, was that link to that monk magelo you made in MB the other day your old monk?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Ainmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">A little followup to my original post.<br />
<br />
After using the Symbol of the Planesmaster for the last couple weeks, I've decided this item is the true &quot;warrior item&quot; from Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
The other day it was really clear to me when we were fighting Hydrotha, and how I never lost aggro on Hydrotha despite being blinded 3 times.<br />
<br />
It was crystal clear to me yesterday when we were slumming it in Plane of Earth A and doing Mud ring.  I have never been able to keep aggro on Monstrous Mudwalker before.  Usually once he was pushed out of range whoever happened to be close to him got aggro and tanked until he was pushed oor again.  Not this time.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, I started tanking him, and had a few pestilence shock procs.  From there, I never lost aggro on him until he mem blurred.  He would get pushed out of range and then summon me back to him.  It was amazing.<br />
<br />
I don't know how well the proc on the Symbol compares to Aten gloves (Call of Fire), but let me say that with a BoW and the Symbol, a warrior can expect to -never- lose aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>kriegartorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">i would guess the symbol and aten gloves to have the same amount of agro, basically same spell with different resists...<br />
<br />
its still possible to lose agro but not if you are given enough time to establish agro... in exp groups i still lose agro if group members dont give me enough time to establish agro... <br />

LOL. I have been coming to this board for over 2 years now and while I have had some heated debates and I don't always agree with all of the posts, I have yet to be flamed for no playing a warrior as my main. I would tend to believe that if you are coming to this board and getting ridiculed and flamed by some of the long time posters, the source of the problem is the person being flamed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Originally the effect was marvelous visions, which has the 50 sta.
