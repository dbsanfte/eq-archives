<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>evilbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings,<br />
<br />
I would like to buy a new weapon for my 43 warrior, hopefully something with mad DPS. I have about 8k - 12k to put into the project. The server is Drinal if anyone is interested.  Right now he has the following:<br />
<br />
Blade of Xalgoz<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5623 <br />
<br />
Lamentation<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5157 <br />
<br />
Kunzar Ku'juch<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5159 <br />
<br />
What recommendations might anyone have for me as to a next move? Stats would be nice but not necessary as the gear on the warrior is fine, imo. Also if there is something just outside of my range, please mention that too - if it's that much better than what 8 - 12k can get me for just a few kpp more,  i'll wait a week or two and raise the plat.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">those are the ones he already has</div></div><hr />

For 10kish range I would suggest  a Sword of the Bloodsworn or Copper Hammer of Striking. Both cost within that price range, or you could get a Frostbringer. Even a Greatstaff of Thunder would work well. There are quite a few options. The best bet would be to hit your local bazaar and see what's for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great staff of Thunder wont be usable until he is 55.  Copper hammer of striking procs at level 1 I believe.  Not sure when Sword of Bloodsworn procs but at level 43 a CHoS would be my advice since you won't be fighting level 55 + mobs for a while yet and the agro is good.  I would leave the Kunzar Ku'juch in off hand with CHoS in main hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you get a copper hammer of striking you'll most likely retire with it; damn thing is just sooo nice for the casual/semi-power gamer and even for the l33t amongst us it's an awesome weapon for the risk/reward in obtaining it if you don't go the bazaar route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, shik, enlighten us a bit, I don't know enough about Chardok B to go there (my opinion) can you give me a link or two to get me on the way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>evilbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Geez thanks for the advice ... seems like everyone really likes the CHoS so i'll check the /baz for prices on that when i get home. I did fail to mention earlier that i will probably be duoing with a 57 cleric for a while until to get cranked up in the levels a bit ... so something that doesn't proc for a few levels would be ok as i'm hoping they won't take too long. Maybe that changes anyone's opinion?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Our opinions won't change.  Get a copper hammer...you won't regret it.  It IS all it's cracked up to be</div></div><hr />

Copper Hammer of Striking is a Droga camp, along with the Sword of the Bloodsworn.  I bought my SotB when the prices dipped to 3K-ish; I haven't found a group that can/will help me camp the hammer yet.<br />
<br />
I found this tactic:  http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=41521#post41521.  I'm sure there are others on the boards too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Definitely get a CHoS, my war is 42 and has it and it rocks.  It procs a lot, sometimes you'll get 2 procs right in a row, 179, 179.  That's quite a hit on a level 40ish mob.  Not to mention it interrupts healers and other casters.  Couple it with a SoTB which also interrupts, with those two procs and bash you will interrupt casters like mad.  Not to mention hold aggro like a charm...  and the dps is also great.  Depends on your server prices, but on most servers you should be able to get a CHoS, but if not get a Sword of the Bloodsworn.  I paid 28k for my CHoS on Stromm.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mr_jak02</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">which would be the better purchase for a 41 Warrior then? Swiftblade of Zek or a Copper Hammer of Striking?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Um, no one is talking about the SBoZ much anymore.  The CHoS is 1/3 the price and has a nicer ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Add one vote for CHoS!  At 56 it's still in my primary slot (with the Tak 50dd aug until I can get a Ykesha one).  I expect it'll stay there for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>evilbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well it really looks like we have an obvious winner here ... looks like the CHoS is around 15 - 16k on Drinal. Perhaps I can round up a group or two and go camp the king ... think a group of 55 - 60's could hold it down?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It may be a little hard to get to and clear it, but once your settled into the camp it shouldn't be a problem.</div></div><hr />
