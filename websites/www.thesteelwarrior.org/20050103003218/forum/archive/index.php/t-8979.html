<br />
Did a small test the other night where I had the monk pull with 1 shuriken of eternity and stand 30ish feet in front of me when he got back, I tagged with 1 shuriken then hit Bazu Bellow and mob turned and came right to me.<br />
<br />
This finding also suggests proximity agro bonus is between 481-599 ofcourse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please try it without you casting a shuriken as well, if possible :)</div></div><hr />

And I've always used stars with incites up to ancient chaos cry and never could pull a mob off anyone unless they run behind me (like a good little puller should! /pat) and I got the proximity agro bonus instead of them.<br />
<br />
Youre right though, it probably would be a good idea to do the same test without a star just to prove whether or not the initial 120 direct hate cap exists. I'll try it when I can log in today.<br />
<br />
edit: found thread where I saw Frodlins post http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8757</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did same test with Press the Attack then Bazu Bellow mob came to me, I really wish they would just take the knockback off press the attack and make it 1dmg 200 range so we can use incite without having to swap range items  :( even just 100-120 range would be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The initial hate cap only counts if you're pulling the mob, or to be more specific on the first person to aggro the mob, thats why slowers take aggro, they generate a lot more hate than 120 ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not going to argue about it though, those were the tests.</div></div><hr />

(He had all aggroreducing AA - so dunno if that works with a low AA chanter too)<br />
<br />
But thats a big heads up in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Why should an ability be gimped, just because its the first hostile action you perform? Basically just a huge annoyance, and doesnt make sense from a gameplay standpoint either.</div></div><hr />

If the puller is running behind you giving you the proximity bonus (like they should be doing) then all you have to do is get on the hate list, can even be 1dmg, as long as youre on the hate list for anything at all and youre closest you will get agro. Unelss they pulled with stun or snare or anything else with &gt;481-599 hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">poorly worded, so i'll just type what I meant...<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that once the mob is engaged, and has an aggro list at all (not necessarily by the warrior) there's no longer an aggro cap, so if someone else is pulling, we can bazu/incite right off the bat and get the full aggro of it. If this isn't the case, would surely like to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naw, you have to be on the hate list yourself to get the full value of incite.</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
<br />
It's like Pally's needing to shoot an arrow before stunning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hope they change that eventually, seems silly :p</div></div><hr />
