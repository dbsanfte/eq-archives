<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I asked the other day about getting a GBoS for myself. The warrior community felt I had a good set-up and that the GBoS wouldn't be much of an upgrade for me. This leads me to a new set of questions. Right now I have Hategiver and Soulrender as my standard line up. I have enough to buy an Anger2 and closing fast on Anger3 (the better deal). I was thinking that I shouldn't spend the points Aug the HG with Anger3 b/c I didn't feel it was a great weapon to go with for the long haul. I could also Aug the Render with one of the procs. My problem is I find myself loosing aggro to some DoTs and Slows from the casters if I don't get early procs. What recommendation do you all have to remedy the problem or just as a good improvement for the future (I don't want to waste my LDoN points on weps I will bank soon). Keep in mind I don't raid much so any upgrades will have to be off 1 or 2-group Named (mobs). Should I:<br />
<br />
1 - Should I Anger3 the HG and stop unrating it in my mind  :) <br />
2 - Should I Aug the Render or go after &lt;insert here&gt; for my off-hand.<br />
3 - Augment both and see the difference?<br />
4 - Should I switch to the Ornate Greatblade and Anger3 it?<br />
5 - Go after a whole new weapon set  :eek: ?<br />
<br />
I know we get a lot of these upgrade questions but I don't think my weapons are bad but I really am apprehensice about dropping 1500+ LDoN points to augment weapons I could upgrade with a little effort. Thanks for all that take the time to offer up their advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Speaking as someone who would kill for any eb weapon at this point, I vote aug the hategiver. I'm pretty sure any two a3 augged eb 1 handers is pretty much the end all for aggro until you have a shot at a darkblade. Some peeps will try and convince you a BoW is better but the numbers just don't support it.<br />
<br />
If you want an upgrade, you've obviously been in SSRA, start farming cursed and pick up a Bloodfrenzy, and aug that too. <br />
<br />
Incidentally, what is it you don't like about the hategiver?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hategiver is an excellent weapon IMO. I'd slap an Anger 3 on that, and then either not aug your off hander, or stick a cheap anger 2 or Ykesha on it if you feel your still lacking some aggro. (I'd probably go with Ykesha, so that it has better aggro, but you can also use it for DPS later down the line)<br />
<br />
It might also help if you could tell us where your guild is at progression wise, and what weapons you have  *realistic* chance of getting in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Forgot to add: If your looking for an aggro solution that will always help you, no matter what weapon your using, get Weapon Affinity! Nothing, and I mean NOTHING has increased my aggro as much as Weapon Afinity has.<br />
<br />
Also, what is it you don't like about the Hategiver? The stats are WAY better than the BoC's imo. 25 ac completely owns the extra 15 hp the BoC has. Plus it has a slightly better ratio. The only one hander I'd rank above the HG is a BF until you get into Time and above content. (DBotW, EoE, etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, to answer some of the questions people are asking. I really don't have a problem with Hategiver, except maybe I feel if I can get back into Ssra I can get a BF, but chances are that won't heppen. (I would give BF to someone without a hate proc weapon before upgrading me).... Anyway, I will probable Anger3 it then. <br />
<br />
As far as my guild is concerned, I just moved to CT from Bristlebane to play with friends in my local area (co-workers, etc) as well as some old friends from back home. I am unguilded although I am Elem flagged. My new job has me working nights so unless a raid takes place during the day I won't be raiding anymore. That limits me to mobs that are killable by 1-2 groups I would guess. At least until I find a good Pacific coast guild (anyone know any?)<br />
<br />
Lilwee, I just put my first AA point into Weapon Affinity the other day. Haven't had a chance to see results but just your statement there makes me feel better. Maybe I will try and max that skill now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">EB + A3 on your main hand weapon, and level 3-4 of WA and you'll be proccing like a machine gun. Of course you'll always have a few dry spells when you most need it, but thats just life as a warrior~<br />
<br />
With your current situation I'd *deffinitely* go with A3 on the HG.<br />
<br />
You might also want to look into a Euro/Australian guild if you play during the day time. I know on the Tribunal we have one Aussy guild in Time, and a Euro guild there also.<br />
<br />
BTW, don't expect to see visible results from level one of WA. Like almost any AA, you have to get it near maxed to see the real results, but once you do, it is *very* worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Render isn't anything special for aggro due to the low aggro proc, but it should be some very decent DPS. Reasons: 21/24 (at best) is a very good ratio, but a 75 point lifetap is basically no aggro at all. You will never turn a mob with that weapon. To naysay previous posters, you would be served well replacing it with a GBoS. You'll lose some ac/hp, but you'll increase your aggro (~400 hate proc with GBoS, ~75 hate proc with the Render).<br />
<br />
 HG is an upgraded BoC. Slightly better ratio and better stats, same proc and proc rate. That being said, it's better than any tradable weapon. You could only replace it with a BF or DBotW or the like for DW weapons. Augment it. <br />
<br />
  Whatever offhand you think you'll be keeping for a long time, augment. An extra 600 hate proc per minute (1.5 procs per minute with WA5) is nothing to complain about. Don't blow the points on a weapon you'll replace quickly though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, now for a stupid question:<br />
<br />
Do Type 8 Augs go on any weapon aug slot or is there a weapon that takes only type 8 slots?<br />
<br />
These are the two I am speaking of specifically:<br />
<br />
Radiant Marble Sphere of Ire - Guk 1150 - Aug Type 8 <br />
Lore, Effect:AngerIII, Restrictions:WeaponsOnly  <br />
<br />
Radiant Fragment of Dread - Guk 760 - Aug Type 8 <br />
Lore, Effect:ForceOfYkesha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No, those go in type 8 slots.  You find type 8 slots on weapons from PoTime, Kod'Taz and later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks Sassi, well that is disappointing. Probably save me some points though  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You get Anger 3 for slot 4 in Everfrost, and I believe Yak slot 4 is from Guk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;You have to get it(WA) near max to see it&quot; <br />
<br />
I just trained WA1 2 days ago. I am now getting something I have never seen to date: Both weps proccing at the same time.  I will dig and find the log but I would swear I saw &quot;Your targets face contorts with rage&quot; and the next message when I looked down was the 75DD stun from my SotBS.  I did the proc dance for nearly 10 seconds due to this. It was funny 'cuz I normally tank in 3rd person ( scroll the wheel back on my mouse 3 or 4 clicks ) as long as they're no walls close, and all I saw was me doin that proc push movement over and over.  :)  I am a big fan of WA. <br />
