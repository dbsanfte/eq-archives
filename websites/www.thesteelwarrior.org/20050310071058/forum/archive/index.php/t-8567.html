No, they patched it over to the regular test server.  No NDA breakage going on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now all highend encounters will have to be balanced with the shield AA in mind either making them required or making the AA shitty enough they wont be required.<br />
<br />
They should give it to pal / sk only and leave warriors and encounter balance out of it.<br />
<br />
Or make the AA to avoid riposte dmg work for mainhand weapon also with the same success rate as the shield AA for balance purposes if the encounters are already tuned to the shield AA. I dont wanna use a shield every single encounter.</div></div><hr />

No NDA's were harmed in the making of this thread.<br />
Basically there was a patch to the test server.  Someone logged on a char of every class type and did /alt list  to get a listing of all the diff alt commands which are all basically aa's</div></div><hr />

Unless they add some kind of agro inducing effect (thats not broken like FB). I don't think you'll see anyone bagging their offhands permanently. <br />
<br />
However if they coupled it with some kind of focus effect like raex bp when the shield was equiped it might offset it (dunno thinking out loud).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm surprised... and not surprised at the same time. I can see the new LR/ID you'll need for most of the new encounters, the &quot;flurry even more&quot;, &quot;mastery of the tactical mastery&quot;... <br />
So far the only &quot;new&quot; AA is Press the attack who seems promising to position mobss... but I really expected something more than grindings even more AAs to gain 3% more mitigation or dps...<br />
<br />
I hope it's not a finished list yet, some other classes really get some cool stuff , for exemple monks, all their special have now an added effect (stun for round kick, eagle strike snare, tiger claw debuff atk...), wizard get some new inventive teleports (all the group to the wiz bind point, a TP to a place the caster used a mark..)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely playing the wrong game if you expected that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, this game contains minor increases in power.  They build up over time, but each increase is really small.<br />
<br />
Expect the world, and you'll be shocked by reality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, I like getting every bit of mitigation and hp too... and even after 4 years playing I really enjoy every small new addition to the game, especially AAs, since I'm only semi-casual and dont raid yet stuff Higher than MM or Bert. Every new encouters or abilities are candies. In fact I'm more shocked with paladins or rangers AAs (who have nothing really inventive in the list).<br />
<br />
But I can't stop to think new games coming (namely wow) at the end of year with maybe some more fun in gameplay (if they can reproduce the feeling you get tanking stuff in EQ, but I doubt that).<br />
<br />
And since all MMORPG today are copying each other, they could have adapted one of those City of Heroes tricks tanks are using there :D.</div></div><hr />
