Now, I've only tried this once so I wanna see if anyone else has anything to share. About a month or so back, while my guild was doing AoD in Air, I went to the front of the mob with the MT and hit furious when it enraged. It was facing me and I had attack on, and I was hitting him as normal as if he was not enraged, and he was doing the same to me. Though this has no really benifit from what I saw, it seems that it is an alternate way to avoid Enrage death.<br />
<br />
Anyone else every try this?</div></div><hr />

If you want to play attack something while it's enraging, it's safer to use /disc fortitude instead.</div></div><hr />

i only use it when i know a heal is late. gives the cleric 9 seconds to get a heal in. sometimes i dont think it's worth a hour reuse though, and i would be better off praying defen/evade is enough to keep me living.<br />
<br />
also good for setting off procs. many a war will tell you the virtues of rampage+fury+pbaoe weapon=lot of dead stuff, but w defintly not rain effec wepon i killed myself. 30+ procs of 122 rain hurt alot, but was good for a laugh.</div></div><hr />
