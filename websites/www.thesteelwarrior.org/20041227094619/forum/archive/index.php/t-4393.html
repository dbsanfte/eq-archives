<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kranc</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently took over my brothers 65 warrior(6 month ship duty) and am learning to play him with my 65 bard and cleric.  I have only played a warrior to 45 so I am very unfamiliar with the aa progression. Apparently, this warrior was on an offensive aa progression. He has Stamina 3; Run 3: CA 1; CS 1; CF 3; ND 3: PE; Area Taunt; Flurry 3: Planar Durability 3; Planar Power 4: Fury of the Ages 3; Hastened Instigation 1; Ingenuity 3; Punishing Blade 1; and Raging Flurry 1. I have added 4 more aa's and am unsure where I should put them.  He is a human and is stunned a lot. His gear is ornate/ssra type. I mainly am using him for grouping with my bard(which aint easy) and my cleric(which is very easy) for normal HoH and planar exp. I am just not sure what to do. I could use any advice. I plan to play him for experiencing grouping mainly and occasionally on tier 1 planes raids. He isnt gonna be main tank, as the guild has other defensive warriors.  I really do enjoy playing him.  Thanks in advance for any advice.</div></div><hr />

Warriors really shouldn't have to endure that whole stunning thing.  Another suggestion would be tactical mastery.</div></div><hr />

Once you get about the same amount of AA into defense , then start alternateing offence and defense.<br />
<br />
 The standard path in the past was get all defensive aa first , but that just leaves you with aggro problems. If you can aquire some defensive now you will have a nice balance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kranc</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the ideas. If I am in illusion from either chanter spell or potion, will I take on their traits. For example, if I use illusion barbarian, troll, ogre can I avoid frontal stuns and bash without a shield?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, you will not take on the traits from illusion.<br />
<br />
As for AA path, start plugging away at CA 3 and CS 3.  Then move to LR 5 then ID 5.  From there, he oughta be alright for whatever ya want next.  I'd probably say ferocity (kinda odd he didn't pick that up before flurry /shrug) then it's pretty well up to you what you want to do, but Stalwart Endurance and Tactical Mastery are very nice AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree get ca/cs lr/id maxed before anything else since it helps tremendiously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zolanoid</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, there is a big difference between a warrior with ca3, cs3, lr5, id5 and one without, they are pretty basic. It's easy to convince people to go after the hp AAs because you can actually see the difference on your character sheet, while those 4 are probably just as good but they are stealthy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree with going defensive for a stretch. Note that PE not only enhances ND, but also CA/CS, so you're 'wasting' 2/3 of PE if you don't max CA/CS.<br />
<br />
After that, since he's got PB1, I would recommend maxing to PB3 (if you're 2 handing on a regular basis). The only time I ever saw a dramatic increase in my DPS due to AAs was when I went from PB2 to PB3. I'd held steady at about 80 - 85 DPS for the longest time (while working defensive AAs with only PB2 for offensive), and without any other changes, when I plugged in the points for PB3, I immediately shot up to 95 - 100 DPS average (windblade). I was parsing religiously both before and after, and was amazed (and delighted) at the 10%+ DPS boost.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can personally confirm being frontally stunned while in ogre illusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axterix EnObelix</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To clear up some illusion information...<br />
<br />
In Ogre, Troll, or barbarian form, you gain access to slam.  Just gotta set up the hotkey.<br />
<br />
Troll form gives you 1 hp per tick regen.  Iksar does not.<br />
<br />
You still get stunned in Ogre form, even from the front.</div></div><hr />
