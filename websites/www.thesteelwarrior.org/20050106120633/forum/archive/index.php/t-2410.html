<br />
The essentials tho is a set of weapons for taunt and a set of weapons for DPS, doesnt matter if they are 2 handers or 1 handers, just whatever the best you can come up with for each.</div></div><hr />

Great for Corinav and Pere ring. Also huge fun if you pop back to VT for shits and giggles and train 20 quas and zols. Gotta love breaking 20 mezzes at once!<br />
<br />
Worker's Sledgemallet - Saved my ass several times, and it's only a 30 second run to the PoK book now<br />
<br />
Gnoll Hide Lariat - For Rathe Event (not as needed now they gimped it by upping the regen)<br />
<br />
Some decent ratio procless 2hander, preferably with good resists.<br />
<br />
A high AC shield, for those rare times you prepare for /shielding<br />
<br />
<br />
Slow weap, Snare weap, Primal if you aren't atk capped, bandage procer, long distance bow (or ragefire bracer)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uhrlik, more types than specifics.   I've got a limited budget, which has put my weapons pretty far down on the list.  I pretty much only have what I've picked up here and there except for the GSoT which I got at the bargain price of 3kpp.  I'm just trying to figure out what set up I need to keep for OT/DPS really, since I have the GSoT for when I MT.  I've been in alot of situations recently where I've been OT with another warrior who has a GSoT, so I can't equip it without getting ping pong aggro.  But my DPS weps really suck when I'm trying to pull an add off of a caster.  I have a couple of procing 1HS.  I thought might try those cause the MTs GSoT would probably out aggro them.  Also I'm trying to figure out my best DPS with the weps I have.  Finally I just want to know what other warriors feel is essential, like the snare whip. Means I've got to come up with more pp though /sigh.<br />
<br />
P.S. Oh yeah, and I've mentioned this before, but I took over a year and a half off when I had my daughter, so treat me like a newb when it comes to specifics, like primal, what is that?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Primal = any number of weapons that dropped in Sleeper's Tomb. If the Sleeper has been awakened on your server, Prismatic weapons drop in lieu of Primal. Prismatic weapon = Primal weapon with minor statistical differences and new graphics. Primal weapons proc Avatar which = +100 ATK/STR/DEX/AGI.<br />
<br />
You need a key to get into Sleeper's Tomb. Key components drop off of Yelinak (Skyshrine), Sontalak (Western Wastes), Klandicar (also WW), Zlandicar (Dragon Necropolis), and Lendinaria (west Temple of Veeshan). Also I think Vindicator (Kael) drops a key component. Component goes to Jaled Dar's shade in Dragon Necro for a ST key.<br />
<br />
Ya need a raid to get Prismatic weapons unless you're very well equipped.</div></div><hr />
