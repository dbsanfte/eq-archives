Have not done any named though. Just trial one sewer trash. Two of my items came from the first room and the 3rd about 3 rooms in.<br />

Seems like you get a trash mob item every 200 kills or so, is that about in line with yur expperience.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure there was a nerfing of the drops across the board because we had a bunch of stuff rotting early on, but these days we dont see any drops at all. <br />
<br />
I wouldnt want to count on those drops for my warrior these days since they are so crazy rare, I'm just glad I got them when i did.</div></div><hr />

I have only seen one item in all of GoD that dropped off a trash mob in Barundi, was some bst/mnk regen bp.<br />

Otherwise I only go after named.<br />

The only problem I could see is the lack of note about any rarity of the items.  Obviously, if the items dropped like candy more would know about it already.<br />

You can by pass by doing the Smith Rondo event.</div></div><hr />

Hardcore, but non-raiding warrior with a good team of non-raiding friends in the GoD era. <br />
<br />
Interspersed with LDoN gear, ignored some of the rarer/newer drops, and bought a BoC and some buckets of crab from bazaar by selling dupes or unuseables they got along the way. <br />
<br />
Not expecting everyone to get everything on here, but it's just an example of what's available for certain slots with a single group who've never raided.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got the Ferbi shoulders first week GoD went live.  Got earring in Bari, without grouping there much.  Got Vxed once about 3rd time doing, haven't seen since.<br />
<br />
I am MA for a guild that JUST got elemental flaged, most of my gear is from GoD 1 group mobs.  Threw on the 40HP augments, and 10ac augments to make it a tad better.<br />
<br />
For me, Hard LDoN drops + GoD + LDoN augments will make you a very strong warrior.</div></div><hr />

I dont know if i would agree on a mob that quads for 2200 a one group mob but most of that stuff looks easily obtainable (sp?).<br />

It's very frustrating as a warrior because out side of keeping aggro lots of times you have no control over anything but aggro (and that's shakey sometimes)<br />
<br />
So in GoD if your puller is bad....whipe<br />
                if your cleric is bad.....whipe<br />
                if your crowd control is bad..whipe<br />
                if your snarer is bad..whipe.<br />
<br />
And oftentimes ya don't have control over who your group is unless you are the one putting them together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A glance at your magelo, Partha, and I'm thinking you should probably be okay through Barindu, but you'll definitely need /discs for the nameds. It'll be a definite challenge, though. I do reasonably well in Ferubi at 5.7/1500 ish unbuffed + Full Defensive AA, but it's rough going. Of the sewers, the Crematory is the 'medium' LDoN that everyone wishes existed, and the pools and lair are somewhere above BoT but beneath the Eles, while the Purifying Plant is just an asskicker. As a warrior, I'd want 6k/1400+ AC to work with even bare minimum comfort in the Plant. I can't comment on Vxed/Tipt, other than to say that the two times I went to Vxed, I hid behind a guild warrior, and she took a royal beating at a buffed 9k/1600ish AC.<br />
<br />
 Okay, just did a group in GoD yesterday. Group was WAR/SK/DRU/SHM/BRD/ENC, the other five being solid EPish geared toons. The only Magelo I can find of them is the Bard's (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=893852) . The rest of the group is similarly geared/AA'd, I believe.<br />
<br />
(Of course, they went to Purifying Plant.)  :eek: <br />
<br />
 With this group, I was able to tank trash mobs just fine, which surprised me greatly, given what I've heard about GoD. Mobs tended to hit in the 700-950 range max, which compares with Hard LDoN to me. Sadly, we were not able to attempt the named, due to the Druid's untimely death in a bad spot, followed by time constraints with other folks in the group. All in all, though, it was highly educational. The SK was originally tanking, then they had me take over while he was AFK for a few mobs. I'm sure I would not have done nearly as well with a lesser geared group, however.</div></div><hr />
