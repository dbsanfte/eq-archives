<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Make 16 seperate roles right now BB.  Make them all useful and required on a raid.  I challenge you to, you won't even get 10.<br />
 There's an interesting exercise, considering the fact that many class roles are the same and stack, such as DPS, but I'll bite.<br />
<br />
Healing, spot healing, Mez, off-tanking, pulling, MT, MA, RT, buffing, slowing, debuffing, dotting, nuking, melee DPS, port/evac, Bard (they kinda deservre there own don't they), mana batery, summoning...I'm sure there are others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you balance with class specialization you have to specialize every class or else some are screwed in raids.<br />
<br />
1. Healing<br />
2. Spot Healing<br />
3. Mez (every mob now gets adds)<br />
4. MT<br />
5. Off-tanking (every mob now gets adds)<br />
6. Pulling<br />
7. RT (rampage on every mob now)<br />
8. Buffing<br />
9. Slowing, debuffing is a more broad part of slowing it doesn't count.<br />
10. Dotting, Nuking, Melee DPS, those are all forms of damage, same category.<br />
11. Evac (how will you ever use this as a required raid role?)<br />
12. Bard (massive ae's every fight)<br />
13. Mana batery (oh ya, many people will love being specialists whos job it is to give others their mana)<br />
14. Summoning (every encounter from now on gets to banish)<br />
<br />
MA doesn't count, any class can do that.<br />
<br />
This is why specialization doesn't work, you can't make enough roles that are desired.  If you're going to specialize everyone you have to make them all needed or else they offer nothing.  It would also mean you couldnt give those abilities to other classes without infringing on someones role.   See where the problem with massive specialization is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, you point with this statement was?<br />
<br />
Make 16 seperate roles right now BB.  Make them all useful and required on a raid.  I challenge you to, you won't even get 10.<br />
<br />
<br />
The point of the class descriptions is to define which classes excell at those specific roles such as healing, and tanking, and which classes sacrifice some of that role to obtain other abilities/roles. I'm just wondering what your arguement to this is and your proposed resolution. If you have already stated, please say again, I must have missed it in all the class envy rants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm just disagreeing with BB that the way to balance is through specialization vs class blurring.  With blurring you remove required classes while still only allowing each class to do some stuff.  Specialization of classes doesn't work in a game like EQ thats what gives you situations like (you're going to hate this) you see with Clerics and Warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Brael,<br />
It's more than easy enough to come up with 16 roles as people have done. In the case of some classes, they may have primarily one role, but because of versatility shift back and forth between them. While this doesn't apply very well to SK's it's worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
In PoTime, a Paladin might:<br />
MA one or more Phase 1 Trials<br />
<br />
Melee in Phase 2 including use of SU/Holy Forge on the undead wave while spot healing his group.<br />
<br />
DA Pull/RT on a couple Phase 3 bosses<br />
MA adds on a couple others<br />
<br />
MT Inny or CT<br />
MA RZ's or Inny's adds<br />
<br />
Melee/Group Heal/Cure during Quarm<br />
<br />
It's pretty obvious that it's not fair or balanced for a Paladin to state that they are a Tank that happens to have a spellbook and that they should Tank just below a Warrior's capability. They don't have just a role - they are an assemblege of capabilities that at least in PoTime gives them a place in a raid.<br />
<br />
SoE can thwart all of this by negating abilities and making Tanking the end all and be all. But that's bad design, not necessariliy a problem with the Paladin class.<br />
<br />
I hope that I have made at least a little headway in convincing you that with an enemic spellbook containing only level 9 spells and a half-Defensive ability Paladins would not be wanted on raids. It's acceptable basic tanking PLUS spells that are valuable when raiding that gives them a place.<br />
<br />
SK's have many more problems it's true. Hopefully SoE will make needed improvements.<br />
<br />
I believe Brenlo was stating a truth when he stated:<br />
Like it or not Warriors will always tank better than Pallies and SK's.<br />
<br />
In a game where this is a fact, the goal should be to make sure Knights can tank acceptably AND bring extra value to raids by virtue of their spellbooks.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The problems with SKs is the fact that i think they are &quot;barking up the wrong tree&quot; so to speak. Instead of trying to balance themselves with their peers (Paladins), they continue trying to immulate the Warrior's role. If SKs have an issue, they should be wondering why paladins have been given so many useful abilites while Sks have been left behind.</div></div><hr />

Well said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone else remember &quot;No cleric, no Group&quot; ?<br />
Anyone else remember &quot;No slower, no Group&quot; ?<br />
Anyone else remember &quot;No CC, no group&quot; ?<br />
Anyone else remember &quot;No Snarer, no group &quot;?<br />
Anyone else remember &quot;No puller, no group &quot; ?<br />
<br />
Class blurring is the single best thing SoE ever made.<br />
Because if you have specialists means having RESTRICTIONS.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember pre revamp Kod Taz ? <br />
You could pull with pacify the Raid Entrances to farm augments/spells. <br />
Ever farmed Kod Taz  2.0 ? Everythings is Yellow/Red, need a Monk/Bard/SK to pull.<br />
<br />
 Anyone done LDoN hard with lowbies lately ? <br />
Hint : Chanter/Cleric cant pull pacify resist rate is brutal<br />
So its Mnk/SK/Bard only. Non puller ? No group , Or you end up doing Normal.<br />
Ps : Normal have nasty resists rate too on pacify.<br />
<br />
I wonder how many groups die or dont form because &quot;the specialist&quot; leaves.<br />
<br />
What BB wants is EQ for the &quot;Elite&quot; or &quot;EQ for dummies&quot;. <br />
The HOLY QUADRITY  : Puller / Tank / Ench / Cleric<br />
<br />
Making Mnk/Sk/Bard a NECESSITY for a group will mean 2 things :<br />
- You will have many dying groups because there wont be specialists<br />
- You will have to GIMP content, to compensante for the lack of specialists<br />
<br />
I used to farm chavoor for spells without any kind of CC/Puller.<br />
Now i have actually dropped out of Vxed because we had 4 yellow in the room.<br />
<br />
I used to &quot;gimp pull&quot; with Pacification &amp; TL box in Kod Taz the Raid Entrances.<br />
Now ? I'm reduced to killing Roamers, because i cant get a Chanter/Bard/Mnk/SK<br />
<br />
Thats retarded.<br />
<br />
The reason i loved Ikkinz Trials is because .. You didnt need a puller !<br />
Cleric/Ench/Bard/Mnk/SK could pull reasonably well (some faster some slower)<br />
I even had a wizard Snare/Root &amp; Zone pull one day (and it worked fine was a bit slow)<br />
<br />
A zone like Ferubi with 90% of Single pulls (at most 2 mobs) with Pacify is a bit too easy.<br />
A zone like KT where Mnk/Bard/SK is an absolute necessity is retarded.<br />
<br />
I LOVE dongeon crawls, but having to make a list before entering is retarded :<br />
Snarer : Check<br />
Puller : Check<br />
Evac : Check<br />
CC : Check<br />
<br />
If we listened to BB there would be 6 classes in EQ :<br />
Warriors for Tanking<br />
Monks for Pulling<br />
Enchanters for CC<br />
Clerics for Healing<br />
Druids for Heal/Snare/Evac (The only non specialist OMG)<br />
+ 1 DPS.<br />
<br />
Thats it , EQ reduced from 16 to 6 classes thx to &quot;BB specialisation&quot;.<br />
<br />
I want to be able to grab 5 randomly balanced guildmates, and go do stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, the SK class has a number of problems. I think the major one is that Tank/Cleric might be a viable combination, Tank/Necro hasn't been what it should.<br />
<br />
SK's can't cripple a mob sufficiently to make a real difference. A 50/50 Lifetap doesn't do either enough damage or enough healing to matter. HT is OK, but it's one shot and isn't going to do much to a raid mob.<br />
<br />
I think SK's ideally should in fact be a DPS tank. Like a Shaman, their crippling abilities really reduce mob DPS, their debuff should be unique and assist them in making their spears actually hit. Their spears are OK, but kinda horrible for a nuker. They should nuke hard enough that thier ability to take damage or FD should operate like concussion pants for a nuker. They do less melee DPS than a Warriror, it might be reasonable for them to do more.<br />
<br />
SoE's committed to sorting it out. Hopefully they will and changes be coming soon.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">DPS tank is a concept that will never work, because frankly, DPS isn't pertinant to tanking.  The DPS contributed by the tank is astranomically secondary compared to the tanking ability of the tank.  SK's would have to have extremely overpowering and somehow seriously scaling DPS in order for DPS tank to be a viable concept.  <br />
<br />
DPS is a secondary role (one possessed by warriors) to perform when not tanking - it cannot reasonably be a significant factor in balancing from a pure tanking standpoint.  To make SK's a &quot;DPS tank&quot; within the reasonable bounds of the game and without making them overpowered, you'd end up with a class that's a 3rd rate tank and a 9th rate DPS class (Currently 8 DPS classes).  That combines to form a pretty useless combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The problem Slein is that people dont understand the tanking cap theory.<br />
<br />
You need to be able to tank taking X DPS, in order to perform your task.<br />
If you take more, you are a liability to the group and actually not a Tank class.<br />
If you take less, that is a group survivability bonus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets say a SK has a &quot;SUPER AURA&quot; spell , that TRIPLES the groups DPS.<br />
But as a trade off, they take DOUBLE the dmg of a warrior.<br />
<br />
That would make SK a very kickass class ....<br />
Exept ... if they die ... <br />
Because once they go down, so does the &quot;Super Aura&quot; and so does the group.<br />
<br />
A dead tank cant tank, a dead tank cant DPS.<br />
<br />
In &quot;theory&quot; the best DPS tank, should be the wizard (highest DPS class in EQ).<br />
Replacing a warrior with a wizard should be more efficient, because stuff will die faster.<br />
Problem is .... the wizard will be dead LONG before stuff dies.<br />
<br />
Same things applies to SK :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The defensive &quot;nerf&quot; is only on 2 mobs, DD and Jiru.. nothing else is affected at all. Both their dps was lowered significantly aswell as DD hp/adds being nerfed into insignificance, so who gives a shit? Hell even PA/RI/HS were nerfed to but a shadow of their former selves, when they show up. All ikkinz trials are now a total joke and not in any way &quot;gatekeeper&quot; content they once were. They are basically just free lootfarms for people who dont have Time items in certain slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Look, I can understand that the Shadow Knight spell set could use some work.  I even understand that Shadow Knights would like something like a stonestance so they could pull better.  I don't happen to think improved pulling is going to make much of a difference for the class, since most times there is either a monk or someone using pacify of some kind to pull.  But I can certainly understand the desire to have a little better arrow in your quiver, so to speak.  But when the suggestions made could easily be turned into something used for tanking on a regular basis, that's not going to fly, it really isn't.  There is going to have to be a reasonable delay between the uses, and 72 seconds isn't it.  I happen to think 10 minutes is far more reasonable, but I imagine Shadow Knights won't.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is this though, when you compare the Paladin spell book versus the Shadow Knight spell book, the Shadow Knight comes up short.  Well and good, I think most of us would agree that's pretty true.  Now, why shouldn't fixes, if fixes are necessary, be made to the spell book to bring the Shadow Knight up to being more on par with the Paladin?  Paladin spell book &gt; Shadow Knight spell book != Improve Shadow Knight tanking to compete with Warriors.<br />
<br />
Again, we get back to the problem being, not in the tanking of the class, but in the spell book not being all you think it should be.  Without defensive fired up, Warriors haven't been shown ANYWHERE to have a great enough tanking advantage to justify a marked preference for them as a group tank unless you're going up against some of the hardest hitting one group mobs in the game.  Then people might say, well maybe a Warrior would be a good idea.  Otherwise, under most circumstances, for a group people don't care.  And are Knights having significantly more trouble off and add tanking than a Warrior?  Not if the Warrior has to do it more than once in a ten minute period, they're not.<br />
<br />
I understand that Knights in general would like to &quot;own add tanking&quot;.  But if to do that you have to make them mitigate just like a Warrior, or give them abilities that mimic their mitigating just like a Warrior, you basically completely destroy the only thing a Warrior gets in his favor for a group spot unless you make it so that they can't use it ALL the time.<br />
<br />
Your desire for a defined raid role that you master better than a Warrior does not justify destroying the group game for all Warriors.  So, you're going to have to accept some compromises and some disappointments on this, because balance means not always getting everything you want.  And trust me, Warriors live with not having it all every day of the week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Crystalmatrix, guess what.  SK's are &quot;selfish&quot; we get almost no group benefits, we're also not supposed to.  The only things our spells bring to others in groups is Zevs and Atk.  Thats it, those two things only.  Everything else is self only.  Why do Paladin abilities end up being useful?  Because they help others.<br />
<br />
Glatius, the tanking function of what I said is the primary job for it, the benefit to pulling was a secondary thought actually, if I wanted something purely for pulling I would ask for a 1 tick +75% avoidence disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Slein,<br />
I'm not suggesting I'm right that DPS Tank is a good direction or that's where SoE is headed with SK's. But your comments are pretty much off the mark.<br />
<br />
What real raid role other than melee DPS does a Rogue have or a Ranger for that matter (although it's DPS at range)?<br />
<br />
Unlike Emilia's Wizard, an SK can do significant spell DPS and survive getting the mob's attention. When not MTing, an SK has FD, a way to dump that aggro and they can in fact (since they are a tank) handle getting hit.<br />
<br />
Just for argument's sake, look at the possibilities as an add tank. In an add tank group, with spellbook revision, an SK can &quot;snare&quot; the incoming mob providing more time to get it debuffed, &quot;cripple&quot; it with something like:<br />
<br />
Decrease Disease Resist by 55<br />
Decrease AC by 35<br />
Decrease Attack by ?<br />
<br />
While the Shaman is slowing the mob (made easier thanks to the SK debuff), the SK engages relying on his lifetap weapon (150HP unresistable) imbued with a lifetap weapon buff (150HP), Fear II to ocassionally stun and heals. During the fight, a high damage &quot;spear&quot; (1200HP's) and rogue pet actually worth summoning in a raid insures the mob's early demise.<br />
<br />
It ought to be clear that a DPS Tank capable of creating damage from a number of sources, crippling his opponent, etc. can work in a role like add tanking. The challange is to enhance the differences between SK's and other classes making them actually mean something rather than class blurring while not going overboard and having a spillover into experiance group tanking.<br />
<br />
Such a course of action makes SK's fun to play on their merits, not as lesser Warriors with some class flavor.<br />
<br />
So, y'all are mistaken. Hopefully what I've outlined is the course SoE is embarking on. Although it's difficult to turn a ship and put it back on course quickly, I think it will be done.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Felt it was important to add. Such a course as I suggested above makes SK' wanted in raids. They actually bring something no Warrior can provide. It (like simular suggestions I've made for Paladins) makes 2 Tanks groups viable because the skills of Paladins, SK's, and Warriors become complimentary.<br />
<br />
All this clamor for Defensive, mini-Defensive, making Knights into mini-Warirors etc. instead of spellbook revision, especially by Knight class leaders, potentially hurt the game. Anyone can see it's not the best course of action to take if your goal is to make Knights useful in raids, give them a niche, and a real class identity.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You do realize slows are magic based, right?<br />
<br />
And are you honestly going to try to convince us that a rogue pet and a 1200dmg spear would make us better offtanks?  <br />
<br />
I'd say that pretty much speaks for itself - nothing I can say would refute your posts better than you already have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No Slein,<br />
I'm trying to convince you that consistant with your class description &quot;snaring&quot; a mob to provide you time to debuff and a Shaman to slow (so you take less initial contact damage), a unique crippling of a mob (in addition to whatever a Shaman in your group might do) will make it do less damage. That Fear II could do &quot;stun mitigation&quot;. That 50/75 Lifetaps will let you contribute more to your healing, that a pet plus a better spear (which also is resisted less thanks to the debuff) adding to your damage output so that the mob dies more quickly while you take somewhat less DPS, heal a bit better, and take less damage overall.<br />
<br />
And I'm talking about add tanking.<br />
<br />
However if you believe all of the skills an SK possesses, even if improved, do not make them a worthwhile class to play and they are unable to tank adds (we know they are, right now, without any improvement) then nothing I say is likely to convince you that you aren't playing the wrong class.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">BB, SK's right now can have a 150 lifetap, 75 lifetap, and 195 lifetap all going off.  Even all 3 of those combined don't add up to a meaningful level of healing, infact the healing is so little I abandoned all 3 of those procs for other effects (higher aggro weapon, ykesha proc, more mana)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oh, so we're back to the class descriptions again - right, because they so accurately reflect the game today.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
You still havn't addressed my last post though...<br />
<br />
Our DPS is irrelivant to our tanking role, DPS is a secondary role to be performed when not tanking, not part of the balance in tanking power.  You have that secondary role too - if you're not tanking, you can do a pretty decent chunk of DPS to the mob while you wait for your spot in the MT rotation or whatever.  <br />
<br />
You conveniently avoid the high number of unsarable mobs in the game... and don't say that unstunnable mobs balance that; unstunnable mobs are one of the biggest reasons the knight classes are so screwed up right now.  Try actually READING what I've proposed before making assumptions - someone's already linked it to this board.  <br />
<br />
Lifetaps, as has been stated an uncountable number of times, cannot be used to fix the problem - they don't scale.  They are always either going to be overpowered vs some content or underpowered vs other.  <br />
<br />
Fear2 would be a beneficial option, but for reasons I've discussed, it is a poor solution.  It would simply continue the propagation of the ability that is at the root of the problem.  You see, stuns are rediculously powerful against some content, entirely useless against some content, of limited benefit against other content (I.E. reduce DPS, but do not reduce spike dmg), etc. - their power is not nearly consistant enough.  Stuns, and SK compensation for their power, needs to make up less of the tanking power of the knight classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Which I think proves my point. Either Lifetaps need to have their ratio and amount fixed, or an SK spellline is without any value.<br />
<br />
The choice is really fix SK's or convert them into another class. Atrophied spellines are converting SK's into Warriors by default (I think) in your mind, thus you are concerned about &quot;burst mitigation&quot;.<br />
<br />
I hold the opposite view - that SK's are worth preserving, they should have  raid useful spells and make unique contributions giving them niche based on their traditional class abilities. But it's going to take commitment by both SK's and SoE to a path that leads to rennovated and rejuvinated Shadow Knights.<br />
<br />
I'm not suggesting that you personally seek a different end, but I am suggesting that in general I'm not reading all that much from Shadow Knights about fixing SK spells and abilities, but rather they are focusing hard on trying to make a case for &quot;burst mitigation&quot; like it was the Holy Grail despite the fact that it doesn't seem to be needed post adjustments.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As Brael covered pretty damn well, you can't reasonably give EVERY class a &quot;unique contribution&quot; - class blurring is unavoidable if you want to achieve class balance.

<br />
Anything that was needed before content adjustments is needed after them - content only masks or highlights class balance problems.  It does not create or fix class balance problems.  Content problems and class problems are two different, independent issues.  The content changes that were made aren't generally looked upon too favorably by either class anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As Brael covered pretty damn well, you can't reasonably give EVERY class a &quot;unique contribution&quot; - class blurring is unavoidable if you want to achieve class balance.

<br />
Yes, we're well aware of the impact of class blurring, basically because Knights have been systematically moved  closer and closer to being able to do every thing a Warrior can do, while the Warrior STILL can't do all the things Knights can do.<br />
<br />
Anything that was needed before content adjustments is needed after them - content only masks or highlights class balance problems. It does not create or fix class balance problems. Content problems and class problems are two different, independent issues. The content changes that were made aren't generally looked upon too favorably by either class anyway.<br />
<br />
So let me see if I understand what you're intending to say here.  If Frippy Darkpaw was incorrectly tuned in the Qeynos newbie yard to be a level 8 quad hitting bastage and only a level 3 Warrior being chained healed by two Clerics, a Druid, and a Monk using bind wound, could tank Frippy, then that would indicate a class balance problem, and not that Frippy was too high a level for the newbie yard?  <br />
<br />
I'm really dubious that mobs designed to be a challenge to level 70 characters were really appropriately designed not to slaughter the ever loving bejesus out of level 65 characters.  And the only reason Warriors were being successful in GoD is because they have something that allows them to survive against level 70 mobs when they're only level 65.  It's there for a reason.  Because when raid tanking that's what they're typically doing, going up against a mob significantly higher in level than they are.<br />
<br />
As far as the content changes not being looked on too favorably by the two Knight class, well gee I wonder why?  There goes 3/4 of their arguements about being under powered, gimped, unable to group tank, unable to add tank, and having to hobble around on crutches because their legs are broken.<br />
<br />
I hear that Shadow Knights aren't feeling the love from SoE.  And I admit that they have some basis for that feeling.  But they're playing the game and succeeding.  People haven't been able to list a significant list of mobs that they can't group tank or add tank where needed.  So as far as has been shown, they're not &quot;severely&quot; out of balance, despite their claims, and are at most in need of some fine tuning.</div></div><hr />
