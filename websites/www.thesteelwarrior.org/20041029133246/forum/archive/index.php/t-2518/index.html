<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all once again, <br />
       <br />
      This time i want to know how you can deal with mobs like golems in fear who DT every minute or so. I'm nearing the point in my epic where i'm going to have to take on the spiroc lord/golems and i need startegies for there DT's. the onlything i know about DT is it kills ya no matter what /boggle.<br />
<br />
some assistance plz =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kriegartorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what does that gigantic picture have to do with DT mobs?<br />
<br />
as for how u deal with DT mobs, get lots of DPS and a few warriors and kill them down fast...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can DI save you from a DT?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">20 seconds before mob gonna DT, assuming you know how often they DT.<br />
<br />
LINE UP THE SHAMANS!<br />
<br />
spam slow to jack them up to top of list and WHAM. They take the DT.<br />
<br />
That's how I do Golems for their iksar child. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">DA shields you from DT<br />
(at least shielded me from Shei's DT)<br />
busted the dain scroll out, ran in, saw the DT particles, wuwu</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehe I'm mostly kidding.  We had a bard take the first DT, and then just dps it down before it refreshed /whistles<br />
<br />
But that would imply that bards are useful for something.... :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My old guild had a warrior that was very good at backing away from Shei a second before DT hit and letting someone else eat it :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LOL I thought I was the only one that did that stuff hahhaha..<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, I would eat my 10 or so DTs doing Sky clearing, etc...<br />
<br />
but after you have eaten up 2 blue bubs in level 60 back in the day dying and being rezzed and you have like 3 deaths to go till perma 59, it gets kinda old rofl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh yah, as for real advice...<br />
<br />
It really depends on how fast you think your crew can do 32k of damage to something. (32k is safest to think about, Spiroc Lord etc, have less hps)<br />
<br />
If you can do 32k in less than 2 minutes, then it is usually safe to just let your warrior take a DT if they have agro and have someone else start tanking.<br />
<br />
If you think 32k damage is going to take 4 minutes or more, you better be ready to have another class tanking during the DT parts of the fight.<br />
<br />
The final consideration is how much tanking power and healing power you have. If you think there is another tank in the raid that can handle getting hit for 300 or so (think that is Golem hits) I believe he doubles...then it is okay for you to die. Obviously they need a healer in group that can handle that much melee.<br />
<br />
The best 2nd tanks are paladins or SKs or a warrior with AE taunt.<br />
<br />
Once the first tank goes down, make sure your secondary tanks know that they must get agro immediately.<br />
<br />
Usually though, its not like 5 friends walk into fear and decide to start killing Golems. I have been on one or two raids out of 40 or so where you couldnt just Zerg the hell out of the Golems or Spiroc Lord or whatever.<br />
<br />
Their epic pieces at the appropriate levels (55-60ish) are in huge demand, so people tend to bring more than 12 people to those fights hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Best DT is always the first one. Send in a gnome. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">DA will not block the DT from the golems, or any old world DTing mobs. Shei's DT is different, strangely enough.<br />
<br />
Golem DT (and Yael, and PoA mobs, etc):http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=982&amp;source=Live<br />
Shei's DT: http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2859&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
The fact that Shei's can be blocked by DA is probably a bug, so shhhhh! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Apocaly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gnomes are best for DT especially a caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I (often MT) came up with a Shei strategy that has 4-5 tanks who are NOT the MT taking the DT's, so that *cough* &quot;healers can conserve their mana healing a fully buffed tank most of the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shei's kind of a party for us, people LOVE the DT's. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kizef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Nah its really easy. Time the DT and right before it goes off, ask the anoying druid that had been bugging the raid the entire time... &quot;SNARE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SNARE IT&quot;.  Back in the day I killed 3 druids this way in fear clearing gholems.<br />
<br />
Its been almost 2 years and my wife and I still crack up every time we think about Gholems in fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The cleric Death Pact used to work against the DT mobs in PoS, sometimes. It only gives a percent chance of working based on charisma, but after farming Spiroc lords for 6 hours once, and clearing the drake Island 4 days in a row, I can promise I saw it work a few times. Saw a mage get DT'd twice in one fight against a sphinx, course second one killed him.<br />
<br />
But after a few hours of farming Spiroc lord, not to mention the dozen deaths I took trying to pull the last Vanquisher, I got pretty good at estimating when DT was about ready to recycle again, turning off attack, and losing aggro for a second :)  I did feel bad about it but heck I lost over 2 yellow of Lvl 56 in one weekend up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">With any DT mob, send in a pawn to get initial aggro and take the DT (normally lowest level player in raid for us).<br />
<br />
Having a clicky cleric (or two) really helps. One of the most fun fights I ever did was on Yael with 8 people and low dps. I would get DTed, get rezzed back in, loot my weapons and haste only just in time to taunt and get DTed again.<br />
<br />
Taking 4 DT's on one mob can be fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In response to the first reply(about the picture) I just wanted to test something out and this was the first time i've had smething to post about =D<br />
<br />
It IS an ok picture right??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">NO NO NO!!  You must appease the gods correctly!!  The favored death touch sacrifice is an assling ranger!  If none are available, a gnome paladin will do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The pic is fine, just wondering if you tanked that mob with those HPS :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">At the time i was 61, we had a 64 warrior tanking at the time but he went down at 40%. Then it was a 60 war who went in and died at 35% becase the chain got screwed when a healer died. Then i stepped in and i actually tanked it down to 6% before it enraged. By the time i finished zoning after my death the mob was dead so i stood infront of it and took a pic =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">How to deal with DT mobs (esp PoF golems)<br />
<br />
1). get in position.<br />
2). /shout SAY MY NAME, BIATCH!!!<br />
3). aggro the mob.<br />
<br />
Was even better when DTs were zone wide and pof was packed (and the quote was a bit less obscure...). ;)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Not sure if it would work, but could you send a pet to eat the DT?<br />
I was in PoD last night at MC pulling lightcrawlers and the shaman hit his pet attack key instead of slow.  Dogdog ran out and ate the 1k HT for me.  Would it be possible to use an SK pet or similar?<br />
<br />
Assuming the population of gnomes and bleeders has been exhausted of course;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sending a pet in will get the caster DTed, not the pet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">But it has to be specific things. Here's my top 10 on what should eat a DT<br />
<br />
1. Halfling Ranjas<br />
2. Other Ranjas<br />
3. Vah Shir Beastlords<br />
4. Gnome Paladins<br />
5. Gnome Warriors<br />
6. Gnome Shadowknights<br />
7. Halfling Druids<br />
8. Overnuking Wizards<br />
9. Anyone who screams idiodic catchphrases<br />
10. Any bastard lucky enough to own a Bladestorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I've always thought that DT was a pretty cheesy way to make things hard.  You SHOULD be able to get good enough to kill things without any deaths.  DT is what makes PoA suck hard (well, that and the loot).<br />
<br />
So whats the best way to deal with a DTer?  Kill them as fast as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">In my old guild, we had a special job for our twinks who came of age to do the planes: take the DT. We'd drag one or two along and use them to take the DT's from Fear Golems, Spiroc Lord, that giant pegasus in PoSky, etc...<br />
<br />
Usually, the mob was dead before it had a chance to DT again. If it wasn't, then the one who had the aggro (usually the MT) just took it, then had bitching rights till the next DT happened. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Lol, took down all the golems in fear the other night, 1 tear and shit all all night. Makes me glad i'm not uber enough to be MT but special enugh to be the ST. It gives me such a laugh watching the MT crumple down for no apparent  reason. Whats even funnier, me and some guys were sitting in the trials area and getting DT'ed by the tribunal lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>errun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">DA may save you from the DT but it won't avert a DT on the raid correct?<br />
<br />
On the shei raid, if you DA'ed (like via a bard) won't you lose agro and someone else will get the DT, which triggers 2 more mobs.<br />
<br />
Also, will DI save you from DT?<br />
<br />
Specifically interested in Shei related strategy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">No idea if DI will save on a DT, but technically there are 2 different DTs, Cazic Touch, and Touch of Vinitras. All old world DTing mobs use Cazic Touch, Shei uses Touch of Vinitras. DA will not block a Cazic Touch, but will block Touch of Vinitras. I think some guilds use a DAed pally to take the first Shei DT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>errun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The question i have, is will shei try to DT someone that has DA up, I thought you lost agro when DA goes up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">first clear the entire area that your raid is in(if your doing fear) the respawn on those mobs is about 10 min, have a expendable person run up to the base of the hill and sit down, they will get DTed, then you pull it to your spot and unload on it. <br />
<br />
happy to say i have my epic part now :)<br />
just need a red scale green scale and spiroc wingblade and im done</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Another way to look at the DT :<br />
Take the DT yourself and earn thy epic piece.<br />
I personally took 18 death touches in a single day sky raid getting epic spiroc pieces for all the warriors we brought up.<br />
I in fact turned it into a silly game where we had people fighting over getting agro to take the Death touch.<br />
It is part of the game, and I loathe making someone else take the death touch when it is for my own needs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Raiddinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Shei 101<br />
<br />
Shei isnt aggrod, paladin discs and runs in there, shei attempts DT, disk saves him, runs back out with all the adds to the room on the right, CCers get control, raid moves in, paladin #2 beings MTing, disks to cover 2nd DT at appropriate time, MT AE taunts after the 2nd DT, zerg the err shei ~  <br />
<br />
Doing that you should be able to keep the death count low till the end of the fight when shei is pretty much dead anyway hopefully, if people steal aggro and die make sure you have some druids to snare and kite around the adds.<br />
