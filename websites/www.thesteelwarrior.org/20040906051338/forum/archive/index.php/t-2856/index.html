<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Archonfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">New Discipline:<br />
<br />
The Discipline of Spiralling Anger<br />
This Discipline is obtained at level 63.<br />
<br />
The Discipline of Spiralling Anger has a duration of 10 seconds. It has a reuse time of 22 minutes. Each level past 63 reduces this Discipline's reuse time by 1 minute.<br />
<br />
This Discipline requires that the Warrior be dual wielding. If the Warrior is not dual wielding when the Discipline is activated, Spiralling Anger has no effect until the Warrior starts using two weapons.<br />
<br />
While using Spiralling Anger, the Warrior has a chance to process the Enraging Blow combat ability even if his weapons would not normally be allowed to do so. If his weapon(s) already possess the Enraging Blow ability, the weapons will automatically process the ability on their first attack each combat round (IE once for the mainhand weapon if it has Enraging Blow, and once for the offhand weapon, providing both that it has Enraging Blow and that a successful Dual Wield check is made). Although further procs of Enraging blow during a given round of combat are not guaranteed, they still recieve a chance to process independent of this Discipline.<br />
<br />
The base chance for the weapons to proc Enraging Blow would use the same calculations used for any process, but with [Intelligence+75] as the calculating ability, capped at 305 for purposes of this Discipline.  If the weapon(s) the Warrior is wielding already have the Enraging Blow ability, in addition to the automatic proc allowed for the first attack, the player's Dex score for purposes of determining Enraging Blow procs is considered to be [Dexterity+25].<br />
<br />
While using Spiralling Anger, the Warrior may not use Rage of the Stalwart or Telling Blow.<br />
<br />
Spiralling Anger may be used in conjunction with Rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Archonfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">New Discipline:<br />
<br />
The Discipline of 1,000 Blows<br />
This Discipline is obtained at level 65.<br />
<br />
The Discipline of 1,000 Blows has a duration of 15 seconds. It has a reuse time of 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
This Discipline requires that the Warrior be using a 2hand weapon. If the Warrior is not using a 2hand weapon when he activates 1,000 Blows, the Discipline will have no effect until he does so.<br />
<br />
While using 1,000 Blows, the Warrior has a chance to Flurry with his weapon, equal approximately to the chance normally obtained from the total of the AAs Flurry3 and Raging Flurry3. If he has levels in any of the above two AAs, the addition of 1,000 Blows stacks with whatever level of Flurry/Raging Flurry he has currently attained. For example, a Warrior who did not have Flurry or Raging Flurry would be treated as a Warrior with Flurry3 and Raging Flurry3 for the duration of this Discipline. A Warrior with Flurry3 would be treated as a Warrior with Flurry6 and Raging Flurry3 for the duration of this Discipline. A Warrior with Flurry3 and Raging Flurry1 would be treated as a Warrior with Flurry6 and Raging Flurry4 for the duration of this Discipline, and so on.<br />
<br />
If the Warrior uses this Discipline and already has both Flurry3 and Raging Flurry3, then every attack with his weapon is automatically a flurry.<br />
<br />
While using 1,000 Blows, the Warrior may not use Rage of the Stalwart or Telling Blow.<br />
<br />
1,000 Blows may be used in conjunction with Rampage.</div></div><hr />
