<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The weapon itself is fine and i'm sure the 2.0 version will be statistical delight, but after a week plus of using it.. the right click and focus effects are of minimal value other than the recourse effect with a 15% spell resist chance for 1 minute. <br />
<br />
Using this in PoTime yesterday, we clicked it during fights with every god.. and it failed to last more than one round every time. With our tanks sitting in the 15-20% shielding range and past the 13.5k mark, 2500AC.. the effect seems...trivial at best.  The next level effect is a mere 250 dmg mitigation?  This effect is ridiculously sad compared to the other two tank classes 1.5 effects.<br />
<br />
The focus effect has indeed turned out to be underwhelming. I disagreed with the original complaint thread about it, but now I agree. The 2 second faster reuse on incite line is meaningless.  <br />
<br />
The right click should be 5% mitigation for one full minute and the focus turned into endurance regen of 2 or 3/tick.</div></div><hr />

a long study the life is young padawa. to believe more experienced warrior you have to learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually I was trying to be optimistic that they had finally got something right. I was mistaken. After nearly 6 years of EQ you'd think i'd learn :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Any warrior who has played more than 6 months and is past level 55 could have told them that focus and clicky effect sucks.  I seriously think if it had clicky illusion snow bunny with a -300% agro reduction and a +20 endurance regen worn effect, it would be a useful non-agro weapon and the effects would be far better than they are now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nissa XXX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">FFS, its 1.5<br />

its that simple.  for those in Time+ it proly isnt shit.  But to those of us casuals, it rocks.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />

such a simple thing</div></div><hr />

Very true.<br />
<br />
But....... if 2.0 is only 250 more mitigation like most people speculate, 2.0's effects will equally not be shit to Time+ characters as well... and I think that's what a lot of Time+ characters are complaining/worried about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maarv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's a good weapon with nice stats but i agree the clicky suck a lot. It's almost useless and you must have two buff slot free to use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't really think that's a valid argument at this point either.  Yes, the stats, ratio, and risk versus reward are perfect for being 1.5 and quite on track for casuals/non-ubers/non-Time+, but the effects (both the Incite reduction and the right-click) are not at all what I'd considering &quot;rocking additions&quot; to our class, even for casuals. (And take a look at my Magelo if you doubt where I'm coming from, I'm not an uber by any stretch of the imagination).<br />
<br />
The fact is, the Incite reduction is *nearly* useless; it won't make a lick of difference for a 65 Warrior exping in LDoN nor a difference for a 70 Warrior tanking Txevu boss mobs; the reduction is simply too marginal to matter.  (That doesn't even touch on the endurance issues inherant, which I think is a completely different topic).<br />
<br />
The right-click mitigation is at least somewhat useful, and I wouldn't be angry or even completely against leaving it alone, as long as the Incite effect is altered come patch time.  However, that said, it needs to be noted that the effect is actually more of a benefit to the Warrior's group, rather than to himself.  Again, even for a casual, regardless of whether you're raiding or not, the very minor amount of mitigation provided will not make a noticeable difference regardless of whether you're exping with mobs that hit for 400 or raiding against a 5k-quadder.  The effect will not last long enough and/or reduce damage enough to even be worthwhile for the Warrior, however, I would argue that it will produce a benefit to the group, providing them a slight benefit from being attacked when/if you lose agro, another mob pops, adds come, etc.  The most obvious benefit of this right-click effect is for raid mobs with harsh AEs for non-tanking Warriors and their subsequent groups.  The 15% chance to resist a brutal AE is much more useful than the mitigation, and in fact, I would be quite in favor of altering the click to provide only a 15% chance to resist incoming detrimental spells for the Warrior's entire group for a fixed duration (say, 1 minute) and provide no melee damage alteration.  The 2.0 could be upgraded to produce higher chance to resist, longer duration, and/or melee damage mitigation, but the key is a reliable and useful effect in nearly all situations.  The obvious downside, of course, is minimal use for exp groups, but even then, nowadays many named mobs you'll be pulling with your exp groups have some sort of AE, so that could still prove useful.<br />
<br />
However, the point is, while the weapon is certainly great for non-ubers/casuals, and I won't argue that at all, the effects, especially the Incite timer reduction, needs some serious consideration (which it appears it will get per Frod's recent posts).<br />

BUT, the problem is, there are prolly 2000 customers per 1 SoE employee working on EQ and they can come up with many ideas, and yes i like some of them.  Still gotta realize that they put in what they can.<br />
<br />
Cant get everything right, just not gunna happen.  Id chew my right arm off for 1.5 on this character.  Even with my original Monk in raiding guild i 'may' have seen time if i stayed, but thats not my play style.<br />
<br />
So, take what they give ya, and unless its completly useless, call it good.<br />
<br />
I dunno I guess we all have diff views and that makes these kinda 'arguements' fun.  Ive learned a hella lot on this forum :)</div></div><hr />

Unless you are level 30 or lower, this effect isn't good. The effect on epic 2.0 is just as retarded. The only thing it's good for, is to buff your groupmembers, before and while, you fight bossmobs.<br />

Warrior buff plz tkx la~</div></div><hr />
