<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talic Moore</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did this with Planes of Power, but that was a much more dry topic than this has the potential to be, I think.<br />
<br />
The new expansion promises a far more dynamic addition than any of the other expansions have before, since Kunark I think I have not expected an add-on to change the game. But this Lost Dungeons deal just might do it...<br />
<br />
Now, Absor has already said some stuff about quests in the dungeons. But I'm curious, what kind of things are people hoping for as far as content with the instanced dungeons themselves...<br />
<br />
What I mean is, someone previously brought up the idea of &quot;save the princess&quot; or similar such cliche-but-fun quest principles... what do people here hope to see? Expect to see? Not want to see?<br />
<br />
Talk it up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mandragor</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amen, brudda...  I've never liked the whole &quot;kill-it-and-wait-for-it-to-resurrect&quot; aspect of EQ dungeons.  For one thing, how does it get there?  For another, since it got cacked once in that spot, by the same gang that's standing there waiting for it, why would it come back?!?<br />
<br />
Guess I'm just a nitpicker that way. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dungeon crawl .  wooo wooo<br />
<br />
And I hope the mobs drop coin... Just an old school cat and like mobs that drop coin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was actually excited about the thought that if there is actual loot in these dungeons I won't have to hold a camp for hours on end only to find out the pop after I left dropped the item for someone else, or contend with farmers to actually get the camp in the first place!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">07-12-2003, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I always thought one of the coolest things would be if there was a &quot;hedge event&quot; that took up the entire zone.  IE... you zone in, and you're in a room.  You hail a guy, and he tosses your group into the zone... you could have any number of groups going at once, and they would never get in the way.<br />
<br />
Would seriously cut down on competition... OMG &lt;insert name here&gt; JUST POPPED!!! and everyone races for it... I always thought that was ghey and only hurts feelings and makes enemies.  I really think it'd be cool if each group had an independant zone to run around in, free of competition.  Put a time limit on it so some loser couldn't like 4 box and stay in the entire time (of course), but I'd really like to see a chance to cut down on all the racing.</div></div><hr />
