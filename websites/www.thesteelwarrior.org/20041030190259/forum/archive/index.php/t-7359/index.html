My question is What is the best Face piece that you can buy, Since I cant find a Thulian Visage of Horror for sale. Or should I stick with what I have til I get a no drop? <br />
<br />
Second question, since I dont have any AA's yet am I on track as far as HP/AC.<br />
<br />
Third Question, I've read alot about AA's from Library posts. Since I dual wield SoD's would it be in my best interest to go for WA and Ingenuity? Not many warrior use procs for dps because it just doesnt make sense with most weapon combos, but I've heard SoD's can proc for 516 dmg with ingenuity and with WA5 u can get like 4.5 ppm with primary. That seems like a lot of DPS for the weapon combo I use. Am I just misguided? Seems like a long BoT type fight would generate 8-20 procs with both SoD's, that with 2 or so crits would make me a heavy nuker :) If you dont agree I'll go the standard mitigation/hp route and hold off on WA and Ingenuity. I would love to be in a grp and hear someone go ... wtf Who's spamming anarchy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Mask of the dragon slayer is about the best I can come up with other than Thulian Visage.  What are your chances of getting a no drop upgrade?<br />
<br />
2. Not sure actually, I had aa's before Pop so I dunno what 62s should look like.  Definitely level to 65 before aa'ing though.<br />
<br />
3. SoD's are extremely overrated, sell them both and use that 800k to upgrade the rest of your gear and in the process you can easily buy better weapons in the bazaar.  As far as aa's, go standard hps/defensive aa's before wa/ingenuity.  If you bought a BoC (better than your sods and cheaper) then maybe get wa1 or 2 but I personally would still wait until after most of the defensive aa's.  Above all though, get 65 before any aa's.  You are wasting your time otherwise!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) For face piece, you can also look at <br />
<br />
Face Mask of Frozen Mana<br />
AC: 10<br />
STA: +10 WIS: +7 INT: +7 HP: +45 MANA: +45 ENDUR: +45<br />

<br />
Grimling Contraption <br />

At your level, your HPs are actually looking pretty good.  Once you get your AAs and level 65, you'll be seeing mid-8k or 9k hp.  I'd suggest working on levels and whatnot in LDoN, and aug some of the stuff you wont be upgrading in a while (legs, helm, possibly BP).<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the SoDs, its really up to you.  SoD's are fun, but the aggro is just &quot;eh&quot;.  Get anger3 on them, you'll be holding aggro pretty good, but you could get roughly the same aggro from the droga weapons (although the proc damage wont be as good).<br />
<br />
To compare the two:<br />
You'll have more dps with the dual SoDs<br />
You'll have roughly the same aggro with dual SoDs<br />
You'll have better stats with droga weapons<br />
You'll have a lot more cash to spend with droga weapons.<br />
<br />
As for AAs, I'd go to 65 first, then get defensive/hp, THEN worry about your aggo/dps.  If you find yourself losing aggro a lot, it may be time to either get Anger3 or some WA/DPS AAs a little early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KermeyKhazi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Currently have 800 ldon points working on Ang III for Primary<br />
Grimling Contraption looks good the stats are good with 50 hp <br />
I would consider getting a BoC but its fun being possibly only Warrior on Mith Marr dual wielding SoD's even tho its looking like i am dual wielding Mod rods (Graphic very sad)<br />
I have almost no agro issues I can snap aggro very easily been tanking in PoV since 55 without any trouble. Hope to be upgrading Rigid Steelweave boots to Boots of the storm soon. Face was my only concern. I picked up a second ornate bracer mold today so Im pretty set.<br />
I hope to be lvl 65 by Wednesday of next week maybe sooner got a holiday off from work Monday. Will keep you updated thanks for the response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Look for the Amygdalan Chain Mask in the bazaar, 85 hp and decent AC, and only a few classes can use it.  It is pretty much the best mask you are likely to purchase with platinum (given the rarity of the Thulian Visage).</div></div><hr />

I agree with the above poster. Thulian is WAY rare, and usually perma-camped by a pharmzor. <br />
<br />
Mist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Amygdalan Chain Mask is also way rare, and imo overpriced for its stats:<br />
<br />
Amygdalan's Chain Mask <br />
MAGIC ITEM<br />
Slot: FACE<br />
AC: 8<br />
DEX: +5 STA: +5 WIS: +5 AGI: +5 HP: +85<br />
Required level of 51.<br />
WT: 2.0 Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: WAR PAL RNG SHD BRD ROG BER<br />
Race: ALL<br />
Slot 1, Type 7 <br />
<br />
That usually runs in the 70k area on Luclin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you do ToV at all, kill Lendinara the Keeper in WW for Mask of Superiority</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A person who is dual wielding SoDs and wears an elemental BP presumably has no difficulty finding enough cash to buy a 60k mask (it's 40k on Bertox). The question was about the best mask that one can buy, and the answers are 1) Thulian 2) Amygdalan.</div></div><hr />

Play the game the way that makes you happy.  <br />
<br />
But...since you're posting here for advice, I have to give my 2 copper  :p <br />
<br />
Although warriors do some damage, that's not out job.  Our job is to hold agro and survive the beating while everyone else kills the mob.  Anything  you can do to increase your agro will help the group.  Yes, dual SoD's will give you more dps and is fine in PoV, but when you get into higher content you want the wizards/mages/etc. to be able to nuke as fast and hard as possible - which means you need the best agro you can get.  Dropping one SoD and getting a BoC will give you more agro, and I suspect the same is true for the CHoS but I'm not certain on that one.<br />
<br />
But, like I said...it's a game so do whateve makes you happy ;)</div></div><hr />
