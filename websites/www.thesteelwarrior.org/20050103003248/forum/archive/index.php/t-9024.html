<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drizault</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive now spawned him twice in the past three days. Easy camp, have some patience. Kill the entire room, over and over, its like any other uber rare spawn. Ever camp that mob in lower guk for monk epic? .. its kinda like that. :P<br />
<br />
Dont worry, Shoqui will come! dont forget him!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pappee Puddlejumper</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh cool thanks... was reading the epic 2,0 thread and someone camped him for over 15 hours and claimed it might be broken,  I just didn't want to spent that much time if it was broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pappee Puddlejumper</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hour 7 :( nothing yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keizer Soze</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cleared his room over, and over, and over for 15+ hours straight and he never spawned.   That is my 2nd longest single mob camp ever next to the original Jboot camp in Najena where I camped for 44 hours straight, but that's another story.  If Shoqui isn't broken, and SOE wants people to camp him longer than 15 hours to get one minor piece of our epic just so we can progress, that's seriously fubar.  He still hasn't spawned for anyone else on the Innoruuk server, and I refuse to go camp that room again until it's fixed.  The spawn is broken even if it's working as intended, please fix it.</div></div><hr />

:) lol! this is the kind of sentence that has no meaning ... except in EQ ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pappee Puddlejumper</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep finally spawned on me.  I killed her and got the hilt!<br />
<br />
I would have to make a guess of around 18 hours of camping it took.  I got alot of studying done however :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spikela</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually... this is a supplement if we never did epic 1.0 (like I didn't) and therefor they have all right to make us work for 25 hours when the original 1.0 would take 50 or so. Deal with it or go do the epic 1.0, your choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I fought to that room, he wasnt up.  Cleared the room and when it repopped, he spawned in the first spawn spot to the right of the door when looking in from the hall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have completed the non epic catch up part of the quest and can verify it's working properly.</div></div><hr />

Could a BL friend and myself duo it? (refer to my magelo, we can duo some pretty mean shit together when we try)  If not would I need an entire group?<br />

You could probably solo it if you got a single pull. As it stands its really hard for a warrior to even get 2 on inc, and common to get 3. However you and a BL should have no problems, just be aware that its likely you will get 1-2 weak mobs plus Shoqui himself. Kill Shoqui first obviously =)<br />
<br />
I haven't killed him, but I have had him close to death before the zone crashed =P And that was solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">these guys aren't tough, stand in hallway and use incite and you'll get 2-3.<br />
<br />
We had shoqui pop in that exact same spot others described (first spot on right as you go in door)<br />
<br />
so I'm thinking only one mob is his ph.<br />
<br />
any druid/shaman/cleric and you will be able to duo the whole room</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renhold</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 boxed him last night with my druid. Had to succor on the first pull when I aggroed a 4th mob in the hallway trying to reroot one of the extras. I would have just killed it too, but the druid's C5 had dropped and I was worried about mana running low. <br />
<br />
I did manage to kill one of the room spawns before I chickened out. Just had to invis back up and run down to the room again. Never got more than 2 after that. Cleared most of the room and Shoqui spawned just inside the door to the right on the repop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, so looks like we have confirmed ph of bieng only one mob.<br />
<br />
When you think of it that way and the insane 30minute(ish) respawn, no wonder it takes hours!<br />
<br />
/petition please make a additional PH for Shoqui~!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leviathn</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes it it first spawn point on the right, but you might as well clear the room for a few reasons.<br />
1 single when he does spawn <br />
2 youll be bored to death if you dont. <br />
Did with war druid combo. The break in gets 3 or 4 if you get the hall guy. It is 29.5 min spawn. Took me about 6 hours or 12 cycles.<br />
<br />
He was extremly easy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drummal</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well as of a little while ago on the EC'I server i know of about 5 wars on last piece of the ground spawn for epic.. all need the cover... this do be very wierd... anyone else still having this prob? or are we just unique?</div></div><hr />

Just going to confirm again, same spot for me, kept the whole room cleared because I was bored and still trying to hit 70, but Shoqui spawned in the first spot to the right of the door.</div></div><hr />

When we rezed up a warrior got the camp, he was there for 8 hours and no luck.<br />
<br />
2nd day i went in with her again, we killed 1/2 the room so that we could stay at the corner between the door and the wall. On the first cycle of repops it spawned for me and got the Shank. I can confirm that it does spawn to the right of the door when youre facing INTO the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FlexoMuscolo</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help guys ... got him on the first clearing .. Duo'd him easy with a shaman .. had a cleric help pacify pull to break the room .. FYI I cleared the room then moved in .. he popped after some of the respawns in the room .. GL and thanks again for the help with the map.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is because I cleared out hrs and hrs for yas  :mad: <br />
<br />
Lol j/k bro .. gratz.... hopefully I'll get that SoB soon.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittem</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all.  Your posts really helped speed this up for me.<br />
I cleared the PH 4x and on the fifth pop Shoqui popped.  Good thing too cuz i was tired of looking at the floppy breasts of the troll pirate ladies and was ready to call it quits for the night when Shoqui showed up.<br />
I burned through the rest of it and am now onto finding the pages on the ground in DS - got 2 of em so far.</div></div><hr />

The Paladins can pacify pull the room with great ease, and pally heals are more than suffcient.</div></div><hr />
