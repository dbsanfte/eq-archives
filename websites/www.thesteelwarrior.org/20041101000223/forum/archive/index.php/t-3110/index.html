<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Up until now, I have always carried a set of DPS weapons and a set of agro weapons. With the possibility of adding nice agro augments to a DPS weapon, I find myself undecided as to where to spend my adventure points.<br />
<br />
I intened to get a GBoS in the very near future, so that one is a no brainer since I plan to weild that mainhand and add another DD+stun proc to it.<br />
<br />
Off hand I have 2 choices, I can either go with a copper hammer with 2 procs, or a split blade of destruction which is a far superior ratio/stats weapon and only have 1 proc offhand.<br />
<br />
Are the additional stats and ratio DPS worth only having 1 proc in this case?<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking <br />
13/20 STR: +8 DEX: +4 AGI: +4 HP: +65 MANA: +35 SV FIRE: +5 SV MAGIC: +5<br />
Effect: Force Shock<br />
Augment: one of the Ykesha procs<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Split Blade of Destruction <br />
14/19 AC: 20 STR: +15 DEX: +15 HP: +90 SV COLD: +15 <br />
Augment: one of the Ykesha procs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if it was any other weapon besides the CHoS; i'd go all the way with the split blade+ykesha proc. DPS+aggro from two procs might be teh win on the CHoS and bury anything else.<br />
might want to wait to see if anyone else has augmented a CHoS with ykeska proc and what the &quot;real&quot; results are and some parses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">2 stun procs would out aggro the increase in dps from the SBoD IMO. <br />
<br />
Before I spend X amt of plat on the sword, I would probably save my points and aug:<br />
<br />
1150 Points from Guk: <br />
<br />
Curse-Smelted Long Blade: PRIMARY/SECONDARY, 1H Slash, 14/19, AC8 Dex7 Agi7 Hp75 Mana50 SvCold7 SvMagic7 SvPoison7, WT2.0, WAR/RNG/BRD/ROG, type1, type4, type6 <br />
<br />
With:<br />
<br />
510 Points from Guk: <br />
<br />
Type 4: Slimestone Fragment of Shock, Proc: Strike of Ykesha 100 DD + stun<br />
<br />
&amp; <br />
<br />
310 Points from Miragul's:<br />
<br />
Type 6: Freezing Nickel Fragment, Cold DMG: 2 Bane DMG: Undead +1 <br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
1150 Points from Takish if you want to save that much:<br />
<br />
Type 6: Pristine Emerald of Harm +2 dmg; must be 1h weapon with 16+ dly RANGE PRI SEC all/all <br />
<br />
Giving you essentially a: Curse-Smelted Long Blade: PRIMARY/SECONDARY, 1H Slash, 16/19, AC8 Dex7 Agi7 Sta 6 (type 1 aug), Hp75 Mana50 SvCold7 SvMagic7 SvPoison7. Effect: Strike of the Ykesha. Best thing about it: Its free and you can spend your plat on armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That sword from Guk with augments looks promising for those that dont have access to a decent dps, agro weapon. Its on my personal top 5 on a must get list of items from LDoN.<br />
<br />
My only concern is that Ill be giving up 2 procs for 1 and dps once I fill augment slots. Not sure if thats worth the trade off considering the kind of points you will eventually put into the weapon. <br />
<br />
I would stick with the straight up dmg augs not with +2 cold or whatever those have a chance of getting resisted. Also Chunk of Marr has +3 dmg but nothing else listed. Is there a dly req or any other req. ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont necessarily consider this to be free, because your setup is  roughly 55 successful adventures at 90min a pop.  Spending my time on anything = not free.</div></div><hr />
