That said I feel quite gimpy as a dw fury warrior. I can spend rage on talents that miss more and stall out the off hand and then miss my exicute and loose a full rage bars as I have nothing to spend it on anyway.<br />
<br />
I actaully generate enough rage to HS...I just don't see the value of it atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying it's bad to complain, obviously you see an injustice and complaining brings it out in the open to be corrected (and Kalgan has said some things are being changed)...but at times I wonder:  Are you even having fun?<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes...I know full well this is in the rant section.</div></div><hr />

I thought most people agreed a Fury build is far weaker then MS Build in terms of dmg and things to spend your rage on.  If you really are a FURY warrior then respec to MS if you want to UN-GIMP yourself instead of waiting for a miracle fix from the Devs that isn't gonna happen. Also everything you complained about being broken the devs have stated very clearly they intend to fix it. ie. Fury Moves miss rate Execute misses loosing all your rage... Those two right there should fix most of my rage desires.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-04-2005, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I am mostly. Though the thought was posted for humor it came to me as I was looking at  full rage bar while soloing because, frankly I had sundered enough and doing the other moves did not make a lot of sence tatcially.<br />
<br />
Oh I have no doubt they will be fixed...eventually. Nor was it a complaint that my build is weak...just bug ridden. All that rage works better in groups where the instant attacks make a bit more sence (and I am not likely to run out of targets to sunder).</div></div><hr />

Or you could just not DW on higher lvl mobs than you.  Problem solved!</div></div><hr />
