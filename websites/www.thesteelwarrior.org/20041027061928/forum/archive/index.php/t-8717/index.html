<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nodge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello all<br />
Im new to this site as I am new to the world of warriors<br />
I was wondering if there is a list somewhere of all the possible illusions a warrior can be?<br />
 i know of the crown of deciete and the ball of clay out of PoE.<br />
I made an Ogre/Warrior and am not ready to drop 40k on a cobalt bracer<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are shaman-made potions with Illusions for all the player character races. There is also a mask with Illusion: Fire Elemental that drops in Vex Thal.<br />
<br />
If you're just looking for shrinks though, Anizok's Minimizing Device is your best bet. 20 charges of shrink and rechargeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Amulet of Necropotence off CT is clicky skeleton illusion, good for fatties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Amulet of necropotence (PoFear golem, droppable), or tiny bone bracelet (VT, no drop) for skely illu.<br />
<br />
crown of deceit (quest, no drop) for wood elf.<br />
<br />
circlet of disguise (VT, no drop) for human.<br />
<br />
ball of golem clay (poEarth, no drop) for earth elemental.<br />
<br />
Guise of the deceiver (SH Casino, no drop) for dark elf.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the Fire elem face from VT is not usable by warrior.<br />
<br />
For your case, i would suggest crown of deceit, cost less than shrink bracer, but will take longer to do. maybe can get an amulet of necropotence on a poFear raid, but have to be lucky :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nezlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Potion of the ant! Cheap, inexpensive shrinks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is also the Tinkered shrinking thingy that everyone else gets stuck with (Anizok's minimizing device) although I have to think that a Cobalt bracer should be just fine for Warriors.  An AoN is very nice though if you are not worried about the buffslot, the contact points on the skeleton illusion are minimal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Speaking of AoN... are they priced retardedly high on everyones server or just mine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kunis Marfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Speaking of AoN... are they priced retardedly high on everyones server or just mine?<br />
<br />
someone offered me 400k for mine<br />
<br />
i declined of course :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cobalt bracers pay forthemselves very quickly.<br />
<br />
One of the two best things I've ever bought (other being invis BP).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With elemental illusion on (eg from the PoEarth item), can you corner tank OK?<br />
The model looks roughly Wood Elf sized, maybe a little larger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">These days, since DX9 was fixed, I can corner tank without shrink or illusion, as a human.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">AoN's are retardedly overpriced on every server.  I guess it's really &quot;cool&quot; to be in skelly form, or something!  The biggest reason people want them is to use a horse w/o turning new models on.  And bards look REALLY cool when &quot;playing the guitar&quot;.<br />
<br />
And, just a bit off topic, .. those Gold Ticket's are too rare =(</div></div><hr />
