<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">out of idle curiosity, I checked the most recent easily seeable activity by the Community Relations people(forum posts talking with the customers) for several big games.<br />
<br />
Sanya of DAoC: Oct29th<br />
GFrazier for WoW: Oct30th<br />
Moorgard for EQ2: Oct30th<br />
Absor for EQ: Oct 17th<br />
<br />
All the community people have had interaction with their communities within the last couple days. With Absor, there's been nothing for a couple WEEKS?<br />
<br />
That speaks volumes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He wrote me a letter back after I sent off a fairly irate message regarding the Future Plans cut-n-paste. It was fairly long for him and chock full of information as well. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
 What is posted is the simple truth.  We're working on it, and it will take some time. <br />
<br />
 Does that count as community relations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2 sentances? woo :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">probally a draft...</div></div><hr />

Btw, here is a nice, encouraging, and HONEST post by him: http://www.sigilgames.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=2111<br />

Things like this make me think this game, moreso than anything else, WILL kill EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He talks a good game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take that how you wish to interpret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">very good post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">what game does he represent?</div></div><hr />

For those of you who have been around long enough to remember, it wasn't all fun and games during his reign of EQ either.  For those of you who don't, I don't know if you're better off not knowing or what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">'The vision' is dead.</div></div><hr />
