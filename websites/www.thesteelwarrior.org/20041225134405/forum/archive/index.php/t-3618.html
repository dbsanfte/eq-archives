As a half elf, I used to only shrink once, but now I actually shrink twice.  Ogre friend of mine says he can get shrunk 3 times. <br />
<br />
Havent had a chance to see if this effects corner tanking or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not sure what brough on this change or why you wouldn't wanna be the smallest shrink. that's the whole purpose isn't it? hehe<br />
<br />
kinda annoying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a human I always had to take 2 shrinks.<br />
<br />
I haven't played in 2 days though. Maybe I now need 3?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact I &quot;think&quot; I might be a little bigger than I was, if it's any change at all besides the number of shrinks it's pretty minor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play an Ogre, In temple of marr last night, was Able to be Triple shrunk and corner tank on Mith Marr, *we won first kill*<br />
<br />
Not sure about if this will work in VT, but I assume so.<br />
<br />
What I have not tried was Corner Tanking as a Small race.  <br />
I have gotten the Illusion and seen that they can be shrunk now though.</div></div><hr />

I shrunk 3 times on AoW and it didnt help the corner tanking any. He still wound up facing the other way tward every  other Melee</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gonna have to agree here. It's ALWAYS been one shrink for humans, dark elves, half elves, high elves, wood elves, and erudites until this change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mashin</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">kinda on the same subject, when does a shrink potion wear off? in time I.E. certain # of minutes or when you zone, reason why i ask is potions are expensive and i dont want to blow my cash on potions, especially when i can have one of you vets do me the honor of answering this question. i was  shrunk in paludal caverns today, no one else was. (dorfs must hate meleeing):eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shrink is permanent until you zone or log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasco</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also are no longer shrunk when an illusion is either casted, proced or wears off of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">elfdragon</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know the Shaman spell and Cobalt Bracer work until you zone or camp or get desconnected (welcome to EQ).  If the potion has the effect &quot;Shrink&quot; it will work the same as the spell or the Cobalt Bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was corner tanking stuff in VT tonight with only 1 shrink (wood elf).  At one point I did ask for an extra shrink because of this thread, but I didn't notice any difference in size or performance (several opportunities due to death and disconnect, wee)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim AB</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My dorf can now be shrunk to gnome size.<br />
<br />
The bad thing is that it gets more expensive to use potions to reach the smallest size.<br />
The good thing is that you can now stop at dorf size instead of gnome size, which makes it possible to handle some of the many stairs that require jumping instead, if you are in gnome size. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varf</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dwarfs have been shrinkable forever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed I can now shrink LDoN pets with my Cbracer last night...don't recall being able to do that before...helped alot in MiR with the big ol' dead bear pets.</div></div><hr />
