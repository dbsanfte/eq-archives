<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been using a RBB as my haste since...yeish I don't know. Forever, suffice it to say. Now that LDoN is here, I can actually plan to upgrade my gear, and am planing on moving my haste to my head (once I get the 1492 I need from the elfs, bleh)...soo <br />
<br />
THat leaves me with a belt slot that is quite upgradeable...and I might even be able to use cash to buy it..but a lot of it (say more than 20k, and that is probably more than I want to spend...)<br />
<br />
So what would you all suggest?</div></div><hr />

I personally and holding onto my Fierce Heraldic Girdle which is basically the same as Helanic Tundra. Once my buyable/lootable options are limited down I will go for HRG, but till then I will find other spots to spend the 30-45k they cost on Torv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heavy Tooled Weapon Belts are very nice, no idea what they would go for on your server, my guess is more than 20k tho.  There are a few nice belts you could get with a couple of friends, and seeing as your AC is barely above 1200, with your HP being above 4500, I dont think that the 25AC belt from the shei in Akheva would be too bad for ya, in fact, it would make a decent improvement.  Should be nps gettin to him, and makin him dead with a 65 War, cleric, shammy, and bard, just be sure to fight him in a low-spawn area, as it would take approx. 15 mins to kill him with 4 peeps, and only about 250 total DPS at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How about a Belt of Dorf Slaying?  Heavy Rubicite is awfully sweet also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heavy rubicite girdle no doubt, best choice for a warrior, gots the AC and the HP u need m8 :)</div></div><hr />
