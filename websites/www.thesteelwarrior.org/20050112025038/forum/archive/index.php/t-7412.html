<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zondelfinni</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All...    First let me say that I know this has been talked about to death, and for that i am sorry... I think my question is alittle different then most you have seen tho, so let me get right to the point... First off, money isnt a big deal in this decision, I can have all 3 if i want... Second, I am in a family guild that dont raid, but since I 4 box i have options alot of folks dont, so my main &quot;warrior&quot; is sitting pretty nicely at 7.4k 1500 Ac and over 400 AA's... I wont be getting any better weapons then what you see here so theres really no point in telling me anything different from my original question. With WA5 i am thinking of droping my BoC in favor of another SoD to increase my overall DPS. Now I plan to add anger 3 of the new new SoD, so both SoD's will be the same... Now logically i dont think there will be a significant aggroloss at all, but i want your opinion on that. Only thing i see happening is a loss in a few stats. If you are wondering why i am so concerned with my DPS, its cuz its rare i group with anyone that outdamages me other then nuke happy folks, and when i 4 box my warriors DPS helps alot in maintaining aggro and faster kills obviously... Besides that seems everyone and their mother is running around with BoC's lately. So do ya think this will drop my aggro alittle? Increase my aggro alil, or jus increase my DPS... Opinions vary, thanks for your time, I greatlt appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

I would go for the 2 SoD's if I was in your position.</div></div><hr />

If you are convinced SoD's 0 sec. Stun produces sufficient aggro compared with the anger proc from a BoC and that the DPS from DD procs is a major asset to you, have the courage of your convictions.<br />

<br />
  There will be an aggro loss, we'll say of about 600 proc aggro per minute. You should still be able to hold aggro with a SoD though, so it'd probably be better to go with the DPS over the aggro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think it would be interesting to see some parses on dps <br />
<br />
i know in my average xp group setting i get around 100-110 dps with BoC/GBoS (both anger3) and around 130-140 dps with GSoFW+yak.  i have no offensive aas.<br />
<br />
would be interesting to see the parses with dual SoD's with yak augs and max ingenuity.    my bet is the dps is very nice, but i wonder if it will compare to GSoFW+yak ... or maybe do better?? /shrug.<br />
<br />
GSoFW+yak is enough aggro to hold through an unresisted slow np + incite ... and the only people i have lost aggro too so far are high aa casters and people with weapons that 100% outclass mine.  i would wager that if you are 4boxing you might find the aggro just dandy ... the dps very nice ... and the lack of ripostes a nice little perk on the side.  that said, it wont hold aggro nearly as well as what you have already.  i only use it when i tank for low-dps, low-aggro groups, and never on raids when i'm playing any sort of tank roll.  it is my dps partner.<br />
<br />
WA5 + ingenuity maxxed + duel SoDs with yak procs on each ... ... ... ... i bet thats some sick non-melee dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with battleblade, I bet going 2 SoD's with both ykesha procs will work very well for having good agro and decent dps for a warrior. If you have the extra plat, keep the BoC around with anger3. Then swap out 1 sod for boc when you do end up with a bomb ass wizzy that keeps ya busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would parse SoD vs. BoC mainhand to see how much DPS you are really going to gain.  I would be suprised if it's very significant.  If you're really interested in DPS you might consider something like a Greatstaff of the 4 Winds with a Ykesha aug or something.  With a 7400 hp tank I think you could do BoT towers with 2 groups or so.  Greatblade of Storms would be much better than an SoD for DPS as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IF you don't plan of raiding go with the two sod's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would be very surprised if SoD is a significant increase in DPS over a BoC, if at all. If I where you and I was interested in increasing DPS, I would hit the Towers for a GBoS and a GSot4W. Then I would get the Yak proc for all 3 weapons. BoC+GBoS with a couple of Yak procs will certainly do better DPS and agro than a pair of SoDs. The GSot4W with a Yak proc would be a great DPS weapon, you would be hard pressed to get anything better pre-BoW for DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, main hand the SoD should be doing 288 X3 damage from just procs, or 864 damage per minute, or 14.4 DPS if no resisted procs. Off hand should be about half of that. A 12/18 compared to a 15/20 probably isn't enough of a DPS difference to make up for the proc damage, if it's even in favor of the BoC. Definitely parse the DPS difference mainhand before spending money on it, but it'll probably be sufficient aggro and extra DPS.</div></div><hr />

Actually Haass i do have ingenuity maxed, and the 500+ crit blast are quite nice hehe.. Well I did several parse last night and here were my results... SoD main average 137DPS with a high of 145DPS. BoC main 111DPS with a high of 117DPS. So I am thinking if i added a SoD, and a few ykesha augs, i could hopefully push out 160+ ez, hell maybe 170+. Nice when folks call ya Sir proc Alot haha... Every now and then ill turn spell effects on, i swear my warrior should be a caster, cuz his animation hardly ever looks like he is hittin the mob =-p. Thanks for all your kind responses, I really appreciate it...</div></div><hr />

To be honest, I use it when I don't really want aggro and bag my DBoW, click off the Symbol of the Planesmaster buff, and am prepared to switch the DBoW back in if I'm up as MT. It's not the best DPS but weapon swtching is OK.<br />

I also use it in LDoN missions when I'm MTing, but &quot;playing around&quot; and impressing pre-PoTime peeps.<br />

You will probably be happy with the SoDs, but like most Warriors too much aggro is not enough and anger augged DBoW/EoE generates as much hate as I possibly can. If I could generate more hate, I would.<br />

Well pal, you and I are in 2 different worlds.. You are in TIME, and i am in DROGA... Heck i dont even have 1 flag to my name, and prolly wont for a long time till i brake down and decide to leave my friends behind me to join uber guild 01 that has jus opened recruitin cuz tons of folks decided to join WoW or try EQ2... Sure i have enough HP/Ac to prolly join a EP guild, but thats not what i want. Its easy for some to say, go get this over there, or get a pick up group and upgrade to this or that... The best i can have tho, is what i got, and i think i do pretty well for a guy in my situation. Sure MOST my equipment is bought, but i earned them thru hard farming, been playin 4 years, still havent wanted to advance &quot;PoP+&quot; more then what i have... Thanks for your advice and imput, but to my friends and the people i hang around, i am a aggro god with my lil ole SoD/BoC combo... As far as this thread is concerned, i jus basically wanted opinions as to if i do go SoD/SoD with anger 3 on both, if i would notice a slight aggro drop... Now in my opinion, I dont think i will at all... As one person said, heck you could hold aggro with 2 anger auged lammys jus fine... And the 2 SoDs will by far out damage the BoC combo and out aggro it if they are angered... Now if i yak aug them, it will jus be sick DPS/aggro... I wonder how many folks actually respond to questions they think they know the answer to, but has never tried or even know if it can be... Alot are quick to say SoD sucks and so on, but thats what i get for asking for opinions i guess... And you know what they say about opinions, =-p</div></div><hr />

Wasn't putting you down chief. I was pointing out DD DPS isn't overwhelming aggro. That's what many Warrior's go for - overwhelming aggro.<br />
<br />
GL with Droga. CHoS and SotB are good weapons and hold aggro very nice when auged - pretty inexpensive too ;).<br />

Looks like the SoD handily beats a BoC for DPS.  I am one of those that typically is just the MT for my xp group and with a SoD mainhand and CHoS offhand I hold aggro really well, even without Anger or Ykesha augs (waiting till 60+ to grind LDoN points).  <br />
<br />
Also, my group is often just the four of us including clr/war/enc/shm, so my dps is important to our group.  A lot of people say that warrior dps doesn't matter, it is all about aggro.  Well, yes, aggro is definitely the most important factor, but dps for some is an important factor and should be considered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apokolipse</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had an SoD for a week or so, it was nice DPS ( I hated the can opener graphic ).  I ended up swapping it for a BoC.  I'm sure with Anger 3 the SoD would have been nice aggro, especially if you have Ingenuity and WA etc...  But I'm an aggro-aholic.  I get angry myself when I lose aggro, so I got the BoC and I'm saving up for Anger 3.  The BoC has 100 hps ( SoD = 50 hp ), and at my stage I'm still scraping for every HP I can get.  I mostly do xp grinds in the planes, but I'm starting to get into the Raid scene and have joined a new guild.  I'm hoping the BoC with Anger 3 will help me MT raids if given the chance.  I'm sure it's over kill for xp groups, but an early slow will always take the aggro anyways.  So I say if it's worth doing, it's worth over doing.<br />

But if I had Ingenuity 3 and WA, I would like a pair of SoD's just for fun.  I just need more plat !!</div></div><hr />

Unless the 15 dps from procs number is way off, and I don't think it is, then there's no way you're getting 10 more pure melee dps from a 12/18 than you do from a 15/20.  Can't happen.

I parsed for well over 6 hours last night fella... lvl 60 mobs, no defuffing, and i was tanking... I have my own shammy/cleric/chanter so you can assume what buffs i had on me... Each parse lasted about a hour with a tottal of 6 parses... 3 with each in mainhand... and i have allready stated the outcome... If this isnt long enough, then i am sorry... I think its plenty... I crit blast prolly 3 times a fight with SoD in main, and the procs are just about non stop, at least 1 every 4 sec at the least... Now i wont argue the fact that a BoC vs SoD without counting SoD's proc will out damage it, sure BoC hands down... But with SoD's proc, BoC dont come close...</div></div><hr />

Well bro i meant atleast 1 proc every 4 sec worse case from either wep... But I tell ya what hehe.. Since it looks like it hasnt been done befor or whatever, I am gonna keep my BoC for awhile and bag it... I am gonna purchase a SoD and parse it up the wazooo, and since i have points in ldon rotting away i am gonna aug them with the best yak augs and parse it again... Dont forget tho i have max offensice AA's, maybe that effects the disparity somehow...</div></div><hr />

I did a 6+ hour parse on the katta bankers with an SoD to verify it before the modifiers were in Lucy.  With WA5, flurry, etc, I could see you getting 5ppm or so with 2 un-augged SoDs, but no way you're getting 15.  I would bet money on it.</div></div><hr />

There is no way in hell that you are averaging 15 ppm, even with full offensive AA, 2 aug procs, and 1 imbued proc. You can't get that with a DBotW+BF will all the extras. Go parse on the Katta banker for 6 or 8 hours unbuffed and see how the DPS compares.<br />

Parsing exp mobs with a group for 6 hours is not 6 hours of fighting no matter how hard you try. Not only that, but your statements that you are getting 3 crits procs a fight and at least 1 proc every 4 seconds tell me that you are going by what it &quot;feels&quot; like in your chat window spam or you don't know how to parse logs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SoD is the weapon for him.  The aggro difference is minimal.  This isn't DD aggro he's generating, this is Enchanter nuke aggro.  The DPS difference is going to be considerable, especially considering he's not going to be fighting particularly MR mobs.  I was in the same boat he was, and if he does any of the same mobs I XP'd off, he won't be seeing many Anarchy resists.<br />
<br />
I still suggest hitting the Katta banker with your BoC, just to shut the rest of these people up, but yes, you are right, and yes the SoD is going to work out best for you.</div></div><hr />

I am going on what we know to be true about how game works after hundreds of hours of parsing and discussion on these boards.<br />
<br />
You really should go parse on the Katta banker to get a real parse. Anyone can get a parse with a high proc rate with a little luck. But a few nights later you will get a parse with an extremely low proc rate that will bring down the overall average down to what we expect to see. With your set up over the long run you are going to see around 9 ppm. We can do some simple math to see how the procs are going to stack up -<br />
<br />
Scenario 1 - 2 X SoD+Force of Ykesha<br />
Main hand<br />
Anarchy 3ppm = 288x3 = 864<br />
Ykesha 3ppm = 125x3 = 375<br />
Offhand<br />
Anarch 1.5ppm = 288x1.5 = 432<br />

So basically depending on whether you put BoC or GBoS mainhand, you would have to overcome between 13 and 17 DPS in procs. The question is now is 14/18+15/20 going to generate more than 13-17 DPS. Without parsing I would make an educated guess that it will be pretty close,  with the slight advantage to the BoC+GBoS.<br />
<br />
Since DPS will likely be very close, you would have to decide between 100hp 100end 3600 hpm vs. 185hp 85end 4250-4500 hpm. You can do what ever you want, but you came here asking for help. Sounds like you had your mind made up before you even posted.</div></div><hr />

This was a perfectly entertaining debate backed up by really interestingly cooked numbers, which might have even degenerated into Haass and a few others flaming eachother repeatedly, and you had to go and wreck it all with your damned LOGIC and MATH.  :D</div></div><hr />

Bah, bullshit, I wouldn't have flamed anyone.  My next post wouldda been Wandor's post there actually :)<br />

The thing is that everyone knows the BOC is the best.  However, there are times when the best isn't needed, and you don't need that much aggro in an XP group.  Furthermore, if the group is heavily dependant on your DPS, then switching to a weapon with 75% of the aggro (Which is already more than you need), but more DPS, then you're going to be benfitting from it.<br />
<br />
I was in the same position.  I haven't been in combat without Ferine Avatar on since my shaman hit 65.  Oftentimes my groups were War/Shm/Cleric/Bard, so to say my DPS wasn't contributing was an outright lie.  I had a BoC, I sold the damned thing, cuz it wasn't worth 400k for what I was using it for.  I'm really happy with my SoD tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure you will do fine with 2 SoD's but I wouldn't consider it an upgrade to BoC/SoD by any means.  Haass' argument is completely valid though.  If you can sell the BoC for 400k to use on other upgrades it's probably not the most bang for your buck you can get.  If you really want more dps, then get real dps weapons IMO.</div></div><hr />
