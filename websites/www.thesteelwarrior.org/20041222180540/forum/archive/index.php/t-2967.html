<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unkle</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok - LDoN is out - apart from pissing around trying to get a group together that had all the necessary preflags, and then actually going into a dungeon I can say that I am well impressed so far...<br />
<br />
Clicking on a barrel that made my entire party drunk was just hilarious.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we won our adventure and I bought Mirror 1(Combat) which I have augmented onto my Stone Etched Mallet.  <br />
<br />
Question I have is - what the hell does it do? !!!<br />
<br />
Anyone the wiser?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't stack with the mage spell bounce... so I am going to assume it is the same type of spell.<br />
<br />
Bounce gives a chance for a spell to be &quot;bounced&quot; back at the person that cast it.  Mob nukes you for 100 points... it bounces off you and hits them instead....<br />
<br />
Mirror I has the following... (100/5/5)<br />
Bounce (level 44 int caster spell) has (100/40/40)<br />
<br />
I don't know what the numbers mean... one of them is probably the max level spell that it works on?  And one is the chance it works?  Just guesses.<br />
<br />
What I wonder is, since this is essentially a rune type spell... is there any aggro associated with it proccing?<br />
<br />
Would be nice to toss some of Mith Marr's 3500 point procs back in his face, but I don't think that's gonna happen :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the aggro - havent been able to test that yet!  The Rune II proc on the SEM generates enough fun aggro by itself - I think I will need to imbue a non aggro generating weapon and test.</div></div><hr />
