<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We all know how much Kei has changed the game...<br />
How with kei, B09,SD, etc.. casters get virtually unlimited mana and no or little downtime. What I dont understand is this...<br />
<br />
Why are all the hybrids not the same? Why is Bard mana-regen so different?<br />
<br />
It seems to me that a lot of the hybrid imballance has occured because of the HUGE improvements in the casting side of hybrids. It seems to me that making all the mana-regen of all the knights equivalent to Bard mana-regen would slide the scal a little more towards the balanced side.<br />
<br />
For those of you who do not know bards, it is my understanding that the ONLY mana-regen they get is from FT items, MC and medding... They are not even affected by their own mana songs, I may be wrong, but that is what I have been explained. Why is this not the same for the other hybrid classes?<br />
<br />
This may not fixx all of the aggro-lock issues, but its an idea to pursue. <br />
<br />
I still believe in a hard cap on the level of mob that a stun can be cast on should exist. Cease and Desist at level 65 should just NOT exist for aggro purposes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Szlia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To my knowledge, bards do only 2 things with mana: Charm and since PoP, Fading Memories. The cost of the charm song is so minimal that any kind of mana regen would cancel its cost. That's why, to my understanding, bards can't regen mana and can't benefit from twiches or mod rods.<br />
<br />
It's not like bards use charm these days anyway, since they don't have a PoP one with a higher cap...<br />
<br />
So their situation is pretty different from the one of the hybrides that have actual spells they actually cast.<br />
<br />
And bards are not hybrides, they are bard.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't this a hybrid penalty which was removed?  Or am I remembering old patch messages incorrectly?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The majority of Bard songs do not require mana at all.  Szlia describes their mana requirements well.  There is no comparison to be made between Bard mana use and any other class's mana use (hybrid or otherwise).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Help me out Sylas.  Why does Divine Stun make Cease and Desist a bigger problem?<br />
<br />
I agree that the idea of Cease aggroing mobs 10 levels higher than it can affect is an issue.  You can ignore Desist, because no one uses it at higher levels, but it should be treated however Cease gets treated.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand how Divine Stun plays into this.  Divine stun is low aggro, with a small knockback.  It is useful for interrupting spell casts and positioning mobs.  It is not generally used for aggro purposes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">it doesnt affect cease/desist.. it just adds..<br />
<br />
so that at level 65 a palaadin can have seven stuns available at any time with a maximum cost of 90 mana... or 9 stuns available at a max cost of 200 mana... take 3-4k mana pool, focus effects, add in FT,KEI,SD,Bo9, etc.. virtual no loss of mana at all..<br />
<br />
there is one thing about giving paladins tools.. its quite another thing to give them the whole damn Sears hardware store..</div></div><hr />

Well this niggled at me, cuz I couldn't remember what I was thinking of ... I think I found it what I was remembering, an old patch message from long before my time.<br />
<br />
From EQ PATCH MESSAGE, AUGUST 9, 2000 (http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=2090) : Rangers, Paladins, and SKs now have mana equivalent to that of a pure caster with the same stats.  This will give those hybrids a good deal more mana, regardless of their stats.<br />
Thanks for the correction, tho it drove me nuts to have to track that down :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont' think this would work.  It would just make hybrids have mana issues from holding aggro and would kill knights utility, this would just make casters find ways around needing tanks at all since they would be sitting at full mana all of the time.  I think either nerfing mana regen in general or fixing warrior aggro is the way to go.</div></div><hr />
