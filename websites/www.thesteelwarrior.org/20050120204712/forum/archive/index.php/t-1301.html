Anyone here going to rush to the store first thing in the morning to get their copy?<br />
<br />
The books have been getting progressively &quot;darker&quot; as they go along.  It will be interesting to see what happens in this one.<br />
<br />
My prediction?  This will be a #1 NY Times bestseller.<br />
<br />
How's that for going out on a limb?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My WIFE will be rushing to get it I am sure...<br />
<br />
Mebbe I can keep her away long enough so that we can spend our ANNIVERSARY together...<br />
<br />
Prolly not.</div></div><hr />

My wife then convinced me to read the first one.  I thought they were quite excellent, and I am now really looking forward to this latest installment.<br />
<br />
I have a friend that is such a Harry Potter fan that he actually flew to London a few years ago so he could pick up the book several weeks before its US debut.  More power to him I guess ...</div></div><hr />

Gonna be food, trivia, probably lots of screaming kids, and at midnight, the book will go onsale.<br />

They later found the truck empty! Hows that for anticipation? lol<br />
<br />
Personally, I am really looking forward to the latest book. They really are a great read and, as always, the movies are complete shit compared to the books.</div></div><hr />

I will rush to get the next Robert Jordan book, you can be sure of that. Wheel of Time, baby!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you haven't read them, how do you know they aren't equal to, or better than, Robert Jordan's books?<br />
<br />
Or are you simply being anti-Potter because it's &quot;cool&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have read both series with the exclusion of the Newest Harry Potter book and I would say that Jordans book is more serious and heady writing. I guess I view Harry Potter as an enjoyable and fresh take on fantasy writing. I really like both of those series a lot but I tend to take Rowling less seriously than Jordan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO the harry potter books are to fantasy novels what the Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy books are to sci-fi.  Sure Harry Potter is in the same basic genre as Lord of the Rings and The Wheel of Time, but the Harry Potter books have a completely different style and are far more amusing and light hearted than most standard fantasy books.  I enjoy the Wheel of Time books and the Harry Potter books, but for completely different reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got the book on Monday and I'm about halfway through.  Really good so far, but I like the Redwall series alot more.</div></div><hr />

I just slummed around the house.  Oh well, maybe I should read book 4 before book 5 anyways :P  I just gotta get up and go pick it up at the local Barnes and Noble sometime.</div></div><hr />

2nd was not bad<br />
3rd was exactly same as first 2........<br />
She had enough juice only for 1 book. Rest of them are just boring repetion of the same thing over and over. Disapointing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was talking about on SUPER NINTENDO. we got the book at costco. since i have a life i'm letting my sister read it first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason I like the Harry Potter series is that it is easy reading. The storyline is simple and the writing style is aimed at the 13-18 year olds. But that is what makes it enjoyable.<br />
<br />
I have tried to read LoTR trilogy 3 times and just can't get into Tolkins writing style.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for book 6 and 7 to come out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitzwillow</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought it was about like Goblet of Fire, maybe a little better.<br />
<br />
I wonder if it's a commentary on the state of fantasy that the second-best fantasy series out there is written for children...<br />
<br />
(Incidentally, the best is A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin.  As different from Harry Potter as night and day, I'd say.  Robert Jordan = the new Piers Anthony.)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I mean to say that these two are the best out of the current crop.  I'm not such a philistine that I'd try to rank anything written in the last 30 years over Lord of the Rings, it's the original and best.  Further edit:  just because it's &quot;light&quot; doesn't mean that it's not good -- I would rank any given Discworld book over the leaden prose of a Robert Jordan or Terry Goodkind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">*Gasp* A diss to R. Jordan and Terry Brooks in the same sentence?!? Blasphemy!<br />
<br />
Back on topic though, I had pre-ordered book 5 online, got it delivered saturday, but didn't get home until 8:30 that night. First thing i did when i got home, of course, was... Log on my bazaar mule ;)  Then, I did read the book. start time: 9pm. Finish time: 6am. You can say a lot about the reading level of the book if someone can read 880 or whatever pages in 9 hours. <br />
<br />
I'd also say the book was roughly the same quality as gob of fire, but the only reason I liked these two more is their length. Honestly, any fantasy book under 350 or so pages isn't really a &quot;book&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kinda saddening though, the fact that my favorite 5 or 6 authors currently writing have all published a book recently = No new stuff for me for 6 months or so =(<br />
<br />
At least the rest of Stephen King's &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series is coming out soonish.<br />
<br />
PS- Phat L3wtz and plat to anyone who tells me what fantasy author wrote the quote in my sig :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belwolf</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i haven't gotten the 5th book yet but intend to. i've enjoyed the other 4 and am looking forward to reading it. i can't seem to get the next wheel of time book from the library now since it's popular and terry pratchett isn't coming out with another yet, blah.<br />
 can anyone suggest a ood book? i need some humorous books about now otherwise i'll kill everyone around me, don't ya love family:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitzwillow</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pick up &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; if you haven't already, George R. R. Martin.  It's head and shoulders above any other fantasy series currently going.  (EDIT: maybe inappropriate if you're looking for lighthearted... this is serious as a heart attack.)<br />
<br />
For a great high fantasy story with sci-fi undertones, try &quot;Lord Valentine's Castle&quot; by Robert Silverberg.<br />
<br />
For an absolutely beautifully written series (which these days would be one long novel), try &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot;, published separately as &quot;Shadow of the Torturer&quot;, &quot;Claw of the Conciliator&quot;, &quot;Sword of the Lictor&quot;, and &quot;Citadel of the Autarch&quot; by Gene Wolfe.<br />
<br />
And for sheer fun, which sounds like what you're looking for, pick up &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot; by Matt Ruff -- it's an epic fantasy (of sorts) set on the campus of Cornell University.</div></div><hr />
