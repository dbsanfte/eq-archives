<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acfreak</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I may only be level 48, but I got an offer from a friend to have my epic 1.0 done for me (at least the 4 raid mobs, Golems, Queen, Spyroc, and Maestro).  This is too hard to pass up since he is doing the epic for his cleric and chanter alt which both have mobs in the same zones as the warrior epic.  I'm wondering how the agro on the combo is, and whether to use the 2hs or the 2/1hs'ers.  I know the people very well that are helping me but is it worth the 6+ hours of non-stop raiding?</div></div><hr />

Easier to get it done now then play camp-me-overseer with the local ebay crews in tactics.</div></div><hr />

Before you start assuming that my friends are ebaying fools like 1/3 of EQ players..... If you look on eqrankings.com Illuminati Sancti is a well renouned TOP THREE guild on the Xegony server.  Most of the players have been playing since '99 and many are personal friends.  Before you made your comment of stupidity, I agree with you 100% on the fact that they do pale in comparison to what I'm using now, but the Anger proc on the 2hs is pretty sweet and I'd rather sell my windblade for something a little different, perhaps some ornate gauntlets.</div></div><hr />

I doubt he meant your crew, he meant the ebay bought farmers that usually have the Overseer spawn locked down from farming it extensively.<br />
<br />
Overseer is a mob you'll be needing for epic 1.5 if you don't have 1.0 completed, and it's farmed to death by ebay bought crews.  Other people, that will be keeping the spawn dead farming it, so that you and your crew will have a tough time ever finding it up or not camped.</div></div><hr />

deep breath and calm down there tanto!<br />
<br />
He was referring to the fact that jo blows who never did epic 1.0 now all have to kill the overseer in tactics and complete an even longer epic 1.5 quest.  It was a jab at the lazies who never did their epic in the first place not at yourself or your guild ... that and the people that bought accounts on ebay for the explicite purpose of killing mobs like the overseer and tower bosses so that they can make bank in game on ornate bp's.</div></div><hr />

1.  Lightsabers!<br />
<br />
2.  Somewhat nifty title<br />
<br />
3.  Just to say you did it (even if years late)<br />
<br />
4.  A decent jumping off point for Epic 1.5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, you should not have the epic handed to you.  You would not appreciate what that weapon used to mean and the difficulty it took to obtain it.  Plus, unless the warrior epic is different than most, you are not worthy of having the quest mobs deal with you yet.<br />
<br />
You also might want to try a reading comprehension course before you blast someone that posts something to help you even though you asked an assininely stupid question to begin with.<br />

Epic, hell, ask 'em if they'll do your laundry too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acfreak</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the help guys, and sorry for jumping at you lol  :D .  I myself don't have the power to get the epic done since I'm not in a guild and don't wish to until 60 or 65.  Posting on the forums at school isnt a good idea since school puts me in a lame mood.  On a lighter note, the lightsabers idea is awesome, heck i even forgot they had a graphic lol.  Even though I may not be learning something from the experience, I'm still glad to know that there are wonderful players out there (like the steel warrior guys and gals) that are willing to help someone out and that means something to me /tear.  I'll be posting on my epic experience and tell you all how it went in another section of the forum.  I don't know any other warriors other thanb myself and a friend that are attempting the 1.0 right now, so I'm sure new info will surface.  Thanks for the help  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">10-14-2004, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh it happens all the time to me, i know ac IRL...stop the random tangents lol! :p<br />
<br />
but yea, epic 1.0 is worth it for me...i plan to dual weild Strategy and Tactics, and aug both of em with the 100 DD ykesha augs from sro.<br />
<br />
Lightsabers Rock!  :D</div></div><hr />

Besides, they look way neat. :)</div></div><hr />

Holy fuck, don't post when you're on a pms day. As a matter of fact, I had not bothered to look at what server you are on, and yes, our server xegony has tons of ebay crews. Forgive me if I haven't set foot in tactics for like a year to see that the local ebay king is no longer on his overseer throne. Going off of what is posted about all the other servers with overseer being 24/7 ebay'd is what brought about my comment. <br />
<br />
As for what guild anyone is in, I give two shits less. There's trash in every guild on every server, tag doesn't change that.</div></div><hr />
