I've led several hunts now in Sanctus Seru killing the top-floor guards in the towers (mainly A Vigilum Cohortis from the NE &quot;Eye&quot; building), but with probably near 100-150 kills now, we have not seen a single report drop...</div></div><hr />

I duo'd most of mine with a cleric.  There was one house that took well over 200 kills to get.  Just keep trying, reporst aren't bugged or anything, you may just be like me and get unlucky.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah seru reports are just really really rare.  I would say that it took me between 30-40 hours to get all 4 of my reports done.  The good news is that the shoulder and heart house can be 2 boxed pretty easily by a warrior and some sorta healer.  The eye and hand houses are somewhat harder to 2 box because there are see invis mobs in the lower levels of the guildhouse that you have to kill before you can get to the third level.<br />
<br />
After you get your reports get ready for the shard bosses.  They are 1 week respawn and seem to be highly contested.  Luckily I was able to finish off my shards this last week when the servers went down for patch 3 times in 3 days.</div></div><hr />

In my experience the drop rate is somewhere around 1/10 or 1/20.  Judge drop rates by killing Signifieri of the Hand, the only mobs that can't be pickpocketed.<br />
<br />
Yep, that's right, rogues PP the reports in the other 3 buildings.  This means you have to clear spawn generally before you have any chance to get a report.<br />
<br />
I hunted these for myself in the last 2 weeks, I got a report on the second Signifieri I killed.  All others I got in the 1st or second repops.  The Lictor of the Heart seems to drop a little less frequently, because there are a lot more Lictors than the guards in the other buildings, but we still got the report on the 3rd round of kills, took about 2 hours I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well they are definately a lot more rare from my experiences...  I finally got my report from the &quot;Eye&quot; building last night (woot), after about five nights and about 200 A Vigilum Cohortis I'd say.</div></div><hr />

They're not being pick-pocketed.  They are just rare.  Camping reports sucks.</div></div><hr />

You said you camped them for yourself, but try camping them for about 10-12 different guildmates at various times for various amounts of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chingerz</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would those reports be tradable on FV where Gnomos plays?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes they are tradable here, and rogues do PP them.  The guards are under 60 in 3 of the buildings, 5 levels under a 65.</div></div><hr />

A guildie and I are working this quest and we've only picked up reports in one building.  Last night we spent 3 hours w/o seeing any drops at all in 2 buildings.</div></div><hr />

I forget which mob dropped it, but it takes a lot of camping.</div></div><hr />
