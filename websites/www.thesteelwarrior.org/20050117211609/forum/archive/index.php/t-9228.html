Honestly, where do people get all their pp from to buy this stuff? I mean WTF, sorry I dont have 1 mil to spend on decent enough gear...and guilds wont get me in with my current gear so I cant raid for it. Its just ridiculous how hard it is to get lots of pp...any suggestions on how I cna do so? I thought about farming seb.</div></div><hr />

Potactics Glykus, Anival, Overseer/Amorer/Supplier and any other named in there are also duo'able and drop items that sell for about 50k+ or you can do the old thing and just slaughter Sebilis for gems</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, I'm guessing he's not geared to be capable of BoT tower named mobs if he's asking about how to get the pp for uber gear  ;) <br />
<br />
Warriormaster, definitely go to OoW while you can.  Most groups currently count runes and loot drops as seperate, so with a good group you can walk away with both a rune and an upgrade.  Our 69 / 70 discs are the only ones worth getting really, so sell the runes while they're worth something.<br />
<br />
I've spent 5 yrs asking the same question you have, but since OoW release, I've made enough cash to buy Ornate Greaves, Ornate BP, a new ToD, a Fallen Defender's Cloak, a horse for a friend, a Cobalt Bracer, traded some runes to twink a lvl 45 char with WoS drops, and give some runes to friends.  Thats like 500k worth of gear currently on Tunare (though rune values are dropping like mad of course)<br />
<br />
After OoW prices bottom out, I'll be outta luck too, just glad I made what I could while I could.</div></div><hr />

Or else he could bring an ench along and maybe a DPS and still make 100k for himself. And the Potac mobs he just will need a slower</div></div><hr />

However, for plat, I hunt with a group of friends.  If something drops that isn't an upgrade for any of us, it goes on our merchant in the bazaar.  <br />
I also &quot;trio&quot; BoT named with my warrior and cleric and a bard friend.  I have not paid for any ornate for my warrior or druid.  (Paid out the nose for bracers for cleric because I was impatient, doh!)</div></div><hr />
