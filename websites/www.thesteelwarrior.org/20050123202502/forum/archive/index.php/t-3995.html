I decided to give it a try, and it worked wonders for me. I was using GBoS and Copper hammer so replaced the hammer for the shield. Results where much more agro, its seems to work for me, gives noticeable AC boost, improved agro (than my older configuration), much less ripostes or rampages from bosses. Only negative part is ur DPS that suffers much, but since im MTing who cares. What u thing about? is this shield really an agro &quot;weapon&quot; or its just crap?<br />
<br />
note: if someone doesnt know the shield just check my magelo ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
 the MT in my guild gets aggro with BF/BoC and then switches out the BoC for his shield, i find it helps alot, it does kill your DPS, but lets face it, your not there for DPS, your there to get the hell beat outa you</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last night, while grinding with a good dps group in HoH, decided to give it a shot. Held agro very well (was working on bash skill, still only 130) using just an unaugmented CHoS in primary.<br />

Very usable, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's an old analogy, &quot;Using a sledgehammer to kill a fly.&quot; There are trade offs to be had for sure. Lose a hell of a lot of DPS and some agro for sure, just so you can take a FEW less ripostes? sorry but no thanks. You don't get riposted THAT much (lets face it the percentage is small compared to your total number of attacks). Add in the fact that your dual wield check and double attack for your offhand will fire off a bit less than your primary weapon and you're really saving very little in the way of ripostes.<br />
<br />
The trade off from Dual Wield to 2Handers (like BoW and any number of other similar weapons) is different. Less possibility for procs, for added DPS and riposte reduction. In this case the positives outweigh the negative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The curious fact here is that for me is not an agro loss, its an agro gain. The shield with his furious bash IV seems to generate more agro that the copper hammer that was in his place before (i have bash maxed out). Have  tested this triying to steal agro from our best SK and seemed to work. Mob ping pong between us, while if i use copper hammer cant get it out of SK. Any clue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">when I snagged my carapace I was using GBoS and frosty, and putting the shield in offhand was a noticable increase in aggro.  However, as time went on I found that I was having more and more trouble keeping the mob on me.  I would say use it if it's really that much of an increase, but I would warn you that GBoS/carapace ended up being rather lacking in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I got the shield, I went to rivervale and tanked the PoD.<br />
<br />
I pulled it with my enchanter with a tash, I then taunted it off with my warrior and I let him beat on me (did not attack). I then began hitting bash. After 15 bashes (8 of which missed, 7 of which hit and gave me the glowing message) I turned on auto attack on my chanter (weilding 30/35 2 hand bash stick). After like 2nd swing, chanter had agro and no amount of bashing was helping.<br />
<br />
Now, my bash skill sucks, but I landed 7 of them, and they were for normal bash-esque damage. And well, I could not out agro an unhasted caster with a 30/35 stick.<br />
<br />
More recently I tanked some named (with GBoS and Stormrider) on LDoN hard, and my nukers would get summoned. Something that never happens when im tanking trash with dual weild set-up.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story is... I have found the agro on the shield to be horrible. I will still dink around with it if I for whatever reason want the ubah AC, but it should be much, much better than it is.<br />

I use it if I'm Rampage tanking mobs, or if I&quot;m taking a rooted mob.  Otherwise, I lose agro all the time with it.  Its fun to play with, but nothing to really write home about, even with a BoC in primairy.</div></div><hr />

But I really hate war using it in xp grp. <br />
I would really say it's a raid item, very good to RT, ok to MT.<br />
Problem is that you'd probably have  noticeable better aggro with an augmented offhander (anger 3), I might be wrong, but I don't think there's a way to improve aggro of a shield with an augment.</div></div><hr />

The end.<br />

(They can be a nice option for rampage tanking though.)</div></div><hr />

Since I almost always MA, it will go back into the bag for another few months. It's horrible for agro compared to a decent offhander.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have to say I have tried using it on BOT minis when the healer is getting LOM (to save ripostes and the xtra HP/AC), and I would start losing agro to the nukers (which doesn't happen if I have my CHSD in offhand).<br />
<br />
So it's nice for offtanking adds or RT but I never pull it out otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of curiousity, what are the people reporting losses of aggro using as a main hand weapon? BoC/HG/BF? This may have changed at some point, but as furious bash stood quite a long time ago, it also applied the aggro bonus to any non-pure hate effect you cast. The original intent was to amplify the stun aggro from bashing, or so it appeared to me, but it also amplified the aggro from cast stuns and snares. Not having my own FB shield, I can't say anything firmly about it, but I suspect this may be the case.  The simplest way to test this would be to equip a CHoS and an FB shield, and go pound on a katta banker without bashing. If your shield gives the focus message, $$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has it's uses.  I like to use it when my disc wears off.  The extra hp and ac help.  Definitely not an all the time kind of thing, but situationally valuable.  Oh, and as an Ogre, I have an advantage over little races in that my Bash has been maxed for a while, thus far fewer misses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BigAlFoxTrot</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a BOC in main hand and Furious bash in off hand.<br />
<br />
Eventually I started losing agro to the nukers.  <br />
<br />
I don't think the shield adds to the hate proc of what you have in main hand (it might but then the lost DPS and proc in off hand work better for me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It will not add to pure hate, AKA Enraging Blow or Terror of Thule, but it may blanket add to stun hate, this is what I would like to see tested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There have been threads about this in the past.  Furious bash only enhances spells that you have mem'd in your spell book basically.  Since warriors can mem no spells, furious bash only helps in augmenting bash aggro, which is nearly negligible these days.<br />
<br />
While i think it's definately possible for someone to MT with an anger aug'd BF and the shield, the shield is still doing nothing for your aggro.  You might as well be using hand-to-hand with your offhand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normally, I use it to tank named when my dis off. I seldom lost aggro since I have been tanking for 3 mins long. This 400hate is nice enough to keep my aggro goes on.<br />
<br />
In group, everyone prefer to use Dual Wield/2H with no doubt, but sometimes I would switch this shield to bash once (for either lost aggro/add hate) and change back to offhand weapon for dps. <br />
<br />
Yea! I like this shield :cool:</div></div><hr />

Where did you hear you get 400 hate from it? 400 hate per bash would be insane.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm the n00best of n00bs and even I know that shields, FB or no, are completely and depressingly awful for a warrior. More hp, more ac, yeah yeah yeah. Just because you happen to hold aggro via your mainhand weapon while you have this PoS equipped doesn't mean it's helping. I assure you it's only hurting. I can believe that it's worth equipping for Rampage tanking, but forgive me if that doesn't make me giddy with excitement.<br />
<br />
And yes, I own a Stormrider Carapace, for about 3 weeks now. It's laughably bad. I considered using it to make my magelo look better but my conscience got the better of me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tried it in Xp groups with some guildies who know how to play.<br />
I almost never lose aggro when playing with them with my 2 aggro weaps ( BoC + CHSP ) .<br />
With BoC + Shield , i can't hold aggro at all.<br />
<br />
Tried in raid MTing : using 2 weaps while Defensive going , BoC + Shield after. I keep aggro only if i am lucly on procs , while i almost never lose it when i keep using my 2 weaps.<br />
<br />
I have it since 2 months and now i only use it when RTing.<br />
Stats on it should help when RT at least but except the message it gives, i have never seen any effect of the FB thing on this shield.<br />
<br />
Edit : a lil bit of Spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamov</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a nice little observation about how this shield might work.<br />
<br />
If you engage a mob with a bash with FB, shield does NOT glow.<br />
However, any subsequent bash would makes the shield glow.<br />
<br />
A natural guess is that any bash with the carapace would increase the accumulated bash aggro by 1.4 times. Since you have 0 bash aggro when you engage a mob, shield does not glow.<br />
<br />
This implies the shield might be &quot;ok&quot; aggro in the long run...when you fight stuffs that have 1000k HP or what so you would have a chance to accumulate some nice bash aggro in the first place.<br />
<br />
As for exp gorup, this shield is pretty useless, dont even bother switch it out for ghetto bash.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Increase Spell/Bash Hate by 40%<br />
<br />
That's the effect. If you aren't procing (one poster said they weren't attacking just bashing) then the only thing that FB can work with is hate generated from bash which is low. <br />
<br />
I used this with GBoS and held great aggro, I remember the first night I pulled it out the mage in group crit'd for 8k total and the mob didn't even blink at him. <br />
<br />
With the right main hand weapon (proc) FB does wonders at holding aggro. <br />
<br />
Don't bother with it in exp groups tho because you will only kill your dps.</div></div><hr />
