<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...Difference in DPS while you proc? I notice recently that my DPS spikes alot now that I have A2'd my SotBS. With FA and Ferro I still hit hard, but I notice when I scroll out so I fight in 3rd person it seems I am stuck in a repetitive &quot;Proc Shuffle&quot; dance. Proc, proc, proc, proc procprocproc..... I am noticing my DPS is staggeringly low during these times. Anyone else notice the same or similar thing? I am wondering if in 8 missions when I A3 my BoC if that will hinder my DPS even further, adding the 4th proc to my setup?<br />
<br />
I know my job is aggro and I handle it fairly well for being an alt, but I just get the feeling I'm short-changing my group's DPS. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The animations you see when you proc have nothing to do with actual swings, a proc will not lower your dps in any way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mourneblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This was actually a question I had recently until I parsed my DPS with proc weapons vs. non-proc weapons.<br />
<br />
DPS was slightly higher with the proc weapons so I answered my own question.  Yes, procs make it &quot;appear&quot; that you are swinging less, but if you look at the actual damage output there's no change in swing rate.  Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depending on the type of procs, your dex, any combat effects / weapon affinity, proc damage can be a huge boost.<br />

I did some before/after parses of damage output of adding augmented DD procs.  I added 150dd poison to primary and 125dd fire to offhand.  305 dex unbuffed, WA5, 0 combat effects:<br />
<br />
73,969 second duration<br />
<br />
500,434 damage from rujarkian venom<br />
208,951 damage from flaming blade<br />
----------<br />
709,385 total augment DD damage, 9.59 dps<br />
<br />
Add in natural procs:<br />
542,100 damage from assassin's blood<br />
388,570 damage from call of time<br />
----------<br />
930,670 total natural proc damage, 12.58 dps<br />
<br />
Add in all 4 procs:<br />
1,640,055 total damage, 22.17 dps or 10.17% of my total damage output (I'm a rogue).<br />
<br />
Edit: forgot to add these numbers are overnight parses, unbuffed, so the proc dps % would decrease with attack and haste buffs.  Witn normal buffs, proc damage of total dps drops to 7%.</div></div><hr />
