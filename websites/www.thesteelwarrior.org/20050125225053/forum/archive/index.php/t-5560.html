<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Griglon</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just some opinions, should I upgrade the helm slot first or the BP?  Some friends say the helm due to my BP being &quot;somewhat&quot; decent as it is and that I can augment the helm with 36% haste.<br />
<br />
Opinions and suggestions please before I spend 1492 points.</div></div><hr />

LDoN BP should be second last. (Vindicator/Statue)<br />
<br />
Go for some other parts first imo. (Like a 110hp bracer .....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a Champ's BP so Royal Attendant BP was my first armor purchase for LDoN. People will argue the value of AC vs HP, but even if 1 ac was only worth 3 hp then I made a 22ac 10hp upgrade ( 72 hp if 1ac = 3hp ). I consider it a worthwhile upgrade.<br />
<br />
For helm I am holding out for RZ helm and will slap a 40hp aug on it, but I did think hard about Royal Attendant helm before sticking to my previous decision. There are bazaar purchaseable bracers with 100hp if you have the cash, or you can try for bracelet of speed or other dropped bracers. <br />
<br />
I think my next RA item will be the arms, as I don't see myself snagging the ones from Ssra or VT anytime soon, and they are still an upgrade from FH/Ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go with what will be the biggest upgrade AC and hps wise for you. That goes for any slot for Tak armor, not just BP/ helm.<br />
<br />
Also consider what you will likely get an upgrade soon on raid wise. You don't want to spend 1492 points on a Tak BP and get an ornate BP the following week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poosha</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played around with my &quot;Dream Gear&quot; profile on Magelo, and put in all Velious / VT gear that would work for me (our guild is gearing up to move into VT soon).  The only pieces of RA armor that would work out better are the bracers and boots for me.  Not everyone will have the same experience, though, depending on what mobs they're hitting and such.  Like others have said, look at what you're currently wearing, and also what upgrades you'll likely get from raids soon... that should help narrow down the best slots to upgrade.  :)</div></div><hr />

I never paid much attention to it. If so, you can get the BP and aug that with haste just as easily as the helm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haste doesn't fit in BP, only like helm, belt, and 2 other slots that I can't remember atm.<br />
<br />
Personally I wouldn't give up the chance at an AoW helm to change from 31% to 36% haste, especially with the decent stats on your haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This of course, assusmes that you are in a guild that at some point, in the near future, you will be killing the AoW.<br />
<br />
I have the Tak hat, and am mostly happy (it is 3 less AC than the BP, but with 36% haste in it, I got to pull out my RBB and get a real belt) but for the fact as a barbarian the darned thing is visible!<br />
<br />
I think its the only race it is visible for. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
As an agnostic warrior I have found those the hardest to upgrade in my travels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's really up to you and your playing style.  I have about 150k in the bank and usually make about 10 to 15k a month.  I'm not raiding that much yet and my guild is nowhere near elemental level (great people and very skilled...just small atm.)  <br />
<br />
For me the criteria I used was what would give me the best combination of ac and hp over my current gear and what I could buy with 60k or less (I don't want to blow all my plat on 1 item;)? )  I also considered things I could reasonably expect to get as drops in ldon or tier 3.  For me the choice was the BP and the second choice is probably the helm (although I'm getting anger 3 next and my decision may change based on GoD drops.)<br />
<br />
Also, consider how fast you build up points.  Again, for me it's 500 to 800 a month.<br />
<br />
Also, my plan is to fully augment the BP with what I want before getting another piece.  The reason I'm doing that is to reduce the chance something drops on a raid I want that is better than an ldon piece I have.  Also, I like to get the best I can in each slot before addressing the next slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should go with ornate in <br />
<br />
BP<br />
Legs<br />
Hands<br />
<br />
Because all 3 have super usefull buffs (300HP shield, spell haste and solid STA buff).<br />
<br />
The others slots is best for RA armor. But see my megalo for items that are basically &quot;best of bazzar (that you are likly to see, i.e. no farplate)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Because all 3 have super usefull buffs &quot;<br />
<br />
That get negated rather quickly in various group settings.<br />
<br />
(Focus overwrites arcane shielding)<br />
<br />
(Boar overwrites health)<br />
<br />
(Vallon's Quickening, and many many other haste spells, make the haste gloves pointless).<br />
<br />
They're not bad clickies. I just feel the &quot;whole&quot; story about those clickies needs to be presented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well true enough if a shaman / chanters are around. And its not like they are lousy otherwise, RA is really good but so is ornate stat wise. And ornate is buyable, I find it simpler to get Plat then anything but.. <br />
<br />
Id still go ornate in those 3 slots (even if you are buffed 80percent plus of the time thats still 20percent of the time when they come in handy) and spend the LDoN points on the others slots. Best to get Anger III first with yur LDoN points in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Well there are no absolutes I guess, RA or Ornate you not going to go wrong...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I won a Ornate BP, I like it.  And I am sans buffs enough that the clicky matters.  I got Miragul legs.  Since I am not always buffed to max, the extra STA works better for me that the STA-less Tak legs.   I am looking forward to the Tak helm, arms, and maybe a bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">(legs)<br />
If you don't mind spending 2x the points for probably 15hp and 4 ac + some minor stats, then take the tak legs. For half the points (HALF) you can get a pair of 44ac 70hp greaves from everfrost. So if you're like me, and dislike LDoN (or don't have time) then I strongly reccomend Everfrost over tak greaves.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats only the greaves though, I'm not sure on other LDoN stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Griglon</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the EF legs like Ahz for the same reason.  I toyed with my magelo some more and the bracer and helm are the two that give me the most AC and HP upgrades so it will most likely be one of those.</div></div><hr />
