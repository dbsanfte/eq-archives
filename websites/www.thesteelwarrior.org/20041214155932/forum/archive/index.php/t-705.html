<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuur</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, am going to start hammering out AA's and was wondering if my current path looks good to you folks.  I am usually MA or SA (dual box usually so can depend on what class I have to play as to what I am) but usually MA.  You can click on my gear link to see what AA's I have currently, but here they are:<br />
Run 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
Metabolism 3 (hate eating my good stat food up quickly)<br />
Sta 5<br />
ND 3<br />
CA 1<br />
CS 1<br />
FB 1 (before they nerfed it)<br />
AET<br />
PE<br />
<br />
Ok, now here's my plan of action (in order):<br />
PD 1-3<br />
PP 1-5<br />
CF 1<br />
PB 1<br />
TM 1-3<br />
Ferocity 1-3<br />
CA 2<br />
CS 2<br />
CF 2<br />
PB 2<br />
CA 3<br />
CS 3<br />
CF 3<br />
PB 3<br />
LR 1-5<br />
ID 1-5<br />
Flurry 1-3<br />
FoA 1-3<br />
RF 1-3<br />
Ambidexterity<br />
<br />
I know it's a long ways off, just want to see what everyone thinks as I push forward.  BTW I am usually fully buffed with the best buffs in the game when I play (Ferine Avatar as well).  I'm trying to keep aggro as best I can while doing a good a job at tanking as possible.  My thought is that I have to get and keep aggro before I worry about defensive, but what do you think?  Thanks ahead of time ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, this is just my opinion but where is your weakness?  Your lv 65 with a windbalde.  Do you have an ok time keeping agro?  If so I think ca or cs would be the best for you.  I would take planar power lastish.  If your having trouble keeping aggro then take more offensive aa.  From your gear, it looks like your guild is ready to start ssra and since your 5 levels higher than previous tanks who did those zones.. I think you should do fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuur</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should have noted that we're a smaller guild geared more towards strategy/tactics then all out zerging.  We average 3 groups on a raid currently, average level of 62 or so I'd say.  Currently we do HoT and the easier named (Vindi, DS, etc.) as we're working on improving gear for places like Ssra and such.  I don't have too bad of a time holding aggro, but I am planning on grabbing the Greatstaff of Thunder (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17984) shortly once I can get it to drop for me in BoT, so that should keep aggro on me np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greatstaff of Thunder is amazing!<br />

After getting the advice of the folks here, I decided to scrap my wavecrasher/frosty combo and buy this thing.  Yeah I over paid for it, but there was only 1 for sale all week and the guy was afk.  Anyways, it holds aggro mucho better over the other weapons and now I only use that and the Windblade.  I'll prob switch back to duel procing weaps later when I start raiding again.<br />
<br />
Few groups after I got it, I'm holding aggro significantly better than before.  Grouped with ranger, rogues (with 16 dam pierecers), monks and such without much problem [and without them sneaking/feigning].  Started with 10 2hb skill and now Im close to 200 with just 2 nights of casual grouping.  <br />
<br />
Usually when this thing procs, I have no trouble with aggro.  Can usually switch to windblade during the fight to bring up dps.  My question is this . . .<br />
<br />
'Are there any tricks to get innital aggro?'  I'm firing arrows, clicking disarm, saving taunt and such at first but when the slow lands usually the shammy/ench gets summoned.  Anyone got any ideas on how to get that initial aggro quickly?</div></div><hr />

-Get Ferocity and Punishing Blade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would take CA very early on, it makes a big difference.  I did not finish up my CS until about aa 100, but I went after CA3 right off the bat.  Avoiding procs is the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuur</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys, gonna move CA3 &amp; LR5 up in my path a bit. :)  One note on getting aggro quickly is time your taunt to land right after their slow/tash, if done properly you can turn the mob right back around on you, assuming the caster did not cast 2 or 3 aggro spells in a row and is low health of course ;)</div></div><hr />
